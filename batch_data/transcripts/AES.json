Leung - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Andrew Levi Operator : Good morning, and thank you for standing by. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. And I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Ahmed Pasha, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Pasha, you may begin. Ahmed Pasha : Thank you, Angela. Good morning, and welcome to our First Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. Our earnings release presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom O'Flynn; our Chief Financial Officer, and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will now turn the call over to Andres. Andres? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Today I will discuss : our first quarter results; dry and hydrological conditions in Latin America and the steps we are taking in response; our 2014 guidance and longer-term expectations; and an update on how our strategy is continuing to yield opportunities to create shareholder value. Then Tom will provide a detailed discussion of our results and our capital allocation plan. Turning first to our results on Slide 4. This year, hydrology, in much of Latin America, is proving to be drier than expected. However, we are pulling all levers in our control to meet our commitments and we are reaffirming our guidance on all metrics, although we now expect to be in the lower end of our adjusted EPS range. In the first quarter, we earned $0.24 of adjusted EPS, down $0.03 from the first quarter of 2013. And our proportional free cash flow was $129 million, down $232 million. The former traces largely to outages and gas curtailment at DPL and the latter to temporary working capital needs due to the severe weather in Indiana, Ohio and Brazil. Turning to Slide 5. Before Tom discusses our first quarter results and capital allocation plan in more detail, let me address some recent developments at some of our businesses. So far this year, hydrology in Chile, Colombia, Argentina has been in line with our expectations. However, we are seeing conditions in Panama and Brazil that are even drier than last year's, which could have an adverse impact of between $0.07 and $0.10 on earnings per share this year, relative to our original assumptions. The actual impact will ultimately depend upon the strength of a potential El Ni\u00f1o developing in the Pacific, which could improve hydrology conditions at some of our facilities in Latin America. Even if this is the second consecutive year of poor hydrology in Latin America, we are aggressively taking steps to mitigate this year's impact and develop real options to decrease future volatility. Specifically in Panama, where we have seen the greatest exposure, we converted 175 megawatts PPA from financial to physical, capping our exposure to actual production levels. We successfully executed an agreement with the government of Panama where the government agreed to reduce the financial impact of spot electricity purchases by up to $100 million over the next 3 years for AES Panama. And in order to diversify the fuel mix of our generation fleet in Panama, while supporting the country, we will bring in a 72-megawatt oil fired power barge. We're entering into a 5-year PPA with the government-owned distribution company and expect to earn attractive returns beginning in 2015. We're also evaluating similar real option opportunities in other parts of Latin America. In Brazil, our revised outlook indicates that forecasted hydrological conditions will have a negative impact on our earnings this year. However, it also contributed to a 60% increase in power prices for 2016, nearing the level of Tiet\u00ea's current contract with Eletropaulo, which expires late 2015. Tiet\u00ea has roughly 2/3 of its capacity contracted for 2016 at BRL 119 per megawatt hour. 1/3 of its firm capacity has not been contracted and this grows to 2/3 in 2018. Tiet\u00ea may be able to capture additional upside if power prices remain at 2016 levels through 2018. These same market conditions are also favorable for Uruguaiana, our 640-megawatt gas power plant in which we are able to secure gas supply for 60 days. We're leveraging our presence in Argentina, Brazil and Chile to find solutions and take advantage of underutilized infrastructure in those countries to quickly address current energy shortfalls while we work towards long-term solutions. Before turning to our 2014 guidance, let me touch on the status of DPL's generation assets. We continue to work on parallel paths, exploring options to transfer to an affiliate or to sell to a third-party. The sale process is well underway. We're in the second round of discussions with potential buyers and the sale could be announced later this year. We're also monitoring alternative proposals for commercial strategies in Ohio, which may have an impact on the long-term value of these businesses. Keep in mind we will only sell if the price offer is reasonable and represents the best outcome for investors. Now I'd like to review our guidance on Slide 6. The impact of hydrology I mentioned earlier is the most significant change since our last conference call. And we now see an estimated impact for the year of $0.07 to $0.10 per year. However, in a portfolio as large and diverse as AES, we're able to mitigate this impact through additional cost management efforts, targeted capital allocation and strategic initiatives. Therefore, we're reaffirming our adjusted EPS guidance of $1.30 to $1.38, but we now expect to be in the low end of the range. Our earnings and cash expectations beyond 2014 remain unchanged. Although we reported only $129 million of proportional free cash flow in the first quarter, we're reaffirming our guidance range of $1 billion to $1.3 billion. We expect to achieve our range as we recoup our working capital in Brazil and the U.S., as well as implement other liquidity-enhancing initiatives that Tom will discuss in a moment. Based on our current stock price, the level of free cash flow represents a 10% to 13% free cash flow yield. Now turning to Slide 7. We remain focused on executing on our strategy, which aims to maximize total shareholder returns. As a reminder, our strategy is based on the following 4 pillars : performance excellence; reducing our geographic complexity; expanding access to capital; and leveraging our platform. Beginning with Performance Excellence. We're on track to achieve our 2015 goal of reducing global G&A by $200 million, making progress towards reducing our proportional O&M by $185 million by 2018. Since our last call, we moved forward with several opportunities that are examples of the other 2 pillars : expanding access to capital and leveraging our platforms. The 4 examples I will describe in a moment all came together in the last few months, demonstrating our commitment to execute on value-accretive transactions that require shorter lead times. In aggregate, we believe that these new projects will result in $200 million to $300 million of NPV creation and adjusted EPS contributions of between $0.10 and $0.12 per year, once they are fully operational. These particular projects have several characteristics in common. They require relatively small equity investments from AES and they will earn strong returns. Turning to the first example on Slide 8. In Chile, we recently had the opportunity to both expand our access to capital through a creative partnership arrangement, as well as leverage our existing presence in the market. By exercising our right of first offer, we bought the remaining 50% stake in AES Gener's Guacolda generation business for $728 million and then sold the 50% stake less 1 share at the same price to another investor. By doing so, we increased our operating role in the project, allowing us to extract synergies from operations and create $50 million to $100 million in present value for our shareholders. Another example is the integration of fogging technology at our Parana CCGT plant in Argentina. We increased the output by as much as 45 megawatts with an investment of less than $1 million. This project is also an example of our adjacencies and enhancement programs, which includes energy storage, fogging and water desalinization. As I mentioned on our last call, in aggregate, we expect the enhancements and adjacencies program to add $40 million of pretax contribution for PTC in 2015. The power barge in Panama I discussed earlier is another example and will produce approximately $20 million in PTC beginning next year. Now turning to Slide 9. We plan to convert the DPP gas powered plant in the Dominican Republic from open cycle to combined cycle, increasing its output by 120 megawatts to 360 megawatts, without using any additional fuel. All required permits are in place, and we're working on PPAs for approximately 85% of the capacity. We expect to finance the more than $200 million investment in this project with leverage capacity at our existing businesses in the Dominican Republic. These 4 initiatives are examples of actions we are taking to create value for our shareholders with minimal AES equity. We're working on similar projects across our portfolio, which will result in an improved return on our invested capital. We're also seeing electricity demand growth in most of our markets, such as Chile, Central America and Asia that is 4x higher than the U.S., which provides us with many good investment opportunities. Now regarding the project on our construction project. Since our last call, we completed construction of our 266-megawatt Mount Signal Solar project in California, on time and on budget. It is one of the largest single-axis tracker PV plants in the world. We expect this project to contribute almost $10 million of distributable cash in 2014. Additionally, as you can see on Slide 10, we currently have 4,100 megawatts of new capacity under construction. This includes the 1,320-megawatt coal-fired OPGC II project in India and the 531-megawatt hydroelectric Alto Maipo project in Chile. Both of these projects broke ground during the first quarter on our expansions of existing plants. We also have 2400 megawatts of environmental upgrade underway at IPL Indiana, which will bring our IPL generation capacity into full MATS compliance by 2016. All of our construction projects are progressing well and are expected to come online over the next 5 years. Total AES equity required for these projects is $1.25 billion, of which 75% is already funded. All necessary financings are in place. On average, we're expecting an attractive 14% return on these investments. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom. Thomas M. O'Flynn: Thanks, Andres, and good morning to all. As Andres said, hydrology for this year is challenging. We're taking steps to offset these issues. While we're reaffirming our guidance for cash flow and adjusted EPS, we now expect to be in the lower half of the range for adjusted EPS. Today I'll go through our first quarter, including adjusted EPS, adjusted PTC by strategic business units or SBU, proportional free cash flow and our 2014 capital allocation plan. Turning to Slide 12. First quarter 2014 adjusted EPS of $0.24 was $0.03 below first quarter 2013. I'll give more details in a moment. But at a high level, we benefited from the following : our SBUs contributed an increase of $0.02 despite a $0.04 impact from hydrology and onetime spot price adjustment in the Philippines. We also had $0.03 from capital allocation actions, which resulted in reduced Parent interest expense and a 3% lower share count. On the negative side, we're affected by the absence of last year's $0.04 Beaver Valley PPA termination payment; a $0.03 impact from forced outages and the lack of gas availability at DPL during the extreme winter weather; and the return to roughly 30% normalized tax rate this year versus 26% in the first quarter 2013, which has an impact of $0.01. On a GAAP basis, we reported a loss of $0.07. This included $0.17 of impairments as a result of our annual review, largely DPL, where we impaired the goodwill associated with our retail business, reflecting continued margin compression and lower expected future retail growth. After this impairment, the remaining goodwill at DPL is $317 million. GAAP results also reflect $0.13 of expenses associated with the refinancing of near-term Parent debt maturities with longer-term lower coupon debt. Before we review our businesses in more detail, I'd like to comment on hydrology on Slide 13. Hydrology has been a challenge across Latin America. And we provided guidance at the end of February that was largely based on a return to normal hydro conditions for 2014. However, in the first quarter of '14, we had a $0.02 impact from below average hydrology versus a $0.03 impact last year. As Andres discussed, we've taken actions to reduce the full year impact by $0.04. Accordingly, we expect an impact of between $0.07 and $0.10 this year compared to $0.13 last year. About 2/3 of this is from Panama and the remainder from Brazil. In Chile, Colombia and Argentina, hydro has been very much in line with our expectations. And I'll cover Panama and then Brazil. As we noted on our last call, inflows were below average in Panama but the rainy season had not yet started. We're now entering that rainy season and the forecast is for inflows to be significantly below average. Also adding pressure to the tight supply, the competitor's large thermal plant went off-line in March, further increasing spot prices. As I mentioned on our fourth quarter call, in Brazil, system reservoir levels were low at 39% but there were still 2 months left in the rainy season. Since then the rainy season has ended and system reservoir levels have only improved to 43% versus 62% last year. System operator has increased thermal dispatched to preserve reservoir levers, causing higher spot prices. These higher spot prices do not affect our utility earnings due to the passive nature of energy purchases. However, there has certainly been an impact on working capital needs. To assist the distribution companies with the working capital, the government of Brazil has announced an BRL 11 billion funding plan, of which Eletropaulo and Sul will receive about BRL 1 billion this year. Regarding Tiet\u00ea, our generation business in Brazil, we ended the first quarter with high results from spot sales at favorable prices due to lower contract levels. However, we expect Tiet\u00ea to be a net buyer in the spot market during the second half of the year. If the dry conditions persist, we're getting some exposure in the second half of 2014. I'll note that this estimate does not include the potential rationing in Brazil. Since current reservoir levels are at 43% and given the level of thermal generation in the system, we do not believe that rationing is likely this year. Turning now to Slide 14 and the newly proposed tax reforms in Chile, which are expected to be approved by the third quarter of this year. The tax performs includes the phased-in increase of the corporate income tax rate from 20% to 25% by 2017. In addition, beginning in 2017, the law would require a 10% withholding tax to be paid when profits are earned rather than when they're paid out as dividends. Beyond the onetime increase in our deferred tax balance in 2014, which was factored into our guidance, we don't expect material impact from these changes in the near term. The Chilean government has also proposed new emissions taxes, including a carbon tax of $5 per ton, to be imposed on stationary boilers and turbines beginning in 2017. The proposal has an impact on our thermal plants, primarily for the period from 2017 through 2022. We believe that the impact of these green taxes is around $0.02 to $0.03 per share in 2017, declining thereafter as we expect an uplift in power prices that benefit our hydro capacity and our efforts to re-contract our thermal capacity. As a reminder, the average life of our PPAs in Chile is about 7 years. Now I'll go through each SBU. Turning to Slide 15. In the U.S. we reported a decline of $58 million in adjusted PTC year-over-year, which includes the onetime effect of $49 million on 2013 PTC from Beaver Valley PPA termination payment. Although we benefited from higher profitability on our wind businesses and better availability in Hawaii, as compared to last year, results were negatively affected by a $33 million decline at DPL. This was largely driven by DPL having to cover some of its load obligations from the spot market during January's extremely cold weather due to forced outages and gas curtailment. Turning to Andes, we reported a decrease of $28 million in PTC, half of which is the result of planned maintenance in Chile and the remaining amount is related to foreign exchange. In Brazil, PTC increased $27 million for the quarter, despite a 15% currency devaluation. Profitability improved across all of our businesses. Tiet\u00ea benefited from higher spot prices, as I described earlier. We also saw some improvements in Eletropaulo and Sul from higher demand due to the hot weather. At Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, we saw 16% adjusted PTC growth to $65 million. This was largely driven by higher availability and higher contract prices in the Dominican Republic. These favorable contributions were somewhat offset by lower hydrology in Panama. Turning to Europe, the Middle East and Africa on Slide 16. PTC increased 20% to $115 million. This was largely driven by higher operating performance in Bulgaria and Northern Ireland, as well as contributions from our new wind businesses in the U.K. Now I'd like to provide a quick update on Maritza. The plants are running well with excellent availability and the government of Bulgaria continues to support the agreement -- the agreed-upon payment plans. We received $61 million in payments since our last call, and current outstanding receivables are about the same level, which is $167 million, of which $40 million is due in installments over the next 8 months and the majority of the remaining amount is less than 90 days outstanding. Finally, turning to Asia, where PTC declined by $23 million to $8 million. About 1/3 of this decline relates to the planned and unplanned outages at our Masinloc facility in the Philippines. The plant is now back online as of mid-April. Also in the Philippines, we expensed $14 million this quarter as a result of a market spot price adjustment for November and December, when the system experienced unprecedented high spot prices due to significant system outages. Now turning to cash flow on Slide 17. We generated $129 million of proportional free cash flow this quarter, including the $60 million PPA termination payment related to Beaver Valley. This represents a decline of $172 million versus last year's first quarter. During the quarter we benefited from lower maintenance CapEx at our U.S. and Brazil utilities, higher collections at our businesses in the Dominican Republic and lower tax payments in Colombia. These gains were offset by higher working capital needs in Brazil and DPL related to higher sales, which we expect to recover during the remainder of the year. On a full year basis, as Andres has mentioned, we expect to generate $1 billion to $1.3 billion in proportional free cash flow. In addition to the recovery of working capital that I just mentioned, we are focused on improving liquidity and cash flow. As an example, we're reassessing minimum cash balances required to support operations at key businesses, with excess cash balances being distributed to AES or used more efficiently at the business level, such as debt prepayment. We also have a review of existing project financing arrangements to identify areas where restricted cash balances may be distributed to AES without adversely affecting the underlying credit. Overall, we believe these initiatives will help us to achieve our full year cash flow guidance. Now to Slide 18, our capital allocation plan for the year. We continue to project roughly $900 million of discretionary cash, including $500 million of Parent free cash flow as well as about $200 million of announced asset sales. In addition to dividend and debt prepayments, we plan to use $270 million for investments, largely in platform expansions at IPL and Gener, including our $108 million participation in Gener's recent equity raise. This leaves about $200 million to $300 million of discretionary cash to be allocated this year. Plus as we announce additional asset sales of roughly $500 million to $700 million by 2015, the amount of discretionary cash available will increase. We'll continue to work on maximizing cash flow, improved operations, optimize working capital and additional asset sales. And we'll deploy it in a disciplined way to maximize returns for our shareholders. I'll now pass it back to Andres. Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Thanks, Tom. In summary, although hydrology is once again extremely dry in some of our markets, we're taking steps to minimize the impact, including increased cost management efforts, accelerated capital allocation and strategic initiatives. At the same time, we're taking advantage of the opportunities our presence in attractive markets offers us to create value while being mindful of the amounts of AES equity we invest. Going forward, and in line with our capital allocation framework, we will continue to invest our discretionary cash to maximize value for our shareholders. As we've demonstrated through the repurchase of 8% of our outstanding shares over the last 2 years, buybacks will remain a key component of our capital allocation plan. To that end, we have $190 million of our repurchased authorization outstanding in conjunction with strong liquidity. The bottom line is that we still expect our annual total return to grow from a range of 6% to 8% to a range of 8% to 10% and expect our free cash flow to grow at a rate of 10% to 15% annually on average over the next 5 years. With that, I'd like to open up the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ali Agha with SunTrust. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : A couple of quick clarifications. First off on DPL, I know that you folks have been trying to get clarity from the commission on the status of the non-bypassable charge if you were to sell those assets. I heard you say you're sort of second round in the bids could -- and the sale transaction could occur by the end of this year. So where are you in that process from hearing back from the commission? And what bearing, if any, will that have on the timeline of the sale that you were talking about? Thomas M. O'Flynn: Ali, it's Tom. I'll just say we're on a parallel path there to -- as a separate to an affiliate and keeping the affiliate or of course to look at separating and selling to a nonaffiliate. We believe that the NDC and the other pieces of the ESP from last year are a fair and reasonable treatment, whether we continue to own the assets or not, essentially to provide stability for the DP&L utility, to manage through the transition pieces. And we think that's very reasonable. So we're continuing on a path. The team has made their -- a substantial filing before our last call. And we continue to move forward on that process. And we would expect to have the separation perhaps in the third quarter of this year and then have the flexibility to sell, as Andres said, by the end of the year. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : Okay. Secondly, Andres, if I was hearing you right, you mentioned these expansion opportunities that you're now capitalizing on represents $0.10 to $0.12 of earnings. It sounded from your timeline that that's starting to flow '15 onwards on these plus the pickup in the forward pricing in Brazil, particularly the '16 pricing. So have we raised our '15 and '16 outlook to reflect this? And if not, why not? Like what's offsetting at least the $0.10 to $0.12 of pickup that you highlighted for us? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Sure, Ali. As I mentioned in previous call, this was a very important initiative for us which is really to use those sort of adjacent spaces to add to our existing platforms to increase the profitability of the businesses. So at this time, Ali, we are sticking to our guidance for '14. And what we're saying in terms of beyond that is that we're doing everything possible to accelerate our total return growth from 6% to 8% to 8% to 10%. So at this point, I really have nothing further to say but that we're going to do everything possible to accelerate this as soon as possible. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : But did I hear you right that $0.10 to $0.12 of earnings, this is incremental it was not in your original budget that you were laying out for us? Is that correct? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : I would say some of that was because as I mentioned, when I first came out with the initiative, I said that we really were in the process of quantifying it. We had these ideas that we thought they were very promising but we really had to see how they would pan out in reality. So what I'm very pleased with the development in the last couple of months is that we're seeing that they're panning out very well. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : Got it. My final question, as far as capital allocation is concerned, Tom, the $200 million to $300 million bucket that you highlighted unallocated, when will you allocate that? We're almost getting to the halfway point in the year and share buybacks, clearly, you haven't done any so far this year. How should we think about that in terms of priority of that $200 million to $300 million that you plan to use this year? Thomas M. O'Flynn: Ali, our cash flow does tend to be a little bit more third, fourth quarter driven. We obviously are doing work to try to accelerate some of that. But as Andres said, we do have an authorization for a little short of $200 million. We do have good liquidity. So it is something that we look at as we look at some of the opportunities that Andres has mentioned, despite they're, let's say, thin on capital, because we're trying to be miserly, let's say, with our investment. So we've got good availability for other alternatives. We do compete those very much against share repurchase. So we do look at it on a regular basis. And I would say that -- remind you we did buy back 20 million shares in mid-December. And we bought back I think 8% of our shares since Andres stepped in as CEO. So it is something we look at on a regular basis. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : Okay. Final comment, more than a question, I mean, as you know given your valuation multiple, share buyback seems like a no-brainer at these price levels. Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Yes. We definitely think that current share price is an attractive value for us. So yes, I agree with you. Operator : Our next question is from Gregg Orrill with Barclays. Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Just a follow-up on the Tiet\u00ea contracting strategy '16 and beyond, how you're looking to fill that position through purchases or auction. Are there other auctions coming up that might help you to fill that? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Okay. I'll make it sort of a general comment. Our strategy there has been gradual recontracting. I think if you go back a couple of calls, people were saying why hadn't we contracted more? Partly one of the reasons, of course, we couldn't foresee the degree of drought but we did foresee that with MP 579 and other -- any of the concessions that we thought supply would be a bit tight. So we really essentially hedged our bets and said we contract over time. So as we mentioned we're about 68% contracted today post the ending of the contract with Eletropaulo at BRL 119 per megawatt hour. Our latest has been closing around BRL 125, BRL 135 and current prices are higher. But I'll pass it on to Andy, so he can talk a little bit about some of the auctions that we've seen recently. Operator : And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research : I just wanted clarification. So this $0.07 to $0.10 of an impact, is this before the $0.04 mitigation or is this inclusive of the $0.04? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Yes. That number is net of the mitigation actions that we've taken. And of course we're going to try for more. And as I also mentioned, to some extent where we'll be in that range will depend on how the potential El Ni\u00f1o develops. If it's very strong, it could help mitigate this. I would say that essentially El Ni\u00f1o will help us in Colombia, if it's strong -- whenever it's a very strong wind it could also help rains in Brazil. And typically it will make things worse in Panama. So there is a lot of moving pieces here. But what I think is very important, this is the second year that we've seen this occur. So we're taking actions to mitigate this risk going forward. We had taken some actions but we're taking additional actions, such as the barge into Panama. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research : Okay. Now about DPL, so we've had quite an impressive moving forward power curves. AD Javes [ph] is stronger than we probably -- you have ever expected. Now is this in any way impacting your decision making about the disposing your merchant assets or maybe restarting the sale process, given the fact that the value of these assets have still increased? Thomas M. O'Flynn: Angie, it's Tom. Yes, we've certainly seen that with gas coming up and some -- also some retirements. We've seen that. We would -- I think our plan continues to be the same. We're on a parallel path. We would hope and expect that those higher -- those improved outlooks and the forward market would translate into higher value from the folks looking at our assets. And we also have seen RPM here in the next few months. We think there's a lot of -- in the next few weeks, I'm sorry, we think there's a lot of helpful things that will bring the RPM back into a more attractive number. It would also help values that we would expect to see. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research : And lastly, you mentioned that there were some gas curtailment for some of the assets in Ohio. Is this a real curtailment or is this something that the prices were prohibitively high? Andrew Martin Vesey : Angie, this is Andy Vesey. Let me respond to that. This is the first time that -- in recent operating memory at DP&L there've been basically shortages of gas. What happened with extremely cold weather, there were 2 effects. One was that literally there was no gas available because it was prioritized to residential customers. The second issue is that the pricing went very, very high. I think on average, we see gas at about $8 a decatherm. We were buying at $25 and we were refusing at $45, so it was both. It was a period just no gas available because it was prioritize to residential customers. And the second impact that we saw was that when there was gas available, the pricing was extremely high. I think this is something we have to recognize and be cognizant of. And as a result of the performance that we had during the polar vortex, we've made a number of changes. And one is that we had recognize that the commercial strategy we had in place was suboptimal if not fragile. And we're currently reviewing that and reorienting that so we don't have these issues going forward. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research : Could you say which gas hub will have this issue with curtailment of gas? Andrew Martin Vesey : Angie, that I just don't know. We can get back to you on that. Operator : Our next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : So just a quick clarification on the hydrology, if you would. Is there any way to break up this $0.07 to $0.10 by quarter or by region a little bit more granularly, just so as we think through the next few quarters here what the expected impacts could be respectively? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Sure. I mean, we had $0.02 as we said in the first quarter. And then we're thinking of $0.07 to $0.10 for the remainder. Now again this range will depend again on -- it looks more likely than not that we'll have an El Ni\u00f1o effect and the question will be the strength of El Ni\u00f1o. If it's a very strong one then it's of course more positive for us. Now the main effects would be, one is Panama will get worse if you have a strong El Ni\u00f1o. That's the most -- that's where we have the biggest exposure. And then second, it would be Brazil where we have basically the Tiet\u00ea. And then on the positive side, you basically have Colombia. So I would say that in terms of quarters, maybe 60% will be in the second half of the year and we'll have 40% in the first half of the year. And again, we are cognizant of this. And what we're really trying to do is reshape our commercial strategy and create real options to sort of cut off the extreme ends here. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. And then on the Chilean tax situation, if you could talk about that briefly, I was wondering -- so you have an increase by year but also this is, I suppose, a 2017 increase step-up potential. What do you estimate that to be and also what are some mitigating strategies that you see as well? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Okay. I was in Chile last week and I met with key ministers. I met with leading congressmen and leading senators. So first, we have to say that this is a tax proposal. And what we really have is a discussion about it. What is key is that President Bachelet has that said they want 3% additional revenues, 3% of GDP additional revenues, which most of that will go for educational reform, making higher education free at all levels. So that's the desired outcome. So they have different components. The first is the increase of the corporate income tax to 25%. And quite frankly, we were expecting that and that has always been as part of our guidance. And we've taken the appropriate steps in time for that. And they're doing it in a gradual fashion to -- as should be the case. The second part of that is the withholding tax, doing on an accrual basis rather than on a cash basis. And that -- it was not as expected. But again, we had to pay that anyway when we pay the dividend. And we have been paying -- for example, this year high proportion of our disposable cash. Then the third issue, which is the green tax. This is interesting because what we heard was basically this was a revenue measure more than having -- because of the -- it's not extensive to all sources of CO2. So it's very specific, it was a revenue measure. They're looking at raising $180 million when fully implemented. So this one is also being debated at this point. Do you make it a wider tax rather than just boilers and turbines? And so we'll have to see how this one turns out. But in all cases, I think that we are well positioned for. We started Alto Maipo, which is 500 megawatts of hydro, thinking that this could be an eventuality in Chile. And we do have a pipeline potential from the Alto Maipo making additional hydro run of the river investments, if we see this task in full. [ph] So Julien, this is one thing we'll have to continue to monitor because this is not in place. What I feel very certain is that you will have this tax increase and they will have additional funds for the educational system, the corporate income tax of 25%, that's a given. Some sort of a green tax is also very likely. And there's a lot of discussion about the withholding. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Great. And then just in Bulgaria quickly, it seems like in the K we calculated some prices retroactively. I mean, how is the collection, how is the political situation stand there? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Okay. We haven't, sorry, calculated any prices retroactively. What Tom said in his script was basically that if you look at the level of receivables, they remain basically unchanged. I don't know, Tom, do you want to add? Thomas M. O'Flynn: So I'll just say, Julien, maybe the recalc was in the Philippines and it was about $14 million from very high prices last November, December. There was a large number of outages, I believe it was 2,000 megawatts of outages, so prices really spiked and the market did some recalculation. So some spot prices that we've taken in the income last November, December we've reversed out this quarter. That's the only market recalc. Bulgaria and Maritza, there hasn't been any recalc. And we continue to move forward and I gave the stats on receivables and payments. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Great, excellent. And let me just clarify one last comment you made Andres, with regards to Ohio, some of the other dynamics around, I suppose, getting involved with recon -- PPA's potentially. I'm kind of curious is that something on the radar screen? And could you talk about how that timeline for that process might mesh with your own decision to move forward with the sale and maybe also how it might relate to the pending ESP as well? I suppose the read that we're hearing on ESP. Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : We're aware of some of the other proposals that have been made in the space regarding a commercial strategy, which will help assure supply. I think there's serious concern given what happened in the polar vortex to keep sufficient plants online. And if there's a commercial strategy that helps make this happen, we support it. And we'd certainly look at this before making any final decision on a sale. So as we've said in effect, we're pursuing both fast. We're looking at what's occurring in Ohio and we will make the decision that we feel is in our shareholders' interest. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. But the timeline, is there a certain period of time with which you would need to wait for the ESP and PPAs to get resolved or you're kind of moving forward regardless with the sale and if it's not resolved by then, then you move forward with the sale? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Obviously, if you would transfer to an affiliate or you sell, sort of mutually exclusive. I don't see any sort of hard timeline that we have to make a decision in any specific period of time. So this will be more sort of a, I believe, a Q3 -- Q2, Q3 -- late Q2, Q3 issue. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Chin with Merrill Lynch. Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Just going back to the Philippines question. I thought I heard in your prepared remarks that there were unprecedented high spot prices in this quarter, but then in your response to Julien's question, I thought you had referenced that it was in the prior period. Can you just clarify that and help us understand this one? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Yes, I'll pass this one on to Andy. Basically there are -- there was 1 period where there were high prices and that's what it refers to. Andrew Martin Vesey : Brian, this is Andy Vesey, the period of time with -- of the recalc was last November, December. As Tom had mentioned, over 2,000 megawatts off the system. And the way to think about it is that on an average in 2013, we saw spot prices about 88,000-megawatt hour. During this period in November, December they climbed to 296,000-megawatt hour and that really stressed the system. And you also have to remember this was immediately after the typhoon. So this was a big stress on the economy. The government stepped in to recalc based on what they thought it should've been. That is over now. We have no indication that, that will go on. And quite honestly, most of the generators are discussing that decision by the government. We are -- right now we do not anticipate that this is a trend or that the government in the future would step in again, given that we don't see that kind of amazing spike in prices. Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : If you look at the Philippines, it is a market that's going to be short. But we think it's an attractive market. And we're looking at the opportunity of expanding our Masinloc plant there. So this decision by the ERC, as Andy mentioned, is being, let's say, contested because it interferes with the pricing mechanism. But again it was a very particular short period of time when prices really did really spike. Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : And then going back to DPL and gas deliverability, you've made comments about the fact that you're looking at solutions for gas deliverability in the future. Can you just go into little bit more color on what does that mean? Are we talking real changes, are you talking changes to some of your current contracts? Just a little more flavor on what we're looking at there. Andrew Martin Vesey : Brian, this is Andy. I really don't think we're looking at, at gas. One of the things we're really looking at is the commercial strategy and how close to the edge we're operating with our baseload and how we view the need for our gas turbine facilities to help meet our obligations. So this is really a re-examination of the commercial strategy to give us more flexibility in times of stress and potentially looking at the different uses of hedges in our hedging strategy in Ohio. Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : And then last one for me. The Tiet\u00ea comments about how power prices are now higher, is there a rough sense of what the incremental year-over-year EPS impact will be for that contractual rollover now? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : The contractual rollover, I mean, the current contract is at BRL 195 per megawatt hour. It expires in late 2015. It's a contract between Tiet\u00ea and Eletropaulo. There are contracts being signed now. There was an A0 [ph] auction but it had to be energy was available now. That's what A0 [ph] means, close to those levels actually, actually higher than those levels. And so again our strategy of having sort of not committed all of these energy early and having done it over time I think is playing favorably. And if those continue, we could see a potential upside. I mean what's in our forecast is an average price of around BRL 125 per megawatt hour. And currently, the 68% that we have is 119 megawatts -- BRL 119 per megawatt hour. So this could be -- for every $0.10 above an average price of BRL 10, that's about $0.01 for us in terms of adjusted EPS. Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. So a slight uptick is embedded in the forecast from '14 to '16 based on where you think the contractual prices could go. Is that correct? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Actually, I think that we're conservative given where we're at today, at today's prices, because again we have BRL 119 is our average price for 68% And we still have to contract 1/3 more. And if we contracted those, say -- to get to our BRL 125, you're probably talking about $1.30 up or BRL 1.35 per megawatt hour. Now if we contract higher than that and realize that if you go out to, let's say, 2018, we're 2/3 open. So I think there's a potential for an upside. I certainly don't think that our numbers are high. Operator : Our next question is from Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : In fourth quarter, you provided a long-term outlook for adjusted EPS. And I just wanted to make sure I understood the comments today and how it might impact that. 2015 was 4% to 6%, 4% to 6% growth? I'm still assuming that's the case. 2016, flat. And then 2017, 2018, you're going from 6% to 8%, to 8% to 10%? Is that correct? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : That's correct. Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then the change in 2017 to 2018, you've got a $0.02 headwind because of the Chilean emissions tax. What's offsetting that, that gets you the 2% growth bump? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : There are of course many moving pieces and one I'd say is the Chilean green tax, we have to see the final form, but that's a potential downside at this side. There are many things that could improve. I mean some of the adjacencies and enhancements, not all of those were in our forecast. And you also have the potential for higher re-contracting prices, for example, at Tiet\u00ea. So we don't -- we're not moving from those numbers. And we think that we have enough offsets to compensate for any green tax in Chile. Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : But going from 6% to 8% average annual growth in 2017 to 2018, the 8% to 10% is it just an increase in your confidence or is that project specific? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : No. No, there's a number of projects. I mean you realize that we have 4,100 megawatts under construction today. So you have Mong Duong coming online, you have -- in that time period, you would have the -- you'll have about -- besides Mong Duong, you have a number of other plants coming online that time period. So this is not, sort of, just uptick in our confidence it's basically plants that are coming online, including OPGC II, including -- in that timeframe, you would have Alto Maipo as well. So it's really most of it is just based on the construction projects coming online. Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : So there's just been an acceleration of the commercial operations? Ahmed Pasha : Just to be clear, Charles, this is Ahmed, just to be clear there's no change in our outlook that we provided back in December. So EPS growth rate, we talked about 4% to 6%, 4% to 6% to 8%, and then you have a dividend yield. So the total return we are talking about is 8% to 10%, so the EPS growth, just to be clear. Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Okay. The 8% to 10% is total and the 6% to 8% in '17, '18 still stands? Ahmed Pasha : Yes. So the EPS growth rate remains intact, no change, so is the cash flow. Operator : Our next question is from Alex Kania with Wolfe Research. Alex Kania - Wolfe Research, LLC: Just a quick question. Can you comment on just the coal piles in Indiana and Ohio, how they look relative to how you like to usually have them in -- going to the summer? Andrew Martin Vesey : Alex, this is Andy Vesey. We're okay. I mean we're right where we think we need to be. And we monitor that on a regular basis. We manage our coal procurement globally. So we're relatively comfortable with the current inventory levels that we have. Operator : Our next question is from Jeff Gildersleeve with Millennium Partners. Jeff Gildersleeve : I just wanted to ask, Tom, on the -- you went over certain cash management efforts, minimum cash balances and review of existing project financed structures. Could you just repeat that, and maybe explain how that's transforming? And is it just for this year or is it something that would have an ongoing impact on the cash flow of the business? Thomas M. O'Flynn: Yes, Jeff, happy to cover it. I'd say in general, we have unrestricted cash on a proportional basis. Year end was about $1.3 billion -- around $1.3 billion and we have a target to bring that down to about $1 billion by year end. That's different than the unrestricted cash you see in our financials because that's consolidated. So the number we focus more is on our proportional numbers just as we do on everything. So we are looking at working capital issues, looking at cash balances within our project financed structures, looking at seasonality, working capital, also see in some cases whether we can pool, if you will, on a modest basis some adjacent businesses that may have some offsetting working capital issues. So it's a couple of things. One, we do expect to make a press down this year. Some of this will be -- will not be classified as proportional free cash flow, some of it may be return capital but it's all cash so it all helps. So we think there'll be some benefits this year. But on an ongoing basis, we would expect to continue to make improvements from cash flow. And some of that goes into some of the structures as we -- Andres went through some of the growth that we're doing. We're very mindful of working capital requirements and restricted cash requirements in our growth. I think historically perhaps we weren't as mindful so we've got cash trapped in a lot of places. That is very fundamental to our investment decision and structural decisions. Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : We've taken, really, lessons learned and making sure that our new contracts, that we really have the ability to spend out the cash, unrestricted versus in the past. We've also restructured a lot of our debt. I mean we've had $8 billion of refinancing over the last year of subsidiary debt. And so all told, we are making structural changes to make it -- to reduce the amount of restricted cash that we have. Operator : And our next question is from Raymond Leung with Goldman Sachs. Raymond M. Leung - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Just to follow on Jeff's question, actually. He started to ask about what I wanted to talk about. How do you -- how should we think about for you to work on working capital or just restructuring some of your project financed, what does that do to maybe your subsidiary distributions? Do you think that or should we think this is more onetime in nature? And sort of what's your timing or sustainability of getting cash out? Is it more of a ongoing cash flow stream versus onetime in nature? I guess it sounds like you're targeting $300 million for that. And if you can address that, and also are you guys still projecting $1.15 billion to $1.25 billion for subsidiary distribution for the year, if you could update us on that? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Let me take, sort of backwards the first -- last one, yes. We are maintaining the same projections. I think, getting to your question, again, we are -- when we are doing refinancings, when we're doing restructurings, when we're doing a growth project, what we're incorporating is the ability, the greatest ability possible to be able to upstream that cash. So we are making structural changes to that. I don't know, Tom, do you want to add something too? I mean it's really an ongoing process. Thomas M. O'Flynn: It's ongoing process. I'd say it was factored in when we talk about 10% to 15% proportional free cash flow growth for the next 5 years, it was very much factored into that. We continue to look at ways obviously to be at the higher end of that range. And some of this will be used within the businesses. Some of this would be used to pay down debt in the businesses, use money more effectively. Some of it may also be used for subsidiary distributions, which obviously helps Parent free cash flow. Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : I think one of the things -- one of our great challenges is to take this very rapid cash flow growth and to turn it into earnings growth on a per-share basis. So that's one of the big challenges that we're grappling with. Raymond M. Leung - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. I mean what would be the optimal number of this unrestricted cash? I think you said $1.3 billion at year end, would like to get it down to $1 billion, what sort of, any thoughts on where you'd like it to get to? Thomas M. O'Flynn: We're looking through that. I think $1 billion is a reasonable target for year end '14. We have objectives to obviously get lower. I'd be a little ahead of skis if I put an objective down. Some of it, frankly, is restructuring some of our agreements and also trying to work some of the seasonality in the businesses. So we certainly think we can make more improvements to get lower than $1 billion in the future. Maybe it will provide a target but I'd probably be a little ahead of myself if I put one out right now. Raymond M. Leung - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Just my last question, just back to DPL I guess you guys noted that you had operational challenges at DPL. It sounded like it was more gas plants. Can you talk about how the coal plants performed during the quarter, during the vortex, what are your operational challenges there and then so, what sort of -- what are triggers there? Andrew Martin Vesey : Raymond, this is Andy Vesey. It wasn't just gas. We had some baseload units out notably in the first cold snap. One of the Zimmer units were out and that's one that we're co-tending, we don't operate. But we also had outages at Stuart. So collectively that represents almost 600 megawatts. Now these were very short outages from 5 to 7 days and actually Zimmer was ready to come back but we didn't have the gas for start-up. So when you think about -- the thing that was the major impact that we had from the gas was on our gas turbines, which we would have called in. We didn't have them. So the performance of the baseload units were impacting this period. We don't view the performance of these major coal units as problematic but as part of our overall review of our performance during January, we will be looking again as to what are the things we can do to basically improve performance and bring that equal [ph] rate down. Because that will have to be a very important part of our commercial strategy going forward. Ahmed Pasha : Angela, can we take one last question, please? Operator : Yes, our last question for today is from Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisors. Andrew Levi : I'm not really left with much. I guess the only thing that I'm kind of curious about and kind of goes around Jeff's question as well, is obviously you're trying very, very hard to unlock the value of the company, whether it's through asset sales, stock buyback, but it does seem that you have an awful lot of cash available. Is there -- are there any other things that you guys are thinking about as far as trying to unlock value for the shareholders? Something more radical as I would assume you get frustrated with the stock as far as its value and kind of where it's stuck? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Well certainly, as I said, we think that we are -- our stock is an attractive value. Now I would say that in terms of the things that we're doing, I mean these do take some time, this is a big company. What we feel very good about is how our strategy of thinking differently about our capital, about how we bring in partners, about how we do add-ons is -- we think making -- getting significant traction and that is really how we'll create growth. I mean people talk a lot about yield cos. What we're doing is quite frankly, bringing the partners in at the project level, getting a promote or getting management fees and other ways of increasing our return on capital. If we think about on the efficiency side by having a more focused geographic footprint, we've been able to cut -- we're getting close to 1/3 of our overhead. And we're starting now to look at O&M. And we have in our plans to cut about 11% of addressable O&M over the next -- through 2018. So we feel very good about what's been under our control. I mean we've had a difficult quarter. Part of that was some of the outages at DP&L, which we discussed. Looking for the rest of the year, second half, we're looking at a difficult hydrological situation. But if we think about the value that we've created by our active measures, we think these outweigh the sort of onetime event of a drought. And we will emerge from this situation with a portfolio that is less, say, vulnerable to droughts because we're creating the real option. So overall, I feel very optimistic about the path of the company. And I think that this will be recognized. And some of those things that we're doing is new. How we're thinking about capital is new. And I think we have to prove ourselves and that's what we're trying very hard to do. Andrew Levi : And then -- and there's no doubt that you're doing that. I guess what I was kind of thinking was -- I mean obviously the DPL, you have to sell those assets, and see what you get as proceeds. And I guess most of the proceeds are at this point scheduled to pay down debt, assuming you get those proceeds. Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : That's correct. Andrew Levi : But there is an awful lot of kind of cash available to you. And with the stock where it is, trying to do something a little bit more radical, whether it's a more immediate buyback such as like a Dutch auction or something like that, to try to unlock the value there and reward the shareholders. I don't know anything -- maybe not that specific but you understand what I'm saying, something more... Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : I understand completely. Count on us -- we, as I said, we see one of our challenges to convert our strong free cash flow and our strong free cash flow growth into value for our shareholders. And certainly, we were open to any ideas. Of course we have a plan that we're executing on and very clearly our objective is really increasing value per share, total return per share value. And that's what we're focused on. And I think if you look at our track record, we've done that and we will continue to do that. Operator : And we're showing no additional questions at this time. Ahmed Pasha : Okay. Thanks, guys. Thank you, I appreciate your help. Operator : And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

O'Flynn - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Andrew Martin Vesey - Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President Analysts : Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC Operator : Good morning, and thank you for standing by. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] And I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Ahmed Pasha, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Pasha, you may begin. Ahmed Pasha : Thank you, Elan. Good morning, and welcome to the second quarter 2014 earnings call for The AES Corporation. Our earnings release presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom O'Flynn, our Chief Financial Officer and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will now turn the call over to Andres. Andres? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. Today I will provide a brief update on our second quarter results and our progress on executing our strategic plan. Turning to Slide 4. Our second quarter results were $0.28 of adjusted earnings per share, which keeps us in line to achieve the low end of our guidance range on EPS despite the continuation of the drought in Brazil and Panama. Tom will provide more details on our results today and our year-to-go forecast, but a major driver of lower earnings in the second quarter was a much higher tax rate, which we expect will normalize on a full year basis. Similarly, while our cash flow results to date are significantly below last year's, this is largely due to timing issues at our utility. And we continue to expect to achieve our full year guidance. Now turning to the progress we are making on executing our strategic plan. I am pleased with our results to date. As you can see on Slide 5, the main objectives we set out almost 3 years ago were : first, exiting those markets where we do not have a competitive advantage; second, focusing our growth on platform expansions; and third, reducing our overhead. Since then, we've added a fourth objective, to expand our access to capital through partnerships at the project and business level. Taking one objective at a time, turning to Slide 6 and the simplification of our portfolio. In the second quarter, we announced and closed 2 new asset sale transactions. First, we brought in a minority partner for 41% of our Masinloc business in the Philippines. Second, we announced the sale of a majority of our solar business, Silver Ridge, which was not yielding adequate risk-adjusted returns on our invested capital. These 2 new transactions together represent $631 million of proceeds, implying a P/E multiple of more than 14 from these businesses and in line with our expectation of achieving $500 million to $700 million in asset sale proceeds in 2014 and 2015. Since we began the simplification of our portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2011, we have received $2 billion in asset sale proceeds, which we have used to pay down 20% of our recourse debt, buy back 8% of our stock and invest in platform expansions. Going forward, we expect to raise $500 million in additional proceeds by December 2015, by selling all or part of our interests in certain businesses in markets where we want to exit, decrease our exposure or reinvest our capital in platform expansions. What we seek to do is optimize our portfolio by geography, technology and fuel source. Turning to Slide 7. With regard to our focus on platform expansions, which provide us with a path for growth with higher risk-adjusted returns. We now have 4,500 megawatts of new capacity and 2,400 megawatts of environmental upgrades under construction. Most of these projects are either under long-term contracts or will earn utility-like returns. This is the greatest number of megawatts under construction ever in AES' 33-year history. As you can see on Slide 8, we've achieved commercial operations on time and on budget at the 247 megawatt IPP4 power plant in Jordan, which has a long-term contract with a state-owned utility. We also recently broke ground on 3 new platform expansion projects in the second quarter totaling 702 megawatts in the U.S. and Chile. The 671 megawatt Eagle Valley CCGT at IPL will not only help us diversify the fuel mix at the utility, but will also earn attractive regulated returns beginning during construction. This investment, combined with the mass upgrade currently underway, will result in a 50% increase in IPL's rate base. We see additional investment opportunities at IPL, which will help further grow the earnings power of this utility. In Northern Chile in the Atacama Desert, which has some of the best solar irradiation in the world, we recently broke ground on a 21 megawatt solar project with a long-term PPA with a local mine. Including this project under construction, we are developing a total of 220 megawatts of solar capacity next to our existing Los Andes substation. The entire capacity has environmental approval and will be developed in stages. Turning to Slide 9. The investment in our construction program will be mostly funded through nonrecourse debt and by our partners on various projects. Our total equity contribution in these projects is approximately $1.5 billion, of which we've already funded more than $1 billion and expect to invest the remaining $450 million, largely in 2015 and 2016. We expect a 16% cash return and a 15% ROE on these investments, which will be an important driver of earnings and cash flow growth over the next few years. Furthermore, we're making progress on our advanced pipeline of development projects, including platform expansions, adjacencies and enhancements and select platform expansion acquisitions. These opportunities represent a pipeline of more than 5,000 megawatts in our core markets. Turning to Slide 10. We have significant brownfield potential at our Southland gas-fired facilities in Southern California. We're moving through the permitting process and pursuing long-term PPAs and commercial arrangements. Furthermore, our energy storage solution and site locations position us well to help meet Californian's mandate for at least 1,325 megawatts of energy storage. Turning to Slide 11. As we discussed in our last call, we are closing the cycle at our 236 megawatt DPP plant in the Dominican Republic, increasing its capacity by 122 megawatts. We recently signed a 6-year PPA with the state-owned utility and selected an EPC contractor. We are working on financing and expect to begin construction later this year with commercial operations in mid-2016. This 260 megawatt enhancement will be mostly funded with debt capacity in the Dominican Republic. Moving to Slide 12. Another market where we're looking at growth opportunities is Mexico. We've been in Mexico for almost 15 years and currently own 3 power plants, making us one of the largest independent power producers in the country. Mexico is a big market, and more importantly, has the potential to increase its installed capacity by more than 25,000 megawatts in the next 5 to 7 years through recently proposed reforms to the energy laws. Now on to Asia beginning on Slide 13. As you may know, the Philippines is currently experiencing power shortages as growing demand continues to exceed existing supply. We already have all the necessary permits for the 600 megawatt Masinloc expansion, and we're working to secure EPC and power offtake agreements. We're also developing up to 200-megawatts of energy storage projects to meet ancillary service requirements and peak demand needs for the system. Turning to Slide 14. In Vietnam, construction of our 1,240-megawatt Mong Duong project is progressing well. We recently synchronized to the national grid and achieved full load on unit 1 of 560 megawatts. We expect to achieve full commercial operations on time during the second half of 2015. In its first full year of operations, we expect Mong Duong to contribute $100 million in proportional free cash flow. In addition to our Mong Duong facility, we're assessing further growth opportunities in Vietnam, including both greenfield and privatization of government-owned generation plants. Turning to Slide 15. A significant development that aids the execution of our strategy is our ability to incorporate financial partners at the project and business level. Since we started this initiative 2 years ago, we have closed about $2 billion in equity from partners. Bringing in partners at the project level enables us to optimize our portfolio by tailoring our equity commitments to specific projects managing our aggregate risk profile at the corporate level and improving our returns through promotes and management fees. It also gives us a mechanism to demonstrate the value of our assets in markets where there are few or no listed comps. Some recent examples of these are Guacolda in Chile where we brought in a partner to invest $728 million for a 50% stake in the business; and Masinloc in the Philippines where EGCO, a Thai company, invested $453 million for a 41% stake. Now addressing our third objective on Slide 16, reducing our global overhead to become the low-cost manager of a portfolio of assets. We are well on our way. We're on track to realize our goal of reducing global overhead by $200 million by 2015. From 2011 to 2013, we reduced our global overhead by $143 million, and we expect to achieve an additional $57 million over the next 1.5 years. I'm pleased to report that we have accelerated our savings profile and now expect to realize about 70% or $40 million in savings this year, leaving only $17 million to be achieved in 2015. We're accomplishing these reductions through process improvements and global standardization across our corporate support functions. Therefore, in terms of executing on our strategic plan to increase shareholder value by creating a more streamlined and focused company, which takes advantage of its footprint in attractive markets to pursue high-return projects, I would say we are continuing to make very good progress. Nonetheless, we're facing some short-term challenges in a few of our markets. Moving to Slide 17. This is the second year of drought in Latin America, which has significantly affected our results in Panama and Brazil. As we discussed on our last call, we continue to project an earnings impact of $0.07 to $0.10 in 2014. Turning to Slide 18 in Brazil where we continue to see tight demand and supply conditions having a positive impact on forward power prices, which are now BRL 180 to BRL 210 per megawatt hour for 2016. As you may know, this is about the same price of Tiet\u00ea's existing contract that expires in 2015 and is almost 50% higher than the price we assumed in our expectations for 2016. 3/4 of Tiet\u00ea's capacity for 2016 is contracted for 2016 at BRL 125 per megawatt hour. And with today's forward curves, we see $0.01 to $0.02 upside for adjusted EPS in 2016 relative to our expectations. Beyond 2016, on an unhedged basis, every BRL 10 improvement in power prices translates into $0.01 of adjusted EPS for AES. Turning to Slide 19, I will discuss developments at Maritza, our coal-fired power plant in Bulgaria. In June, the Bulgarian energy regulator took certain actions concerning Maritza's PPA. The regulator announced that it had requested the Director General for Competition of the European Commission to scrutinize the PPA under European state aid rules. While the Director General has not contacted us on this matter, Maritza will defend the PPA in any assessment or proceedings initiated in response to this request. Additionally, as we've discussed in the past, the energy regulator has instructed NEK, the state-owned utility that is the offtaker under our contract, to initiate negotiations on the terms of the PPA in order to lower its payments. We have had several discussions with NEK and various government authorities concerning the regulator's actions. Maritza continues to be engaged in resolving this matter, as well as in the recovery of our outstanding receivables. In fact, last week, Maritza signed an agreement to settle $45 million of its outstanding receivables that are more than 90 days overdue from NEK. In that deal, NEK agreed to assume $17 million representing all of Maritza's outstanding obligations to its fuel supplier and restructured the additional amount over 4 months. As of July 31, Maritza had $206 million of receivables due from NEK with $47 million not yet due and $69 million overdue for more than 90 days. As far as the resolution of these issues, it is likely that any action will be deferred until the new government is elected in October. Maritza contributes roughly 7% of our PTC. And while the situation is challenging, Maritza's objective is to preserve the value of the business through a negotiated agreement of our seeking to reinforce its rights. Our guidance is based on maintaining the value of our existing contract. Next turning to Slide 20. Although we have not been negatively affected by the Argentine government's selected defaults, we continue to closely monitor the situation. In Argentina, where we generate about 3% of our PTC, we have a competitive fleet of 3,000 megawatts of generation capacity, which is an important source of reliable generation in the country. Additionally, we have taken steps to dollarize our accounts receivables in Argentina. Although we have factored a devaluation of the Argentine peso into our forecast, an extreme devaluation could have negative impacts on our results. And finally, turning to the situation in Puerto Rico where our 524 megawatt coal-fired plant has a long-term contract with PREPA, a government-owned utility. As you may know, the rating agencies lowered the rating on the commonwealth and its corporations. AES Puerto Rico contributes about 2% of our PTC. PREPA is facing business and liquidity challenges primarily driven by the weak economy, along with other state-owned companies and has a high cost oil-fired generation fleet that serves 70% of the commonwealth's energy needs. We believe that our existing contract is advantageous to PREPA, particularly considering that our plant saves PREPA an estimated $250 million per year. These are some of the key areas that we're keeping a close eye on. Having said that, we have taken actions and will continue to do so in order to mitigate any risks. In the longer term, we're addressing our exposure through selective asset sell-downs and rebalancing our fuel mix through platform expansions to create an even more robust company. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom, who will provide more details on our financial results in the second quarter and year-to-date, as well as our year-to-go forecast. Thomas M. O'Flynn: Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll go through our second quarter results including adjusted EPS, adjusted PTC by strategic business unit or SBU, proportional free cash flow, the 2014 capital allocation plan, and finally, our 2014 guidance. Beginning on Slide 22. This quarter, we benefited from higher pretax contributions from our businesses and also our capital allocation impacts. However, the tax rate in the second quarter was higher than last year and above our full year 2014 expectations. We finished the quarter with adjusted EPS of $0.28 a share and expect to achieve adjusted EPS in the low end of our guidance range. Improvements in our businesses in the U.S., Andes, Brazil and also in Mexico, Central America and Caribbean SBUs together contributed an increase of $0.02, including a lower adverse impact from hydrology versus last year. Partially offsetting these improvements, outages in our Europe, Middle East and Africa and Asia SBUs reduced results by $0.02. Like last year, we recognized benefits from some discrete items, the net effect of which was a positive $0.02. We also benefited from investing in our balance sheet, which added $0.02 to the bottom line. This was driven by 2 factors : First, our share count was down by 3%; and second, in May of 2013, we prepaid $300 million of parent debt and refinanced $750 million, which resulted in annual interest expense reduction of $50 million. Our tax rate was 40% this quarter, higher than last year's second quarter's unusually low rate of 11% producing a negative impact of $0.11. This breaks down into $0.07 related to the expected return to a normalized rate of about 30% to 32% and $0.04 due to interim timing impacts. Before I go into the businesses, I'd like to touch on some developments at DPL on Slide 23. The commission has ruled on all pending matters in the ESP case and extended the generation separation deadline by 12 months to January 2017. Regarding generation separation, based on the PUCO staff's recent comments, we believe we are close to a consensus with the staff on material terms of separation. We expect a commission decision in the third quarter. As you may know, we ran a process to consider selling DPL generation. Although the sale would have been accretive this year, and we received reasonable bids. The offers were not attractive relative to the long-term value to AES. We therefore decided not to sell. Selling the generation would have left the remaining business with a significant amount of debt. At the same time, this high debt level increases our leverage to improvements in the energy market. The following factors contributed to our decision : first, movements in power prices as witnessed in the first half of this year create a more positive outlook. I appreciate these curves would come off their May peaks, however, the market is still higher than what we were projecting at the start of the year. Second, we saw an improvement in PJM RPM prices which doubled, albeit from low level at the last auction and outstanding proposals to provide additional improvement. Third, we are implementing a plan to further improve the operations of the business, particularly related to improved plant performance. And fourth, we'll continue to optimize our positions through our multiyear commercial hedging strategy. Overall through 2016 when the ESP expires, DPL is expected to generate annual EBITDA of about $350 million, of which about $80 million to $100 million is attributable to the generation business with the rest coming from the T&D business and the non-bypassable payments under the current ESP. Based on current forwards, DPL is projected to generate $100 million in free cash flow annually. And our plan is to use any excess cash to repay debt, which is currently $2.3 billion. We provided addition details on hedging and debt maturity profiles of DPL in the appendix. Bottom line is that DPL's generation business was projected to be dilutive over the next several years. However, based on the current market, this business is earnings neutral and has earnings upside potential if we're successful in capturing the market and operating improvements that I just discussed. Now to Slide 24, I'll discuss each of our SBUs, focusing on adjusted PTC or PTC. In the U.S., we reported an increase of $17 million of PTC. This was largely driven by the synchronous condensers at Southland and a new 40 megawatt energy storage resource in Ohio. In our Andes SBU, PTC was up $16 million. We benefited from a higher tariff at AES Argentina and lower maintenance costs and lower FX losses in Chile. In Brazil, PTC increased $37 million for the quarter. This includes a $47 million benefit at Sul from a reversal of a prior interest expense. This compares to a $24 million reversal of a liability at Uruguaiana in the second quarter of last year. Excluding these onetime items, PTC increased by $14 million as we benefited from higher contributions at Uruguaiana and Sul. Moving to Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, PTC declined $9 million. We benefited from the steps that were taken to offset the adverse hydro conditions in Panama, including payment from the government under the negotiated agreement to compensate for exposure to high spot prices of up to $40 million this year and $100 million total from 2014 to 2016. Turning to Europe, Middle East and Africa on Slide 25. PTC was essentially flat versus last year. This performance was largely driven by scheduled outages in Bulgaria that were offset by higher operating performance at Kilroot in U.K. and a reversal of a liability in Kazakhstan. Finally to Asia, where PTC declined by $17 million. Although we were anticipating a decline, our operations in the Philippines were adversely affected by forced outages in the second quarter with an impact of $13 million. These outages are the result of issues in the boiler, which have been resolved and the units were returned to service in July. In addition, we used these outages to complete some maintenance we had planned for next year. So to summarize, as shown on Slide 26, our total year-to-date adjusted PTC is roughly $583 million or 43% of the midpoint of our expectations. For comparison, last year, we earned 46% of our full year PTC in the first half. Our year-to-date effective tax rate was 36%. We expect a lower rate during the second half of the year that will bring our full year tax rate down to about 30% to 32%. Beyond this year, we continue to expect a low to mid-30% tax rate. Now to cash flow on Slide 27, we generated $47 million of proportional free cash flow in the second quarter, which was impacted by working capital requirements at our utilities in Brazil. This brings our year-to-date proportional free cash flow to $176 million versus $526 million in the first 6 months of '13. We recognize that this year is significantly lower than last year as we've had a $300 million swing at our utilities in the U.S. and Brazil driven primarily by working capital requirements. Specifically, in Brazil as we discussed on our last call, the system operators dispatching thermal generation to preserve reservoir levels causing higher spot prices. These higher spot prices do not affect our utility earnings due to the passive nature of energy purchases. However, there is an adverse impact on working capital as there was a lag due to the periodic tariff adjustments approved on an annual basis. Our guidance assumes that during the second half of the year, our utilities in Brazil will benefit from the recently approved annual tariff adjustments, as well as the pending government support mechanisms. In the U.S., during the first half of the year, cash flow at DPL and IPL were affected by higher working capital requirements, outages at DPL and upfront funding of annual pension contributions at IPL. Working capital requirements at our U.S. utilities were driven by high receivables from our regulated customers as a result of higher fuel prices and energy purchases during the cold weather in the first quarter. Our guidance assumes that both companies will recover these investments through fuel and energy cost regulatory mechanisms during the second half of the year. To summarize, with our year-to-date performance, we expect to generate almost $1 billion in proportional free cash flow during the second half of this year versus $745 million generated in the second half of last year. We do have seasonality in our cash flow. Last year, the second half represented 59% of our proportional free cash flow. This year, in addition to the seasonality factor in the second half, we expect to recover the significant short-term working capital drag that I just discussed. In fact, our utilities in the U.S. and Brazil should contribute about $400 million in the second half of the year versus negative $100 million in the first half. We believe proportional free cash flow is one of our key value drivers. We continue to believe that we'll generate $1 billion to $1.3 billion this year, and we're very focused on our businesses having a strong second half to achieve this goal. Now to Slide 28 in our capital allocation plan for the year. During the quarter, we refinanced a $770 million senior secured term loan with an unsecured floating rate note, increasing our available first-lien debt capacity by 50% to $2.2 billion and reducing our interest expense. When taking into account the recently announced solar and Philippines transactions, we project roughly $1.5 billion of discretionary cash, including about $800 million of cash from announced asset sales as well as parent-free cash flow, which we expect to be $500 million. We've allocated about $275 million this year for investment in a portion of our equity commitments for projects under construction, primarily platform expansions. We used roughly $500 million to $600 million of the excess cash for debt reduction, including the $320 million that we recently called and the $140 million prepaid earlier this year. About half the targeted debt reduction this year relates to our policy of using part of the proceeds from asset sales to maintain credit neutrality. The remaining half was discretionary in an effort to accelerate our credit improvement and reduce financial risks, consistent with our previously stated balanced capital allocation strategy. Since our first quarter call in May, we've invested $47 million in our shares. This brings our overall investment in share repurchases to $758 million since September of 2011, reducing our share count by 8%. After $145 million of dividends to shareholders and a target closing cash balance of $100 million, we're projecting $300 million to $500 million of discretionary cash to be allocated this year, plus any additional asset sales would increase the amount available. In the first half of the year, our allocation of capital to share repurchases has been modest, as we've been more focused on reducing our debt and making investments, that will earn attractive returns and generate growth in our earnings and cash flow. Over the past 2 years, however, we've been returning approximately $400 million per year on average to shareholders, including dividends and repurchases. This year, we anticipate returning at least $300 million as we expect to repurchase more shares in the second half. The bottom line is that we'll continue to be disciplined and invest our cash to maximize risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders on a per-share basis. Now to Slide 29. We are reaffirming our guidance that we expect to be in the low end of our adjusted EPS range of $1.30 to $1.38. In the first quarter call when we updated our guidance, we discussed several items that we expect that will help us to mitigate the $0.07 to $0.10 impact of hydrology. One of these offsets was an expectation of the benefits from selling DPL's generation business and removing it from continuing operations this year. Although we decided to retain this business, and therefore, will not have that benefit this year, the Sul reversal that I talked about earlier, which was not in our original guidance, allows us to stay within the low end of our guidance range. With that, I'll now turn it back over to Andres. Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Thanks, Tom. In summary, although we're facing some short-term headwinds, we're taking concrete steps to lower our portfolio risks and increase per-share value. Since we set out our strategy in September 2011, we're on target to reduce our global overhead by $200 million by next year, and we are focusing on additional O&M cost reductions. We raised $2 billion in asset sale proceeds. We paid down 20% of our parent debt; invested $758 million in our shares, reducing our share count by 8%; and we are selectively investing in platform expansion opportunities that yield attractive risk-adjusted returns. Through these actions, we've laid a solid foundation and remain committed to investing our excess cash flow to grow our earnings and free cash flow per share, resulting in proportional free cash flow growth of 10% to 15% per year and a total return to shareholders of 8% to 10% by 2017. Now, I'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Ali Agha. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : Just following-up on a few of the topics, first off on the capital allocation front. So if I looked at on the slide, this quarter versus last quarter, it appears you've paid down about an another $390 odd million of debt or plan to do that in terms of -- in terms of that bucket. What are the earnings implications of that, or have those been factored in from that incremental debt reduction? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Yes, those are factored in, Ali. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : So is it fair to say the asset sale proceeds, the earnings going away from asset sales are being offset by the lower interest. Is that the way to think about that? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Yes, I would say partially, yes. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then with regards to the unallocated bucket, and I know, Tom, you alluded to the fact you will be buying more shares in the second half, given that roughly 300 million or so number. Is there a thought of getting even more aggressive on the buyback given where the stock is, Andres? I mean just your thoughts on that, as you're investing in new projects versus buybacks looking at the valuations, how are you thinking about potentially getting even more aggressive on buybacks? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : That's a very good question, Ali. When we're looking at the investments that we're making, as I've said in the past, we compete that -- those against share buybacks. So obviously, when you look at the returns that we're projecting, 16% cash returns and a 15% ROE, we think that those are superior to what we're getting back from buybacks. So we're taking a balanced approach. We're saying that -- we said last time that we would buy back shares. We're doing that. Do realize that the cash that we received from these asset sales was also quite recent. We only received it, say, in the last month. But I think we're doing exactly what we said that we would do that we would buy back shares. But we'd also complete the new projects. And so obviously, if we're doing these new projects it's because we feel that those are the projects that maximize our shareholder value over time. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : And then Andres, just coming back to DPL for a second. So the merchant, as you said, the pricing you thought was not good, so you pulled back on that sale. So should we view these assets now as core holdings and that sale is completely off the table? And related to that, as you know Duke is going through the similar process, and you do have joint ownership with them on a bunch of your plants. Would you look to participate through that joint ownership in the Duke process? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : You're right, Ali, one of the factors and one of the reasons we proceeded to go out and get a market read on these assets were that some of our partners were out there selling. And obviously, that will have an impact on these assets. It depends on who buys them, how they will be running these operations. So we will continue to closely monitor that process and see what ways we can continue to increase value there. I mean, as you know, we have a program to get more out of these plants from a performance point of view. Maybe Andy would like to just comment on some of the things we're doing there. Andrew Martin Vesey : Thanks, Andres. We -- in keeping the plants, we have a few things that we're focusing it on, and I'll just talk to the 3. Obviously, we continue our cost reduction program. We've already achieved about $65 million in O&M reductions to date, which is currently in our forecast. We're also looking at 2 other things. One is reliability and improvements at the major stations. For our fleet at DPL, every 1% increase in -- decrease in E4 [ph] gives us about approximately $2 million of adjusted PTC. And also heat rate, which again on a fleet basis, every 1% improvement in heat rate gives us about $3 million to us. So we're focused on both of those programs. We have a lot of experience there, and we should start to see those improvement results in 2015. And lastly, one of the lessons we took away from last year's polar vortex was we really had to refocus on our commercial strategy in working with our risk flow. The operating people are trying to increase operational flexibility by improving the ability to turn down and be much more responsive to markets. So those 3 things we're going to pursue much more aggressively now. And we think we'll start to see the benefit of that in the 2015 timeframe. Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : To sort of close the topic, also some of our other firms in Ohio are looking at, for example, PPAs and other things. so we're monitoring those things. And we took a decision based that we thought there was more upside at that price than selling it. It would have been a -- I think it shows our discipline in terms of executing on our strategy. I think all of our asset sales, we've executed quite well and really tried to get value from those assets. Even though sometimes we could have done things faster, I think we would have left some money on the table. Operator : Our next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : So first question here, could you reconcile a little bit what the assumptions are baked into your long-term growth rates? Specifically, I noticed you talk about a higher growth rate in '17, '18. What's embedded in there from both the DPL perspective as well as the hydro and recontracting perspective in Brazil? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : I'm going to pass this question off to Tom. But I think that the basic assumptions -- what I can say in terms of the longer forecast -- I mean this is based on the projects that we have under construction today. A big factor is Mong Duong coming online next year, which will produce a lot of cash. We also have Alto Maipo. We have these 4,500 megawatts, which we're constructing. And in terms of the hydro in Brazil, we do assume a return to normal, but we are looking at higher contract prices. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Tom, were you going to add something? Thomas M. O'Flynn: Yes. Sorry, Julien. So the 5-year forecast, we look at it on an annual basis. That's when we talked in our year end call, we laid out. And that was based upon market assumptions at that time. So those were PJM forwards at that time and also Brazil numbers that were around, more like 115 at that time. So as we sit here today, DPL's probably up a couple of cents. And as Andres went through Tiet\u00ea, we'll probably be up a penny or 2 based upon the forward curves as we see them today. I think that said, we're reluctant to update 5-year guidance on a piece-by-piece basis. But just in isolation, those 2 things would be tailwinds for us. We would plan to give a wholesome 5 year update at the same time next year, which is in Feb when we announce our year end earnings. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Got you. And can you just reconcile a little bit on DPL. I think I heard you saying that it generates, perhaps, breakeven or even negative EPS prospectively. When would you think about next reevaluating this business? Is this really about waiting it out in terms of maturity and seeing what happens in terms of the market, or is it something else? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : I think Julien, getting back to sort of our decision, this year it would have been accretive to sell DPL, as Tom pointed out in our last earnings call and mentioned today again. We think given current forward curves that it will be neutral to slightly accretive to have kept it going forward. Now in terms of -- we are always evaluating all of our businesses and updating it. But what I would say is that, as Tom mentioned in his speech, we're thinking about things very much in the portfolio and in terms of looking what's our aggregated risk at the corporate level. And so here, we're saying that basically, given the various factors that are happening in Ohio and the forward curves, we think there's potential upside from having kept Ohio. Of course, we have to always revalue our decisions over time. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : I'll move on. On the D -- sorry, on the share repurchase side of the equation, when you're thinking about allocating the rest of the to-be-allocated capital on that pie chart, at what point in time could we see a potential revision in share repurchase? I know it's a little bit re-asking the last question, but I just want to be a little clearer about this. Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : What I would say, Julien, is that again, we've said that we would buy shares at these prices, and we are doing so. And I don't think that at this stage, we have a number of interesting projects. And we also have the opportunity to pay down debt, which we've announced. I think we've -- Tom stated that we wanted to be a solid BB, and we're keeping our credit metrics within that range. So we'll maintain that balanced capital allocation, say, philosophy going forward. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : And then could you talk a little bit about the expansions here? Again kind of with respect to the guidance there, I assume this isn't in there. But the Dominican Republic expansion, how much does that contribute in EPS? And then also Mexico, given increasing competitive pressures, I mean is this something that is attractive to you? How are you thinking about your own participation, and how soon could that come? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Okay. I'd say let's take first the Dominican Republic. This is in our forecast in terms of -- so we expect this to come online mid-2016. So this is in our forecast. This is an attractive project. We have a very good portfolio there in the Dominican Republic. I would say that in terms of Mexico, we have a great brand name there. We have a very good brand name because of the turnaround that we did on 2 pet coke plants. They're [indiscernible] and Tiet\u00ea. And our offtakers were Grupo Penoles and CEMEX . And so we have a good brand name. People want us to build more plants there and would like to be our offtaker. We have some potential projects. We have to see if those pan out. But I think that the -- it's an attractive market for us. We've done well there. I think it's a market very correlated, let's say, with U.S. risk, in terms of the economy itself. So we're well positioned. We're looking at the opportunities. And let's see if some of these projects are concrete, and we can announce them. Operator : Our next question is from Christopher Turnure. Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Could you give us a little bit more color on the drivers of the increase in solar power prices in Brazil? And then give us some color as well on how you're thinking about contracting going forward? We see the slide today that shows where you are now, but has that changed? Have you been more aggressive given the power price increase, et cetera? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : What's interesting in the case of Brazil -- I mean what is driving it? You had medida provis\u00f3ria, MP 579, which let's say, reduced some of the concession life. Some of the company did not renew their concessions on some of the generation assets. And there was somewhat of a slowdown in new construction. Because of that, there's also been a delay on some of the mega hydros on the tributaries of the Amazon. So put that all together, I think that's partly what's driving the higher prices. There's also been the drought in Brazil. But really, when you\u2019re talking '16 onwards, I think it's -- the bigger effect is MP 579. Our strategy was when we had the sort of, cliff falling off in our contract. We actually took a conservative approach and didn't contact everything right away. Had we done so, we would have re-contracted at the then going price of 95 to 100. We thought that it was likely the market would get tighter, of course, based on our conditions. So -- and that has come true. So I think that in terms of our contracting strategy going forward, we're going to continue to take advantage, let's say, of these higher prices and contract more. But it's a little bit sort of a rolling average. So as you go out over time, we're less contracted. It's also you can't get that many long-term contracts in Brazil. It's going to be these sort of 2 to 3-year contracts. Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Is there any chance that 2 consecutive years of dry hydrology have actually impacted the outer years at all, even though that's, by definition, a short-term phenomenon? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : I don't think so. I really don't think so because I think that everybody expects the droughts to reverse and enter more into a normal cycle of El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a-type phenomena. Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : My second question is on cash flows in the back half of the year. Could you just walk us through how the Eletropaulo kind of true-up works with the regulators there, or with the government subsidy or help plan that they give you? And then kind of how much of a percentage of what you have to make up for in the back half of the year that actually equates to for overall AES? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : I'm going to ask Tom to take this question. But basically, the essence is that in both cases, we have higher energy prices that first, we have to pay for the energy and then we bill clients. Thomas M. O'Flynn: Yes, so it's really 2 things. There's tariff adjustments. Both Eletropaulo and Sul have had major tariff adjustments that would capture some of the shorter-term costs, such as purchase power, which is the largest one. And then also there's been a government funding mechanism by the regulator that provides, I think, about $1.2 billion to collectively EP and Sul that allows some direct payment of those higher cost power payments. For us, the big swing factor is Sul. Eletropaulo, we only own 16% of it. It's a more modest amount. But of the $400 million swing that I talked about, of all the utilities, which is down 100 -- or $500 million swing, I'm sorry, down $100 million to plus $400 million from first half to second half, a, about 70% of that is coming out of the U.S. And for us, the lion's share of the Brazilian portion is coming from Sul. Operator : Our next question is from Kit Konolige. Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division : So just to get back to DPL, at least, briefly. Obviously, there have been a few questions on the withdrawal of the capacity for sale. Do you -- can you give us any idea of what you're kind of looking for or what kind of timetable you're looking at that might lead to a remarketing of that capacity, or is that really not in the cards at this point? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : I would say at this point, it's -- we're not in the cards. I mean we've taken a decision. We expect to improve the performance of those assets. And we think that there are several factors, several different avenues to significant increase in volume in the future of those generation assets. So of course, we don't know exactly how the future, but we think there are several paths where this could have significant upside. Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division : And when you looked at the bids that were coming in and looked at your process for putting those plants up for sale, what's your conclusion, in retrospect, about the difference between your expectations and the bids you got in? I mean what were the buyers seeing there? Was this just too small of a fleet for people to want to buy into? It would have seemed like a pretty good environment with prices having run up some? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Well, I -- again, I can't get into the minds of the potential buyers. What I would say is that the run-up in forward curves in the better outlook for the RPM capacity also helped us in terms of what we consider our whole value would be. Thomas M. O'Flynn: Kit, it's Tom. I'd just add that obviously, we've done a lot of asset sales around the world, many billions of dollars that have brought $2 billion of cash back to AES. So we've shown an ability to transact. I guess that said, at any -- for all those transactions, when we looked at where the numbers were finally coming down to, we made a judgment ourselves and the board as to whether the assets were worth more to us or more to somebody else. So at least in this case, through a whole lot of factors, it was a tough decision. It was a -- certainly had a lot of discussion. We looked at it hard. We did get real bids from real players, so it certainly was transactable. But it was -- we just thought it worth more to keep than to take the money now. Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division : And then one other area that I'd like to touch on. You sold your position in some solar assets that you had. And you're investing in other solar assets. Can you give us an idea -- I mean you mentioned for the ones that you're selling that you weren't getting adequate returns. And obviously, for the ones that you're going to invest in, you're expecting to get adequate returns. Can you give us an idea what the difference was? In other words, what was wrong with the solar investment that you made previously? And why is the future one going to be better? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Well, the big difference is that going forwards, we're really looking at geographic markets. So we're building solar where we have an existing business. So when I mentioned we have 220 megawatts of permitted solar in Chile, we already have a substation there. We already have all of the infrastructure. So it's far less expensive to operate. It's far less expensive to do the development. So that's really the big change in strategy. What we're looking at is the total cost of doing the project and taking advantage of our platforms. So what we did was exit a number of countries. We had relatively small number of megawatts operating them. And what we're doing is we will build solar in the future because we do many types of energy. We will do the energy -- type of energy that is most attractive and makes the most sense for that market, but that also compliments our portfolio. So that's the big difference. We're going to where we have assets, where we can do the development and operations much cheaper than going into markets where we don't have a presence. Operator : Our next question is from Stephen Byrd. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : It's actually Rajeev Lalwani on for Stephen's team. 2 questions, the first, just as it relates to Latin America. We've seen some issues in Puerto Rico and Argentina. How concerned are you that, that could spread to other regions? And then likewise, as you look at the Middle East and Russia and places like that, there's been some more headlines. How can that impact your operations? And then a follow-up. Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Okay, talking about -- I think the situation in Argentina is particular to Argentina. I really don't see that spreading. That was a selective default. I'm sure you followed the court cases in New York. And we have 3,000 megawatts of terrific assets in Argentina. They're cash positive and have very little debt on them. They have about $180 million debt for 3,000 megawatts. So [indiscernible], we'll continue to monitor the situation, but we've had really no effect whatsoever to date. If you look at the case of Puerto Rico, it's a case where you do have the commonwealth, as you know, has been downgraded twice. And the reason I mentioned it in my script, we think we have a very strong operation there because we're selling energy at $0.095 per kilowatt hour to PREPA that would cost it $0.20 for itself to self-generate because these are inefficient oil-fired plants. So we have a good contract. It's in our interest. So we're just highlighting that because we wanted to make sure that we covered all of the things that were potential risks. So I don't see those particular situations spreading. Puerto Rico is very unique. Argentina's guys [ph] is very unique. Chile is a very strong economy. Mexico is doing well, Colombia, these are our main other businesses there. Of course, we've already discussed Brazil. So I don't see any contagion. Now moving to Eastern Europe, we talked about Bulgaria. Bulgaria, is somewhat of a unique case, because it actually has a relatively small foreign debt. And so had -- was not that affected by, for example, contamination from Greece. We have been reducing our position in Eastern Europe. We sold Ukraine, you may remember, about 10 months ago. And we're very happy with that decision. How could Bulgaria be affected? Well, Bulgaria does get its gas from Russia, which comes through the Ukraine. So if there were any cut-off of gas from Russia to the Ukraine, it would affect Bulgaria. And that would make our plant even more valuable because it operates on local lignite. And the other thing I would mention about our plant, it's the only EU 16 environmentally compliant thermal plant in the country. So that this is also an important factor to take into account. Now what we've had basically is a transition from the 2 parties and a lack of a firm government. And in that you had a little -- the regulator came out with some rather unexpected statements, which we are trying to manage. So the issue really has been the liquidity situation of the offtaker NEK. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : And then maybe a question for Tom. In terms of additional asset sales, can you talk about maybe regions you're targeting and the process for looking at where you're going to sell? Thomas M. O'Flynn: Yes. I think consistent with our prior practice, we'd rather not talk about or speculate on things we might do. Keep in mind that some of these businesses are -- obviously have a lot of relationships with people, stake holders, regulators, et cetera, so we'd rather think through something and then announce it rather than creep it out. Andres talked about a $500 million that would be cash back to parent that may be selling entire stakes or selling minority stakes out on the Philippines. Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : What I think is important is that -- what I'm saying today is that we had basically met our target for 2014 and 2015 this year. We're saying that we think there could be another additional $500 million. But that would not necessarily be exiting. That could be bringing on partners. Because what we're really focused on now is optimizing our portfolio, optimizing our position in different businesses. So by bringing in partners, this permits us flexibility to try to achieve that optimal portfolio. Operator : Our next question is from Charles Fishman. Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Following-up that last question about [indiscernible]. I mean just to make sure I understand. Really, you're dealing with a plant there [indiscernible]. It's a low-cost plant under -- environmentally, it's adequate or even more than adequate. There's, to the best of my knowledge, no talk of nationalization of that plant. So it's really just a receivable from a utility that has a [indiscernible] purchase, that has what appears to be a liquidity issue at the moment. Is that a fair assessment? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : I think what you said is fair. One thing I'd say is that our contract in Maritza is not the low cost in the country. Because we had a really state-of-the-art waste disposal facility, which is part of that contract. But you're right in a sense that, really the issue is the liquidity of the offtaker [ph] NEK. NEK sales of energy, it generates us well. Sells energy to the distribution company and also exports energy. Now Bulgaria actually has one of the lowest -- actually has lowest retail tariffs in the EU. So the fact is if the EU rules are enforced, that would retire about 1,000 megawatts in country and make this -- our thermal plant more attractive. And it's also a big employer because again, it uses local lignite. So you're right. I mean the essential problem there really is keeping track of the receivables at NEK and the regulator trying to find various ways to continually to lower retail tariffs. But this has not been [indiscernible] an issue with the government, per se. It's been an issue with the regulator, which is independent of the government. Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : And then second question. [indiscernible], is that a similar technology to Tiet\u00ea? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Yes. But we're thinking about putting in it is -- it's basically our energy storage, which are lithium ion batteries in containers. And what we really have is proprietary algorithms to help with the ancillary services. So we tested it out, we're the world leader in this. And that's exactly right. Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : So it's a lot like Tiet\u00ea? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : It's virtually identical. I mean it's the same containers and it would be used in the same fashion. Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : And then you mentioned the opportunity for energy storage in Asia. Is that technology, or is that [indiscernible] storage or something else? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : It would be exactly the same technology. It works really well in islands where you have sort of isolated grids because you have more instability, especially as you put on more renewables. So we operate on a lot of islands, Hawaii, Northern Ireland, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines, there's a lot of islands. So this is something I spoke to with the President of the Philippines and also his Minister of Energy and Minister of Finance that they're very interested in putting more renewables in, and we could also help that, make it more feasible by putting in the same technology on various of the islands in the Philippines. Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : And I assume now you're -- I don't know if you're quite a year into Tiet\u00ea, but the performance has been good. And that's given you a showcase to illustrate the technology. Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Yes, you're right. The performance has been very good. And it gives us a showcase here in the States. I mean we are also operating larger units in Chile, so those were some of the first units that came out. So I think that the when you have situations like the polar vortex in Ohio, et cetera, it's very good to have a facility like Tiet\u00ea, so I think it's been a great time to showcase its abilities. Operator : Our final question today is from Paul Patterson. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Just to follow-up on Argentina and the -- you guys mentioned that an extreme devaluation might change the outlook or something. Could you just elaborate a little bit more exactly? Sort of what's in guidance, and what your comments -- what that meant? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Ahmed, you want to... Ahmed Pasha : Paul, I mean we have assumed devaluation when we gave our forecast for 5 years outlook. We assumed roughly 20% on average annual depreciation in Argentine pesos, and it was more front-end loaded. But we did assume devaluation when we gave our outlook. And just to give you, in context, anything beyond that 20%, every 10% is roughly $6 million pretax earnings for us. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Then in terms of the DPL assets, there was some discussion, you did touch on the fact that I think FirstEnergy and AEP are looking to have PPAs, sort of for fuel diversity or stability or what have you. I'm just wondering do you see -- are there any opportunities like that for you guys? Is that any part of what your discussion or decision was in terms of retaining these? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : What we have said is that we look favorably on this because we do think that if you had a replay of the polar vortex post-'16 and you retired as many plants as would be slated for retirement, coal plants, you would have a problem in PGM and in Ohio. So we look favorably on something like that, that would help secure the stability of the network. Because again, that's the last -- how do I say, the worst time possible to be short power. And you don't have adequate transmission capacity. So we look favorably upon it, and certainly, we will be following that very closely. And it could apply to DPL's generation as well. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : And then just -- not to beat up on the DPL thing. But is there any potential for a partial sale of assets associated with the Duke joint ownership process that they're going under? Since you guys own some of the same plants, could some of those go with them, or how should we think about that? Or it's just too early to say? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : I'd say it's too early to say. Let's see what happens with their process. What we're interested in is really optimizing the performance of those plants. Operator : I'll now turn the call back to the speakers for closing remarks. Ahmed Pasha : We thank, everybody, for joining us on today's call. As always the IR team will be available to answer any questions you may have. Thank you, and have a nice day. Operator : Thank you, and this does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this call is being recorded today, Thursday, November 6, 2014 at 9 :00 Eastern Time. I would now like to turn the meeting over to your host for today's call, Ahmed Pasha, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Ahmed Pasha : Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to AES' Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. Our earnings release presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom O'Flynn, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our senior management team With that, I will now turn the call over to Andres. Andres? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. Today, I will discuss our current financial outlook and provide an update on the execution of our strategy and plans to create value for our shareholders. Overall, while we are reaffirming our medium to long-term cash and earning projections, we are lowering our near-term guidance as a result of the persistent drought in Latin America and weak foreign currency exchange rates. Despite disappointing short-term expectations, we are executing well against our strategic objectives of reducing our footprint and costs and growing our business platforms profitably. To date, we're ahead of our expectations on asset sales and on track on our cost reductions. Our construction pipeline represents $9 billion in investments and more than 7,000 megawatts of additional capacity and upgrades. And this year, we plan to return up to $480 million to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, the highest amount in AES' history. On this call, I will provide a discussion of our 2014 outlook, an update on macro trends that we're seeing across our portfolio, a review of our accomplishments since our second quarter call in August and my thoughts on capital allocation. Tom will then provide a detailed discussion of our results and guidance. Turning to Slide 4. As I mentioned, 2014 has been a very challenging year for AES with headwinds from poor hydrology and untimely plant outages. At the time of our last call, we expected poor hydrology to have an impact of $0.07 to $0.10 per share on our full year earnings, with an additional negative impact of $0.06 from plant outages. At that time, we expected to offset most of this impact through improved operational performance, accelerated G&A savings and capital allocation, and be able to achieve the low end of our guidance range. However, based on our 9-month performance and our updated outlook for the remainder of the year, we have revised our 2014 guidance to a range of $1.25 to $1.31. This revision reflects our current view of hydrology, which we now expect to have a negative impact of $0.10. The reduction also includes a $0.02 impact from a modestly higher effective tax rate. Now I would like to review some macro trends that we're seeing across our portfolio and provide an update on a few of our businesses, beginning on Slide 5. Poor hydrology in Latin America has had a substantial impact on our earnings over the past 2 years. Although short-term weather conditions are difficult to predict, our numbers are based on a return to normal hydrology in 2015. In Panama, where we have experienced the worst hydrology in the last 50 years, we are encouraged by the higher-than-expected inflows and the recovery in reservoir levels in September and October. In Brazil, reservoir levels are currently at approximately 23%, which is about half the historical average for this time of year, causing elevated spot prices. The rainy season begins at the end of November, so we will have more insight into 2015 at the time of our fourth quarter call in February. We're also seeing a slowdown in global markets that is affecting currencies, interest rates, commodities and GDP growth expectations. While we largely manage market risk through contracts, fuel pass-throughs and hedging strategies, we have some residual exposure to these fluctuations. Relative to the long-term outlook we provided in February, we're now projecting more unfavorable euro and Brazilian real exchange rates and lower GDP growth and higher interest rates in Brazil. In 2017 and '18, the headwinds from foreign currency devaluation and lower GDP growth in Brazil are expected to continue, but are offset by improvements at DP&L, driven by higher dark spreads and revenue. Therefore, net-net, our earnings power remains basically unchanged from our prior expectations. Accordingly, we have lowered our 2015 and 2016 adjusted EPS outlook and we are reaffirming our 2017 and 2018 earnings power, as well as our 10% to 15% cash flow growth for 2015 through 2018. Tom will discuss our guidance and expectations in greater detail in a few minutes. Now I will provide a few business updates beginning on Slide 6. In Bulgaria, a new energy regulator was appointed in September, and a 10% increase in the end user electricity tariff was announced soon after. This tariff increase is a step towards improving the liquidity of Maritza's offtaker, NEK. Furthermore, we have been reassured by the regulator that our capacity is critical to the Bulgarian electric system and will remain an important part of their energy mix. In October, elections were held and we are awaiting the formation of a new government before resuming meaningful conversations on the outstanding issues. Turning to Slide 7. As you may have seen in the press recently, the coal allocation for most private companies, including our 1,320 megawatt OPGC II project, currently under construction, were canceled by the Supreme Court of India. Although there is no clear resolution at this point, with or without a direct coal allocation, we believe that OPGC II is still an attractive growth project for us. The plant is located in the state of Odisha, which has the second largest coal reserves in India. And we currently operate OPGC I adjacent to the site of OPGC II that utilizes coal supplied by Coal India. We are working on multiple options to optimize the coal supply to OPGC II and deliver much needed electricity in India once the plant is operational by 2018. Next, turning to Slide 8. In our accomplishments since our second quarter call in August. With 3 new transactions, we have made continued progress towards reducing the complexity of our portfolio and expanding our access to capital. We announced the sale of 100% of our interest in assets in Turkey. We also closed the sale of our operating wind projects in the United Kingdom and we brought in a strong local partner for our business in the Dominican Republic with the sell down of 8% of our position. These transactions represent a total of $382 million in equity proceeds to AES, which translates into 13x 2015 earnings. With these proceeds, we are 76% of the way towards the goal we announced this year of realizing $500 million in asset sale proceeds by December 2015. As a reminder, since September 2011, we have announced a total of $2.4 billion in asset sale proceeds to AES and announced our exit from 9 countries. This quarter, we have also achieved a number of substantial milestones on key platform expansions. As you can see on Slide 9, we have more than 7,000 megawatts under construction, the largest construction pipeline in AES' history. The total investment in these projects is $9 billion, of which our equity portion is $1.5 billion and $1.1 billion has already been funded. Our projected ROE on those projects is greater than 15%. Although our current earnings do not reflect any return from these investments other than at IPL, these projects will be contributing roughly $0.30 of adjusted EPS and more than $200 million in dividends to the parent on an annual basis once they have all come online by the end of 2018. Since our second quarter earnings call in August, we closed financing and broke around on 2 additional projects. Turning to Slide 10. In the Dominican Republic, we are closing the cycle at our DPP plant, which will increase output by 122 megawatts to 358 megawatts, without using any additional fuel. We are funding 100% of this project with available debt capacity in the Dominican Republic through $260 million in nonrecourse debt, including participation by the IFC. This project is fully contracted and is expected to come online early in 2017. Turning to Slide 11. In Panama, we recently acquired a 72 megawatt fuel oil-fired power barge and signed a 5-year PPA with a state-owned generation company for its capacity. The barge will be online early next year and modestly diversifies our portfolio in Panama away from hydro. In the U.S., we achieved important milestones on 2 development projects with a total project cost of $2.2 billion, which will likely be funded with a combination of debt, partner equity and AES equity. Turning to Slide 12. In California, where we currently own and operate almost 4,000 megawatts of gas-fired capacity, we were recently awarded a new 20-year Power Purchase Agreement by Southern California Edison. We will build and operate a 1,284 megawatts of combined cycle, gas-fired generation and 100 megawatts of battery-based energy storage to replace older capacity in the western Los Angeles Basin. I'm particularly excited about the energy storage award. And this is the first time this technology has successfully competed against traditional peaking capacity to win a long-term PPA. The award of these PPAs is a recognition of our ability to deliver innovative power solutions through a combination of our expertise and a locational advantage of our existing power plant sites. As our largest growth investment in the United States, this new capacity in California sets a solid foundation for continued earnings and cash flow contribution from Southland for years to come. Turning to Slide 13. In Indiana, IPL continues to grow by modernizing its fleet and is seeking approval from the regulator for a $332 million investment to comply with wastewater regulations and to convert our Harding Street Station from coal to natural gas. If approved, the majority of this investment will begin earning regulated returns during construction. When combined with the $1 billion investment in projects currently under construction at IPL, these projects represent an increase in rate base of 70%. Finally, before I turn the call over to Tom, I want to share my thoughts on capital allocation. Moving on to Slide 14. I would like to review the significant progress we have made towards enhancing long-term shareholder value through our strategy of disciplined capital allocation, which we outlined in late 2011. Since then, we've invested $1.6 billion to reduce or refinance debt, which has helped us lower our corporate debt by 20% and our interest expense by $140 million annually. We've also returned $1.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In fact, since 2011, we have lowered our share count by 9% by repurchasing 72 million shares at an average price of $12.43. Furthermore, we have selectively invested $831 million, primarily in growth projects. As I mentioned earlier, these platform expansions, projects, will represent an important component of our earnings and cash flow growth going forward. Turning to Slide 15. We expect to have substantial excess capital available to us going forward. Our diversified portfolio generates strong parent free cash flow, which is projected to grow at 10% to 15% annually on average through 2018, providing us with the wherewithal to fund growth projects across our key markets and deliver strong returns to shareholders. Additional asset sales proceeds, including bringing in partners would increase our available discretionary cash. But even without assuming any additional asset sales, we believe that available discretionary cash could total approximately $3 billion from 2015 through 2018. Approximately $400 million of this will be required to fund our remaining equity commitment for projects currently under construction. A minimum of $580 million will be used for dividend. That is the amount we would pay if we assume we hold dividends constant at the current level of $145 million annually. Considering the amount of parent debt that we've already prepaid, we believe that additional meaningful debt repayments aren't necessary for the next few years. The remaining $1.9 billion is therefore available for investment at attractive growth projects and returning cash to shareholders through buybacks and/or dividend increases. After dividend growth, which I will discuss in a moment, our other 2 alternatives for investment of our discretionary cash are growth projects and share repurchases. First, we have a strong pipeline of growth opportunities, including the IPL upgrades and Southland repowering, I just discussed, as well as additional platform expansions such as Masinloc 2, Mong Duong 3 and energy storage. Of course, as we have demonstrated, we are likely to bring in equity partners from many of these growth projects to optimize our returns and market exposures. Second, we view share repurchases as the benchmark against which all other investment decisions are measured. And as such, they remain a key part of our capital allocation. Although some of the macro factors that I have discussed this morning are having an impact on our near-term earnings and cash flow. Our portfolio continues to generate strong and growing cash flow, which we will continue to invest to create value for shareholders. Our board has increased our repurchase authorization to $150 million. In the past, we have indicated that we will be opportunistic with respect to the timing of buybacks. This time, we intend to use the majority of this authorization by the end of this year. Turning to Slide 16. With respect to the dividend, I appreciate that the current level of $0.20 per share or $145 million is relatively low, given our strong cash flow. We believe there is room to grow the dividend, particularly since our current payout ratio is at the lower end of our 30% to 40% of sustainable parent free cash flow, and we see robust 10% to 15% annual growth in our parent free cash flow. As you know, we typically review the dividend with our board in December. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom. Thomas M. O'Flynn: Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. While we're disappointed that macro factors, higher working capital requirements and increased receivables have delayed our growth in near-term earnings and cash flow projections, our long-term outlook has not changed. In an effort to remain as transparent as possible, we are providing our 2015 guidance and longer-term expectations today, a quarter earlier than our normal practice. I'll go with the details after discussion of our third quarter results. Turning to Slide 18. Our third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.37 compared to $0.39 in the third quarter last year. Four of our strategic business units experienced strong adjusted PTC growth, driven by higher revenue and gross margin. However, these gains were offset by lower contributions from Brazil, largely due to poor hydrology and the plant outage at Masinloc in the Philippines in July, resulting in overall decline in our earnings for the quarter of $0.02. Our results also reflect a $0.01 impact from the sale of a minority interest in Masinloc, which was largely offset by the benefits of capital allocation. We also benefited from a slightly lower tax rate during the quarter. Before I go over our businesses in more detail, I'd like to comment on the $0.02 negative impact during the quarter from low hydrology on Slide 19. Our generation business in Brazil, Tiet\u00ea, saw a $0.04 impact from hydro. The system inflows were lower relative to last year resulting in higher spot prices impacting Tiet\u00ea who's had to cover part of the contract position in the open market. As we discussed on our last call, Tiet\u00ea was net long in the first half of the year and short in the second half. Consequently, although their margins benefited in the first half, Tiet\u00ea is now covering some of its contract position in the spot market. In Panama, where hydro is now improving, we had a $0.01 adverse impact from hydrology. This represents a $0.02 improvement over last year. Partially offsetting Brazil and Panama was a $0.03 benefit from hydro at Chivor in Colombia, where our facility had stronger inflows versus the rest of the country, allowing us to benefit from short-term sales at attractive prices. This brings our overall year-to-date hydro impact to $0.06, and we now expect the full year impact to be $0.10 a share versus $0.13 last year. Turning to Slide 20, I'll discuss each of our SBUs, focusing on adjusted PTC or PTC. In the U.S., we reported an increase of $24 million in PTC. This was largely driven by higher non-bypassable revenues at DPL, which were approved late last year and contributions from our wind businesses. In our Andes SBU, PTC increased $11 million, driven largely by higher volumes and prices in Colombia due to the hydrology I just covered. Next in Brazil, PTC decreased $84 million for the quarter. This includes about $50 million at Tiet\u00ea, largely due to poor hydrology as I just discussed. Additionally, our utilities experienced higher costs, primarily related to storms at Sul. Moving to MCAC. PTC increased $28 million, primarily driven by higher rates and lower fuel costs in the Dominican Republic. We also saw an improvement in Panama as a result of the actions we've taken to reduce the impact of poor hydrology. Turning to EMEA on Slide 21. PTC increased $13 million, largely driven by higher availability at Maritza in Bulgaria and contributions from our IPP4 Jordan plant, which came online in July. Finally, in Asia, PTC declined by $28 million. As you may recall, our second quarter results this year were affected by an outage at Masinloc in the Philippines, which continued into July. Further, the results reflect the sale of 45% of our stake in Masinloc, which was completed during the quarter. To summarize this quarter, after corporate costs, we earned $354 million in adjusted pretax earnings and $0.30 adjusted EPS. As you can see on Slide 22, we are revising our 2014 adjusted PTC modeling ranges to reflect the same drivers as our revised adjusted EPS guidance, Andres just discussed. We provided new PTC modeling ranges by SBU in the appendix of today's slide deck as well. Year-to-date we've earned $937 million in adjusted PTC, which is 71% of the midpoint of our revised PTC range. After taking into account a 1% increase in our expected tax rate, which is now expected to be 31% to 33%, we're forecasting full year adjusted EPS of $1.25 to $1.31, with $0.89 already earned year-to-date. We expect higher earnings in the fourth quarter relative to $0.29 earned last year. Our fourth quarter 2013 results included the $0.04 provision we booked for potential customer refunds at Eletropaulo in Brazil. Further, our fourth quarter '14 results will benefit from improved operations in Chile and at IPL in the U.S., lower G&A and lower parent interest. Now to cash flow on Slide 23. We generated $427 million of proportional free cash flow in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date proportional free cash flow to $604 million versus $923 million in the first 9 months of last year. With our year-to-date performance and factoring in the impacts from working capital requirements in Brazil, Bulgaria and Chile, we now expect full year 2014 proportional free cash flow of $900 million to $1 billion. Year-to-date, we've achieved 60% of the midpoint of our revised guidance range and we now expect about $300 million to $400 million of proportional free cash flow during the fourth quarter, which is in line with the $349 million generated in the fourth quarter last year. Now to Slide 24 in our capital allocation plan for the year. Starting on the left, we project roughly $1.7 billion of discretionary cash, this includes about $1 billion of cash from announced asset sales except Turkey, which we expect to receive next year. I'd like to highlight that although we're lowering our proportional free cash flow guidance for the year, we still expect to generate $500 million of parent free cash flow. Turning to uses on the right-hand side. We've allocated about $330 million this year for a portion of our equity commitments to investments in subsidiaries, primarily for platform expansion projects under construction. So far in '14, we've used roughly $500 million for debt reduction and refinancing, and expect to use about $100 million more during the remainder of the year. Approximately half of this prepayment is to maintain credit neutrality following asset sales, while the remaining amount is discretionary in an effort to accelerate our credit metric improvement and reduce financial risk, consistent with our previously stated balanced capital allocation strategy. In terms of returning cash to shareholders. On the last call, we outlined our plan to return at least $300 million to shareholders this year. With $182 million of share repurchases so far, plus our annual dividend of $145 million, we're already returning $327 million to shareholders in 2014. Further, as Andres mentioned, we expect to invest another $150 million in our stock, largely by year end, which will bring total cash returned to shareholders in 2014 of up to above $475 million. After target closing cash balance of $100 million, we're projecting roughly $200 million of unallocated cash remaining at the end of 2014. For simplicity, we've assumed that this cash is carried over into '15. Of course, we may use some of that before year end. Now to Slide 25. I'd like to provide some insight into our plans for capital allocation for 2015. We expect parent free cash flow of roughly $525 million and $125 million in proceeds from the sale of our businesses in Turkey. Together with about $300 million of unallocated cash carryover from '14, this would put our total discretionary cash at about $1 billion in 2015. At this point, we expect to use this cash to fund roughly $200 million in equity commitments in our projects currently under construction as well as make dividends of $145 million at the current rate. This would leave us with about $550 million of unallocated cash in 2015, without assuming any additional asset sales. We'll continue to require new growth investments to compete against share repurchases. We have ample capacity to also increase the dividend. Now to Slide 26. Last February, we provided an initial outlook on earnings growth for 2015 through 2018. And today, I'd like to provide an update on those expectations. We've seen a stronger U.S. dollar, which has affected us mainly in Brazil and Europe. Further in Brazil, we've lowered our GDP growth expectations and we're experiencing higher interest rates. The impact from these macro factors is about $0.05 per year in 2015 and '16. Accordingly, we've lowered our 2015 and '16 expectations and are introducing a 2015 guidance range of $1.30 to $1.40 per share. We expect flat to modest growth in 2016 consistent with our prior expectations although from a lower earnings base. However, the level of earnings power that we now expect for 2017 and 2018 remains unchanged with the macro headwinds I just discussed continuing through '17 and '18, but are offset by some improvements, largely at DPL. We continue to expect that our projects under construction will drive our earnings growth, which is now 8% to 10% off the lower 2016 base. Turning to Slide 27. Although we include a modest contingency in our estimates, key assumptions in our 2015 guidance include : first, a return to normal hydrology in 2015; second, currency and commodity forward curves as of mid-October of this year. As always, we're providing sensitivities in the appendix of today's deck. Finally, a 31% to 33% effective tax rate, which assumes that the CFC look-through rule is extended. We believe the Congress will extend the CFC look-through later this year. However, if it is not extended, the impact on 2015 earnings could be a negative $0.06, after considering mitigating actions we're currently pursuing. And this impact would be, of course, noncash, given we have nearly $3 billion of NOLs outstanding. Further, if the CFC look-through rule is not extended, we'll continue to pursue actions to mitigate the impact as we've done in the past. Shifting to cash flow on Slide 28. Despite the reduction in our near-term earnings expectations, we're maintaining our cash flow outlook for 2018. We continue to expect 10% to 15% average annual growth in our proportional free cash flow as well as in our parent free cash flow. In 2015, our expectation is for between $1 billion and $1.35 billion in proportional free cash flow. This range implies an increase of roughly $225 million over the midpoint of our 2014 revised guidance. Approximately half of this increase is expected from the recovery of working capital, mostly from our utilities in Brazil and in Gener. The remaining amount is expected from improved availability at DPL and improved hydrology in Latin America. We continue to believe proportional free cash flow is one of our key value drivers with a strong double-digit growth over the longer term. We'll continue to show the value of our cash flow through disciplined capital allocation that maximizes risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. With that, I'll now turn it back to Andres. Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Thanks, Tom. To summarize, despite lowering our near-term expectations, we're executing our strategic objectives, including narrowing our geographic focus and reducing costs while expanding our platforms in a profitable manner. We are ahead of our expectations on asset sales and on track for cost reductions. Our construction pipeline represents $9 billion in total project cost or 7,141 megawatts of additional capacity in upgrades, which is the largest amount in AES' 33-year history. This year, we expect to return up to $480 million to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, and we believe that we will have significant capacity to return cash to shareholders in the future. With that, we look forward to seeing many of you at the EEI financial conference in Dallas next week. And now, I'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ali Agha of SunTrust. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : Andres, I guess my first question to you -- you mentioned that the board will look at the dividend in December and you currently have this 30% to 40% payout ratio on your free cash flow. And the consistent message that you've given us is that your cash flow growth profile for the next several years far exceeds your earnings profile. Is there any thought by management to revisit the payout ratio and perhaps rebate the dividend on a higher payout ratio? Also, given the conditions and the fact that the market certainly in today's environment is more supportive of higher-yielding securities and your higher free cash flow story would resonate more with investors if you were able to demonstrate to us a higher payout ratio. Any thought on that? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : That's a very good observation, Ali. I think that today, we're at about 29% payout ratio, 29% payout [ph]. We have said that our policy is a payout ratio between 30% and 40%. So we are -- at this stage, what I would say is we want to maintain ourselves in that ratio, and that's what we will be discussing. But I think you raise a good issue and we will have the opportunity to look at that in the future. But right now, what I'd say is we want to be within the 30% to 40%. And currently, we're below that at about 29%. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : I understand that and we will discuss this more perhaps at EEI. My second question for you is with regards to the earnings profile that you laid out for us and, obviously, the previous 4% to 6% guidance growth through '16 no longer is valid, given the new numbers. And so I guess a 2-part question. One, the $0.05 of macro headwinds that are incremental. I'm surprised given the size of your portfolio, that there weren't other offsetting factors that you could come up with, whether it's cost reductions or perhaps even more aggressive buybacks and capital allocation to offset that because $0.05 in the scheme of things is not that big of a number. I guess that's part one. And part 2, the normal hydrology that you have assumed for '15, how confident are you, given that, as you mentioned, the Brazilian rainy season hasn't even started yet and might we be looking at another potential reduction to the '15 numbers? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Okay, Ali. Let's take it by parts. In terms of the first one, the cost reductions. We're aggressively pursuing cost reductions. As we've stated, now we're moving from G&A to fixed costs in our business and we have an addressable spend of around $3 billion that we're going after. And we're working hard on this. Now it does take some time because this is -- we have 38,000 megawatts under our management. And this requires standardization, this requires testing, this requires aggregations. So that's well underway and I think that Andy and the team are doing a great job there, but that does take some time. But we certainly are pulling all levers to meet our commitment. I can assure you of that. But on the other hand, we want to make sure that everything we do is really creating a sustainable long-term shareholder value. So we're not going to make cuts that could, say, harm the value of this company going forward. I assure you, we are pulling all levers, and I think we've demonstrated we're quite good at that. I think we have a good track record in terms of that. The second in terms -- question regarding hydrology. I would say, break it into parts. We've had this unusual event that the hydrology was correlated negatively, quite frankly, everywhere, for the prior 2 years. Now even with the $0.10 negative impact, this is $0.03 less than it was in 2013. So we have improved. Part of it is some of the actions that we've taken on commercial policy, that we've taken with regards to Panama. Now we are seeing differences. In Panama, as I mentioned, we're actually seeing very good inflows into the reservoirs in September, October and carrying over to the first week here in November. So in Panama, we are seeing a recovery of the hydro. The question really is a little bit, some transmission constraints. But in terms of the physical rainfall in Panama, we've seen a significant recovery. In the case of Colombia, Chivor is in a different watershed than a lot of the country's hydro, and so it's actually done quite well, as Tom mentioned, because it's had a better relative rainfall than the rest of the country. So in Colombia -- in Panama, we see things better. In Brazil, it's still too early to tell. We got this question a lot, whether -- the situation in Brazil regarding 2014 at the beginning of the year. At that time, we said that we did not see rationing as the most likely scenario, that it was not likely to occur this year. All the studies I have seen for 2015 indicates that rationing is possible, but it's not the most likely scenario at this point. And as I mentioned in the past, if we compare this to 2001, the Brazilian government has about 10 gigawatts of thermal capacity and is executing quite well in terms of using the water, let's say, holding back on the water and using hydro. Now this will depend -- quite frankly, we really have no way of predicting when the rains will come at the end of November, beginning of December and they run through April, and that's what we'll have to see what happens at that time and how they handle it. Now there are different scenarios. It obviously would depend on the degree of -- if there were to be any rationing, the degree of it; the degree of compensations and what would be the price cap. So we'll give you information on the Q4 update when we have a better view. But it's difficult to predict whether in the short-term and what we monitor very closely are the reservoir levels and the actions that the government is taking to comply with it. And also quite frankly, it's a question of demand as well. It will be a question of how hot it is in the fourth quarter in Brazil, first quarter in Brazil and the economic recovery as well. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : My last question. In your capital allocation for 2014, as -- Tom, as you mentioned, there's still about $200 million that you kind of unallocated and maybe even assume it sticks around till the year end. Any reason why you didn't add that to the $150 million of buyback that you've indicated to us? Or is it possible that some or all of that $200 million is added on to the $150 million of buyback by year end? Thomas M. O'Flynn: Ali, I think it's -- I think I thought with the $150 million was to put out a number that we thought we could execute the majority of it by year end and it's step-by-step. I think we've shown that we put out more modest-size amounts, we execute on them and then we think about the next steps going forward. Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Yes, Ali, I think what's important here -- I think we've shown that we really do compete new investments against buybacks and we've always been able to get the authorizations that we need to do more buybacks. But as Tom said, we think this is the correct amount for this year. And also in terms of the total return to shareholders of this year, it will be a new record for AES. So we feel that we've made the right capital allocation decisions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : I wanted to revisit your Ohio generation assets, just given we've seen some potentially favorable developments there. Has that at all altered your appetite for considering monetizing some or all of those assets? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : What I would say is that, at this stage, we're happy with our decision. As you remember, we ran a sales process. We didn't think the price was right. I think that the market has moved in a favorable direction since then. So we feel that we made the correct decision in holding on to them and we're -- there's a number of things which could occur in the PJM and in Ohio, specifically, that could even improve the value further. So what I'd say at this stage, we're happy with our decision to hold that we made this year. Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Understood. But you're not necessarily wedded to that decision in the long-term if conditions changed and value were to change for those assets? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Well, again, we tend to think in terms of the medium term with our assets. In terms of the value we can create. We are talking about costs and synergies. You need to be able to plan into the medium term, and I think we also think about this in terms of our portfolio. One of the things we've done is bringing partners to reduce our exposure to certain risks, to increase, quite frankly, our capacity to do bigger projects. So we will always figure into that mix. But we also do portfolio fine-tuning. So I wouldn't exclude it, but what I'm saying is that what we are doing now is really trying to optimize our portfolio by bringing in partners and really looking at the mix of assets we have that give us really the best risk-adjusted return. Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay, understood. And then just shifting over to the California contracts. Would it be possible for you to give us a sense of the aggregate EBITDA that's associated with these contracts? Thomas M. O'Flynn: Stephen, it's Tom. I'd say it's tough. It's obviously, fresh off the presses. So we've been through a pretty rigorous competitive situation, so I think we may, at some point, but I think it's a little too early for that. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Turnure of JPMorgan. Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Sticking on the theme of the SoCal Ed contracts that were announced yesterday. Could you kind of walk us through the long-term plan there? I know you have at least another gigawatt of potential capacity that you can kind of repower there. What are you thinking about that? What are you thinking about the 500 or so that you could just sell for other uses right now to redevelop that property? And how does all of this, including yesterday's contracts kind of fit into the idea that you are losing EBITDA, I guess at the end of 2018, because the existing contracts will go off? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Yes. I think this is a good point. We have like, 4,000 megawatts. This is a very important step in terms of getting about 1,300 megawatts under a PPA in California. And we are looking at -- the main site is Huntington Beach. We also have Alamitos and we will be looking at what to do with the other sites. I think what's important here is the 100 megawatts of energy storage that we mentioned. And in the energy storage space, they often talk about resource that can be positive and negative. So this is 200 megawatts of resource, which is equivalent to the 100% of what we all have done to date. So that -- again, getting to your question here, Southern California is important to us. We'll be looking at getting the maximum value out of these sites. Our locational advantage is very important. We're very happy to have won this contract. And yes, we'll continue to focus on it. But at this time, what I'd say is you're correct. These new PPAs start in 2020 and we have to make sure that we have sufficient total presence there to offset everything that we'd be retiring. Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay, great. And then switching gears to the Dominican Republic. You guys sold that small stake of the assets there. Kind of, can you speak to the future of that business? What you were thinking in terms of the sale price there, the multiple that you got on valuation? And was it kind of more of a price motive? Or was it a strategic motive that drove you to make that decision? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Yes, that's a good question. It was definitely a strategic motive. We've been doing very well in the Dominican Republic. There are really only 2 modern regasification facilities in the Caribbean, and this is one of them. The other one is in Puerto Rico. So this business has done well. As you know, we are selling compressed gas to third parties for vehicles and for other industrial purposes on the island. And this is very solid business. The gas that we bring in is at Henry Hub base. So what we saw here is that there's a potential to do more in the Dominican Republic, but we thought it was very important to have, say, a deeper relationship with the country and that's why we wanted to have local participation in our projects. So we are expanding, as you see, with DPP, that's a very efficient project where we're closing the cycle. We won't be, of course, burning any more fuel, but we'll get 122 more megawatts. So it really was a strategic motive. Now in terms of the big business, what do we see there? We see there is still upside potential from our regasification and storage facility there, and we could see that in the future having a little bit sort of hub and spoke system from the Dominican Republic. Now, of course, this -- we would have -- our business is the large business. It's the holding facility, so others could come and use our facility. But we see upside potential in the Dominican Republic from the very strong base that we have in gas. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : So first, turning back to the Southern California for a quick second. Can you talk about sort of the net EPS change after the contracts roll off or the existing contracts roll off into the next round with the 3 assets that you got locked in? And what that 2019 interim period might look like as well? Thomas M. O'Flynn: Yes, Julien, it's Tom. I think we may give a little bit of color, but as I said to Stephen, it's a little -- still early just given it is really hot off the presses. We have just been through a -- quite a lengthy competitor process. So it's a little early for us to be putting out detailed numbers. Ahmed Pasha : Yes, Julien, just to give you a big picture. This is Ahmed. In terms of the uptick -- I mean, just comparing these current existing capacity against what we've just have been awarded, the 1,300, 1,400 megawatts. Just these megawatts will be contributing higher EBITDA earnings than what we are projecting today from existing capacity in 2017. On the top of that, there is another capacity, about 1,000 megawatts, that we have already permitted, that will add even more. So I think the short answer to your question is, it is accretive comparing the existing generation versus what we can do on our existing sites. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Right. Absolutely, very clear. And just in terms of capital allocation around the SCE assets. Can you just elaborate a little bit more what the thought process is around equity? And broadly funding it, if you will, just from a timeline perspective? Thomas M. O'Flynn: Sure. Once again, it's early, but I think if you take a $1.9 million, $2 billion number, we think these are very leverageable and consistent with our financing process. We do debt for certainly a strong majority, maybe call it 60% -- probably more likely 70%. So that will leave about 30% equity commitments. And we will -- as Andres said, we'll strongly look to bring in a partner that could help us leverage ourselves further and manage our commitments and also potentially enhance our return. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Right. Let me -- perhaps I may be a little clearer, also. What is your thought process around YieldCo selldowns? And just broadly speaking, your ownership of this versus perhaps, in someone else's hands who might value this at a different level? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : We've had a lot of discussions in the past about YieldCo. I'm saying we have nothing philosophically against them. We really haven't seen that we could at this stage of the game sort of carve out assets that would make sense because we -- lot of our PPAs in the U.S. and other markets are highly levered and have a lot of nonrecourse debt on them. So again, at this stage of the game, it's a little early. But again, we don't have anything philosophically against something like a YieldCo. And in fact, we have done, what we've done at Gener and what we've done at some of the other ones. But if you're saying sort of spin it off to somebody else for them to do YieldCo -- that's not sort of in the cards. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Got you. All right. And then just -- let me just clarify little bit of what your response on prior question was. When you assume normal hydrology in 2015, that's a transition to normal hydrology, I imagine, right? And to the extent to which that it would be a transition, is there an incremental benefit as you think about this going from '15 to '16 or even '17, right? I mean, how much of a multiyear process is this in normalization? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : It's going to be a -- I mean, it's going to be a benefit. As you become normal -- I think what we mean by normal has to do -- within, let's say, one standard deviation in terms of getting it back on track and we really had sort of 2 outlier years. So I guess the -- if I understand your question, what we're saying is that we're not predicting a continuation of the sort of drought conditions and we're not using in our numbers any sort of rationing in the case of Brazil. And what we're seeing in Panama and Colombia is a return to, say, normal hydrology. I don't know, Tom, you want to add something? Thomas M. O'Flynn: Yes, I just say, Julien, in terms of transitioning into '16, we'll certainly -- once our contract, long-term contract, Eletropaulo, ends at the end of '15, we have the ability to manage our hydro risk through hedging ratios. So we've shown in the past we're kind of in the low 80s in terms of percentage of our shared energy that we have sold for '16. We'll certainly -- we may creep up somewhat, but we will be certainly at lower levels to provide ourselves the comfort that if there is poor hydrology in '16, we have set ourselves up so we don't have hydro risk. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Right. And then lastly, could you elaborate a little bit on the legislative changes you need for the end of this year around the tax extenders? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : The CFC look-through rules -- I mean, those have -- in the past, they've been, say, renewed -- at sort of the 12th hour at the end of the year as part of larger packages. So everything that we're seeing is, we feel that it's very, very likely that they'll be extended this year once again, as part of an extender package at the end of the year. So as Tom said that -- because of this year, we -- the impact would be minimal. And in '15, there could be more of an impact, but we'll also take measures as we have in the past should it not be extended. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : And I apologize if this is a naive question. Tipper [ph], CFC tipper [ph] -- is that all related? I know we used to talk about that, but just want to bring it up. Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : The answer is yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Orrill of Barclays. Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Just 2 quick follow-ups or clarifications. On the look-through provision, just to clarify. Is that a new view that you've had as a result of some changes in Congress? Or was it your expectation all along that, that would be extended? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : No. I mean, this is not a change -- this has always been our view all along. I would like to emphasize that even in the unlikely case that we're not extended, this is not cash, as Tom mentioned. I mean, we have $3 billion of NOLs. So yes, this would affect our adjusted EPS, but not our cash. Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Got it. And then I think you commented that '17, '18, you've got some offsets that you put in place to help you. DPL, I think is one of them that you called out and -- so just curious as to what that is specifically. Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Gregg, the DPL improvement would be a combination of darks as well as some value for the PJM premium capacity product. We're obviously watching that closely, still some moving parts in that, but we believe that if gets implemented in something near its current form that could be some good value for us also. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Chin of Merrill Lynch. Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but on the California contracts, can you give a breakdown of that $1.9 billion between the CCGT and the energy storage assets? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : I think, let us get back to you on that one. Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : The vast bulk of it is in CCGT. Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Right. That's what I would have assumed, but just to get a little bit more color on that would be helpful. And if anything, I can follow-up with you at EEI. Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : That's fine, Brian. We just want to make sure we're disclosing things that are consistent with the provisions of our bid process. Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Understood. Secondly, you mentioned in one of the earlier slides that Supreme Court of India decision on OPGC and the coal allocations. Could you just give a little bit more color on what exactly happened there and why did it happen the way it did? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Sure. Going back some time, I guess, about -- probably about 2 years ago, it started with an issue with the coal allocation, then there was a scandal in India called Coalgate. And really it was that people had received coal allocations and then flipped them for significant gains. So that, let's say, started the issue. We weren't, quite frankly, involved at all of this because we had received our allocation and our partner is the state government of Odisha. So we had our coal allocation and we were proceeding with the project. Then the Supreme Court did something that, which they had done in telecom spectrum, which was, really, to say that all prior allocations were invalid because the process was not, say, sufficiently transparent. And this was very politically successful in India. So really what they did was come out with a very similar decision regarding coal, basically saying that the coal allocation process was flawed and, therefore, the allocations were null and void. And this covered people from, who actually were currently operating plants, to people like ourselves who had future plans. It covered state governments. It covered JVs like us and it covered private companies. Then the decision actually came out that said, it did not apply to federal companies, but it includes state companies. Then subsequently, they came out with a decree saying that state government companies' allocations were also valid. So in our case, we're in sort of the gray zone because we're a JV and it's a state government of Odisha. So the good thing is we have been -- of this whole process, we've been extremely transparent and we think that the state government may get the coal allocation. From perspective of an investor in AES, even if we don't get the coal allocation -- we'd prefer it. It does help modestly on the returns and it helps us to assure the quality of the coal that we would be receiving. But even if it doesn't go forward, this is still a good project because this is located right next to OPGC I, and we have all the line permits for developing a -- and it's under construction, a 1,300 megawatt coal plant. So if it's a question of receiving coal from Coal India, as we currently do for the existing plant, again, it's still a good project. But we will of course prefer to have this -- more control over it with the coal allocation. So it's not a positive, but it's not something that, say, threatens the viability of the project. Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : I guess one follow-up question on this. With that decision causing a reallocation of coal, have coal prices in India been jumping up as different parties try to sign or renegotiate contracts? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : No. And it has not. Basically, what's happened is they have granted a temporary license to those who've had coal allocations that were operating and the rest were very much future projects. But I think people expect the coal to be used one way or another. So in essence, Odisha, our OPGC II project is pretty close to sort of a mine mouth type project. So it's very well situated. There's a shortage and we have a good contract for the offtake. So it's caused more noise, we think, than anything. Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : That's very helpful. And then one last question for me. I realize I've asked a few here. You guys gave out '15 and '16 guidance a quarter earlier than expected. And one of the factors that drove that decision was some of the volatility in macro factors. Could you give us a sense of how much you're hedged with regards to currency exposure in '15 and '16? Thomas M. O'Flynn: Yes. We've got some sensitivities in the back, Brian, of our deck. But we generally hedge about 6 to 12 months forward in Brazil and about a year forward in other currencies. So, yes, some exposure in '15, a little the more in '16, but there's a page in the back of the deck. Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : If you're referring to Slide 49, that's '15. How should we think about those sensitivities in '16? Maybe like 25%, 30% more sensitivity in '16? Ahmed Pasha : No, I think -- Brian, this is Ahmed. I think you should look at it because that's why we provided it on open basis. So even if you assume it's all open, so it's $0.04 versus $0.035. So it's not as significant. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski of Macquarie. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research : I had a bigger picture question. So you operate in the industry that is valued based on earnings. You have a very complex portfolio. Every time, there are factors you clearly cannot control and they're moving earnings around. Now the cash flow generation of your business is undeniable and you keep trading at a higher and higher cash flow. I mean, why not just use the cash that you are getting from asset divestitures and from your operating assets to buy back stock in very large quantities and thus, help the -- your share price? I mean, it's hard for me to believe that the investment of the cash that you're getting in any asset would actually render higher returns than actually buying back the stock. Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : We have bought back, as we said, by the end of this year, close to $1 billion. And we think at a good price and we have sold down, I think, very well. I mean, if you actually look at our selldowns that we've done, our timing was very good in terms of when we disposed of the assets. So you raise a valid point, and we do look at that very closely. If you do -- our new projects do have ROEs that are higher than buying back our stocks. Now, there is a time inconsistency because the effect of buying back our stock today is much -- of course, is immediate versus having to invest 3 to 4 years. But we do look at that, Angie. And that's a very good question and we have to keep ourselves to that standard. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research : Simply put, even if you really reinvest the money at the return that you're saying, and you really get to that eventual 8% growth in earnings, given the data that is associated with that growth, I don't think that you will ever be fully paid a high multiple for that growth, right? As opposed to the free cash flow yield that the stock currently generates and the cash that could be used to really significantly reduce the share count? I mean, it's -- I know that you're trying to maximize the shareholder value, but it's really hard to believe that a buyback at this level wouldn't be more value-creating than any investment at 15%-plus ROE. Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Well, we do look at it. We do sort of NPVs on this, but we can discuss that more off-line. I think it's a very good question that you raise and we do look at sort of the big pictures. And we know we will be generating more cash, faster cash growth for fundamental reasons. One is that we do have the NOLs and our tax rate has gone up from 2013 to today by 10 points. So that's a big jump. But it doesn't have any impact on us. The other one is Mong Duong and other -- some of our projects will be generating a lot more cash, but we have to even out the earnings, due to the accounting rules. But I would say that the -- what is important, and that's why we stressed it on this call. If you look at us, we've had significant jumps in our revenues and in our earnings. We have to have new assets come online because we have them contracted. And if you look at this year, 2014, we only have -- we have less than 300 megawatts coming online. If you look at next year, it's much, much higher. And you look at the next year. So when we talk about this growth, it is occurring from tangible projects that we have on hand. But thanks for the question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman of Morningstar. Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Did you guys want to take one more question? I thought you weren't. Ahmed Pasha : Sorry, Charles, can we -- you can call me on my landline. Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : I'll tell you what, I'll save it for EEI. Ahmed Pasha : Okay, that sounds better. Okay. Good. We thank everybody for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any questions you may have. Thanks and have a nice day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Shaughnessy - Massachusetts Financial Services Company Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI, Research Division Insoo Kim - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division Operator : Good morning. My name is Sean, I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the AES Corporation's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Financial Review Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Ahmed Pasha, you may begin your conference. Ahmed Pasha : Thank you, Sean. Good morning, and welcome to our Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Earnings Call. Our earnings release presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom O'Flynn, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will now turn the call over to. Andres. Andres? Andr\u00e9s Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings call. Today I will, first, review our 2014 results; second, discuss the current macroeconomic environment and how it will affect our 2015 guidance; third, provide an update on the execution of our strategy to date; fourth, share my thoughts on capital allocation; and fifth, discuss our priorities for 2015. Then Tom will discuss our 2014 results and 2015 guidance and longer-term expectations in detail. Turning to Slide 4. During 2014, we made significant progress on our strategy and continued to position our company for the future. During this year, we brought in financial partners to invest $1.9 billion in our subsidiaries; announced or closed 10 transactions for $1.8 billion in equity proceeds from asset sales; broke new ground on 6 new platform expansion projects, totaling 2,200 megawatts and won long-term contracts to build 1,400 megawatts of capacity in California. We allocated $600 million to reduce parent debt and improve our credit profile, returned $450 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks and announced a doubling of our dividend, with an intended growth rate of 10%. Turning to Slide 5. Unfortunately, our financial results for the year were affected by $0.10 of adverse hydrology in Panama and Brazil. Still, we earned an adjusted EPS of $1.30, which was at the lower end of our original guidance range of $1.30 to $1.40, and slightly better than our expectations at the end of our third quarter call in November. We are disappointed with our proportional free cash flow of $891 million. Although proportional free cash flow came in at the low end of our revised guidance, it is 20% lower than our original guidance, primarily driven by the higher working capital requirements in Brazil and Chile as well as increased receivables in Bulgaria. All of which, we expect to reverse in 2015. Now turning to Slide 6. I would like to outline several factors affecting our 2015 outlook. Importantly, we have taken a number of steps to mitigate their impacts. Since our last call, we've seen international macroeconomic factors move against us. Currency and commodity forwards have declined significantly. Although we are largely contracted and the majority of our earnings are U.S. dollar-linked, this downward shift in forward curves has affected some of our businesses and, consequently, our earnings expectations for 2015 and beyond. We are also seeing continuing poor hydro conditions in Brazil, especially in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, where our hydros are located, rather than a return to normal hydrology, as we had previously assumed. We've been taking actions to lower our sensitivity to hydrology by adopting more optimal hedging strategies in Panama and Brazil. In Panama, we are bringing in a 72-megawatt oil-fired barge. In Brazil, we are working on creative solutions to supply additional energy, such as pursuing opportunities to restart long-term operations at our 640-megawatt Uruguaiana CCGT plant, which has not operated continually for many years due to lack of fuel. We're also exploring options to export energy from Chile and Argentina to the Brazilian grid. In parallel, we are proactively hedging our FX exposure in Brazil, Colombia and Europe, where since our last call, we have entered into additional hedges to shield 40% of our exposed earnings from further volatility. In our 2015 guidance, we're also assuming that ongoing negotiations in Bulgaria will have some earnings impact on our Maritza business. The Energy Minister of Bulgaria recently issued a communiqu\u00e9 in which he committed to paying Maritza's outstanding receivables of approximately $260 million and announced ongoing discussions to reduce the contract price. Additionally, the government is taking steps to improve the financial position of our offtaker, NEK, by reducing the volume of expensive energy that NEK is purchasing from other market participants and compensating NEK through environmental taxes. The Bulgarian government has targeted closing this negotiation and addressing NEK's financial situation in the first half of this year. Although negotiations have not been finalized, we're incorporating modest earnings dilution in our future expectations, which we believe is sufficient to accommodate the outcome of the discussions currently under way. The combined earnings impact of the macroeconomic factors and hydrology in Brazil as well as the potential outcome of the PPA negotiations at Maritza is approximately $0.18. Through proactive steps, including additional hedges, revenue improvement and cost savings, we expect to offset $0.13 of the total and, therefore, are reducing our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 to a revised range of $1.25 to $1.35. Notwithstanding the impact on our earnings from these factors, we are also reaffirming our 2015 proportional free cash flow range of $1,000,000,000 to $1,035,000,000 (sic) [$1,350,000,000], which is 30% higher than our 2014 results. This growth is largely driven by the recovery of working capital in Brazil and Chile as well as a reduction in accounts receivable in Bulgaria and the contributions from new plants coming online this year, such as the 1,240-megawatt Mong Duong project in Vietnam and the 72-megawatt oil-fired barge in Panama. Turning to Slide 7. I will discuss our continued progress on our strategic objectives, which we laid out in 2011, including reducing complexity, performance excellence, expanding access to capital and leveraging our platforms. First, reducing complexity. Since 2011, we have reduced the number of countries where we operate, from 28 down to 18, and raised $3 billion in equity proceeds from asset sales. In 2014 alone, we closed 10 transactions, totaling $1.8 billion in equity proceeds to AES. In addition to simplifying our portfolio, we recently exited riskier markets, such as Ukraine, Nigeria and Cameroon in a timely manner and at attractive valuations. As a result of our efforts, 80% of our 2014 earnings and proportional free cash flow was generated in 10 countries in the Americas. Regarding performance excellence, we believe that we are now the low-cost manager of a large portfolio of international energy assets. As you can see on Slide 8, we have reduced our global G&A by about 1/3 or $200 million, achieving the goal we established in 2011, 1 year early. Going forward, we are focusing on additional cost savings initiatives, including saving $100 million in O&M by 2018. Turning to Slide 9. Through financial partnerships, we are expanding our access to capital and fine-tuning our portfolio's global macroeconomic exposures and commodity risks. In most cases, we earn management, development, a promote or upfront fees. Partial sell-downs of our assets also served to highlight the value of the business in our portfolio. In total, we have raised $2.5 billion in proceeds to AES through financial partnerships. In 2014, we brought in partners at 4 of our businesses, including CDPQ, a long-term institutional investor headquartered in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada, which recently invested in IPALCO in Indiana. We look forward to working with CDPQ on additional partnering opportunities in the U.S. and Latin America. Turning to leveraging our platforms on Slide 10. We are exclusively focusing our growth on classroom expansions, including adjacencies such as energy storage and desalinization. Adjacencies are smaller investment opportunities that are replicable across our portfolio and have higher returns, with a much shorter construction period. To that end, we recently made a $25 million investment to acquire Main Street Power, a developer of distributed solar. Although modest in size, this business will provide us with the know-how to implement distributed solar generation in some of our international markets, where power prices are higher and solar resource is greater. We will focus on commercial and industrial customers. We currently have a total of 1,141 megawatts (sic) [7,141 megawatts] under construction, the most in AES's 34-year history. These projects represent $9 billion in total capital expenditures, the vast majority of which is being funded by a combination of nonrecourse debt and partner equity. More importantly, our required equity for these projects is $1.5 billion, of which we've already funded 70%. In terms of where these projects are located, as you can see on the right-hand side of the slide, 40% of the capacity under construction is in the U.S. The 1,400 [ph] megawatts of Southland contracts we recently won are not yet included in these numbers since we have not yet broken ground. If they were, the U.S. would represent 50% of the new capacity. We're earning very attractive risk-adjusted returns on these projects. For competitive reasons, we cannot provide details on a project-by-project basis. However, we will provide some general guidelines. For international projects, we're seeing IRRs from the midteens to more than 20%, with project-specific returns varying, reflecting project and country risk premiums. For U.S. projects, IRRs are in the low double digits. Including all of our projects under construction, the average IRR is around 14% and the ROE is greater than 15%. We would expect to earn at least as much from new projects in our development pipeline. Now turning to Slide 11. I would emphasize that as we have done in the past, we will complete all new projects with share buybacks and, furthermore, we will only invest in a new project if it meets the following criteria. First, it enhances the value of an existing business, such as the MATS CapEx program at IPL in Indiana or the oil-fired barge in Panama. Second, it offers compelling risk-adjusted returns while minimizing AES Corp. equity by using project-level cash or local leverage capacity. Examples include closing the cycle at our DPP plant in the Dominican Republic and energy storage. And finally, for any large project, we would expect to bring in a partner to maximize our returns and allow us to fine tune our total exposure in the project. The bottom line is that our successful execution on the 4 pillars of our strategy that I just discussed have positioned us to deliver average annual cash flow growth of 10% to 15% over the next 4 years, as our construction projects come online. We expect to grow our dividend 10% per year from today's level as cash flow increases. Given all that, we believe that our current share price does not reflect the progress we have made in our company and portfolio or the value from our largely funded construction program. Therefore, we have taken advantage of low share prices by buying back $150 million of our shares since our third quarter call. And today, we have announced that our board has authorized an additional $400 million for share repurchases, the majority of which we expect to utilize in 2015. Finally, as you can see on Slide 12, our overall capital allocation over the last 3 years has been very shareholder-focused. In fact, we have allocated 78% of our discretionary cash to parent debt prepayments and returning cash to shareholders. Specifically, we've allocated $1.6 billion to decrease our parent debt by 20% and improve our financial flexibility. We have also reduced our share count by 10%, buying back 78 million shares at an average price of $12.69. And with the recent doubling of our dividend, we're now paying $0.10 per share per quarter and we expect to grow the dividend 10% annually. We recognize that 2015 will be a challenging year due to negative macroeconomic factors in international markets and poor hydrology in Brazil. Nonetheless, we will continue to execute on our strategy to create shareholder value by pulling the levers we have outlined today. With that, I will now turn the call over to Tom, who will provide greater detail on our 2014 results and 2015 forecast. Thomas M. O'Flynn: Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review our fourth quarter and full year results, including: adjusted EPS; adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, by strategic business unit, or SBU; and our cash flow. Then I'll discuss our 2014 and '15 capital allocation plans, 2015 guidance and our longer-term expectations. As Andres has just discussed, we achieved a number of our objectives in 2014, despite the impacts from adverse hydrology and other factors. From an EPS perspective, we were able to offset these issues through operational improvements, accelerated cost savings and our capital allocation decisions, including share repurchases and debt prepayments. Admittedly, our 2014 proportional free cash flow was disappointing due to higher working capital requirements and increased receivables. Turning to Slide 14. Our fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.41 compared to $0.29 in the fourth quarter of 2013. Overall, our businesses contributed $0.08, driven by higher earnings from our U.S., Brazil and Andes SBUs. We also benefited from a 3% reduction in share count, lower parent interest expense and improved corporate charges, which contributed $0.07. These benefits were offset by a $0.03 impact from tax. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 25%, which was higher than the 18% rate we had last year. Detailed drivers of our fourth quarter PTC performance by SBU are in the appendix. Moving to Slide 15, and our full year EPS of $1.30 per share. Compared to 2013, we benefited from $0.07 of better operating performance at our U.S. SBU and our utilities in Brazil, plus a smaller impact from hydro; $0.03 from several other items, including recognition of higher interest income on receivables in Argentina in 2013; and $0.11 from capital allocation and lower corporate charges. These benefits were offset by $0.06 from outages in the first 9 months and a $0.14 impact from a higher adjusted effective tax rate of 30% versus 21% in '13. We ended up at $1.30, which was at the low end of our original guidance range. Turning to Slide 16. Our results by SBU were in line with the adjusted PTC modeling ranges we provided in November. The main driver that helped us come in at the high end of our revised EPS range was a 30% tax rate, which was slightly below what we were expecting, and equates to a couple cents of earnings. Now to Slide 17. Poor hydrology in Latin America continued to be a headwind in 2014, with a $0.10 impact to our adjusted EPS versus normal conditions. Although this was a meaningful impact, it was about 25% lower than what we experienced in 2013 due to favorable hydro conditions in Colombia and our proactive steps in Panama. Now going to hydrology by market, beginning with Colombia. In 2014, Chivor had favorable inflow conditions relative to the rest of the country, which allowed us to sell excess power into the spot market at attractive prices, adding $0.03. Currently, inflows at Chivor are 92% of average. And we're expecting a normal year in 2015. In Panama, we had a $0.06 shortfall in '14, most of which was during the first 9 months, as inflows improved in the fourth quarter. Inflows are now close to 100% of long-term average and power prices are about $100 a megawatt hour, down from well over $200 per megawatt hour from much of last year. Our downside exposure continues to decrease for 2 main reasons. First, the government compensation agreement we negotiated last year to offset this exposure; and secondly, lower oil prices helped to reduce our earnings volatility, as spot prices during dry conditions are set by oil-fired generation. In 2014, we were purchasing in the spot market. If oil prices were at today's level last year, the hydro impact would've been about $0.03 rather than the $0.06 we actually experienced. I'll also note, as Andres mentioned, we've brought an oil-fired barge to Panama, improving our bottom line. Finally in Brazil, we had a $0.07 impact from poor hydrology in 2014. Tiet\u00ea experienced a 10% reduction in generation, or GSF. The impact was magnified by the fact that the average spot price was just under BRL 700 per megawatt hour in 2014, significantly greater than the BRL 200 level of our offtake contract. Currently, reservoir levels are about 23%. While we've seen some recent improvement, it's difficult to predict how much they'll recover by the end of the rainy season in April. For now, we're factoring in about a $0.05 impact into our 2015 guidance due to an estimated 15% to 17% reduction in generation for the year. The impact of a shortfall will be less than last year as spot prices are now capped at BRL 388 per megawatt hour compared to the cap last year which was BRL 823. We're not incorporating rationing into our 2015 guidance at this time. We'll provide an update on our next earnings call in May, when we'll have more clarity. Although it's very premature, we estimate a rationing scenario could result in an additional $0.05 impact, above the $0.05 we already have incorporated into our guidance. Now to cash flow, beginning on Slide 18. We generated $287 million of proportional free cash flow in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year amount to $891 million versus $1.27 billion in 2013. Although near the bottom end of our revised guidance, it's roughly $250 million less than our original guidance. We're obviously disappointed with this result. This decline was largely driven by 3 unanticipated factors : first, an increase of a little more than $100 million in receivables at our Maritza Plant in Bulgaria; second, higher receivables at Sul, our utility in Brazil, due to higher energy purchases; and finally, a lag in VAT, or value-added taxes, related to our construction projects in Chile. We expect improvement in these factors this year. Now to Slide 19, and our capital allocation in 2014. Starting on the left, we generated roughly $1.9 billion of discretionary cash, including $1.2 billion from announced asset sales. We're pleased that despite our shortfall in proportional free cash flow, we generated $523 million in parent free cash flow, above the $500 million midpoint of our expectations. Turning to the right-hand side of the slide, we allocated 76% of this cash to parent debt and returning cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Meeting our parent free cash flow expectation is especially important as it is the foundation of our dividend and dividend growth. As we've demonstrated through the recent doubling of our dividend, we continue to be comfortable that we'll generate about $525 million in parent free cash flow in '15 and growth of 10% to 15% annually. Turning to Slide 20, and our capital allocation plan for 2015. With $460 million in announced asset sale proceeds, our total discretionary cash is expected to be about $1.5 billion in 2015. We'll invest about $300 million to fund equity commitments in projects currently under construction, the largest of which is at IPALCO, where we have a $1.4 billion investment program under way to increase the rate base by 70% from 2013 to 2017. After taking into account our growth investments as well as expected debt prepayments of $200 million, we're projecting about $600 million of remaining cash available for allocation. We currently have a $400 million authorization for share repurchases, of which we expect to utilize the majority during 2015. Before turning to our guidance, I'd like to take a moment to address our foreign currency and commodity exposures and our hedging practices, on Slide 21. We have long-term protections built into our business model to manage our exposure to FX and commodity price changes. For example, 82% of our businesses are either utilities or generation businesses with an average contract term of 7 years. This insulates the majority of our earnings from commodity price volatility. Having said that, some of our businesses do have commodity exposure as they operate in markets where power prices are oil- or natural-gas-driven. As shown in our appendix, every 10% move in oil is roughly a $0.025 EPS impact on an op [ph] basis, primarily from the Dominican Republic and, to a lesser extent, Panama, where we have a modest amount of excess power to sell into the spot market. On the plus side, in Panama, as I just mentioned, lower oil prices reduce our exposure to poor hydrology. In terms of gas, our largest exposure is at our DPL merchant business, where our 3,000-megawatt coal-fired fleet is negatively impacted by declining gas prices. However, although, gas has fallen by 20%, dark spreads held up at around the $12 range. The impact on our EPS has been less than our disclosed sensitivities, which assumed a constant market heat rate. Regarding currencies, as you can see on the right-hand side, we're largely protected from foreign currency changes, given that more than 2/3 of our PTC is effectively U.S.-dollar denominated. The remaining 1/3 is exposed to a handful of foreign currencies, mainly the Brazilian real, the euro and the Colombian peso. For the exposed portion, we mitigate the risk on a 12-month rolling basis through shorter-term FX hedging programs or currency-linked escalation clauses in our shorter-term contracts. Now I'll walk through our 2015 adjusted EPS guidance on Slide 22. The updated forward curve on commodities and currencies used in sensitivities we provided in our last earnings deck, would suggest a $0.10 negative impact to 2015. However, as a result of additional FX hedges, fuel and power contracts, we have been able to trim the overall impact from currencies and commodities on our 2015 EPS by $0.04. We're also incorporating a $0.05 impact from Brazil hydrology, as I discussed earlier. Finally, we've also factored in a modest dilution of $0.03 from other factors, including PPA negotiations at Maritza. We're offsetting these impacts through the following actions : $0.04 from cost savings initiatives across our portfolio and revenue improvements, including a modest uplift from Mong Duong, where a new accounting standard better aligns earnings with cash on an ongoing basis; $0.02 from accelerated capital allocation; and $0.03 from various tax opportunities. Net-net, we've offset $0.13 of the $0.18 of headwinds, and therefore revised our guidance downward by $0.05 to a range of $1.25 to $1.35 per share. Turning to our longer-term adjusted EPS expectations, on Slide 23. We continue to expect modest to flat growth in 2016, and 6% to 8% growth in 2017 and '18, more weighted towards 2018, consistent with our prior expectation but off a lower 2015 base. Our projects under construction will drive our earnings growth, while many of the other actions we're implementing in 2015 will continue to benefit us in '16 and beyond, largely offsetting what appears at this time to be a negative impact from currency and commodity forward curves as well as the impact of potential modifications of the Maritza PPA. Shifting to cash flow guidance on Slide 24. We are reaffirming our 2015 proportional free cash flow guidance of $1 billion to $1.35 billion. This implies an increase of roughly $275 million over 2014, which is driven by recovery of working capital and receivables along with cash flow from new businesses, including Mong Duong, which comes online this year. In Brazil, we're encouraged that recent moves by the regulator will accelerate the collection of purchased power costs by the distribution companies. On Slide 25, we continue to expect 10% to 15% average annual growth in proportional free cash flow driven by contributions from projects currently under construction as well as the fact that maintenance CapEx is less than depreciation from new projects. In 2014 and '15, depreciation averages about $350 million greater than maintenance and environmental CapEx. We expect this differential to widen to $600 million by 2017, which explains much of why our cash flow is growing at a greater rate than earnings. We believe cash flow is a key value driver, with strong double-digit growth in both proportional and parent free cash flow over the longer term. We'll continue to show the value of our cash flow through disciplined capital allocation that maximizes risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders. Now I'll turn it back to Andres. Andr\u00e9s Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Thanks, Tom. To summarize, we made significant progress on our strategy in 2014 and are encouraged with the resilience of our platform and the opportunities it provides to increase shareholder value. For 2015, our priorities are : pulling all levers to mitigate the effects of poor hydrology in Brazil and lower FX and commodity prices; completing the 1,240-megawatt Mong Duong project in Vietnam, which will be a major contributor to our growth; resolving Maritza's outstanding receivables and renegotiating our PPA; executing on platform expansion opportunities and bringing in financial partners at the project level; and allocating our discretionary capital to maximize returns, including providing for growth in our dividend and returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases. We believe that AES is uniquely positioned to offer our shareholders a strong and growing cash flow and dividends. I would like to open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ali Agha from SunTrust. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : A couple of questions. One, I noticed that when you updated your 2015 guidance, you used the commodity and currency curves as of December 31, 2014. As you know, since then, particularly on the currency side, we've seen further depreciation out there. And I'm just wondering, factoring all of that in as we stand here today, does that cause you to relook at the range of earnings that you put out maybe towards the lower end or has there been other offsets that you're still comfortable on the midpoint of this range to [indiscernible] given the currencies moves for the year? Andr\u00e9s Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Ali, we're comfortable with the range we're providing. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : Are there any other additional offsets that you've made since December 31 that aren't? Andr\u00e9s Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Again, I think that we have a number of initiatives that we're undertaking. And again, in the net-net, we're comfortable with the range we're providing. Thomas M. O'Flynn: Yes, Ali, I'll just say that as we look at the currencies maybe off $0.01, maybe real is a bit up, but there are some other moving pieces. Maybe commodities have helped us a little bit, so net-net, we're in about the same place. And we thought that the end of the year was a good baseline, and that's what we used for our budget. We just thought that was a good place to stick with, but we obviously provided you with sensitivities. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : Right. Second question, with regards to the longer-term earnings outlook, '16 and beyond, if I heard you right, I think you've said, \"Hey, we're now going to start off from the lower base and build out from there.\" So I would've thought some of the '15 hits are not dominant and currency and commodities can move at other places. So why is there a permanent sort of rollover effect in the future years that causes everything to move down, given the '15 move down? Andr\u00e9s Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Ali, I completely agree that currencies and commodities can move. Hydrology, we expect to be sort of onetime hits. But currency and commodity, we're putting in the forward curves that we have to date. We don't have any better information. But I agree, if they improve and then we would improve as well. But the way the modeling works is that you have to take the forward curves and the best estimate of tomorrow's price is today's prices, and so we've moved them down accordingly. But I agree with you. I mean, one thing we're sure of is that they're going to move in the future. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : And then, Andres, finally, as far as CIC's ownership is concerned, obviously, there's a representative on your board resigned last month. They haven't announced a replacement. What's your latest understanding of what their plan is for their ownership in AES shares currently? Andr\u00e9s Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Sure. Of course we can't speak for CIC, but what I can say is that, first, the decision of Mr. Zhang [ph] to retire is because he hit the age limit of 70, and in China, they're very strict about the age limit restrictions in government, so that's the first part. The second, as you know, there are things happening in China, so they have the right to assign a new director, and they will do so. But as you know, because of certain campaigns that are in China today, things have slowed down in terms of rapid decision-making. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : Okay. So no indication from them on what their plans are for their ownership? Andr\u00e9s Ricardo Gluski Weilert : That's correct. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : We saw an interesting development yesterday in Ohio. And I know it's very recent, but it did look, I guess, to us at least, somewhat promising in terms of receptivity to PPAs in the state. Just curious, I know it's very recent and involves another company, but any immediate reaction to that? Any thoughts as to how that might impact you or just, more broadly, on what you saw yesterday? Thomas M. O'Flynn: Yes, Stephen. It's Tom. I'll just hit that briefly. We have been following that. We did notice that it seemed like PUCO was receptive to the concept of PPAs, but didn't believe that specific example warranted the PPO, or the merits were not significant or sufficiently demonstrated. So we continue to monitor the situation. We do think -- kind of stepping back on, a bigger picture, we do think capacity will be worth more and that probably was a significant input into us deciding last summer to retain the generation. We are seeing a lot of that, to be honest, through PJM premium capacity product. That looks like it's on track, so we expect to get more value for our capacity in that fashion. The last thing I'd say, it's a little harder for us. All of our plants are, let's say, positive on a to-go cost. We don't have any plants that are cash flow-negative, as we see it. So it's a little harder for us to make the case that, perhaps, some other plants in Ohio might -- the majority of our plants. We do have a small interest in the OVEC plant that might be in a different situation, but the majority of our plants are cash flow positive. Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. Understood. That's very helpful. And I wanted to switch over, Andres, to Main Street Power, and as you think about solar for commercial and industrial customers. I'm just curious how we should think about this in terms of the types of countries that would be most interesting. You talked about the criteria briefly, but is this something that you would envision will start relatively small for some period of time? Do you see the potential as so positive that within meaningful, relatively short amount of time it could become sizable? How should we think about this in terms of where this goes in terms of scale? Andr\u00e9s Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Yes, great question. We're starting off very modestly. I think as you know, we sold most of our position in utility-scale solar in our JV with Riverstone. We've kept some assets. We continue to believe that we should have the capability of introducing solar onto our platforms where it makes economic sense. So right now, we're building 20 megawatts of solar in Chile. So one market that's particularly interesting is Chile, where you have some of the best solar irradiation in the world, and you have very low rainfall in the north, so it's an optimal place for solar. And also energy prices, because they have limited hydro, are quite high. So that combination of factors makes it an attractive market. We have other markets, such as the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, where, again, you have high solar irradiation and you have high energy prices. So we feel that this could be a nice addition to our portfolio to address the needs of large customers, especially commercial and industrial. We also think that this is -- distributed solar is something which is affecting the industry, and we want to have our most current information, understand what's happening, understand developments to be able to react faster. So we think that we have a unique footprint in terms of places where you have the right combinations of natural factors and of market factors, and with this know-how, we're optimistic we will make a good business. Now given AES's size and given that we have a modest investment, at this point, it will take some time to grow out. And lastly, as you know, we are the world leaders in the use of lithium-ion batteries. We recently won in the Southern California Edison bid. We got 100 megawatts of more, additional capacity and we're using it really to -- almost like a peaking plant, I would say. So having distributed solar and having the batteries together puts us in a very good position to react to changes in the marketplace with the growth of renewables. So again, it's part of our having a complete product offering. But again, we're starting off modest and like in batteries, we intend to make money from it. Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : That's very helpful. And if I could, just one last very brief question on Uruguaiana. You talked, Andres, about the potential restart and the key challenge in terms of getting fuel. What are potential approaches you could take there? How should we think about the challenges of actually achieving a restart there? Andr\u00e9s Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Yes, well, last year it ran for a couple of months and it's going to be running this year as well for a couple of months under emergency situations. Of course, what would be more efficient for us is to receive capacity payments and be able to run it more. We have, of course, a gas pipeline. It comes through Argentina. So the issue really has been to deliver LNG into Argentina and get an equivalent amount of gas in Brazil at Uruguaiana. And it really depends on what's the delivered price to the plant, so we've been having relatively high prices of delivered gas to Uruguaiana. We're working on mechanisms using the existing infrastructure to get lower-priced gas. But what is also very important is that we have been promoting discussions between the governments. So we had an interconnection line from Chile -- from Argentina to Chile, from TermoAndes into Chile. Given the situation of increased capacity in Northern Chile, we have reversed that transmission line so that we can now export energy from Chile into Argentina. And there exists the possibility, and that we're exploring, where we would actually pass energy from Chile to Argentina and from Argentina into Brazil. And it would be a win-win for all, and we have had considerable government receptivity. It's just that we've gotten the permission for the first step, we'll be looking to the second step. But I think what's important, broadly, is that we're looking at ways to decrease our hydro exposure. And even if rains come back to normal, we don't want to be as susceptible to a drought. Admittedly, this is the worst drought in 100 years but, nonetheless, we want to decrease our portfolio sensitivity to it, so we're looking at these ideas. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : So I wanted to elaborate a little bit on the cost savings. Can you talk about where exactly you're getting from -- them from, and the sustainability as you look forward on the guidance you guys just released? And then perhaps, the second factor, as you think year-on-year, looking towards the hydrology, what kind of assumptions on normalization are you assuming '15 versus '16, or is that kind of all largely caught up already within the range, the $0.10 range you have? Andr\u00e9s Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Okay. Let me take the first one and Tom will take the second one. The first one, regarding the O&M savings that I mentioned. So first, the G&A savings, the $200 million, that's sustainable. That's a structural change in how we operate and better use of systems and I think a better organizational structure. So that's, let's say, in the bag. Regarding the additional $100 million of O&M savings for -- through 2018. Basically, as you know, we're -- have 7,000 additional megawatts, which will come online between now and 2018. So really, our challenge is to keep O&M constant, flat, and reducing it on a megawatt-hour basis, is what we're going to be doing and also keeping our costs flat relative to local inflations. These are our 2 main mechanisms that we're doing. Of course, we have opportunities for additional standardization, for additional aggregation of purchases. We now have the systems to do that. Those are additional things that we'll be looking at. Thomas M. O'Flynn: Julien, the hydrology for next year, we're assuming it'll be normal, just like we are for Panama this year. Keep in mind that our contract at Tiet\u00ea of about BRL 200 per megawatt hour ends this year, so we're about 83%, 85% hedged for next year. So if there was a GSF reduction like we're predicting this year, let's say, 15%, we would lose some sales. We would not be short. So we'll be in a much better position going forward. And that's how we would expect to run our business at Tiet\u00ea, as well as everywhere else. All our businesses that are portfolios in a market we would look to sell some of the power but have some excess that would protect us against reductions in production and hopefully to capitalize on some opportunities where we've got a little bit of length if prices are high. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Got you. And then moving to Vietnam real quickly, can you elaborate briefly here on your expectations for not just this year but in subsequent years around earnings trends. You talked it up in terms of '15 guidance, but in terms of the -- once in service, what does it mean, your latest update on guidance? Because I know you've talked to a lower ROE versus cash flow in that project throughout. Thomas M. O'Flynn: Yes, so the ROE -- as I said, the ROE will now look closer to the cash yields and the cash yield is in the high teens and the ROE will be in the midteens maybe 14%, 15%. Andr\u00e9s Ricardo Gluski Weilert : So, Julien, we expect us to be fully online, both units will be online by the second half of the year. So starting '16, we have a full year of Mong Duong. Now again, cash is still sort of front loaded. Because it's a BOT, it comes under lease accounting or a version of it, and we have to normalize it over the life of the projects. Thomas M. O'Flynn: But those are -- Julien, those benefits -- that ROE is sustainable for many years, 10 years plus. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Right. But let me just be clear about kind of combining these factors. You're going to have a better ROE on Vietnam, and so that's another year-over-year benefit in '16, right? So the '15 versus '16 jump is better than what you previously disclosed? And then in addition to that, in theory, there's a normalization factor that's taking effect '15 versus '16 that should be benefiting as well, right? Is that -- I just want to make sure I'm capturing some of the changes here as you think forward-looking. Andr\u00e9s Ricardo Gluski Weilert : The short answer is yes. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Got it. Excellent. And then lastly, just on Bulgaria, if you don't mind my asking. I appreciate that you've taken an impact here. When you're thinking about the overall value proposition and the NPV, how are you thinking about that in the context of the conversation? And I know that might be sensitive. I just wanted to get that out there, if I could. Andr\u00e9s Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Yes. Of course, we're in the midst of conversations with the government. For us, the real key point is, one, a prompt payment of the 100% of the outstanding receivables; and the second is really solving the source of the problem, which is the financial situation of NEK, the offtaker. So by really increasing the revenues to NEK, especially on the passing of the C02 taxes, which went to the government. The government allocated a portion of that to NEK. Now they'll go directly to NEK. And second, rationalizing the energy that NEK buys because we are the -- among the thermal plants, one of the few EU 16-compliant plants. So if they really enforced their rules, this will put -- make our plant much more important. And so I think it's -- the exchange, of course, would be that they want a decrease in our energy prices today and for a number of years and, in exchange, we have to look at the overall health of the business. And so we'll be looking at those factors, taking them into consideration. But I think the most important is that we should end up with a project that we don't have to be talking about receivables next year at this time, and that's really our primary interest in this. And the government, quite frankly, doesn't want to be talking about this either. But I think that with the cancellation of the South Stream project of gas from Russia, this plant becomes absolutely vital for Bulgaria. So I feel very confident that we will come to a resolution. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Maura Shaughnessy from MFS. Maura A. Shaughnessy - Massachusetts Financial Services Company : Yes, so I just -- I just have 2 questions dealing mainly around Brazil. So just what was the GSF for Tiet\u00ea in '14 and what is the assumption in '15? Thomas M. O'Flynn: Yes, Maura, it's Tom. GSF was down 10% in '14, and so that was basically what cost us the $0.07. Our assumption for '15 is 15% to 17%. Keep in mind, obviously, the prices were a lot lower. We are filling our short in '14 at basically BRL 700 per megawatt hour. Now the cap is BRL 388. So it's a larger shortage, but it's cheaper to fill it on a megawatt-hour basis. Maura A. Shaughnessy - Massachusetts Financial Services Company : And so that the assumption that the GSF would fall into -- and I guess, you're talking about it down from 100%, I think about it the other way. So in the 70s under a rationing scenario? What's the... Thomas M. O'Flynn: Well, our -- I guess our assumption in terms of percentage of assured energy, flipping it around, we were 90% of assured last year and we'll be -- we're assuming we'll be 83% to 85% of our assured this year. So the $0.05 that's baked into our guidance assumes that we'll not be rationing. Obviously, we're watching the rainfall. We'll know more -- I think, at least, the last week or so has been good, but if there were to be rationing, there's different scenarios. We've looked at them. But our sense is if we were to be rationing, it would be an additional $0.05, so it'll be $0.10 instead of $0.05. But it's still far too early to call on rationing. Maura A. Shaughnessy - Massachusetts Financial Services Company : An assured energy level of 75% to 80%, is a guesstimate range on rationing? Thomas M. O'Flynn: Yes, we have a little more -- well, there's assured but then that also goes into some volume reductions, so we actually start to lose a little bit at Eletropaulo and Sul. So it's a Tiet\u00ea. The rationing would be baked in. We'd have some Sul and Eletropaulo sales reductions as well as just Tiet\u00ea. That's a Brazil number, not just a Tiet\u00ea number. Maura A. Shaughnessy - Massachusetts Financial Services Company : So the $0.08 expected hit for Tiet\u00ea in '16, I think you had something like 17% of that contract still open. What's the assumption in terms of the pricing to get to that $0.08? And what are you doing with that open position? What's the strategy there? Thomas M. O'Flynn: Yes, I'm sorry -- so for -- there is a reduction, let's say, from normal '15 to a normal '16. I want to make sure I separate hydrology from prices. There is a reduction of about $0.06, $0.07 just on a normal hydro year, from '15 to '16, because this year, we're selling at BRL 200 per megawatt hour. Next year, it's about BRL 135. It's about BRL 135 while it's been doing a rolling forward hedge program now for about 18 months, and I believe about BRL 135 is our average pricing and about 83% sold for Tiet\u00ea next year. That number goes up a little bit in the next 3 years. The reais per megawatt hour goes up a little bit. And the hedging level, just like any rolling hedge program, goes down, about 20% a year. Andr\u00e9s Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Exactly -- in -- by '18, it's 46% hedged, and the average price is BRL 141 per megawatt hour. Maura A. Shaughnessy - Massachusetts Financial Services Company : Okay. And just -- I mean, obviously, the tax is what it is, but when you're selling [indiscernible] forward power today, what would those prices be at today? Thomas M. O'Flynn: Well, we're seeing very high numbers. If you just did a single '16, we're seeing them in the mid-200s. But we've generally been selling more -- sorry, go ahead. Maura A. Shaughnessy - Massachusetts Financial Services Company : Yes, so we know the Eletropaulo contract expires and the like, I'm just trying to understand what that [indiscernible]. The initial power sold was very low prices, but now you have last year the opportunity to reset that cost. But the pricing hasn't pushed up that much in your asset loss in '16 versus '15. So just wondering what -- is there the chance to be -- is the assumption to be selling power north of [indiscernible] or no? Thomas M. O'Flynn: Yes -- no, Maura, that's -- I mean, we've been doing a rolling hedge program, as I said, it started probably about 2 years ago. So 1 year ago at this time, we said that we had a fair number of sales for '16 and they were about BRL 150, so as we increased our sales, as we filled up the bucket for '16 over the last 12 months, we've been doing it at about, well, BRL 160, BRL 180, so that's why we -- our weighted average is BRL 135 for '16, which basically reflects sales we've been doing for the last couple years. It is fair, as we've been doing the sales, Andres has mentioned about 40% sold for '18, we have often sold them in 3-year strips, because there's a little bit of backwardation between '16 and '19, so we've been selling them in 3-year strips to take advantage of the '16 higher prices and basically stretch it out for a couple of years. Maura A. Shaughnessy - Massachusetts Financial Services Company : So if I were stepping back and looking at what's happening in Brazil, you've had a positive in terms of accounting in terms of Eletropaulo this quarter and on the other [indiscernible] we're supposed to have a special tariff increase in March. So that front for the distribution company, never mind in the next [indiscernible] seeing some rational returns to its [indiscernible] having said that, on [indiscernible] the strategy from the government just seems to be pray for rain. [indiscernible] Just going to wait until April and that will make a determination or, because it seems easy for them not to have been doing stuff, obviously, a year ago, never mind this year. So what's the -- Andres, what do you think this is going to -- how this is all going to shake out? Andr\u00e9s Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Well, I think that -- I remember last year when we talked about this. We said that we thought rationing was very unlikely, given the elections, that they'd do everything possible to avoid rationing. I think that you'll have the extraordinary tariff increase. We expect that in March. I do think that will go through, which will help us pass through short-term -- near-term costs. I think that the last couple weeks have been good. I mean, one of the big problems has been that the rainfall has been falling in the wrong places. It's been falling further south and the big hydros are in the southeast. So that's what's -- so the average rainfall numbers won't give you the real picture. It's really the fact that they haven't been falling in S\u00e3o Paulo and Mina Gerais, the rain. So my feeling is that they'll -- they're showing that they're taking active steps to protect the liquidity of the distribution companies. I think they're also taking active steps to run as much thermal as possible. And so it isn't sort of just hope for the rains. I think they're taking a lot of steps. So I still think it's more likely that we won't have rationing than we will have rationing. But it's a higher percentage than it was, say, last year. It might be 40-60 or something like this. We don't know the exact numbers. But they are doing, taking the right steps to ensure liquidity at the Discos, and also to run the thermals, and they are in discussions with us. At Uruguaiana, we are running the plant and they are really looking at the imports of energy. I don't know if that sort of gives you sort of our feeling of what will happen. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI, Research Division : Most of my questions have been asked. Good job, guys, navigating through a very tough environment. One question is when I looked at the shortfall in cash flow that you experienced this year, below the bottom end of the range, how much of that is just stuff that you actually expect to reverse out and come back in '15 and '16 and that's essentially baked into your confidence in the future cash flow? Thomas M. O'Flynn: Greg, I'd say some of it is, especially the nearest-term stuff will be the Chilean VAT. We've already started to see about 1/2 of that come back. The Brazilian situation is, as Andres mentioned there have been through the flag mechanisms and there are some meaningful rate increases expected here, whereby the deferred power purchase expense will get passed through here in the next few months. So we have good visibility and we also have a good, reasonable contingency in our numbers. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI, Research Division : Great. And when I look at the spread between parent free cash flow and -- sorry, proportional free cash and parent free cash, $1,000,000,000 to $1,350,000,000 going down to $475 million to $575 million, that's a ratio of 42.5% at the low end, of 47.5% at the high end. Is it a good rule of thumb to assume that proportional free cash translates into the parent free cash at 45% as we go through time or does that rise or fall or is there another way we should think about that? Andr\u00e9s Ricardo Gluski Weilert : I think that can rise and fall. I mean, I think we showed it last year, where one fell 25% and the other one grew. So it will depend on the specific circumstances. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI, Research Division : Okay, great. But I mean, should we be concerned that there's that big range of potential outcomes there or is it with a relatively narrow band? Andr\u00e9s Ricardo Gluski Weilert : The parent free cash flow, I think we've shown over the years, is very solid. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI, Research Division : Okay, great. And my final question is can you just review what's going on with the Southland projects and what is the actual timing of when the capital investments start to translate into net income? Andr\u00e9s Ricardo Gluski Weilert : When they'll start to translate? Well, they would come online in 2020, is what we're looking at. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI, Research Division : And would you generate AFUDC on those investments or -- in the construction space or no? Andr\u00e9s Ricardo Gluski Weilert : No. No, this is... Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Insoo Kim from RBC Capital Markets. Insoo Kim - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Just a couple of questions. Regarding the Maritza renegotiations, in your guidance, what percentage decrease in contract prices are you assuming and kind of, I guess, the breakdown of -- from that $0.03, what EPS impact are you assuming? Andr\u00e9s Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Well, on the first one, I mean, we can't give any details, because we're in the midst of negotiations right now. So I can't give you any more color on that. It's in that bundle that we've put up there, of $0.03, and we think that's more than adequate to cover anything that could result from the negotiations. Insoo Kim - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And regarding the tax rate for the year, I know it assumes the extension of the CFC look-through rule. Do you have any updates or timing on when that decision would come out? Andr\u00e9s Ricardo Gluski Weilert : We got it last year. Congress has had a tendency to do it last minute, sort of 12 :00 on the 31st of December. So we really don't. I mean, there is a talk of updating the -- starting to make some changes in our tax code, but there remains significant support for this. And so we expect it to be passed. We're also taking steps to minimize the impact should it not pass, as we have in the past. So we're now talking about a range of maybe $0.05 or something like that, should it not pass. But just a reminder, we do have $3 billion of NOLs. We are generating more, so it will always be noncash for the foreseeable future. Ahmed Pasha : Okay. Well, we thank everyone for joining us today on our call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any questions you may have. Thank you, and have a nice day.

Our earnings release presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause financial results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom O\u2019Flynn, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will now turn the call over to. Andres. Andres? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our first quarter 2015 earnings call. I am pleased to report that with our first quarter results we\u2019re reaffirming our 2015 guidance for all metrics. Since our previous quarterly call less than three months ago, we have achieved several significant milestones on our strategic objectives and our priorities for 2015. We continue to leverage our platforms, our $9 billion construction program is advancing on schedule and will be the major contributor to our cash and earnings growth over the next four years. This quarter, we commissioned the largest power plant that AES has ever constructed. We also signed agreements for two additional asset sales, totaling a $105 million in equity proceeds and invested $345 million to prepay and refinance debt. This year, we have also repurchased $42 million of our shares and we made substantial progress and addressing short-term issues affecting our businesses in Bulgaria and India. I will discuss some of these achievements in detail. But first, I\u2019d like to provide the highlights of our financial results. In the first quarter, we generated proportional fee cash flow of $265 million doubled a results of year ago. Due to the recovery of working capital and a couple of significant businesses, we are in $0.25 of adjusted earnings per share, which was a $0.01 increase from our first quarter of 2014. We improved operating performance at our U.S. and Andes strategic business units although; we continue to experience headwinds from poor hydrology in Brazil and unfavorable foreign exchange in Latin America and Europe. During the quarter, our earnings benefited from our previous capital allocation decisions to pay down debt and buyback our shares. As we\u2019ve discussed in the past, we have taken steps to mitigate the impact of adverse hydrology in Latin America and this year that risk is mostly limited to Brazil. We also have a rolling 12 months hedging strategy to help mitigate the impact of fluctuations in foreign currencies especially the Brazil real, the Colombian peso and the euro. Although these currencies have weakened against the U.S. dollar, energy demand has remained robust at 3% to 10% our markets except in the U.S., while we are experiencing flat demand and in Brazil where demand growth is slightly negative. Now I\u2019ll discuss our significant accomplishment since our last call. Starting with our progress and resolving a couple of business specific issues beginning on slide four. In Bulgaria with the Maritza Plant sole customer, the National Electricity Company or NEK had fallen significantly behind on its payment; we\u2019re now seeing positive momentum. Last month, Maritza signed an MOU with NEK to received full payment of all arrears which as of March 30th were $236 million in exchange for a decrease in the capacity price of the long-term PPA. We expect to sign a binding agreement by the third quarter of this year. The 14% capacity price reduction is already reflected in our 2015 guidance as well as our longer term expectations. This agreement is part of a broad set of initiatives; the Government of Bulgaria is taking to help restore NEK\u2019s financial position. One of these initiatives is the introduction of energy sector reforms to reduce the volume of energy that NEK purchases from coal generators and compensating NEK through existing environmental taxes. Already Maritza\u2019s collections during the first four months of the year have improved by 40% and our receivable balance has remained flat as of the end of December. Turning now to our 1,320 megawatts OPGC 2 project, under construction in India on slide 5. As you may know late last year, the Supreme Court of India overturned the allocations of 214 coal blocks, including those for OPGC 2. I am pleased to report that the project through a new joint venture between OPGC and the Government of Odisha has re-secured the rights to the same coal blocks, which can support 2,640 megawatts of new capacity. Construction on OPGC 2 is on schedule with this plant expected to come online in 2018. Now turning to slide six, I\u2019ll discuss our construction program and develop and pipeline in more detail. Our construction program is a most significant driver of our 10% to 15% average annual growth and free cash flow over the next few years. This strong growth is a foundation for a commitment to 10% annual dividend growth as well as other capital allocation decisions. From 2015 through 2018, we expect the commission 7,131 megawatts of new capacity, which is a high multiple of the roughly 600 megawatts we\u2019ve brought online in the three previous years from 2012 to 2014. In fact, already this year, we\u2019ve brought online 1,312 megawatts, which is 87% of the capacity we expect to commission this year. Moving onto slide 7, remaining 5,118 megawatts under constructions, progressing well and remain on-time and on-budget. As a reminder, the total CapEx for our projects currently under construction is $7 billion, but AES\u2019s equity commitment is only 1.3 billion of which all but 400 million has already been funded. As you can see roughly 80% of this new capacity is in the America, we expect our return on equity from these projects of more than 15%. Turning to slide 8, I\u2019m very happy to report that we have achieved commercial operation on our 1,240 megawatts Mong Duong project in Vietnam six months early. Additionally, the project reached 18 million man-hours without a lost time incident. This project provides us with solid platform from which to grow our presence in Vietnam where we see a number of future platform expansion opportunities. Moving to slide 9, to help mitigate our hydrology risk in Panama we\u2019ve recently inaugurated a 72 MW thermal power barge. The plant's output is contracted under five year PBA. We're also looking at similar opportunities in other countries in Latin America to decrease our exposure to fluctuations in hydrology. Finally, looking at our growth opportunities beyond the projects currently under construction; beginning on slide 10. We see compelling platform expansion opportunities in a number of growing markets such as Chile, Mexico, Panama and the Philippines. In more mature markets like California and the United Kingdom, we see opportunity to replace older, less efficient or noncompliant capacity. Generally, we expect our future project mix to be heavily weighted towards of natural gas, renewables, and energy storage as we seek to match the right offering on the future needs of each market. As we have said in the past we will continue to compete all investments in growth projects against share repurchases, in order to ensure that we are maximizing risk-adjusted per share returns for our shareholders.  Based on the opportunities we see across our portfolio beyond 2018, we believe we could invest $300 million to $400 million of AES equity in the attractive growth projects each year which is consistent with the amount of equity we are currently contributing annually to our growth projects. This level of annual equity commitment is quite moderate considering the expected growth in our free cash flow and continued recycling of capital from additional asset sales. We also plan to bring in financial partners on all of our larger projects as a means of improving our returns, fine-tuning our portfolio's risk exposures and having our project bided by other investors. Now, I\u2019d like to highlight a couple of more significant projects in our development pipeline, beginning on slight 11. Our Southline Repowering Project in California with 1400 MW of gas-fired and energy storage capacity is on track to begin construction in 2017. We expect to select our EPC contractor and file final permitting amendments in the next six months. Our development pipeline is not limited to power generation projects as we seek to realize the full value of our existing market platforms through adjacent business lines such as enhanced LNG services, desalinization, and energy storage. Turning to slide 12 for example, in the Dominican Republic, we are working on opportunities to expand our existing LNG infrastructure. We are developing a second gas pipeline which would transport natural gas from our regasification terminal to other power generators so they can convert up to the 1000 MW of diesel and oil fired generations to cheaper, cleaner natural gas. We are also advancing in the development of an upgrade of our LNG import terminal to allow for the reshipment of LNG. The ability to reship LNG will be an extension of our successful gas distribution business in the Dominican Republic, which supplies third-party trucks with liquefied natural gas. Both of these attractive projects will require only modest equity investments as we expect to largely fund them with leverage capacity at the local business. In terms of desalinization, on slide 13, we currently have one 200 cubic meter per hour project under construction at our Angamos power plant in Chile. Although this project is largely a modernization of our existing diesel facilities at that plant, there are a number of potential diesel projects in Chile to supply our mining and industrial customers. We see diesel as a timely and significant opportunity in Chile and possibly longer term in Mexico and California, given the challenges of water supply in those markets and our many years of experience operating diesel plants.  Moving on to slide 14. We are the world leaders in battery-based energy storage 86 MW of installed capacity. Although this is likely to remain relatively small in the near term, we see the potential for much larger opportunity over the next 4 to 5 years. We are encouraged by ongoing regulatory support and growing acceptance by power systems and utilities in some of the AES' market. To that end, as you may have seen we have recently announced that we have 50 MW under construction including the first energy storage unit in the Netherlands and Northern Ireland. These projects under construction are all additions to our existing platforms. We are well-positioned to take advantage of this emerging business opportunity given AES' international portfolio in eight years of successful and profitable experience operating battery-based energy storage. With that I'll turn the call over to Tom to discuss our first quarter results and full year guidance in more detail. Thomas O\u2019Flynn: Thanks Andre's and good morning everyone. This quarter we continued to benefit from our capital allocation decisions in operational improvements despite some macro headwinds. Further, as anticipated, our cash flow improved as a result of lower working capital requirements. We also made substantial progress toward a key financial goal of improving our credit profile by reducing parent debt, lowering interest expense and extending maturities. Today, I\u2019ll review our first quarter results, including adjusted EPS, adjusted pretax contribution or PTC by strategic business unit or SBU and for the first time proportional free cash flow by SBU which we\u2019ve also included in our 10-Q. Now I\u2019ll cover our 2015 capital allocation plan and our 2015 guidance. Turning to slide 16, first quarter adjusted EPS of $0.25 was a penny higher than first quarter 2014. At a high level, we benefited from the following. $0.03 from capital allocation which resulted in 13% lower parent debt and a 3% lower share count relative to last year and a $0.01 net increase from the performance of our businesses with improvements in the U.S. and Andes partially offset by lower contributions from Brazil, Europe and Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean or MCAC. On the negative side, we are affected by a $0.02 impact from a stronger U.S. dollar which appreciated 18% against the Brazilian real, Colombian peso and euro any once an impact from a slightly higher tax rate of 33% this year versus 30% in the first quarter of last year. Now I\u2019ll cover our SBU\u2019s financial performance in more detail on the six slides beginning on slide 17. In the U.S. adjusted PTC increased by 31 million driven by better availability at DPL compared to the first quarter of last year when a couple of DPL generations plants were not available during the polar vortex. Proportional free cash flow increased 74 million, reflecting a lower working capital requirements this year compared to during the extreme cold of last year.  In Andes, PTC increased 38 million primarily due to better availability at our plants in Chile, however proportional free cash flow declined by 6 million due to timing of collections and higher maintenance capital expenditures. In Brazil, PTC decreased 48 million driven by FX and operating performance, perhaps the decline is driven by our generation business Tiet\u00ea, you may recall that last year Tiet\u00ea benefited from spot sales at favorable prices due to lower contract levels during the first half of the year. This benefit was more of the timing issue of Tiet\u00ea at the purchase and spot market in the second half.This year Tiet\u00ea\u2019s contracts levels are flat in the first and second so we expect contributions to be evenly distributed. Additionally, Sul one of our utilities had lower results due to lower sales volume and higher fixed cost proportional free cash flow increased 15 million primarily driven by higher collections pass through energy purchases built during 2014 offset by lower operating performance.  In MCAC, PTC declined 15 million largely driven by lower margins in the Dominican Republic, where revenues are partially indexed to oil prices as well as lower availability. This impact was partially offset by improved hydrology in Panama, proportional free cash flow improved by 55 million primarily driven by improved working capital in El Salvador and Puerto Rico.  In Europe, adjusted PTC decreased by 30 million half which is due to lower contributions from the sales of Ebute in Nigeria and our UK win businesses, remaining half is largely from unfavorable foreign currency impacts. Proportional free cash flow increased by 21 million driven by higher collections at Maritza which was 60% higher than the first quarter of 2014. Finally in Asia, PTC was essentially flat after taking into account the impact from the sale of 41% of Masinloc in the third quarter of last year offset by the onetime charge recorded in the Masinloc in first quarter of \u201914 related to the market spot price adjustment. Proportional free cash flow decreased 37 million due to Masinloc sale and higher working capital requirements. Turning to slide 23, in summary overall we earned 252 million in adjusted PTC during the quarter and an increase of 9 million from last year and we generated 265 million a proportional free cash flow, representing a doubling from 129 million in last year\u2019s first quarter. As you may recall, working capital was a drag on our results last year and as reflected in our first quarter results, we\u2019re seeing recovery. Now to Slide 24 and our parent capital allocation plan for the year. Regarding sources on the left hand side, the only update from our last call is an increase of 100 million in equity proceeds from asset sales from the sale of the Armenia Mountain Wind project in Pennsylvania and the sale of 40% of our interest in the IPP4 Plant in Jordan. This brings our total available discretionary cash for 2015 to roughly 1.6 billion. We continue to expect parent free-cash-flow of 525 million this year with 10% to 15% average annual growth through 2018. Turning to the uses on the right hand side of the slide, in addition to the dividend, we also plan to invest about 350 million in our subsidiaries, 60% of which is IPL and has already been funded. We\u2019ve invested 345 million in prepayment and refinancing of parent debt to balance asset sales and planned share buybacks. And finally, we repurchased 42 million of shares year-to-date and expect to invest at least 324 million this year, which assumes that we use 300 million of the 400 million we purchased, authorized in February. This leaves 200 million of discretionary cash to be allocated this year. Turning to our parent debt profile on Slide 25. Since our last call, we prepaid 315 million of parent debt, bringing our total parent debt reduction since the end of 2011 to 1.5 billion or a 25% reduction. In early April, we also refinanced another 500 million in near term parent debt maturities. These transactions resulted in a reduction in our near term maturities to only a 180 million over the next four years and reduced the average interest rate from 6.3% to 5.6%. We also continue to optimize the capital structure of certain subsidiaries and affiliates such as Guacolda in Chile, where 830 million in long term debt was refinanced in April at about 4.5% demonstrating the strong credit quality and market access of our businesses. Now beginning on Slide 26, I\u2019ll discuss our adjusted EPS guidance for this year, which is based on the following assumptions. Currency forward curves as of March 31st, which reflect roughly 10% appreciation versus the U.S. dollar compared to year-end curves for the Brazilian Real, Colombian Peso and the Euro, commodity forward curves as of March 31st, which reflects roughly a 5% to 10% decline for oil and gas, and the current outlook for hydro in Latin America, which is in line with our expectations except in Brazil. In the rainy season there was drawing to close and reservoir levels are currently at about 35% and are expected to be about 37% at the end of May. We believe that the government is unlikely to call for rationing this year, given these levels.  That said, the system continues to face a hydro generation shortfall, which has a financial impact on Tiete, it previously had built a $0.05 impact into our guidance, based on having to cover 15% to 17% of our contract in the spot market. We now expect the shortfall to be 17% to 19% due to continued high thermal dispatch. We expect this will add another $0.02 to the hydro impact this year. We\u2019ve also incorporated a modest decline in demand at Sul in Brazil resulting in an incremental impact of another penny. Now turning to Slide 27, as we discussed on our last call, our adjusted EPS guidance is $1.25 per share to $1.35 per share, which when we provided in late February was based on currency and commodity curves as of December 31st. The impact of updating these curves based on the sensitivities we\u2019ve disclosed $0.05. However, we\u2019ve been proactive in hedging our downside which reduced the FX and commodity impact by $0.03. Further as I just discussed, we\u2019re incorporating an additional $0.03 impact from poor hydrology and demand in Brazil. We\u2019ve also included a penny benefit from the completion of the Vietnam project, slightly ahead of our internal projection. Bottom-line is that although we\u2019re facing some headwinds, we\u2019re managing the impacts and therefore reaffirming our EPS guidance range.  At the same time as you can see on Slide 27, we remain confident on our portfolio visibility to generate strong cash flow. We\u2019re affirming our proportional free cash flow guidance of 1 billion to 1.35 billion which after subsidiary debt period provides us with about 525 million in parent free cash flow. We\u2019ll continue to create value by investing in this strong and growing cash flow to maximize returns to share holders. With that I\u2019ll now pass it back to Andr\u00e9s. Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Thanks, Tom. To summarize, we are encouraged by the continued successful execution of our strategy and with the resilience of our platform and the opportunities that it provides increased shareholder value. As we laid out on our last call for 2015, our priorities are to pull all levers to achieve our financial objectives despite headwinds from poor hydrology in Brazil and lower foreign exchange and commodity prices, complete the 1,240-megawatt Mong Duong project in Vietnam, which will be a major contributor to our growth. We have already brought this plan online six months ahead of schedules. Resolve Maritza's outstanding receivables issue, we\u2019ve signed an MOU with NEK and expect to execute a binding agreement by the third quarter. Continued to execute on our platform expansion opportunities and bringing financial partners, we expect to have financial partners on all of our large projects. Reduced parent debt and improved our credit profile by prepaying and refinancing shorter term maturities. And as always allocate our discretionary capital in such a way as to maximize share holder returns by competing growth projects against share repurchases.  Now, I would like to open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS. Your line is open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So first quick question, more at a high level; in terms of future growth opportunities, you talked about $300 million to $400 million in equity investment potential. Where do you expect those dollars to trend towards? I suppose A, as you think about buybacks as shares at Tiete would be more in that direction? And then B, in the context of growth investment, obviously, you've heard a lot in the media around storage [indiscernible] as well as your own efforts in DG in the latest quarter. I'd be curious if you could talk to opportunities there, as well as Puerto Rico, in terms of where those respectively fit within the growth buckets? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Okay. Thanks Julien. Well, all as I said, we expect to have allocated about $300 million to $400 million to the future growth project. Of course this would be leveraged by bringing in financial partners. Now, the exact amount will depend on the projected return of those projects and value we create by buying back our shares. So, they will be competing. This is just to give us sort of the range where we see those projects. We also said that compared to what is currently under construction we see a heavier weighting towards natural gas, renewables and energy storage.  Now, our energy storage business I think is quite different from -- and quite unique actually that we have been at this for 8 years. We make money at it. We\u2019ve been successful, and we have a product that integrates several different usage. So, we have sort of the complete package sort of plug and play. I think that\u2019s one of the reasons we were successful in Southern California bid last year. So, we see this as a growing market in the U.S. California is taking the lead by requiring utilities to have 1,325-megawatts of energy storage by 2020. And we see this trend going across the country in different place. So, again we\u2019re very well positioned to take advantage of it and we have been successful. We\u2019re also opening up new markets. In the latest ones, we\u2019re already in Chile; we\u2019re looking at Northern island and Netherland.  So, it\u2019s one, let's say technology has three different uses. On the one hand you can use it for capacity release like we do Chile which allows you -- you don\u2019t have to hold back 5% of thermal generation because you have a battery. You can use it for ancillary services as we use it in PJM with Tiete. And you can also use it at the Peaking facility which will be the main use in California. So, the different markets, we see it developing, but we\u2019re a big company. So, to really be a needle mover we see it a couple years out. What we really want to be here is not too far ahead of the curve, but we want to be sort of somewhat ahead of the curve and that\u2019s really our strategy here and we think we\u2019re well positioned. So just like in the past when I talked about bringing in partners and said this was an idea, we\u2019ll see how this develops before giving any sort of guidance about say larger numbers of three years to five years out. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And then just running here more specifically at the quarter, I suppose why not more repurchases just as what about the timing here just as you execute on the authorization this year. And then subsequently in terms of the 2015 guidance, would it be fair to say the lower half just to be clear in terms of I think there\u2019s a net $0.04 negative if you add up all those items? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Well, I\u2019d take the second question first. I think it\u2019s a little early in the year to give guidance within the guidance. We've reaffirmed all of our metrics and as you know we guide on cash flow metrics as well as earnings metrics. So again overall, we feel we had a good quarter. In terms of the amount of buybacks, we just did a major re-financings and used $345 million for that and so we\u2019re committed to use as Tom said in his speech around $300 million this year towards share repurchases and we maintain that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ali Agha from SunTrust. Your line is open. Ali Agha : Andr\u00e9s my first question relates to Brazil. For the last several years now it\u2019s been a source of disappointment for you and not only we\u2019re dealing with the hydro situation, but it looks like there is a upheaval or regarding the political outlook, the economic outlook at least under the current administration. I\u2019m just curious, what is your view on Brazil? Why is it still a core market for you? And wouldn\u2019t it be better for the AES platform if you would either substantially reduce or maybe even out of Brazil, given all these other growth opportunities you\u2019ve been telling us about? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : I think first, I think we\u2019ve been very good sellers and managers of our portfolio. If you look at the close to $3 billion that we\u2019ve raised in our asset sales since 2011 and the prices we got out of. If you think of Brazil, I think starting in 2006, we started to reduce our position in Eletropaulo and we also spun-off the telecom and sold that as well I think right at the right timing of the market. So actually if you take a longer term perspective. I think our performance in Brazil over this period has been good. Now there\u2019s no question, that it has been affected by economics and political factors but most of the hydrology, quite frankly. So thinking about our position in Brazil, we have 2,600 megawatts of hydro in Tiete. We also have about $500 million of leverage capacity which we\u2019ve not used at Tiete, so it provides us with an opportunity. And yes, there are droughts and they are cyclical. I mean this year we\u2019re entering into mild -- actually it\u2019s been declared already a mild to medium El Nino which means going back to more sort of normal weather patterns as we\u2019ve seen in the other countries. So that will pass.  Now politically Brazil I think it\u2019s shown on the one hand significant institutional strength given the -- as everybody is aware the issues around Petrobras and the tax authorities and the independence of the judiciary. I think they\u2019ve also named the very strong Minister of Economy Joaquim Levy and we\u2019ve had some -- been able in some small meetings with him and seen what his plans are and we feel very encouraged by it. So I think everybody feels that 2015 will be a difficult year in Brazil. The economy is in contraction. Tom mentioned it in his comments that we see a contraction especially in Sul in terms of demand. But having said that, I think that as they take the right measures and move towards a primary surplus, Brazil is a country with a tremendous opportunity and you can\u2019t sort of come in and come out of large massive capital intensive projects like us. So you have to have a footprint there. So I think we\u2019ve reduced it appropriately and we\u2019re well positioned to look at opportunities going forward. Ali Agha : Secondly the $200 million of cash that you have not yet allocated; can you just give us a sense of from a priority point of view, what would be the priority for that use of cash? And you talked about using up 300 million out of the 400 million of the authorization, but just curious the incremental 200 million, where do you think that\u2019s going to be spent? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Quite practical, that will depend. We\u2019ve laid out what our strategy is and what our considerations are and we have restated our commitment to buy back $300 million of shares. And so we\u2019ll see where that -- we allocated, but we\u2019re going to follow our strict capital allocation or procedures which we\u2019ve done today. But I really can't give you more color than that early. Ali Agha : Last question, the two assets sales that you announced today. Can you just remind us or let us know, what\u2019s roughly the annual net income that goes away as a result of those sales? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : It\u2019s a modest amount Ali. The Armenia Mountain wind project was the second part of the wind that we did earlier. And that would have a relatively attractive I guess PE from our standpoint. And then the Jordan project was a partial sell-down. I think if you add them together the PE\u2019s around 13 -- so what said it is 7 million to 8 million, they got to take -- you'd flip that versus a 100. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Stephen Byrd : I wanted to follow-up just on Julien\u2019s question on storage. You\u2019ve been very active for a number of years in storage. As you think about ways that you can monetize that advantage, do you envision that would be more in the form of continuing to win RFPs or are there ways that others might want to utilize the expertise that you\u2019ve developed either through joint ventures or effectively selling the sort of energy management capabilities you\u2019ve developed? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Thank you for the question. Today, we've basically put the energy storage units on our platform. And this has given us several advantages. First is that we knew markets well. Then we also had a ongoing dialogue with the regulator, because one of the bigger issues with energy storage is to get regulatory approval. We know the benefits that it has for stabilizing the grid, but it\u2019s a question of how you\u2019re going to get paid for sometimes for those services, if there is not a sort of active ancillary market. So at the first steps, we put it on Chile, we put it in DP&L, we\u2019re also looking at putting on our California platforms, possibly in the future IPL and other places. But there are two steps, one is really identifying the use of the energy of the batteries and the second is getting the regulatory approval. So we see opening up markets where we\u2019re present like the Netherlands, like Northern Ireland and continue with that successful strategy. Now in terms of how to monetize that beyond our platforms and it really would be to the situations where we could actually install the advancing product as we call it, which includes our IP, includes the batteries, includes how to operate it. In the market where we\u2019re present, we could put it on somebody else's platform. Essentially, for example let\u2019s say we\u2019re selling energy to a utility and they would like to rate these assets, we can do that as well. So that\u2019s one way that we could grow more quickly than just let's say putting it in operating ourselves. And we\u2019re looking at -- there we\u2019re now talking to people. So again we\u2019re well positioned. We just think that, this is a market that has to develop. And one of the big challenge is again is to get the appropriate regulatory approvals and also have to demonstrate how to choose. Once you put a unit into a market and people see that it functions very well, then we expect to have an increase in demand. So that\u2019s how we see going about it. Now, if we put it on a platform, where we have a partner, for example say in Chile, or in IPL that will participate in that asset that we\u2019re putting on. And we really managing from a center of excellence here at Corp, but pushing out the implementations into the businesses. So again you know this has worked very well. And we think this is an idea of whose time has come. But we see that the U.S. market is most immediate one. We see this is going -- and works particularly well for example on smaller grids islands and we\u2019re located in a lot of islands and smaller grids, from the Philippines to Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Northern Ireland, Dominican Republic. There are a lot of places you can use it or places for example like Chile which due to the nature of the grid look like islands. You have certain constraints. So for all those reasons again we\u2019re optimistic where we think we\u2019re in the leading edge and we\u2019ll continue to push this product forward in numerous markets. Stephen Byrd : That\u2019s very helpful color. I wanted to shift over to renewables growth. We're seeing, and I guess, what I perceive as some fairly aggressive competitors in the marketplace with -- many with yield of course. Could you just talk at a high level to the degree of competition you are seeing either for -- just on an absolute return level, or in terms of just business developments? Are you seeing a change at all, in terms of competition? Or do you feel that, given how long you have been in your core markets, you still see numerous advantages for AES, as you look at renewables growth? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Yes, I think you said it right. The big advantage we have is putting among to our existing businesses and understanding these markets. And I think that we\u2019ve seen situations for example at certain time say wind in Brazil, where prices were very expensive, competition was very aggressive; and I think we\u2019re very judicious about where to put our money in. Now we\u2019ve sold part of our joint venture Silver Ridge to people who have impressive global plans for utility scale solar. And we did in part, because it\u2019s not on our strategy of using our platforms. We are much more efficient, maybe you take all in costs which at the end of the day that\u2019s what matters from development to operating, these plans, even financing and rather than doing sort of one-by-one project financings, really doing at under the umbrella of an existing business. So for example in Chile which is a very competitive market and it had about a 1000 megawatts of renewables that are coming on the grid. We\u2019re building out the 20 megwatt solar. We have permits up to 200. And we\u2019ll do it to the degree that we get PPAs. Of course, the issues with solar, that you only have energy 8 to 10 hours a day. So having the backup of an existing facility gives us a lot more levy in terms of what we can put together. And also technologically we can combine this as we do in Laurel Mountain, where we combined wind with energy storage. This makes a more attractive offering. So really that\u2019s our strategies to put it together. Not to compete just on low returns for this project in many of the markets. And our strategy to date in terms of getting lower cost capital is really been in the partnerships and bringing on partners. And I think we\u2019ve been quite effective in that to date. We have over $2.5 billion that we have raised which is quite a lot of money if you consider it in terms of increasing our ability to larger projects, our ability to fine-tune what our exposure is. And so we\u2019ll continue to use that in renewables as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Greg Gordon : Tom, the $0.01 of operating performance improvement you had in the quarter. You don\u2019t have a commensurate assumed increase or decrease in earnings within the $1.25 to $1.35 guidance range associated with operating performances. Is that because sort of quarter specific, or is it just too early in the year to know how much you\u2019re going to sort of gain from that as you annualizes the things you did in the first quarter? Thomas O\u2019Flynn: It\u2019s probably a little early Greg and obviously there is a lot of moving parts. We call that few, not all. I think the one thing that does jump out was DPL. It had improved performance. We didn\u2019t have to pull out what\u2019s actually, that was one thing that jumped off. Greg Gordon : And then at what point during the year -- if you start to see yourselves potentially towards the midpoint or high-end of guidance, or sort of midpoint or low-end of guidance; do you pull the trigger on capital allocation on that 200 million that remains. Because obviously further in the year, you go, under a scenario where you\u2019re getting behind and it's sort of too late to pull that lever. And in the flip side being, if you\u2019re doing fine, you want to find out -- probably want to hold that money back and think more flexibly about it. So in the context of where you are, how you think things are trending, when do you think we\u2019re getting update on that? Thomas O\u2019Flynn: We\u2019ll certainly do it quarter-to-quarter, we try to look ahead here and that\u2019s what we felt very comfortable saying that we do 300 million of the 400 million that we authorized a couple of months ago, that would bring our share repurchase up to 3 and 340 whatever it would be. So, we\u2019ll do it quarter-by-quarter. Also keep in my mind to the extend we see capital allocation opportunities, let\u2019s say in early 2016 we may end up '15 with a higher balance than just working capital would require. So, we do look at this hard. We do compete all projects, all businesses whether it be a small storage or whether it be larger new build, we compete everything against share repurchase and we\u2019ll continue to do that and keep you posted. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Turnure from JPMorgan. Your line is opened. Chris Turnure : I wanted to get an update on California re-powering. You guys were obviously successful there, back in the fall, with both the gas units and the storage. But could you give us some color here, on the potential for future gas projects there and storage, as well, to some degree, and timing and next milestones around those? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : I would say, of course additional gas units have to based on sort of RFBs and bids, which if they come we still have the capacity to compete on those but really have nothing to report there. In terms of energy storage as I said California has a goal of 1,325 megawatts. Our commitment southern California I think is 100 megawatts, so there is a lot of room there for more. So, we really have to see. But you know it\u2019s 2020. We will be very active in California seeking to increase our footprint there and to the measure that we get, we on additional bids; of course we\u2019ll keep you informed. So, I think short term, certainly energy storage I see significant possibilities for growth in California for the next couple of years. Chris Turnure : And then going back to the re-securing of coal in India, and that's four projects, so it's not going to be online for a while. Could you talk to how the re-contracted situation compares to the original deal that you had, in terms of your growth plans? And if this is going to materially negatively affect any future projects that you were contemplating there? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Not really, there was this scandal, say in India, we call Coal Gate and when they looked at the coal allocations, we weren\u2019t involved in any way in it. But they cancelled all 214 coal allocation [audio gap] OPGC has entered into a joint venture with the state government of Orissa. So, it's really JV of our JV, and so our holdings in this company will be like 25%; that would be the operator of the mine. No, we don\u2019t see any issues at this time. It\u2019s the same two coal blocks. It\u2019s the same amount of 2,640 megawatts. So, it would support OPGC2 and could support, and again we\u2019re not -- there is nothing specific. But it could support OPGC3. And we see nothing negative at this stage from the reallocation of the coal and the construction of the plant is proceeding according to plan. So, again, we sort of -- the plant was proceeding and as we straightened out the coal allocation issue, so, we\u2019re back to where we were at the beginning. Actually the one difference is that it\u2019s -- this joint venture is with the state government of Orissa. Chris Turnure : Okay. And then regarding future expansion in India, the economics have not meaningfully changed for any projects versus what you were thinking before. Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Nothing is changed to date. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Greg Orrill from Barclays. Your line is open. Greg Orrill : So you reaffirmed the multi-year earnings guidance. You had some impacts in the quarter around in 2015 around the sensitivities that you were able to offset to some extent with hedging. As you look forward into 2016 and beyond, do you feel like these things you have to offset that or capital allocation and operations or maybe other things, other investments to offset those the negative move from sensitivities, so do you feel like you\u2019re kind of in the same place? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Yes, I\u2019d tell you again. We have nothing really new to report at this time. And as you sort of pointed out that sensitivities move, I mean certain FX and some of the commodities have actually improved since the closing date of March 30th, in the last couple of weeks, there\u2019s been some strengthening of the currencies to help offset some of that. What we would see as you say operational improvements, some of the projects, shorter term projects, some of the sort of energy storage that we put online this year can come on by 2016; also if we do any additional fogging, which also increases megawatts at a very low cost. For us things like the in-and-out terminal; basically the ability to re-export LNG from the Dominican Republic that maybe late sort of 2016; so those are mainly the things that we see at present. And of course capital allocation would be another tool that we have. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Charles Fishman from Morningstar. Your line is opened. Charles Fishman : First, congratulations to your contract at Mong Duong; that safety record is phenomenal. And second -- the only question I had left was on Slide 24, I just wanted to confirm on that the third bullet point about the 214 million from your partner IPALCO, the Canadian partner. That\u2019s not an increase in their equity piece, that\u2019s just consistent timing with respect to your original announcement of their equity contribution in IPALCO, correct? Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Yes. That\u2019s correct. And thank you for mentioning the sort of safety record at Mong Duong. We\u2019re very proud of that and we do have a sort of lot of visitors who come to see us, how we were able to accomplish that in Vietnam. Charles Fishman : Somebody that started out in the construction business; so I can tell you that that safety record is really strong. Thank you. That was the only question I had. Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert : Okay. Well we thank everybody for joining us on this call today. As always the IR team will be available to answer any questions you may have. Thank you and have a nice day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Alica, and I will be your conference operator for today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the AES Corporation Q2 2015 Financial Review. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Ahmed Pasha, you may begin. Ahmed Pasha : Thanks, Alice. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2015 earnings call. Our earnings release presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom O\u2019Flynn, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will now turn the call over to, Andres. Andres? Andres Gluski : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2015 earnings call. Today, we reported second quarter EPS of $0.25 and proportional free cash flow of $62 million and we are reaffirming our 2015 guidance ranges for all metrics despite facing increased headwinds from foreign currencies. Before Tom and I provide more color on our results for the second quarter and first half of the year, allow me to review our progress on the priorities for 2015 that I provided on our earnings call in February. First, we are making good progress to reach closure on key pending issues that could impact some of our businesses. At Eletropaulo in Brazil, we have had a reasonable outcome in our four year rate case. At Maritza in Bulgaria, important milestones have been reached towards the resolution of our outstanding accounts receivable. Second, we are executing on our construction program and leveraging our platforms. In April, we commissioned our 1.2 gigawatt Mong Duong plant in Vietnam six-month early and under budget. Our remaining $7 billion construction program is advancing on schedule and we expect to bring 6 gigawatts online by the end of 2018. In July, we also broke ground on three new energy storage projects, including our first two in Europe. Third, we are expanding our access to capital through partnerships at the project and business level. Today, I\u2019m very pleased to announce that we are forming a new 50/50 joint venture with Grupo BAL to invest in power and related infrastructure projects in Mexico. And finally, regarding capital allocation, we have delivered on our commitment to invest at least $325 million in share repurchases. Today, we are announcing that we intend to utilize the approximately $100 million left on our buyback authorization during the remainder of this year. In 2015, between buybacks and dividends, we will return $700 million to shareholders or approximately 8% of our current market cap. I will provide more detail on these achievements in a movement, but now I\u2019d like to briefly discuss our financial results and our expectations for the remainder of the year on slide four. Our year-to-date 2015 adjusted EPS of $0.50 is in line with our results of last year and our proportional free cash flow of $327 million is well ahead of first half 2014 results. Our earnings and cash flow are typically weighted towards the second half of the year. We expect our second half results to benefit from improved availability due to less plant maintenance, better hydrology in Latin America and higher collections in Bulgaria and the Dominican Republic. Although, there is still a lot of work to be done to deliver on stronger cash flow in the second half of the year, we remain confident that we will achieve our financial guidance for 2015. Now, let\u2019s discuss some key issues at our businesses in Brazil on slide five. As we discussed on prior calls, we have seen a decline in electricity consumption in Brazil, which is the result of the economic recession and higher energy prices. Today, economists are projecting a 2% contraction of GDP for 2015. In addition, dry hydrology is leading to high electricity prices by requiring the dispatch of more expensive thermal energy. As a result, we are forecasting a 4% year-over-year decrease in volume at our Brazilian utilities in 2015. Nonetheless, we have already factored in the softness in our prior forecast. As a reminder, every 1% change in volume in our Brazilian utilities has a $7 million pretax impact on our bottom line. Turning now to hydrology on slide six. In Brazil, we have seen rainfall improve more than expected since our last call. In July, rainfall was 156% of the long-term average and reservoir levels are projected to be 37% by the end of August materially higher than the 20% levels at the beginning of the year. Improvement in hydrology in Brazil is reflected in spot prices, which are now around 120 reis per megawatt hour significantly lower than last year. We now see the risk of rationing electricity in Brazil in 2015 as remote, but we continue to expect a negative earnings impact of $0.07 per share from poor hydrology this year. In Panama, we are observing a return to normal hydrology and spot prices are about $100 per megawatt hour, one-third of the prices we saw last year. In Colombia, our 1 gigawatt hydro plant Chivor is experiencing stronger inflows close to the historical average. While in the rest of the country, inflows are 90% of the long-term average. Turning to slide seven, we have received approval for Eletropaulo\u2019s four-year tariff reset. This outcome sets a strong foundation for predictable cash flow and earnings from this business through 2019. Lastly, we have successfully negotiated the restructuring of Brasiliana, where we own various businesses in partnership with BNDES, the state-owned development bank. Through this restructuring, we are separating our generation business, Tiet\u00ea, from other businesses under the Brasiliana umbrella. This separation will give us more control of operations and capital allocation decisions at Tiet\u00ea. Once this transaction is completed, we will be in a more favourable position to grow Tiet\u00ea by tapping into approximately $500 million of debt capacity at this business. Turning to slide eight, as you may recall, in April, Maritza signed an MoU with its offtaker, NEK, whereby Maritza would receive a full payment of all arrears, which as of June 30 were $281 million in exchange for a reduction in the capacity price of the long-term PPA. Since our last call, we have secured the required approvals from the project lenders and from the Bulgarian regulator. At the same time, the government of Bulgaria has taken concrete steps to improve NEK\u2019s financial position. Parliament has approved the energy sector reforms to support NEK through a new 5% tax on generators income as well as allocating all proceeds from the sale of the state\u2019s CO2 allowances to NEK. Finally, the regulator announced an increase in the tariff of up to 20% for certain classes of industrial users and reduce NEK\u2019s commitment to procure more expensive renewable energy. These steps will strengthen NEK\u2019s financial position and allow the Bulgarian public sector to raise the necessary financing to pay their outstanding receivables. We expect to sign a binding agreement and collect on all arrears in the second half of the year. Collecting from NEK will be an important contributor to the improvement in our free cash flow in the second half of the year. Now let\u2019s turn to our progress towards our strategic objectives beginning with construction on slide nine. Our construction program is the most important driver of our 10% to 15% average annual growth in free cash flow over the next few years. This strong growth in cash flow is the foundation for our commitment to a 10% annual dividend increase as well as all other capital allocation decisions. From 2015 through 2018, we expect to commission 7 gigawatts of new capacity in comparison with roughly 600 megawatts we brought online in the three years from 2012 through 2014. Through June, we\u2019ve already brought online 1.3 gigawatts, which is nearly 90% of the capacity we plan to commission in 2015. Moving onto slide 10, our remaining 5.8 gigawatts under construction are progressing well and remain on time and on budget. As you can see on the slide, roughly 80% of this new capacity is in the Americas. As a reminder, total CapEx for our projects currently under construction is $7 billion, but the AES\u2019 equity commitment is only $1.3 billion and all but $400 million has already been funded. We expect an average return on equity from these projects of more than 15%. Turning now to slide 11, as we discussed on our last call, we achieved commercial operation on our 1.2 gigawatt Mong Duong project in Vietnam six months early and under budget. The plant is operating at full load and will help meet Vietnam\u2019s rapidly growing demand for electricity and provides us with a solid platform in the country. Moving on to slide 12. We are the world leader in battery-based energy storage with 86 megawatts of installed capacity. We are seeing growing regulatory support and greater acceptance by utilities in our markets. As a result, we recently broke ground on three new energy storage projects totaling 40 megawatts in three countries. We are consolidating our global leadership and now have a total of 70 megawatts of energy storage under construction that we expect to come online through 2016 and 200 more megawatts in late stage development. We are very well-positioned to continue to take advantage of this emerging business opportunity given AES' portfolio and eight years of successful and profitable experience operating battery-based energy storage. Turning to the new joint venture we are forming in Mexico on slide 13. Today, we announced that we signed an MoU with Grupo BAL, a Mexican business conglomerate with a market cap of $11 billion to pursue new power desalinization and natural gas projects. Grupo Bal is one of the largest and most respected business groups in Mexico and one of Grupo Bal subsidiaries, Grupo Penoles is the off-taker of our TEP plant in Mexico. As you may know, Mexico is in the process of implementing new energy sector reforms, which will allow for greater private sector participation. Over the next 10 years, it is estimated that Mexico will need 25 gigawatts of new or replacement generation. We have owned and operated a successful generation business in Mexico for more than 15 years and now with Grupo Bal we\u2019re poised to take advantage of the opening of the energy sector. Turning to slide 14, looking at growth opportunities beyond our projects currently under construction, all of which we expect to complete by 2018, our future project mix is likely to be heavily weighted towards natural gas and renewable, while using our platforms to provide energy storage, desalinization and LNG related services. In particular, in arid and semi-arid regions such as Chile, where our plants on the coast are already providing desalinization for their own needs, long-term desalinated water contracts can be an attractive business. Using existing infrastructure and permits significantly reduces the cost of providing desalinated water to third-parties such as municipal water authorities, mining and industrial customers. Based on all of the opportunities we see across our portfolio, we believe we can invest $300 million to $400 million of AES equity in attractive growth projects each year, which is consistent with the amount of equity we are currently contributing to our growth projects. This amount of equity investment is quite moderate considering the strong growth in our free cash flow. In addition, we can use the debt capacity at our existing businesses such as Brazil, Chile, the Philippines and the Dominican Republic to fund growth projects. Recycling capital has been and will remain an integral part of our strategy. Over the past four years, we have raised $3.1 billion in asset sale proceeds and another $2.5 billion in partner equity at the business and project level. These actions have permitted us to reposition our portfolio, pay down our debt, improve risk adjusted returns, and accelerate our growth profile. Before turning the call over to Tom, I would like to emphasize that as we have demonstrated to date, we will continue to compete all new investments against share repurchases in order to ensure that we are maximizing risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. To that end, as you can see on slide 15, we are returning $700 million to our shareholders in 2015, which is 8% of our current market cap. We have returned a total of $2 billion to shareholders since September 2011 and reduced parent debt by $1.5 billion or 25% while significantly lessening it\u2019s average tenure. With that I will turn the call over to Tom to discuss our second quarter and year-to-date results and full-year guidance in more detail. Tom O\u2019Flynn: Thanks Andres and good morning everyone. Our first-half results and the reaffirmation of our guidance demonstrate the benefits of our proactive actions to mitigate the impact from currency devaluation in other macro factors we\u2019ve experienced over the last several months. Today, I\u2019ll review our second quarter results, including adjusted EPS, adjusted pretax contribution or PTC by strategic business unit or SBU, proportional free cash flow by SBU, then I\u2019ll cover our 2015 guidance and our 2015 capital allocation plan. Turning to slide 17, second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.25 was $0.03 lower than second quarter 2014. At a high level, we were negatively impacted by the following, $0.04 operating impacts, including timing of plant maintenance of certain businesses, as well as lower demand in contracting strategy in Brazil. These were offset by favorable hydrology in Panama, in Colombia and new businesses coming online. We had a $0.02 impact from a stronger U.S. dollar, which appreciated roughly 20% against the Brazilian Real, Colombian Peso, and the Euro. Finally a $0.02 net impact from other adjustments, primarily the favorable reversal of liabilities in Brazil and Kazakhstan in 2014 offset by the favorable reversal of a liability at Eletropaulo in 2015. On the positive side, we benefited $0.04 from a lower tax rate of 30% this year versus 40% in the second quarter last year and a $0.01 from capital allocation net of asset sales, which resulted in 13% lower Parent debt, and a 4% lower share count relative to last year. Now, I\u2019ll cover our SBU's financial performance in more detail on the next six slides beginning on slide 18. In the U.S., adjusted PTC decreased by $24 million, due to planned maintenance in Hawaii and an IPL, as well as lower wind generation at Buffalo Gap in Texas. Proportional free cash flow was roughly flat, reflecting working capital recovery and lower interest at DPL. In Andes, PTC decreased $23 million, primarily due to the timing of planned maintenance in Chile and Argentina, as well as a weaker Columbian peso. Proportional free cash flow declined by $37 million, due to lower earnings and higher tax payment at Chivor in Colombia versus last year. In Brazil, PTC decreased $74 million. In addition to the $17 million impact from the depreciation of the Brazilian real, the decline was driven by approximately $13 million net impact from liability reversals in each period at our distribution businesses Sul and Eletropaulo. You may also recall that last year our generation business Tiet\u00ea benefitted from spot sales at favorable prices, due to lower contract levels during the first half of the year. This benefit was more of a timing issue as Tiet\u00ea had to purchase in this spot market in the second half. This year, Tiet\u00ea's contract levels are flat in the first and second half, so we expect contributions to be evenly distributed. Last but not least, Sul has been affected by lower demand and higher costs. Proportional free cash flow decreased $18 million, primarily driven by lower operating income at Tiet\u00ea as I just discussed. In MCAC, PTC increased a $11 million, largely driven by improved hydro conditions in Panama, where we generated more this year versus buying in the spot market last year. Panama also benefited from the commencement of operations of our 72 megawatt thermal power barge. Proportional free cash flow improved by $12 million, primarily driven by improved operating performance. In Europe, adjusted PTC decreased by $32 million mainly due to lower energy prices and the timing of planned maintenance at Chilvers [ph] [0:18:16] in U.K. Despite the decline in earnings, proportional free cash flow was up $3 million, largely by improved working capital at Maritza. Finally in Asia, PTC increased $7 million, resulting from the early commencement of operations at Mong Duong in Vietnam, partially offset by the sale of minority interest in Masinloc in the Philippines in 2014. Proportional free cash flow was roughly flat. Turning to slide 24, overall, we earned $251 million in adjusted PTC during the quarter, a decrease of $89 million from last year and we generated $62 million of proportional free cash flow, an increase of $15 million. As you can see on slide 25, year-to-date adjusted PTC declined $80 million, largely driven by lower demand and contracting strategy in Brazil, a stronger U.S. dollar, as well as the net impact from reversal of liabilities in Brazil and Europe. These negative impacts were largely offset by the contributions from new businesses that came online earlier this year in our capital allocation decisions. Our proportional free cash flow increased $151 million to $327 million, primarily due to higher contributions from the U.S. and MCAC, including higher collections at DPL and improved working capital in Puerto Rico. Year-to-date adjusted PTC and proportional free cash flow by SBU are in the appendix of today's presentation. Now to slide 26, comparing our first half results to our full-year guidance, our earnings and cash flow tend to be more heavily weighted towards the second half of the year. Consistent with our prior expectations in the second half of 2015, we expect EPS to benefit from improved availability as a result of planned maintenance that was completed earlier in the year in Chile, the Dominican Republic, and the U.S. Improved hydro conditions in Panama and Colombia, seasonality related to contract generation businesses in the U.S. and Chile as well as IPL, the previously expected benefit from tax opportunities at certain businesses and finally contributions from Mong Duong in Vietnam which came online in first half of the year. Regarding proportional free cash flow, improved results in the second half of the year versus the first half are driven in part by higher operating performance in the second half consistent with our earnings profile. The remaining increase is largely attributable to lower pension and fuel payments and IPL in the U.S., timing of income tax payments and VAT collections at [indiscernible], higher collection of receivables in the Dominican Republic and collection of receivables in Bulgaria, a portion of which will be used at the business for deleveraging and fuel payments. Bottom line is that, we have to execute on our plan, we feel confident in our ability to meet our objectives for the year and we are reaffirming our guidance on all metrics. Our reaffirmed guidance is based on forward curves as of June 30 reflecting a benefit of couple of entities relative to our prior guidance which is based on March 31. Client curves as of July 31 were effectively back to where we were as of March 31. Our gains also assumes the current outlook for hydro in Latin America, which is in line with our expectations and an unchanged full year tax rate of 31% to 33% versus year-to-date 2015 rate of 31%. Assumptions in sensitivities for our guidance are in the appendix of today\u2019s deck. On to slide 27 in our parent capital allocation plan for the year, sources in the left hand side reflect total available discretionary cash for 2015 of roughly $1.65 billion which is $70 million higher than our last call. As a reminder, we previously announced asset sale proceeds in the sale of a portion of our interest in IPALCO and Jordan as well as the sale of the Armenia Mountain Wind farm. Today, we are also announcing the sale of our solar assets in Spain bringing our total asset sale proceeds this year to $573 million. We are also expecting an additional $45 million in return of capital from operating businesses which along with our parent free cash flow provides us with nearly $600 million available for dividend payments and growth, incremental share repurchases and other potential investments. In terms of incremental sources of discretionary cash, as Andres mentioned, we\u2019ll continue to evaluate additional asset sale opportunities which could be $200 million to $300 million annually on average, but maybe lumpy year-to-year. Now to uses on the right hand side of the slide, we plan to invest about $350 million in our subsidiaries, 60% of which is at IPL and is already been funded. We\u2019ve invested $345 million in prepayment and refinancing of parent debt leaving us with only $180 million in parent debt maturities through 2018. Finally, in addition to dividend, we are investing $420 million in our shares, which is $100 million more than we committed to on our last call. This brings total cash returned to shareholders through buybacks and dividends to $700 million for the year. We will continue to beat various investment opportunities to maximize per share value for shareholders. With that, I\u2019ll now turn it back to Andres. Andres Gluski : Thanks, Tom. To summarize, we continue to make steady progress on our objectives specifically we are pulling all levers to achieve our financial objectives despite the headwinds from poor hydrology in Brazil, lower foreign exchange and commodity prices. As I noted, overall hydrology in Latin America is improving as a result of the El Ni\u00f1o phenomena. We have achieved a number of milestones towards resolving Maritza\u2019s outstanding receivables after signing an MOU with NEK in April. We expect to collect outstanding receivables in the second half of the year. We have completed the 1.2 gigawatt Mong Duong project in Vietnam six months ahead of schedule and we are making good progress on the remaining 5.8 gigawatts under construction. We are bringing in financial partners to leverage our platform and maximize overall returns by forming a joint venture with Grupo BAL, a strong partner with significant presence in Mexico. And in 2015, we are investing than a $1 billion in returning cash to our shareholders and debt pay downs, in addition to the $350 million we are investing in profitable growth projects. In conclusion, in line with the plans we laid out on previous calls, we continue to leverage our platforms and allocate our discretionary cash to maximize risk adjusted returns for our shareholders. Now, I\u2019d like to open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Greg Gordon : Thanks. Good morning guys. Andres Gluski : Good morning, Greg. Greg Gordon : Great quarter. Your commitment to capital allocation should be \u2013 is best-in-class. So thank you very much and I know your shareholders are certainly very happy. The question \u2013 sort of an open ended question firstly, there are so many moving parts to the guidance. I know you are on track to hit earnings guidance for the year and doing a little bit better on proportional free cash but if you look at and for the balance of the year versus the plan you laid out in March, is there any specific areas where you\u2019re a little bit ahead or little bit behind of where you would expected? I know overall you are still within the channel. Andres Gluski : I would say that one of the key drivers we have as I mentioned on cash is Maritza and we had said that we would get this in the second half of the year. So we\u2019ve really achieved the important milestones. We are quite impressed with the commitment of the Bulgarian government to fix the electricity sector and parliament approving some \u2013 important reforms. So I think that\u2019s the key component, so we are on track there. I would say hydrology in July was quite frankly a little bit ahead of what we expected. And FX is more or less in line with what we expect. I think if anything, the demand in Brazil is softer \u2013 perhaps a little bit softer than we had expected even though we had those numbers in. So overall, we are kind of on track. I think the main points are that we have some seasonality and some of it in terms of collections, we tend to collect more in the Dominican Republic, we have Bulgaria, those are two discrete factors in the second half. And then we had a number of planned maintenance in the first half which won\u2019t happen in the second half. So that\u2019s sort of overall, it\u2019s not too far from our expectations I would say on a case-by-case basis. Greg Gordon : That\u2019s good because one of your competitors in Brazil had a big disappointment in the second quarter as it pertains to their business. So I think there were some trepidation coming into your call that you might see a downward revision. Thank you. The second question is just to be clear, when you gave the first quarter guidance, you based your projections on March 31 index, so Tom, you\u2019re basically saying that if we roll forward to the end of July, we look a little more or less like we looked like at the end of March, so obviously still inside the guidance range. Tom O'Flynn: Yes, that\u2019s correct. If you have asked us five weeks ago, we would have said we might be $0.01 or $0.02 up but I think we lost that in the last five weeks. So basically back to where we were end of March. Greg Gordon : And then final question from me, the 104 to 204 of discretionary cash to be [implicated][ ph], if the stock price doesn\u2019t respond you guys continuing to execute at what point would you go to the Board and potentially allocate that to further share repurchases? Andres Gluski : Greg, as we\u2019ve said in the past, our Board has been very supportive of our share buybacks and we\u2019ve always been able to go back and get a share repurchase authorization when we felt we needed it. So I think that there is \u2013 our sector has that have been hit in the last month by negativism and certainly that\u2019s been reflected in the stock price and certainly that affects our capital allocation decisions as we are comparing the value of buying back shares with our new projects. Greg Gordon : Okay. Thank you, guys. Thanks again for a great quarter. Tom O\u2019Flynn: Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Your line is open. Ali Agha : Thank you. Good morning. Andres Gluski : Good morning, Ali. Ali Agha : Good morning. Andres, first question to you on Brazil, so as you said the hydro situation appears to be improving but you still have the FX headwinds, the economic and political outlook there continues to be very challenging from what we can tell. I just wanted to get a sense what is your tolerance level to absorb all of this. I mean are you there indefinitely for the long haul regardless of how old this place or how are you thinking about that relative to all the other jurisdictions where you have better opportunities perhaps? Andres Gluski : Sure. I think a lot of our countries have cyclical patterns. Right now Brazil in on the \u2013 certainly not at the peak of one of these patterns. I will remind people I think of two, three years ago. Lot of questions I would get on these calls is why wasn\u2019t I investing more in Brazil and that we were slow. What we did at the time and continue to do today is we only invest when we see long term value. And we really see the value not quite frankly get caught in the trends. I think, you know Brazil is having a recession this year. It will probably have a flat 2017 and is expected, 2016, sorry and expected to pick up in 2017. Brazil is a big market, it is a country which has great potential and I think that us as a company of the Americas we should have a presence in Brazil. Now of course all of our assets we look at, what we consider their long term value. What we could sell them for and how they contribute to a balanced portfolio. So, overall what I would say is that I agree that the economic situations look challenging in Brazil, but realize this is a country with tremendous potential that could come back and we can\u2019t come in and out on a short-term basis.  And the final thing is look we have been very prudent about again investments in Brazil, we still have $500 million of debt capacity at Tiete. So, growth in Brazil will come from leveraging the Brazilian businesses. So, I hope that answers your question, but I think that the point is that they are cyclical patterns; Brazil has a lot of capacity to rebound and as always when times were very good in Brazil we were always looking at what is the value and I would remind people that we sold a lot of Brazil at the peak. We sold our telecom business there for billion dollars. We also sold 50% of our holdings in Eletropaulo back in 2005. So, we will continue to make those adjustments as we see fit. Ali Agha : Okay. The second question, I wanted to just clarify the capital usage plan going forward. If I heard you right, Andres, you were saying you may be investing $300 million to $400 million a year in new opportunities on an annual basis. Your dividend is consuming about $300 million of your cash and that's going to grow at 10% every year. So, where is the cash coming from? Because I'm looking at Parent cash and I think these investments and the dividend, I don't think there's any cash left. So am I missing something here or how is that being funded? Andres Gluski : Well, yes, what you are missing from the equation is what Tom mentioned that we will be selling about $200 million to $300 million in our existing asset platform. So, if you include that the equation does close and realize that as our new plants come online they will be generating more cash as well. Ali Agha : Okay. Got it. And then, lastly, to clarify your point, you benchmark everything obviously against share buybacks. So, are you seeing those opportunities out there that can still give you greater returns on a risk-adjusted basis than buying back your own share, that you're confident you can spend $300 million to $400 million a year on new projects? Andres Gluski : Yes, we do. It really gets back to utilizing our platforms. So, I did mention the example, for example of de-sal. If you \u2013 basically we are upgrading our plants to use reverse osmosis technology and once you have the permit for intake of salt water and discharge of saline and you can basically put these in a modular fashion. These are very attractive opportunities. We are also seeing it in other places where we can add-on energy storage and the new projects we are engaged in. So, what I can tell you is that we are seeing above 15% returns on equity from our projects on average. So, yes, we are seeing a lot of attractive opportunities. Of course we are being very selective with our stock at these prices. Ali Agha : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Turnure with JPMorgan, your line is open. Chris Turnure : Good morning, guys. I wanted to get a sense of the potential for GSF reform in Brazil and to get your opinion on the potential for that in general and then the potential structure if it does materialize. And then also, on the flip side, have you sought an injunction for Tiete there? And how would that work if others are successful with injunctions in penalizing of you and the remainder of guys out there that don't get injunctions? Andres Gluski : Okay. Let me take the first one. This year, GSF will be between 17% and 19% and it\u2019s a considerable cost to the generators. I believe the total is somewhere above BRL 20 billion that people are paying. There has been discussions between the government, the Ministry of Energy and mines and the association such as [indiscernible] as well as you have a [indiscernible] and there has been talk about capping the GSF. The exact amount is being negotiated. Let\u2019s just give a hypothetical so it\u2019s capped 10%. The generators will be compensated for that difference between 7% or 8% additional to the cap for example this year by an extension of their contract so you\u2019d receive a regulatory asset, especially of their concession, you\u2019d receive a regulatory asset equivalent to that amount. So, there is nothing set as of yet. There\u2019s certainly interest from the government interest from the regulators and we\u2019ll keep you informed. In terms of the probability, I think on the previous call I was quite let\u2019s say prudent about this thing, we will see, I think the chances of something like this happening have improved. Regarding the injunction, Tom. Tom O\u2019Flynn: I just see the \u2013 I haven\u2019t got all the details here, but there was initially compensation to one or small group of generators that was actually detrimental to the rest of the generators and we did participate with the larger generator community and saying that any \u2013 any decisions, any compensation should be consistent across the sector. That was some time ago and I believe the discussions are now focused on sector reform as Andre said it goes into compensation that really gets into concession renewal, or mind you our concession is well after [indiscernible] it is 2028. In the GSF of 17 and 19 that\u2019s the number that we\u2019ve had now for a number of months. There is some possibility we\u2019ve seen thermal dispatch come down recently from about 19, I think 15.5 gigawatts which may indicate there could be some greater thermal generation i.e. a little bit of improvement on the GSF, but it\u2019s still far too soon to tell that just news over the last couple of weeks. Chris Turnure : Okay. And then, switching gears, I just wanted to get an update on your Argentinian businesses or business down there. It's a little bit tough to break out in and of itself, how have earnings maybe trended the past couple of years there? And are those trends a function of regulatory changes to power prices? And how do you think about that business going forward, with the potential maybe for other regulatory changes to those power prices? And how do you think about things post the election? Tom O\u2019Flynn: I think that\u2019s a great question. I\u2019d say of course if you take a longer-term view in terms of the past coming to the present you know pricing has deteriorated in Argentina, no question about that. On the other hand, I think we have fared very well from a regulatory position because as you know until last year we are exporting energy from Argentina to Chile, through our TermoAndes plant. We also have the only coal plant in the country. So, we have been selling energy under, in TermoAndes under the [indiscernible] which in the past was more favorable than it is today, but I\u2019d say in general you know we have always been making positive earnings in Argentina. So, even though they\u2019re less to say than they were four, five years ago, they continue to be positive. We have been receiving 96% payment on our accounts receivable, some of these are Fannie Mae bank bonds, these bonds are dollarized, they pay interest and for example like Guillermo brown plant where we have a considerable number of these bonds are basically being used to fund that plant. We\u2019re going to receive that plant, our proportion of it, very soon, it\u2019s being commissioned. So, I think overall in Argentina despite the challenging economic circumstances we\u2019ve done well that the one thing is we haven\u2019t been able to pay dividends out of Argentina for the last two years. Now, looking forward what do we see? I think the elections in October, the two leading candidates either one would be favorable. I think you\u2019ll have a gradual return to market-based pricing and a listing of the exchange controls. So, we have a tremendous asset base in Argentina. Of course, we\u2019re not putting any new money in at this stage, but I think we\u2019ve handled it well and I firmly believe that within a year or two we\u2019ll be paying dividends out of Argentina. It is basically considerably developed country and quite wealthy. So, it\u2019s again, I think it\u2019s probably on the rebound at this stage. Chris Turnure : Okay. Would you characterize what you\u2019ve embedded in your long-term EPS and cash flow guidance as incorporating a lot of upside there or you remain conservative there? Tom O\u2019Flynn: We\u2019re always conservative. So we never embed big upside. So, what I can say is we do expect sort of a continuation of what we\u2019ve been doing there, which I think is managing the situation quite favorably. Chris Turnure : Great. Thank guys. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley, your line is open. Stephen Byrd : Good morning. Tom O\u2019Flynn: Good morning Steve. Stephen Byrd : Wanted to echo Greg\u2019s comments on capital allocations, very clear and I did want to take a little further into that following up on all these questions on the $300 million to $400 million in growth, in addition to asset sales and when you think about all of the other levers at your disposal in terms of just retain cash flow at the country level, the project level or other leveraged capacity etcetera, should we be thinking that those levers are quite significant and therefore could further reduce the amount of true equity at the parent or those more discretionary and not something that we should be thinking of as quite significant offsets in terms of the amount of equity needed at the parent. Tom O\u2019Flynn: Yes, Steven, certainly as we look for growth, we do look to drive as much as we can out of the businesses as possible, I think there are big growth drivers, certainly Hahn Air has been a big driver. They\u2019ve brought in partners, they\u2019ve done project finance and the only equity that's been done in the last few years is a 150 million totally at the Hahn Air level. We did our 70% contribution. So that\u2019s a great example of a multi-billion dollar construction program and instruction in the Hahn Air balance sheet, and Hahn Air cash flow growth as much as possible. I think Andres has mentioned a couple other examples, Dominican Republic, we have some unused debt capacity that\u2019s currently being used to fund a facility upgrade and we look around the business to do that as much as we can. IPO has been growing quite a bit also that really grows in more of a classic utilities down that we maintain a capital structure 55, debt 45, equity 30, more came to the normal utility, but we do that and we\u2019ll continue to look for leveraged capacity at the business, look to see whether a partner for a project or a business can come into help increase the value of the business and or bring in more effectively priced capital and then lastly if you will we\u2019ll look at up to the parent. And the $300 million to $400 million is just a general range. I think that\u2019s the number we\u2019ve been at the last couple of years, you go back I think three years it was more in the mid-twos, so it\u2019s just a general indication. Stephen Byrd : Understood great. And then just shifting over to your announced joint venture, can you just discuss at a high level the nature of the arrangement, is this effectively exclusive on both sides, are there other elements of the joint venture in terms of more specific targets or anything else that you can just a little bit further color on the JV would be appreciated. Andres Gluski : Sure, Grupo BAL is one of the most reputable business groups in Mexico and it has a long tradition having been established around 1901 I believe. They\u2019ve been our off-taker at the TEP plant in \u2013 for the last 10 years and we\u2019ve been very pleased with us. They have another small joint venture with EDP for some wind projects and we have our existing plants of TEG, TEP and [indiscernible] which will be outside this joint venture. However, going forward, it\u2019s exclusive on both side that we\u2019ll exclusively look at new deals. There\u2019s no sort of target that we will invest X amount, it\u2019s really that we will look at these projects together, we both bring strengths, we bring the global size, our successful E&C experience, our ability to manage these plants and they bring the local component and knowledge of the sector. So, Mexico is opening up the energy sector, there are I think going to be a considerable number of bids for power plants not only of CFE, but also of private sector clients and also with our strategy of using our platforms for adjacencies such as desalinization or energy storage or for example LNG services, we can add those on. So, this is a - going forward it will be exclusive 50-50, we both have to agree to make an investment. If one partner does not agree with the investment the other one can make it on its own. So, this is I think very favorable for both sides. It gives us a lot of flexibility and it\u2019s really aiming to leverage off our strengths and the good thing is that we know each other, we\u2019ve been working together for more than a decade. Stephen Byrd : That\u2019s great. Thank you very much. Tom O\u2019Flynn: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie, your line is open. Angie Storozynski : Thank you. I wanted to talk about Eletropaulo. So, you have just concluded a rate case there. What kind of load assumptions do you have embedded in that rate case and secondly is the restructuring of Brazilian having any impact on Eletropaulo? Andres Gluski : Okay. I would say in terms of growth and as we said we\u2019re looking at a decline in growth and this - the numbers we gave are weighted average for Sul and Eletropaulo. The decline in demand is stronger in Sul than it has been in Eletropaulo. I think we\u2019re looking at pretty much flat demand for next year and then growing moderately after that. I mean the long-term growth in Brazil is what you normally expect is about 3% to 4% has been the historical average over the last 10 years. The second is how Brazilian affecting Eletropaulo. As you know in 2005 we sold down 50% of our holdings both us and B&DS of Eletropaulo and we basically took that money and de-levered the company. Then in 2011, we spun off the telecom Achimos [ph] and sold that. So, right now, between the two of us, we have about 32% that is Braziliana has it, we have 16%, roughly a little bit more than 16%. I don't really think that the Braziliana structure has been affecting Eletropaulo directly. I think that the distributors have been I think more fairly treated over the past six months than they had before and that's why you\u2019ve seen a recovery in the place. I mean Eletropaulo\u2019s stock should be up I believe about 70% in dollars this year and in fact the sector it\u2019s been the best performing within the sector by a considerable margin. I think part of that is perhaps it was dropped also more strongly because some of the let's say decisions against us, but we got a good decision on a regulatory asset base, the WAC has been raised over 8%. So these are all favorable things. Now unquestionably other than the regulated part, which as I said the market is recognizing, it\u2019s making certain investments to continue to improve quality of service and it will depend on the recovery of the Brazilian economy. I believe that the Brazilian government is doing the right things at this time and taking some very brave decisions, including cutting spending, raising interest rates and that these will have good long-term effects, but certainly they\u2019re very tough in the short-run, but I really commend their bravery. So, I don\u2019t know if that answers your question. I mean what we see in Eletropaulo is a tough 2016, I\u2019m sorry a tough 2015, a more moderate 2016 and a recovery more in 2017, 2018. Angie Storozynski : Okay. Thank you, just one more, on Mong Duong, so the plant came online six months ahead of time, the hydro conditions across the board seem to be in line with expectations, everything else is in line with expectations. So, should we just see this plant that\u2019s potentially moving you beyond the midpoint of your guidance or what\u2019s the potential offset if it\u2019s not the case? Tom O\u2019Flynn: What I would say is that at this stage we are reaffirming the guidance ranges. I think there are - that\u2019s not only earnings, but cash flow. Certainly, on cash flow depending on where we\u2019d be in the range, the payment at Maritza is obviously a big mover because you talk about the range of a billion, 1.4 billion, 1.350 billion and 280 million will make a difference. On the other hand, right now I would say that we remain within that guidance range. Certainly, we don't see in the five months that are left something that would likely move us outside of those ranges to the upside. Angie Storozynski : Fantastic, thank you very much. Tom O\u2019Flynn: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Orrill with Barclays, your line is open. Gregg Orrill : Yes, thank you. Was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the potential of caps on rationing exposure in Brazil and how that might affect that regulatory asset, might affect you either in magnitude going from the 10% to the 17% to 19% maybe how those things might be recorded financially? Would that help you from an earnings perspective as well as cash flow? Andres Gluski : Let me answer the first part and then Tom can answer the second part how we\u2019re looking. We see - the probability rationing this year is very low. And there are two drivers; one, the government has done a very good job of basically running thermals and saving water, and the rains did come in considerably stronger. Quite frankly as of mid July, the reservoir levels were at 41% which is very high. You should be quite frankly declining at this time of the year. So the likelihood of rationing this year not to say it\u2019s impossible, it\u2019s very remote and if rains continue as expected, it\u2019s not very likely in 2016 again assuming the government continues this policy. In addition to that, you\u2019ve had a decline in demand. So you put those two together, again it\u2019s a much stronger position vis-\u00e0-vis having rationing this year and next than it was before and this year is substantially less. In terms of the regulatory asset, I mean that\u2019s a considerable number but I will leave it to Tom in terms of how much we would actually book. Tom O\u2019Flynn: Yes, Greg. I think you\u2019re ahead of us. If there is something that allowed for Tiet\u00ea concession which is now ends in 2029, allows it to get extended, going to valued the economic value, does it turn into a regulatory asset that we would record, we are still early on to understand the detail. Certainly we\u2019ll look at that from a GAAP standpoint, but I think it\u2019s early to think \u2013 too hard about that. Gregg Orrill : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar Equity. Your line is open. Charles Fishman : Good morning. In 2016, I see in slide 53 that you\u2019re still seeing flat to modest growth. With what\u2019s going on in Brazil with maybe your tax rate returning to a more normalized level, you won\u2019t get as much incremental benefit from Mong Duong because it fortunately came on early. What gets you to the modest growth for next year, realizing its flat to modest growth, the guidance doesn\u2019t change. Andres Gluski : I think that the positives, we have the Cochrane coming on. This is a 552 megawatt construction project in Chile and that\u2019s proceeding very well, and we also have rate based growth at IPL. We completed the 2,400 megawatts of upgrades and then of course you mentioned Mong Duong, but we have a full year. And the other thing is of course capital allocation and it will also depend on hydrology. If we have continued good hydrology and specifically for example in the case of Chivor, Chivor typically has a very \u2013 it\u2019s a very good base that is in. So it tends to have less volatile hydrology than the rest of Columbia. So when you have right now, El Nino, it\u2019s getting \u2013 the rest of Columbia is dry and actually Chivor is at average. And so then actually you get better prices for the energy you sell that you haven\u2019t had contracted. And finally, we expect some normalization of the currencies as well. So all sorts of things that can cause this now. I agree 2016, if we look out the next three years, 2016 is on top this year because 2017 and 2018 we have a lot more projects coming online. The other thing is we realize that on some of these adjacencies such as energy storage or desal, these can be operational in a very short period of time. And desally will depend quite frankly, we have to build a pipeline to a client but some of those cases we don\u2019t. So those are additional things that could help. Charles Fishman : Okay. And then second question Andre, I realize you got a lot more going on in the U.S. but the clean power plant seems to have more benefit towards renewable. I would think that would be good for your storage business. Is that correct? Andres Gluski : Yes, absolutely. I think that the clean power plant let\u2019s say increase because it\u2019s basically what they had laid out before, but accelerates it \u2013 increases the market for energy storage and California has really led the way requiring 1,325 megawatts of utilities to have by 2020. So this I think accelerates the adoption of energy storage. Charles Fishman : And so you\u2019ve got Ohio is going for storage and then California and Europe under construction, is that correct? Andres Gluski : We are not under construction yet in California. That will be in 2019 when we start, but we have 100 megawatts with Southern California. Charles Fishman : Okay. Thanks. Andres Gluski : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mitchell [indiscernible]. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi guys. Could you discuss a little bit on some of the core outages, [indiscernible] mentioned some of its plans that are coned by you, experienced high outage rates in the second quarter and just wanted to get some color from you if you saw that at all of your plans or if it was just like [indiscernible] and what went on and how you guys are working on hopefully fixing that. Bernerd da Santos : Hello, this is Bernerd da Santos. Yes, that plan is [indiscernible] beginning of the year. With the management we have implemented 180 days plan that is ongoing. We have already 30 days. We have our next preview with the team 50 days from now. I was present with the management team two weeks ago in Stuart and we have seen improvement. So we expect that we\u2019re going to calculate whether it was the force outage rates in Stuart by the end of the year. Unidentified Analyst : So you are finding it specifically to add Stuart? Bernerd da Santos : Yes, that\u2019s correct. Unidentified Analyst : And is this going to impact your ability to get into the capacity performance Stuart planned. Tom O\u2019Flynn: No, we\u2019ll factor that in. [indiscernible] are factored in but we would expect as Bernerd said an improving Ephod [ph] overtime. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Great. Thank you so much. Tom O\u2019Flynn: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Your line is open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning guys. Just checking in here, in terms of the next accretion, you guys are talking about for the asset sales and talk about share buybacks in place. What\u2019s the net benefit of the $200 million to $300 million in asset sales you\u2019re contemplating for this year relative to the share buybacks, break even or positive accretion? Tom O\u2019Flynn: That\u2019s probably little positive. I think the overall PE of our sales about 13, we do split that between debt pay down and share buybacks. So net-net, it\u2019s probably about maybe a breakeven \u2013 positive of breakeven. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it, excellent. And then can you just update us on what are the pending finalization of the issues in Bulgaria? From what I understand, that should be happening very soon. Or just is there anything really in the way there to make that happen? Andres Gluski : At this point, we really have all the approvals necessary, so now it\u2019s a question of the Bulgarian public sector raising the funds for the payment. So there is no sort of pending important approval at this stage as basically they have to do the market operations to get the funds and to pay us. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Great. And then lastly in terms of deleveraging the business in South America, what\u2019s the timeline there, just the FX or so I mean how quickly should we expect these asset sales to come up and ultimately what\u2019s your interest in these assets. I presume it\u2019s pretty real [ph]. Andres Gluski : Basically we will look for real value before we leverage up today as we have in the past. When you mentioned asset sales, perhaps I think you\u2019re talking about Petrobras and hydro who may be selling some assets. We certainly look at them. What I want to say is that, we will never grow for growth sake and these really have to makes sense, and they have to make sense which should they in terms of a portfolio, there have to be things which would decrease its hydro risk. So it will depend on their contract position and other thing, so there is nothing really short term on this. We are looking at the possibility of doing something like [indiscernible] for example in Brazil as we did in Panama. But I think the main point is [indiscernible] not AES. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And just remind us what the target leverage at [indiscernible]. Tom O\u2019Flynn: Yeah. We looked at debt-to-EBITDA but right it\u2019s quite unlevered and its dividends are restricted by earnings. So it\u2019s not possible to do a recap and bring money upstairs. So if you want to use the leverage capacity it will be for growth within Tiet\u00ea. And as Andrew said, the growth would be within Tiet\u00ea funds rather than AES. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. And what\u2019s the target leverage for GFA just to get a sense of how much capacity there is today. Tom O\u2019Flynn: We will use about $400 million to $500 million U.S. dollar capacity, that\u2019s back into that \u2013 yeah, there will be capacity so you could obviously gross that up to the extension buying an asset that comes with cash flow, you could use a larger number. And that\u2019s exactly goes upon the coverage ratio. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Thank you guys. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to Ahmed Pasha. Ahmed Pasha : Thank you everybody for joining us in today\u2019s call. As always the IR team will be available to answer any questions you may have. Thank you and have a nice day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Lori and I will be a conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the AES Corporation Q3 2015 Financial Review Call. [Operator instructions] Ahmed Pasha, you may begin your conference. Ahmed Pasha : Thank you, Lori. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter 2015 earnings call. Our earnings release presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom O\u2019Flynn, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that I will now turn the call over to Andres. Andres Gluski : Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our third quarter 2015 earnings call. Since our last call, the global macroeconomic environment has continued to weaken, and we have seen a further drop in foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and economic growth in some of our markets. As you may have seen in our press release, these conditions are reducing our earnings outlook. Despite these challenges, we are taking measures to reduce their impact and will continue to generate strong and growing free cash flow, which we will use to maximize risk-adjusted shareholder returns. Today I will discuss the impact of these macroeconomic factors on our outlook, our mitigation plan and our capital allocation strategy. Then Tom will provide our third quarter results, an update on our 2015 guidance and our capital allocation plans for 2015 and 2016. Beginning with macroeconomic factors I just mentioned, the majority of the decline in our earnings forecast is related to currencies and commodities moving against us as well as the deteriorating economic outlook in Brazil. As you may know, some of our businesses, particularly in Brazil, Colombia and Europe, have been impacted by devaluations of up to 35% in their local currencies. Furthermore, lower oil and electricity prices have a direct impact on our businesses in the Dominican Republic, DP&L and Kilroot. To mitigate the impact of these factors we are launching a $150 million cost reduction and a revenue enhancement initiative. This initiative will include overhead reductions, procurement efficiencies and operational improvements. We expect to achieve a least $50 million in savings in 2016, ramping up to $150 million including modest revenue enhancements in 2018. These bottom line improvements are on top of the $200 million of overhead cost reductions and the $170 million of productivity enhancements we have initiated since 2012. I will discuss these drivers in more detail in a few minutes. Turning to Slide 4. And our expectations for cash flow growth through 2018. Despite being affected by the macroeconomic pressures that I just discussed, our free cash flow remains strong. We are expecting average annual growth in proportional and parent free cash flow of at least 10%. Specifically, in 2016, we expect to generate roughly $1.3 billion of proportional free cash flow which translates to $0.90 per share. We also expect to generate about $625 million in parent free cash flow in 2016, which is 20% higher than our 2015 guidance. Our focus on approving sustainable cash to the parent through more efficient use of cash at our subsidiaries has helped us reduce the impact of macroeconomic headwinds on our parent free cash flow. As you may recall, parent free cash flow is the basis for dividend and capital allocation decisions. Turning to Slide 5, we believe proportional free cash flow is the most important valuation metric for AES as it represents the cash generated at our businesses that can be distributed to the parent or utilized locally to delever or fund growth. Proportional free cash flow is essentially operating cash flow minus maintenance CapEx adjusted for our ownership. In 2016, we expect to generate $1.3 billion in proportional free cash flow. Of this approximately 40% or $500 million is expected to be used to pay down nonrecourse debt at our subsidiaries, which generates equity volume and roughly 15% or $175 million may be retained by our subsidiaries due to timing or other reasons. That leaves us with $625 million of parent free cash flow, which is available for discretionary uses at Corp. Turning now to Slide 6, as a reminder, the projected growth in our cash flow is driven by our projects currently under construction which remain on budget and are expected to come online through 2018. All but $160 million of our $1.1 billion in equity requirements for these projects has already been funded. And we continue to expect average cash returns of around 15%. Turning now to our adjusted EPS guidance beginning on slide 7. In 2016, the impact from microeconomic factors is roughly $0.25. The most significant drivers of our revised guidance are first, the deterioration in the forward curves for commodities and currencies from December 2014 to October 2015 accounts for more than half of the impact, or $0.15, in line with the sensitivities that we provided. Second, we are seeing another $0.05 from more demand in higher interest rates in Brazil, primarily at our utility in Rio Grande do Sul, which has also experienced catastrophic flooding in October. Previously we had been expecting demand growth of 2.5% for Brazil, but we have seen a 5% drop in demand in 2015, and expect no recovery in 2016. Third, there is an additional $0.04 impact from regulatory changes at El Nino. The regulatory changes affect capacity prices in the United Kingdom and ancillary services in the Dominican Republic. Although hydrology, in Latin America has improved, we are still expecting El Nino to have a slight negative impact on our businesses in Brazil and Panama. And finally, we expect offset $0.05 of these headwinds through our new cost savings initiatives. Taking all these factors into account, our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance range is $0.05 to $0.15. Turning now to slide 8, which show our updated outlook for adjusted EPS growth through 2018. Although the net impact on our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance is approximately $0.20, our cost savings and other initiatives will reduce the net decrease to about $0.06 per share by 2018, which keeps us within the low end of our previous 2018 expectations. Now on to capital allocations beginning on Slide 9. When we laid out our strategy four years ago, we identified specific levers to improve total shareholder returns, reduce risk and simplify the portfolio. By completing timely exits from 10 countries and netting $3 billion from our asset sales, our portfolio is in a much stronger position today than it was four years ago. Over this period, we have allocated 80% of our $5 billion in discretionary cash to debt pay down and return to shareholders. This has resulted in a 23% reduction in parent debt and a 14% reduction in share count. In fact, as you can see on slide 10, since 2012, we have turned $2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends including $700 million or 9% of our current market cap in 2015. Turning to Slide 11, going forward, after debt pay down at our subsidiaries, we expect to have a total of $2.6 billion in discretionary cash available through 2018, which is roughly one-third of our current market cap. After shareholder dividends and investments in projects under construction, we will have $1.3 billion available for other discretionary uses. These include targeting 10% annual dividend growth, continuing to deliver in order to improve our credit metrics and reduce cash and earnings volatility and opportunistically utilizing our new Ford authorization for $400 million in share repurchases. And finally, while we are still seeing a number of attractive growth opportunities, mainly in brownfield projects across the portfolio, the benchmarks for new investments has been raised. We are focused on completing those projects under construction as well as the South Line repowering and LNG-related facilities in Panama. We will continue to compete any potential investments against the other capital allocation alternatives I just discussed. I would also like to point out that the $1.3 billion in discretionary cash I outlined does not include up to $1 billion in potential asset sale proceeds through 2018. As we allocate capital among these alternatives, we will look to further reduce risk and enhance returns as we continue to fine-tune our portfolio. We expect to strengthen our credit profile over time as we pay down debt, complete our construction projects and grow our cash flow. These actions will improve the stability of our cash flow and earnings. The bottom line is our portfolio generates strong and growing free cash flow, which we will use to maximize risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom to discuss our third-quarter and year-to-date results and full-year 2015 guidance. Tom OFlynn : Thanks Andres, good morning everyone. Today, I\u2019ll review our third quarter results, including proportional free cash flow by Strategic Business Unit or SBU, adjusted EPS, adjusted pretax contribution or PTC by SBU. Then, I will cover our 2015 guidance as well as our 2015 and 2016 capital allocation plans. Turning to Slide 13, third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.39 is $0.02 higher than third quarter 2014. At a high level, we benefited from a reduction in share count of 6% or $43 million shares and lowered parent interest expense as well as higher equity earnings as a result of a restructuring of one of our businesses in Chile, which we discussed on our Q1 call. These positive contributions were partially offset by lower operating results at some of our businesses such as DPL and in the Dominican Republic, which were negative year-over-year but not material versus our full-year expectations. Through roughly 35% to the valuation in foreign currencies, particularly the Brazilian real and Colombian peso. Turning to Slide 14, overall, we generated $621 million proportional free cash flow, an increase of $194 million from last year and we earned $322 million in adjusted PTC during the quarter, a decrease of $32 million. Now we will cover our SBUs in more detail on the next six slides beginning on slide 15. In the U.S., our results were largely impacted by lower contributions from DTL, primarily due to the expected transition to market prices for our regulated load and lower margin volumes and prices. Proportional free cash flow was further impacted by lower collections and the timing of working capital at IPL. In Andes, our results improved primarily due to the gain on restructuring at Guacolda in Chile and higher energy prices at Chivor in Colombia, partially offset by the devaluation of the Colombian peso. Proportional free cash flow also benefited from increased VAT refunds related to the construction of Cochrane in Chile. In Brazil, we benefited from lower spot purchases due the seasonality and shaping of our contract requirement a Tiete, partially offset by a weaker Brazilian real. Proportional free cash flow was negatively impacted by increased working capital as a result of higher recoverable energy purchases at Eletropaulo. In MCAC our results were largely impacted by lower spot sales, financially service revenue in the Dominican Republic, partially offset by improved hydrology in Panama. Proportional free cash flow had very strong increase in the timing of collection of outstanding receivables in the Dominican Republic. In Europe, we were negatively impacted mainly due to a weaker euro and the timing of planned outages at Maritza in Bulgaria as well as the sale of the Abute in 2014. Proportional free cash flow improved largely driven by higher collections at Kavarna in Bulgaria. Finally, in Asia, we benefited from improved availability at Masinloc in the Philippines and the commencement of operations along at Mong Duong in Vietnam. Turning now to 2015 guidance, on Slide 21, based on year-to-date performance and outlook for the year, we are already at about 95% of the low end of our proportional free cash flow guidance and are confident that we will be in the range. One key variable that would put us toward the high end of the range is the receipt of the $330 million in outstanding receivables at Maritza in Bulgaria as part of the previously announced capacity price reduction agreement. Government-owned utility NEK and their holding company BEH are in the process of raising capital to pay these receivables. The remaining issue is the extent of government guarantee from bridge financing prior to the issuance of a long-term bond. While we expect to close later this year, payment could slip into early next year. Turning to adjusted EPS, as we have discussed in our prior calls, we have been facing significant headwinds of about $0.20 from currencies, commodities, hydrology and declining economic conditions in Brazil. We have offset the majority of these impacts with cost savings, hedging and capital allocation. Unfortunately, these same pressures have continued in the third quarter and we face an additional $0.07 impact. We have also faced a $0.02 impact from outages at DPL and AES Hawaii. We have been working to implement additional opportunities, but now believe they will be difficult to capture. We therefore are lowering our guidance range to a $0.18 to $0.25 per share, which is roughly $0.08 lower than the midpoint of our prior guidance of $0.25 to $0.35. Now to Slide 22, and our parent capital allocation plan for 2015. The sources on the left hand side reflect total available discretionary cash or roughly $0.5 billion. As a reminder, we previously announced asset sale proceeds from the sale of a portion of interest in Ipalco and Jordan as the sales of the Armenian mountain wind farm and our solar assets in Spain. Today we are also announcing the closing of the sale of our solar assets in Italy for $42 million, bringing our total asset sales proceeds this year to $401 million. We are also expecting an additional $27 million return of capital which, with our parent free cash flow, provides us with roughly $550 million available for dividend payments and growth incremental share repurchases, debt reduction and potential investments. Turning to uses on the right hand side, we plan to invest $140 million in our subsidiaries, which does not include direct investments by CDPQ into IPL. We have invested $345 million in prepayment and refinancing parent debt, leaving us with only $180 million in parent debt maturities through 2018. In addition to dividend, we have invested $423 million of our shares. This brings total cash returned to shareholders through buybacks and dividends to $700 million for the year. Finally, we expect to have unallocated discretionary cash of about $225 million for the rest of the year. Turning now to 2016, parent capital allocation on Slide 23, source on the left hand side reflect $1.2 billion of total available discretionary cash for 2016. This includes asset sale proceeds of approximately, $200 million, the majority of which is coming from one transaction that we expect to announce shortly. Discretionary cash also includes our parent free cash flow of $625 million, which is approximately 20% higher than the midpoint of this year\u2019s expectation. Strong cash flow, the strong growth in our parent free cash flow demonstrates our increasing focus to upstream sustainable and growing cash from our businesses to further improved returns to our shareholders.  In fact, parent free cash flow is the largest contributor to the expected $2.6 billion in discretionary cash available through 2018 that Andres just covered. We\u2019re also expecting $70 million in returned capital from operating businesses. Additional potential asset sale proceeds could further increase our discretionary cash by up to $1billion through 2018. Turning to uses on the right-hand some of the slide. As Andres mentioned, we\u2019ll be investing in our projects under construction as well as already announced expansion projects at Southland, California and in Panama. After considering these investments in our subs, our current dividend and debt prepayment, we\u2019re left with roughly $400 million of discretionary cash to be allocated. Consistent with our capital allocation framework, we will invest this cash in dividend growth, further debt reduction, to continue to improve our debt profile and increase the stability of equity cash flows, and share repurchases.  Regarding new growth investments, we will continue to compete any new projects against share repurchases. All in all, our 2016 parent free cash flow and proportional free cash flow are growing significantly over 2015. We expect this trend to continue through 2018 and beyond. With that now, I will now turn it back to Andres. Andres Gluski : Thanks, Tom. In summary, we\u2019re pulling all levers from cost reductions, to capital allocation to respond to the challenges presented by a generally weaker global economy. As a reminder, our 6 gigawatts of projects under construction are largely funded and are the driver of at least 10% average annual growth in proportional and parent free cash flow over the next three years. Looking forward, we do not believe that our strong and growing cash flow is fully reflected in our valuation. Over the next three years we will generate $2.6 billion in discretionary cash, an amount equal to one-third of our current market cap.  As our track record demonstrates we will invest in dividend growth, debt paydown and share repurchases. In fact, in 2015 alone, we have returned $700 million or roughly 9% of our current market cap to our shareholders. With that I would now like to open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Your line is open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hi, good morning, can you hear me? Andres Gluski : Yes. Good morning Julien, we can hear you fine. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. So perhaps just following up on the guidance instruction here. I just want be very clear. When you\u2019re making the assumptions for 12% to 16% growth off this lower 2016 number, what exactly are you embedding by the time you get to 2018 in terms of FX and commodities? I just want to be abundantly clear about that. Andres Gluski : Basically what we are using is those commodities and currencies that we have with a relatively liquid market, we\u2019re using basically forward curves two years out. And then more or less a purchasing power parity thereafter. So we have considerable devaluations embedded into these forecasts. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And so then can you help articulate a little bit further the offsets? I know you just did a little bit just now, but can you elaborate a bit further exactly how you\u2019re able to drive these potential mitigating factors? Andres Gluski : So we\u2019re talking about the $150 million initiative. We have already done a $200 million initiative which we started in 2012. Recalling a little bit, we had set out a $100 million program and we managed to get twice that number in savings. What we have in front of us for next year is $50 million and that will be 100% cost reductions. And these are things that we have identified in terms of becoming a more efficient company, streamlining our structure, streamlining processes and really making sure that every single dollar that we are spending is going towards meeting our objectives.  So, for example, we have to make sure that we are not spending any money on any business development, for example, in deals that we\u2019re not going to do over the next couple of years. I think we have this very well identified for 2016. When we think of 2017 and we start getting into some of the initiatives that we\u2019ve had in the past the we\u2019ve started and we\u2019re well underway. We have churn of accounts now, we are really looking at our procurement efficiencies. We are starting to really achieve significant efficiencies on our new construction projects.  So by standardization and by more global deals. We really think that we have to get this more into our global procurement as well. There will be continued streamlining of the company as well and this continues into 2018. The only thing in 2018, we see a small number, maybe 10% of this, 15% of this in terms of revenue enhancements, these are several things that we have identified. But one of them which we don\u2019t have in our forecast is really having a channel partner to sell some of our advancing product. We think by then it\u2019s reasonable to think that we\u2019d have some income from this.  So we feel very confident about hitting this $150 million. And, if you go back to our earnings call, we have always hit our cost savings and revenue enhancement numbers. Julien Dumoulin : Got it. And then just following up on the impact from El Nino, you kind of alluded to it but can you define that a little bit more specifically across your portfolio. What exactly are you? Andres Gluski : Well, not all El Ninos are the same. This is a particularly strong El Nino. So that, normally El Nino would be favorable to, us but in the very case of the very strong El Ninos, it tends to be a bit drier in Panama than a normal El Nino. And, if you look at Southern Brazil you tend to get more rains in the extreme Southeast and somewhat less rains in the Central South. So were taken those into perspective. Normally in Colombia it\u2019s somewhat better but with a very strong El Nino it is a little bit more volatile. So that\u2019s the net that we think it\u2019s a little bit negative from these factors. One thing that hasn\u2019t been perhaps highlighted is that we have had really torrential rains in Sewall, in Rio Grande do Sul. We\u2019ve had the worst rains since 1940. We have had storms that just recently knocked out 14 transmission towers and left half of the 1 million customers without power. And so that\u2019s one of the things, for example, that\u2019s affecting our 2015 guidance. So it\u2019s basically these factors. It is a little bit Brazil, a little bit Panama and we are not expecting because it\u2019s a strong El Nino to have the full offset in the case of Chivor in Colombia. Julien Dumoulin : Great. I\u2019ll leave it there, thank you. Andres Gluski : Thanks, Julien. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ali Agha of SunTrust. And as a reminder please mute your computer speakers. Your line is open. Ali Agha : Thank you, good morning. Andres Gluski : Good morning. Tom OFlynn : Good morning, Ali. Ali Agha : Andres, first question, beyond the FX profile that you\u2019re looking at through 2018. Can you remind us what are you assuming for Hydro levels, for example, in Brazil? Are you assuming back to normal in 2016, 2017 and 2018. Or what is your assumption on Hydro? Andres Gluski : Yes, Ali. We are assuming normal hydrology in Brazil for 2017 and 2018. That is correct. We\u2019re assuming an El Nino through the first half of 2016. Ali Agha : Okay. Secondly, can you also remind us why is there this huge disconnect between your earnings profile that continues to come down and your cash flow profile that remains 10% or higher with a proportional parent level? Why is the cash flow not being more impacted by these macro impacts on your earnings? Andres Gluski : Yes. One of it is arithmetic. It\u2019s a bigger number, so if you have an x amount of decrease, say $100 million, it is going to impact the smaller number more. But I think to be frank, we had a little bit more margin in our cash flow. And realize that our cash flow, as we have always been saying, is going to be growing faster than our earnings. And the primary driver is we have $3.5 of NOLs, we have higher depreciation that we have maintenance CapEx. And we also have some of the accounting for lease accounting and HLBV et cetera tends to spread this out. So I think, those are the primary reasons. They have not changed. And we been saying for some time that the fundamental strength of this company is its cash flow. And, I think that we have seen that even with these negative external factors, we\u2019re delivering on what we had laid out. Tom OFlynn : I\u2019ll just add on one point that Andres just mentioned on the differential between proportional depreciation and proportional maintenance on environmental CapEx. We do continue to bring our maintenance environmental CapEx down, but that differential this year is about $300 million. The differential widens as new plants come on, that differential widens by about $75 million a year, so call it $0.78, that\u2019s keeping earnings down, but growing cash. Ali Agha : Got it, got it. And then thirdly, a more bigger picture. You\u2019re doing a great job of trying to come up with internal offsets to these macro headwinds. Have you stepped back and taken a look at this entire portfolio? I mean, is this model working? That the AES global model and does it have to make sense for you to perhaps relook at the fact that the sum of the bars may be greater than the whole in terms of maximizing shareholder value? Andres Gluski : We always look at that. I mean, we have an open mind. We know that we\u2019re working for our shareholders. We will look at anything that we think increases shareholder value. Having said that, in terms of our portfolio, we think we have the global scale that really allows us to reach economies and synergies. So, for example, if you look at recent bids recent bids, whether it be California or the gas plant in IPL, which had to basically complete with alternatives or the gas plant and regassification terminal in Panama, we\u2019re winning bids against the best in the business. And we\u2019re able to do that because of this global scale and reach that we have. I think we\u2019ve also shown that the portfolio, in this case, is offsetting. It\u2019s doing well in one place; it\u2019s not doing well on the other. And we think we have good combination of rapidly growing markets in Asia. And Latin America is going through a downturn in the cycle but realize that, other than Brazil, these markets are growing whereas, for example, in the U.S. it is a market where energy demand is not growing. Having said that, we have further fine-tuning to do. We have to sell down those areas where we have particular risks that have been affecting us. We are growing in those areas. If you look at where our growth is, 80% is U.S., or it\u2019s Chile or even if you include Panama, it\u2019s dollar-denominated. So we\u2019re decreasing our currency and hydro risk over time. So we will continue to do what we\u2019ve done in terms of fine-tuning this portfolio, taking advantage of our synergies, making it more efficient, cutting costs, standardizing to become the good operator. We keep an open mind. I think that we have \u2013 when, for example were people discussing Yoto in the past, we said we would look at it. We didn\u2019t see it really a fit for us and we also felt that that would commit us to growth in situations where the markets may not be good. So, having said that, we will keep an open mind, but I think we have shown a lot of prudence in terms of going forward. We continue to look hard at our portfolio, what makes sense as a whole. And, we think we are on the right track. We have been hit with some pretty hard exogenous factors. But as we fine-tune this portfolio, we\u2019ll be less susceptible to them over time. Ali Agha : Understood. And lastly, did I hear you right, you think you\u2019ll have another $1 billion in sale proceeds potentially between now and 2018? Andres Gluski : Yes, we said up to. We said up to and this involves not only selling out of some places, but it could also mean selling down on specific businesses where we think we have too much of some risk or that we can churn that cash and put it to better use somewhere else for our shareholders. Ali Agha : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Keith Stanley of Wolfe Research. As a reminder please mute your computer speakers. Your line is open. Keith Stanley : Hi, good morning. Could I just go back to the previous question on the cash flow outlook versus the earnings outlook? There is such a disparity there. Earnings, I guess come down a couple times now, but you guys continue to be able to maintain the cash flow outlook. So first of all, is the Bulgaria, the receipt of the Bulgaria receivables, is that now in your 2016 proportional free cash flow number? Andres Gluski : No, it is not. As Tom laid out, we still hit our range without it in 2015, but we\u2019re not including it in 2016. Keith Stanley : So it would be upside to 2016 when you receive that cash? Andres Gluski : That is correct. Keith Stanley : Okay. And then, can you just talk a little more about what is \u2013 I know you identified some of the things that are driving cash flow to be stronger. How much should we assume is coming from opportunities within the subsidiaries to pull cash out? For example, you had that U.S. hold sell this year; you pulled about $200 million out. Are there a lot of opportunities to work within capital structures of subs that is helping to find incoming cash flow? Andres Gluski : I\u2019m going to ask Tom to answer this. I think the one thing to realize is that we\u2019re focusing more on cash and getting cash back to the parent and that\u2019s really what we\u2019re maximizing. Sometimes there will be lumpiness in this, but not always from the same place. And we are also \u2013 but this is sustainable, because they really represent earnings from those companies that have been over time. So while there may be some lumpiness and when you get a back, it is not like a one-time shot. These things are sustainable over time and they will get bigger. Realize that we have about $1.1 billion in construction projects. We have our equity in construction projects. We have to put in $160 million more. We have a lot of money that is not yet producing results. So, Tom, if you\u2019d like to clarify his question. Tom OFlynn : Keith, I just on proportional free cash flow, maintenance and environmental CapEx is coming down. Just a general sense, it was close to $600 million this year. Over the next couple years, it\u2019s going to be closer to $500 million. Part of that is working hard with efficiencies, but also we did finish an enviro retrofit program at Chile that is basically finished at the end of 2015, so that helps us. And you then you contrast that with growing depreciation from new assets, so it\u2019s the differential between maintenance and environmental CapEx versus earnings. It is about $300 million today, and that differential grows about $75 million a year. We\u2019ve always said, we do have NOLs that hit EPS, don\u2019t hit cash. And then just sometimes when you bring a new business on, especially a new project, the earnings can be leaner at the early years, but cash continues to be strong. On parent free cash flow, it is an increasing focus of the business and a has been for a couple years. But we continue to find ways to drive efficient use of cash through the business. It may come through inventories, they\u2019ll be down about 15% year-over-year. Our unrestricted cash on the balance sheet will be down about $100 million a year and it is down about $300 million from a couple years ago So we continue to look for efficient ways to run the business. I will say that, when we talk about parent free cash flow, all that is earnings. It\u2019s either earnings from this year or it\u2019s retained earnings from a prior year. When we call it parent free cash flow, it has to be earnings, either this year\u2019s or last year\u2019s or whatever. When we do something like the Jennco financing, if it\u2019s a reflection of prior retained earnings, then we will call it parent free cash flow. If it\u2019s a reflection of cash beyond retained earnings, then we will call it returning capital, and that\u2019s why we make that distinction. To the shareholder, it\u2019s really all money. We make that distinction which is really accounting driven. But we do think there are continued opportunities. A lot of that is growing cash in the businesses. It\u2019s a function of proportional free cash flow, but then there are also opportunities to get businesses that may have delevered over time; we can re-lever them periodically. Obviously you don\u2019t do that every year; you do that every few years. And of the ways to look to up freeing cash, that is a big focus. I will just say on the comment of, we do pay down a fair amount of subsidiary debt. $450 million, $500 million a year of subsidiary debt, and a lot of that we give value for, but we get it, let\u2019s say, in loss. We will get it because we\u2019ll refi something at one point in time that allows to have a chunk of your dividend that year. We may get it from the opportunity to build something where we have created equity value in a business and you build something, basically all debt because your equity all is already embedded in the business. Were doing that right now in the DR. And then also, obviously, the extent that we delever a business, like DPL we\u2019re delevering. So on an aggregate-value business, equity is a bigger part of ag value. Andres Gluski : Just to serve some high numbers, we\u2019re paying about a 4% dividend. We have about a 9% parent free cash flow yield and about a 17% proportional free cash flow yield. I think it is very important what Tom said about the net debt that we pay down at the subs. The vast majority of this in businesses that are ongoing businesses, whether it be, for example, DPL utility. The money we feel that we\u2019re paying down there, we\u2019re creating value. I do agree that if that which would be going for an out of the money older coal plant, that would not be necessarily creating future equity value. But that is very small of that total number. So most of it is going for ongoing businesses. And realize that, because we are in markets that are growing, those plants that we have that we\u2019re paying down nonrecourse debt are likely to even be recontracted at the same or higher prices in many cases. We are in markets that are growing at 10%. This is a very dynamic than in the states where we basically have flat demand. Keith Stanley : That\u2019s all very helpful. Two quick follow-ups. Can you give an update on the Brazil GSF cap and any progress there? Tom, I think you talked about at Maritza, sort of the issue is the government guarantee of the bridge financing. Is there a material risk there in Maritza or are you still feeling very confident on getting this done? Tom OFlynn : Yes, let me get those one at a time. There are discussions going on down in Brazil about compensation to the generators for the meaningful reduction in output GSF beyond listing their nameplate. This year it is going to be about 83% to 85% of GSF. Those discussions are ongoing. I think there are some offsets, some exchanges that have to be made to get some of that. And we are cautious, I would say about whether that will be really a value to us. We\u2019re not baking any of that into our numbers is the important thing. The team is working hard. They are working with other folks down there in similar positions, but at this point we are cautious. And we are not baking any value, cash, earnings or anything else, into our outlook at this point in time. In Maritza, we continue to be positive about it. As you know, we do have a large receivable now of $330 million. Everyone is on board in terms of the banks. The issue, NEK is owned by a holding company called BEH. BEH does have public debt out there. I believe it trades around 5%, 5.5%, but they\u2019ve gone out for proposals from some bank groups. There\u2019s two or three large groups. The primary issue is whether the banks would do a bridge before public take-out that would basically be a parry passive with the current BEH outstanding. Whether the banks would get a sovereign guarantee for all or part of that net, that is the major discussion. Our team is obviously in the middle of this. There may be some other ways to work our way through it. We think ultimately this will be resolved. We do think given its \u2013 time is marching on here for 2015; it may be in 2016. That\u2019s not a material issue for us at this point. As you asked Keith, we will be in the range for proportional free cash flow if Maritza\u2019s resolution doesn\u2019t happen this year. All be it, it will be in the lower end of the range. But we expect it to happen next year. And obviously, we would have a very large number for next year. The discount that would accrue, which is about $2 million or $3 million a month, does not kick in until we get paid. Keith Stanley : Right. Andres Gluski : I think one of the important things to mention is that the Bulgarian government is in the process of enacting the regulatory reforms and terra pro forms that will make NEK cash sustainable over the time. There are two parts, one we want to catch up as soon as possible. But equally important is to have the enactment of these reforms which will solve the problem on an ongoing basis. Keith Stanley : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. [Operator Instructions] Your line is open. Stephen Byrd : Hi, Good morning. Andres Gluski : Good morning, Step. Stephen Byrd : I wanted to follow up on the point about deleveraging down at the subsidiary level. As you look out at the different subsidiaries, is there a potential for releveraging increasing financing there such that over 2016 or beyond you could increase the cash flow to the parent beyond your expectations? Is there a meaningful potential for that as you look at over the next couple of years? Andres Gluski : What I would say is we do have a number of under-levered assets in different markets. We\u2019ve talked a lot about Chiete, over time, how to relever Chiete. I would say that it\u2019s really going to depend on the development in those markets and what rates we can relever these businesses. One of these issues we\u2019ve had in Brazil at Sul, is that the interest rates on that particular business, which was hit by the drought and the lag in tariff increases and therefore needed more cash as the interest rates on loans in Brazil are 18% to 19%. So we will be cautious about that. Realize that 95% plus of our subsidiary debt is in the functional currency of that business. So that means means, in places like Brazil, you have to go with floating rates to accomplish that. So we don\u2019t have a currency mismatch. But, to answer your question, we do have those opportunities. Tom and the team have taken advantage of it. In many cases it\u2019s to put that money to work on what we think are very attractive adjacency sort of Brownfield type projects. There are opportunities there, but we don\u2019t feel at this time to put anything into our guidance. It\u2019s an opportunity we have to see how some of these markets develop. Tom OFlynn : Yes. Steve, I just said, I mean we do have. It\u2019s a great point. We are continuing to work at that that. Parent free cash flow will be up next year about 20%. That is why we have lost margin in the businesses for the currencies and other things that we talk about. Part of that is a reflection of trying to do exactly as you say. Stephen Byrd : Understood. I wanted to shift over to growth. You\u2019ve been able to develop a number of hybrid term projects. When you look out at potential further growth out there in your targeted market, do you think it\u2019s a fairly target rich environment or do you think you are more likely to move towards greater amounts of share buyback given where the stock is? Generally, how do you see the context for even further growth in the future? Andres Gluski : Obviously, where our stock is trading at is a factor. That really raises the bar in terms of what the projects have to return. As you pointed out, we have had very attractive returns on our projects. A key factor of that is partners. By bringing in partners who pay us a management fee or a promote or buy into a project, that really raises return on our capital. In terms of a target-rich environment, we are going ahead with those that we see are extremely profitable short-term platform additions. Desal in Chile, as an example. We are going to complete our projects in Panama and Southland. But we are narrowing our scope because of the drop in our share price also, quite frankly, because of the decrease of cash flow of some of our subsidiaries, as a result of XF and commodities. I think we will continue to do what we\u2019ve been doing. We will continue to strengthen our credit over time. We have allocated some paydown of debt in 2016 as we did in 2015 and as we have done before. And that will continue to make us more stable in terms of earnings and cash flow at the parent. So that\u2019s the focus that we have. So in summary, we continue to see good opportunities, but the bar has been raised. We will continue to use partnerships extensively to take advantage of it and we will continue to try to get the optimal portfolio. Taking Ali\u2019s question, we want to get to a portfolio which has the growth, but has less of certain risks be it hydrology are specific markets. Stephen Byrd : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gregg Orrill from Barclays. As a reminder, please mute your computer speakers. Your line is open. Gregg Orrill : Yes, thank you. I had two questions. First on DPL. Can you talk a little bit more about how you expect the credit to be trending and maybe on an FFO to debt basis over the next number of years. And then on Brazil. How much of the 2016 earnings impact was related to Brazil, and how are you thinking about managing that position in general? Thank you. Andres Gluski : Okay. Yes, I\u2019ll ask Tom to talk about the credit improvement for us at DP&L and then we\u2019ll come back to the Brazil question. Tom OFlynn : We continue to pay down debt. I haven\u2019t got the FFO projections offhand, but the next maturity which is with at the DPL parent, not DP&L, the utility is $130 million next fall and we expect to be able to pay that off with internal cash flow that was contemplated when we left some of it outstanding with the refi we did a year or so ago. So we continue to see debt paydown. We will be transitioning the DP&L integrated utility from a fully integrated. We will be creating a Jennco, basically a sister to the utility that will involve some refinancing at the DP&L level, and that we\u2019ll be over the next couple of years, within the next couple of years. We can follow up with the FFO specifically at DPL and DP&L. Gregg Orrill : Okay. Andres Gluski : When you\u2019re asking about Brazil, are you asking versus 2015 or versus our prior 2016 guidance? Gregg Orrill : Prior 2016. How much of the $0.20, roughly $0.20, impact is Brazil? Andres Gluski : It\u2019s approximately $0.05 that is coming from Brazil from the different things that are happening in Brazil. Again, going back, we had a 5% decrease in demand, which is very strong, this year. It\u2019s reflecting a weakening economy. The economy in Brazil is actually contracting between 2.5% and 3% this year. In addition, you had increase in tariffs and you\u2019ve had these terrible weather conditions in Sul. That\u2019s a part of the things that are affecting demand in Brazil and then you have the effect on the currencies. Gregg Orrill : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Turnure of JP Morgan. And as a reminder please mute your computer speakers. Your line is open. Chris Turnure : Good morning. I just wanted to touch a little bit more on growth opportunities both organically and via asset purchases outside the Company. You guys have kind of already given color on this, but mentioned that there\u2019s a higher bar now due to your lower share price and the alternative there of repurchasing shares. Are there any particular markets via purchases or organic growth that are that much more attractive today versus a year ago that the investment opportunities with the leverage with the JV partners might make you more interested in certain areas versus others or certain risk profiles versus others? Andres Gluski : I think we would have to really look at the distribution of our portfolio. And really where we have synergies. We\u2019re not going to do any deals, we\u2019ve always said, that would just bring money. There really has to be synergies or something special to it. Right now we\u2019re really focused on completing our projects and those that we mentioned are Southland and Panama, a little desal in Chile. And some energy storage projects which we think have a great potential not only for the projects themselves, but also to help us with third-party channel sales of our technology. I would say Mexico is a market that looks attractive given the partner that we have, but we\u2019re going to be very disciplined. We\u2019re going to be disciplined going forward, because, obviously, we have to react to the change of circumstances. We think that we have a lot of embedded growth in what we have already done. We do not want to be in a situation where we are spending on things that therefore we cannot finance or we have better opportunity to use that money somewhere else. Now having said that, if we give guidance out to 2018, but obviously 2019 is going to be even stronger. And then in 2020, you have Southland coming on. So we also want to have the opportunity for of these brownfield additions in the 1920s space, but we\u2019re not going to be spending a lot of money chasing them at this stage. But if there are opportunities that we can keep at a low cost on the back burner, we will be looking at those. Chris Turnure : Okay great. And then just could you give us some high-level thoughts on Brazil right here? You touched on hydrology for next year and that you think load growth is probably going to be around flat versus it being down so much this year. Could you talk more to the medium and longer term picture there? Andres Gluski : Sure, I think there are two things in Brazil. One is that they are in a recession now. It is a going to take a little time for them to work their way out of it, in my opinion. There\u2019s obviously a lot of political confusion, which doesn\u2019t help. But, having said that, in the case of Brazil, this is an economy which has a population in the optimal level. It is still growing. There is still a lot of opportunities in Brazil, especially they do have structural reforms. So I think everybody, if you look at a medium to longer term outlook for Brazil, in the energy sector, will be far more positive than the outlook today, because you\u2019re really looking at it. I think what is important to realize about Brazil, it is not just commodities that\u2019s affecting them. It has really been internal politics and internal decisions. So, their ability to recover is much greater. So that\u2019s it. We don\u2019t expect great recovery in Brazil in 2016, and maybe even 2017. But thereafter, the fundamentals as the market look pretty sound. Chris Turnure : Great. Thanks Andres. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Brian Chin of Merrill Lynch. And please mute your computer speakers. Your line is open. Brian Chin : Hi, good morning. Tom OFlynn : Good morning, Brian. Brian Chin : Just a clarification on the guidance. You mentioned that there had been share repurchases of 400 million that were newly authorized by the Board. Does the guidance consider those share repurchases, or no? Tom OFlynn : In terms of the longer-term guidance, we have some modest share repurchases in there. I would point out that I\u2019ve always said in the past, we do always get the authorizations that we need. But we have said that we would do this opportunistically. So we will be very, again, disciplined in our execution of this. In terms of cash, we have some debt pay down as well into these forecast to make sure that we are credit neutral or improving our credit overtime. Brian Chin : So then, just to be clear, the longer-term guidance considers some portion of 400 million share repurchases? The near-term numbers we should assume do not incorporate any; is that right? Tom OFlynn : Yes, Brian. We look at a balance of share repurchase and debt repayment. It takes time, there\u2019s opportunities to complete those. We\u2019ll look at those, but we don\u2019t put hypotheticals into our numbers. It\u2019s an allocation of discretionary cash beyond our CapEx as to find between share repurchase and debt payment. Brian Chin : Okay, understood. I realize that I\u2019m perhaps delving in a little too nitty-gritty on what is assumed in there or not. But one more question on this front. We\u2019re talking about still pursuing $1 billion in asset sales proceeds. That is not considered in the guidance? Or is it? Tom OFlynn : It\u2019s really a good question. First I want to clarify. This is up to $1 billion. So we don\u2019t have a targeted $1 billion in sales. So this is up to $1 billion. It will depend on the opportunities and the use that we have for that cash. I want to make that perfectly clear. In terms of our guidance, we do have continued fine- tuning of our portfolio. We have some consideration for some modest dilution from some of the sales. Because that may not pan out in the sense it depends what we sell, the timing of what we sell. But we are being prudent in here that if we sell so. We will update that in terms of some of these asset sell downs materialize. And of course and it will vary very much the net effect. Whether it\u2019s exactly what we have embedded or not, will depend on the use of that cash, whether it\u2019s debt paydown or share buybacks or it\u2019s another project and what\u2019s the gestation period of that project. Brian Chin : Understood. And last question, the $150 million cost-cutting initiative that was launched, can you give us a sense of what is mechanically are you looking at? You\u2019ve had a number of cost-cutting initiatives over the last few year, many of which have been successful. Just a little more color on what you\u2019re envisioning with this one and can you give us an SBU or at least geographic breakdown of where most of the cost initiatives you think --? Tom OFlynn : I\u2019m going to pass this one to Bernard. We\u2019re not going to give a breakdown by SBU. But Bernard can give you a little color about some of the things. He\u2019s looking at the SBU level, but this is everyone. This is finance; this is IT; this is absolutely everything is being look at in the Company. Bernerd Da Santos : When you look at what we have done since 2012, we have seen more opportunity for seeds we moved actively for the SBU. So we\u2019re taking advantage for economies of scales, some process, some monetization. I\u2019m trying to give you a flavor of four pockets that we\u2019re looking more into that quarter. The first one is intensified our progress in subsidiaries and economies of scale that is very focused on sourcing, cold, scarce inventory and long-term service agreements. The second part that we have here is centralized our global G&A. We continue to focus on that. We have roughly about $480 million is the global G&A ownership-adjusted. So we have financiers, we have service centers already lower across locations where we operate. So we\u2019re going to lever up those. We want to continue to have more G&A transactional process, or back-office activity done in those lower cost locations. The other one is done that is estimatization and relegation of what our AES programs, that is actually to improve our profitability for our 35 gigawatts fleet. That is also including cheap grade and lower our outage or efforts that we have in our fleet. And the last pocket is really streamline our organization as we rebalance the portfolio. As we sell down some of our business, as we sell some of our assets, we also were looking for what are the new operations that are coming in for our construction. We\u2019re streamlining our organization in order to be more centralized and more focused on more efficient base on the portfolio that we have. Brian Chin : Great. Thank you very much. Andres Gluski : Well, we thank everybody for joining us on today\u2019s call. We look forward to seeing you at EAI. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please feel free to call our team. Thank you and have a nice day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Good morning and welcome to AES' fourth quarter and full-year 2015 earnings call. Our earnings release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at Aes.com. Today we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Tom O'Flynn, our Chief Financial Officer and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will now turn the call over to Andres. Andres? Andres Gluski : Thanks, Ahmed and good morning, everyone. Today I would like to start this call with a brief review of 2015. Then I'll provide an update on the trends we're seeing across our portfolio, our action plans and the net impact of all these factors on our 2016 guidance and long term expectations. As you are all aware, we faced significant macroeconomic headwinds in 2015, including an average devaluation of nearly 30% on our non-U.S. dollar denominated businesses. We also faced the decline of more than 5% in demand at our distribution businesses in Brazil which is now in a deep recession. Both of these challenges are persisting in 2016 and we're taking actions to mitigate their impact on our financial results. Nonetheless, we continued to execute well on our long term strategy to create sustainable shareholder value, simplifying our geographic footprint, improving our balance sheet and debt profile, fine-tuning our financial exposure by bringing in partners at the business and project level and profitably expanding our local platform. As a result of our consistent actions, in 2015, we were able to generate free cash flow of $1.24 billion, up 39% compared to 2014 and $66 million above the mid-point of our guidance range. This was reflected in the $531 million of parent free cash flow we generated which is $8 million higher than 2014. And we increased our quarterly dividend for the third consecutive year to $0.11 per share, up 10% versus the previous year. Unfortunately, we were unable to overcome all of the $0.11 impact from macroeconomic headwinds we faced and our resulting adjusted earnings per share was $1.22, down from $1.30 in 2014. This was within our revised guidance range, but $0.03 below the low end of the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year. Regarding capital allocation, we continued to return most of our discretionary cash to shareholders. Last year, we directed 62% of our discretionary cash towards share repurchases and dividends, specifically $481 million to share buybacks and $276 million to dividends. We also used $345 million or 28% of our discretionary cash to strengthen our balance sheet by pre-paying and refinancing corporate debt. Our proactive steps over the past several years have put us in a strong liquidity position. Over the next three years, we only have $180 million of parent debt maturities and we've already made 85% of our capital contributions towards our 5.6 gigawatts of projects currently under construction. To secure our earnings and cash flow growth over the next couple of years, in 2015 we brought on-line 1.5 gigawatts of new projects and continue to make good progress on the remaining 5.6 gigawatts of construction projects. About 90% of these projects are U.S. dollar-denominated and either regulated or have long term PPAs. Finally, we advanced a few profitable platform expansion projects in California, Panama and the Philippines. Now turning to slide 4 and our forecast for 2016. Over the last two years, currencies have devalued by as much as 40% to 55% and key commodities such as oil and gas have declined by 45% to 60%. The 2016 guidance we provided on our last call incorporated the impact from the macroeconomic factors I previously mentioned as of October 15. Unfortunately, these negative trends have continued and based on our sensitivities to commodities and foreign currencies, we've seen additional impact of $100 million on proportional free cash flow and $0.10 on adjusted earnings per share this year. Tom will provide additional color on the main drivers and their effects in a few minutes. Taking all of this into account, we expect to achieve at least 10% average annual growth in our free cash flow and 12% to 16% average annual growth in adjusted earnings per share through 2018, although all off a lower 2016 base. Our expectations for this growth is based on three factors, continued performance improvement, projects currently under construction and capital allocation decisions. First, turning to slide 5, let us talk about continued performance improvement. As you may recall, since 2011, we have successfully implemented a cost cutting program which resulted in a 25% decrease in global overhead, equivalent to a run rate of $200 million of savings per year. Last quarter, we launched a new efficiency and revenue enhancement program to deliver an additional $150 million in savings per year by 2018. This new initiative includes further overhead cost reductions, procurement savings and operational efficiencies and improvements. We have already launched the programs that will allow us to realize $50 million in savings in 2016 and we're confident that we will realize $150 million in annual run rate by 2018. Turning to slide 6, second, although we have directed the majority of our discretionary cash to share buybacks, debt repayments and dividends over the past four years, we have also been prudently investing in platform expansion projects together with financial partners. These growth projects are key to positioning AES for sustainable growth over the medium term, as well as maintaining our competitive edge. We're only investing in projects where we have an existing business, where we see attractive risk-adjusted returns and where we can attract financial partners. Partnerships both reduce risk and enhance returns, as they provide an additional market read on our projects and often pay AES a promote or management fee. In fact, since 2011, we have raised more than $2.5 billion by incorporating financial partners on our construction projects and operating businesses. And as I said earlier and as you can see on slide 7, in 2015 alone we brought on-line six projects for a total of nearly 1.5 gigawatts and they were completed on time and on budget. Turning to slide 8. We currently have an additional 5.6 gigawatts under construction, the majority of which are expected to come on-line through 2018 with an average return on equity of approximately 15%. The total cost of these projects is $7 billion and AES has already contributed 85% of its $1.2 billion in required equity contributions. A major milestone will be the completion of 1.6 gigawatts of environmental upgrades at our existing thermal generation plants at Indianapolis Power and Light. About 80% of our current construction pipeline is in the U.S. and Chile, where we're expanding our stable and U.S. dollar-denominated asset base at IPL and AES Gener. Now on to slide 9. Over the past several years, we have experienced many of the disadvantages of having an international portfolio. However, one of the advantages is that having pruned our presence from 28 to 17 countries, most of the remaining emerging markets we're in continue to experience robust growth in energy demand, supporting the need for our product. In Panama, Vietnam, India demand growth over the next three years is expected to be in the 6% to 10% range, while in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and the Philippines growth is in the 3% to 5% range. One notable exception is Brazil, where demand for electricity dropped 5% in 2015 and we're not forecasting a recovery in levels of demand until 2018. Now let me touch on a few advanced development projects that will drive our growth beyond 2018. Turning to slide 10, in the Philippines whereas I just mentioned demand growth is expected to remain at around 5%, we plan to break ground in the first half of 2016 on a 300 megawatt expansion of our 630 megawatt Masinloc facility. The $750 million project will be funded with a combination of partner equity, local debt capacity and free cash flow from the business in the Philippines. Now turning to slide 11. In Panama, along with our local partner, Grupo Motta, we won a competitive bid for a 350 megawatt gas-fired combined cycle generation plant with a 10-year U.S. dollar PPA. Using this bid as an anchor, we plan to build 180,000 cubic meter LNG regasification and storage facility, very similar to the one we built and have successfully operated for 13 years in the Dominican Republic. The facility will be strategically located near the entrance of the Panama Canal, allowing it to serve as a ship fuel bunkering hub, as well as meeting unmet local and regional demand for natural gas. With the completion of the sister facility to our existing terminal in the Dominican Republic, we will be the largest LNG offtaker in the Caribbean and Central America. We expect to break ground this year and complete the project in 2018. As you can see on slide 12, we've also achieved important milestones on the repowering of our Southland facility, where we were awarded a 20 year PPA by Southern California Edison for nearly 1.4 gigawatts of combined cycle natural gas generation and energy storage. We're making good progress on permitting and licensing and expect to break ground in 2017, with commissioning beginning in 2020. Finally turning to slide 13, we continue to maintain our leadership of lithium ion-based battery energy storage. We currently have 106 megawatts in operation in four countries. We have another 60 megawatts under construction and a further 228 megawatts in advanced stage development in the U.S., Latin America and Asia, including 100 megawatts under contract in California. In addition, to the nearly 400 megawatts that we have built or may build on our own business platform, we have reached important milestones towards third-party sales of our proprietary award-winning Advancion Energy Storage product. We recently signed an alliance agreement with the Mitsubishi Corporation to sell Advancion in Asia and Australia and a similar agreement with Eaton for select countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. As part of our drive to maintain the cost competitiveness of our product, we also signed an agreement with LG to supply batteries for our pipeline of energy storage projects. In our current financial guidance, we do not include any material income from third-party sales of our Advancion project. We believe this is prudent, since our alliance-based business model is in its initial phases. Nonetheless, we believe that the global market for energy storage solutions is expanding rapidly and will be quite large within five years, as utilities respond to greater renewable penetration. AES's businesses in attractive markets around the world and our long term relationships with local regulators and customers, provide us with an unique advantage in opening the door to energy storage. We will keep you informed as our alliances progress. Turning to slide 14, the third driver of our growth in per share cash flow and earnings, is our capital allocation strategy. Four years ago, we identified specific actions to improve total shareholder return, reduce risk and simplify our portfolio. Since then we have used 81% of our discretionary cash towards share repurchases, dividends and debt prepayments. Since 2011, we have reduced our share count by 15% and our parent debt by 23%. We have completed timely exits from 11 countries and netted $3 billion in asset sale proceeds, including more than $500 million in 2015. As you can see on slide 15, since 2012 we returned $2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, including $757 million or 12% of our current market cap in 2015. While I have discussed our growth opportunities in some detail, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders and reducing corporate leverage. With that, I will now turn the call over to Tom, to provide more color on our 2015 results and 2016 guidance. Tom O'Flynn: Thanks Andres and good morning everyone. Today I'll review our full-year results including proportional free cash flow, adjusted EPS, proportional free cash flow and adjusted pre-tax contribution or PTC by strategic business unit or SBU. Then I'll cover our 2015 capital allocation, our 2016 guidance and longer term expectations, as well as our 2016 capital allocation. Turning to slide 17, full-year adjusted EPS of $1.22 was $0.08 lower than 2014. At a high level, we were impacted by the $0.11 impact from the roughly 30% average devaluation in foreign currencies primarily the Brazilian real and Colombian peso, lower operating results in Brazil due to lower demand and a general economic slowdown, as well as lower commodity prices particularly in the Dominican Republic. These negative drivers were partially offset by a reduction in share count of 6% of 40 million shares, lower parent interest expense and a slightly lower tax rate, as well as improved hydrology in Panama and the benefit of new businesses including Mong Duong in Vietnam. Turning to slide 18, overall, we generated $1.2 billion of proportional free cash flow, an increase of $350 million from last year, even though operating margin was down. As expected, in the Dominican Republic or DR, we settled our outstanding receivables. And in Chile we recovered delayed VAT payments for the construction of Cochrane and Alto Maipo. We previously expected to be in the low end of our range, if the PPA amendment and collection of receivables at Maritza in Bulgaria did not close. Although it's been delayed until 2016, we came in above the mid-point of our range as a result of improved collections and working capital improvements across our portfolio, some of which came late in 2015 rather than our prior expectation to collect in 2016. We also earned $1.15 billion in adjusted PTC during the year, a decrease of $171 million. Now I'll cover our SBUs in more detail over the next six slides, beginning on slide 19. In the U.S. our results reflect lower generation across our wind portfolio, lower contributions from IPL due to wholesale margins and the partial sell-down, as well as from DPL where a greater portion of the energy was sold into the wholesale versus the retail market. Proportional free cash flow also reflects higher collections, lower inventory and a one-time contract termination payment at DPL in 2014. In Andes, our results reflect higher margins as a result of improved availability in Chile and higher energy prices at Chivor in Colombia, partially offset by the 27% devaluation of the Colombian peso. Proportional free cash flow also benefited from increased VAT refunds. PTC also reflects the gain on restructuring at Guacolda in Chile. In Brazil, our results reflect lower margins due to lower demand and the 29% devaluation in the Brazilian real. Proportional free cash flow also reflects higher interest expense, partially offset by the timing of energy purchases, lower tax payments and lower CapEx at Sul. PTC also includes the net unfavorable reversal of liabilities at Eletropaulo and Sul. Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, our results reflect lower margins as a result of lower LNG sales demand, ancillary service revenue and availability in the DR, partially offset by improved hydrology in Panama. Proportional free cash flow had a very strong increase from the collection of outstanding receivables in the DR, as well as favorable timing of collections in Puerto Rico and Panama. In Europe, our results reflect lower margins due to the 16% devaluation of the euro, the 20% devaluation of the Kazakhstan tenge and the sales of our businesses in Nigeria and our wind business in the UK. Proportional free cash flow, however, was up due to higher collections in Bulgaria and Jordan. Lower PTC also reflects the reversal of a liability in Kazakhstan that was favorable in 2014. Finally in Asia, our results benefited from higher margins as a result of the start of operations at Mong Duong in Vietnam, as well as improved availability at Masinloc in the Philippines. Proportional free cash flow was negatively impacted by higher tax payments and the timing of collections and fuel payments at Masinloc. Now to slide 25 and our parent capital allocation for 2015. Sources on the left hand side reflect the total available discretionary cash, roughly $1.6 billion which is about $140 million higher than our expectation. This is largely a result of the approximate 4% sell-down of Gener in the fourth quarter. You may remember from our last call, that we expected additional asset sale proceeds of approximately $150 million in our 2016 capital allocation plan. We were able to close this in 2015 and now own approximately 67% of Gener, down from 71%. This brought our total asset sale proceeds for 2015 to $537 million. Parent free cash flow came in just above the mid-point of our range of $531 million. Turning to uses on the right-hand side, we allocated 91% of our discretionary cash toward debt pay down and return to shareholders. Specifically, we used $345 million to refinance and prepay over $800 million of high coupon debt. This included reducing our overall debt by $240 million and the issuance of $575 million of 5.5% 10 year notes which further extended our maturities and lowered interest expense. In addition to the dividend, we've invested $481 million in our shares. This brings total cash returned to shareholders through buybacks and dividends to $757 million for 2015. Since our last call when we announced our $400 million authorization, we bought back $136 million including $79 million in 2016. Turning to slide 26 and our 2016 guidance and 2017 and 2018 expectations. As Andres mentioned, our prior guidance was based on currency and commodity forward curves as of October 15. Bringing those curves forward to January 31, resulted an incremental impact of $0.10 on EPS or roughly $100 million. Our hedging activities have mitigated this impact by $0.03. Additionally since then, economic conditions in Brazil have also deteriorated by about $0.02. We've incorporated these impacts into our revised guidance. Our 2016 proportional free cash flow guidance is now $125 million lower, with a revised mid-point of $1.175 billion. This reflects the $100 million in macro impacts I just discussed, as well as the fact that our 2015 proportional free cash flow benefited from the accelerated collections in the fourth quarter. Regarding parent free cash flow, we now expect 2016 to be $50 million lower, a mid-point of $575 million. Although this is below our previous expectation, it still represents roughly 10% growth relative to 2015. In 2017 and 2018, we're still projecting at least 10% annual growth in cash flow, but off a lower 2016 base. Our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance is now $0.95 to $1.05 or $0.10 below our prior guidance with the mid-point of $1. In 2017 and 2018, we're maintaining our 12% to 16% growth rate, but off a lower 2016 base. However, we do expect to be in the higher end of that range. Before turning to capital allocation, I want to provide updates on a couple of our businesses, beginning on slide 27. Regarding Maritza in Bulgaria, recent energy sector reforms have now been enacted, resulting in improvement in the financial position of our offtaker NEK. We saw evidence of this in 2015, as collections were 24% higher than 2014. We've also seen progress recently in the financing process of NEK's parent to raise the funds necessary to settle our receivables. That said, our guidance includes only a modest portion of the outstanding receivables we expect to collect. Also this week, DPL filed its electric security plan which included a request for a reliability rider. Our plan tracks the criteria set out by the Public Utility Commission of Ohio which are designed to improve rate stability for customers, ensure continued reliability and promote fuel diversity in Ohio, while also ensuring the continued economic viability of DPL's plants based on a targeted 10.7% return on equity. We expect resolution of this filing later this year, with the outcome effective at the beginning of 2017. We remain on track to have our generation and wires businesses separated by that time. Turning now to 2016 parent capital allocation on slide 29, sources on the left-hand side reflect $1.1 billion of total available discretionary cash. This is roughly $50 million less than our prior expectation, reflecting lower parent free cash flow. Our discretionary cash could increase through additional funds from asset sales. Turning to uses on the right-hand side of the slide, with 10% growth in our dividend and share repurchases year-to-date, we're returning at least one-third of this cash to shareholders. Regarding debt reduction, improving our credit profile continues to be a priority. From a fixed income perspective, we benefit from lowering financing costs and ensuring access to capital. Equally important from an equity perspective, we think that continuing to strengthen our credit will help us get better recognition and valuation for our growing cash flows and dividend. Accordingly, we're targeting $200 million of debt reduction this year, over half of which we've already done. As an aside, we also continue to have good access to financial markets across our businesses which is still open for attractive projects at favorable terms, as we've seen recently with our advanced development projects and refinancings. As an example, just a couple of weeks ago we closed a 15 year nonrecourse financing for our Masinloc expansion project in the Philippines, an all-in cost of less of 5%. We have earmarked $330 million for investments on our projects under construction, as well as our expansion projects at Southland in California and in Panama. We will also be injecting $75 million into Sul in Brazil in support of debt restructuring which will strengthen Sul's capital structure by paying down a portion of the $330 million in debt currently outstanding. The equity injection will also facilitate agreements to extend debt maturities to 2020 and 2021. We believe those meaningful value in the business above our equity contribution. And following debt this restructuring which we expect to close shortly, we will be assessing all strategic alternatives for Sul. After considering these investments in our subs, our current dividend and debt prepayment, we're left with roughly $170 million of discretionary cash to be allocated. As in years past, much of this cash is weighted towards the latter part of the year. We'll continue to invest this cash consistent with our capital allocation framework. With that, I'll now pass it back to Andres. Andres Gluski : Thanks, Tom. As we have discussed, the macro environment has been and continues to be challenging. However, our strategy will allow us to weather the unfavorable macroeconomic environment. And just as importantly, it will allow us to continue to reposition our portfolio in spite of near term headwinds. Furthermore, we will be able to capture the financial upside, when these trends reverse. In the meantime, our portfolio generates strong and growing free cash flow. And consistent with our track record, we will continue to cut costs, streamline our business and allocate our discretionary cash to maximize value for our shareholders. With that, I would now like to open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So a quick question here, in terms of target leverage. You've talked a lot about debt repayment this morning and just broader debt paydown strategies. What's your ultimate target ratios as you guys sit here today? Has it evolved much? Andres Gluski : Well, I would say the first -- we paid down about $1.5 billion of debt over the past four years, so we've been very consistent in this. And so, every time we sell-down something, we also pay down some debt. Now let's say our target is to have sort of -- I would say, thinking longer term like 2019, 2020 to have sort of investment grade-like statistics and be like a strong BB by 2018. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And how much debt -- further debt pay down you need to do? I mean, are on track with your current trajectory of debt pay down? Or what's the total quantum per year you would need to get there, to be clear? Tom O'Flynn: Yes, Julien, this is Tom. I'd just add -- to be consistent what we said in the past, I think we said, maybe $100 million to $200 million a year. This year, we're on the high end of that range, $200 million. I think if we're hitting our numbers, then $100 million a year would be appropriate. But we believe would generally stick, at least for the next couple of years, 2017 to 2018, with a range of $100 million to $200 million. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. But you would hit IG, if at that pace? Tom O'Flynn: We would hit IG stats. The ratings are obviously a broader issue. But if you look over a three, five-year period, we would hit IG stats over that horizon Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And then just following -- a couple little items, just in terms of setting expectations. Do you expect asset sales -- is there any reason to think about that for this year? And then, also in terms of the new assets that you announced, the Masinloc 2, the Panama combined cycle, what are the specific EPS contributions from each of those plants once they reach in-service, at least in your initial expectation? Andres Gluski : Okay. Regarding asset sales, what we've said is that we think on average, we'd been selling around $200 million-plus per year. Last year, we did a bit more, we did $500 million. I think the way to think about it -- we will exit certain markets when we think the time is right, but we'll also sell-down positions to get partnership money to reinvest it in these new projects. Now regarding the EPS contributions, what we've said is that on average, our projects will have a return on equity -- so the first three years of full operation of around 15%. It's going to vary a lot project by project, but I think what's important is we have -- are repositioning this portfolio. 90% of the new projects of that sort of 7 gigawatts that we've had, are U.S. dollar denominated, 80% of the new projects are in the U.S. and Chile. So we're repositioning this portfolio to be more contracted, more dollar-based and in countries with strong markets. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And quick last question, the EBITDA you provide in -- for DPL, is that reflect any above market assumptions for the ESP in forward years? Andres Gluski : What we provided in there for the reliability rider, as we said in the past, it's incorporated into our numbers and it is a modest increase, versus what we had as a non-bypassable [ph] in the past. Operator : Our next question will come from Ali Agha of SunTrust. Please go ahead. Ali Agha : My first question, what is your confidence level in the revised earnings outlook for 2016? Given the ongoing global turmoil, how much cushion have you given yourselves, if things get even worse than at right now? Andres Gluski : Yes. Well, we always give guidance based on sensitivities and based on commodities and based on FX at a period in time. So we feel very confident that we can deliver this, based on those numbers. If you have a further deterioration, we have the sensitivities. Now we have also engaged in some hedging which Tom can talk about, to lessen that. I think that if you look over the years, we've always outperformed our guidance based on the numbers at the beginning of the year. What has happened is that the commodities and FX have moved in a negative direction. Ali Agha : Okay. I guess, a second question on Brazil. There has been some stories suggesting potential exit from maybe Eletropaulo Sul. You alluded to Sul in your comments. Can you give us a sense what you are looking at there in Brazil? And maybe bigger picture, if you are not looking for an exit, what is the strategic rationale for staying there, given the disproportionately negative impact that Brazil has to your overall stock and valuation, given such a small contribution to earnings, given the outlook that is not looking any positive, why are you in Brazil? Andres Gluski : Let's step back a little bit. Since about 2006, when I got involved in Brazil to date, we've sold down probably about 70% of Eletropaulo. Until the last two years, Brazil actually was a pretty good contributor to our earnings and cash flow. Now I agree that the prospectus for Brazil -- for 2015, was a terrible year. I think 2016 is going to be bad. We don't expect a recovery in energy demand until about 2018. This is true. But I think you have to remember, that we only own16% of Eletropaulo. At today's market valuation, that's about $60 million of equity positions, it's relatively small. It's a publicly-listed company, so we're not going to comment on it. But I would say that we've been consistent in our strategy of let's say, of focusing our position in Brazil. And for example, when there was sort of an -- asset prices were high. There was a lot of pressure on us from -- to lever up Tiete and buy assets. We never did, because we never thought that those were good investments. So looking at the good, big picture for Brazil, we have 2,006 megawatts of hydro. They are very well-contracted over the next couple of years, at much higher than today's spot prices. I thinking in the future, it's going to be hard to get that kind of hydro assets at a reasonable price. So Brazil, again is in tough times. It's going to take some time to work its way out of it. But on the other hand, I think we have to take a longer term perspective of the AES' presence in Brazil, not referring to any specific asset. Ali Agha : But the comment on regarding Sul, Andres does that apply to distribution exposure in general in Brazil? Which in the past you've said has been a challenging market for you? Andres Gluski : Again I said, we've -- I'm not going to comment on Eletropaulo, it's a publicly traded company. But regarding Sul, referring to Tom's speech, we're going to look at all strategic alternatives. With the refinancing, with this capital injection and refinancing, this will give us a year's grace. And we will look at alternatives of how to make Sul more efficient and what makes the most sense for our shareholders. Ali Agha : Okay. Last question, sort of more bigger picture, at what point would you be willing to step back and look dispassionately at the portfolio, Andres and perhaps followed the logic that some of us espouse, that the sum of the parts may be greater than the whole and does it make sense to maybe look at unlocking equity value, by perhaps breaking up some of the pieces of this Company? Would with ever occur in your mind or what's your thinking --? Andres Gluski : Well, I think it certainly has occurred. I think we been very dispassionate. I mean, we've sold one-third of this portfolio. And I think that, if you go back and look at the prices we sold at and the timing, I think overall, we'd have to get a pretty good grade. So we always look very dispassionately -- we work for shareholders. What we're doing I think in many cases, is capturing a lot of that value through our partnerships and using that money to reposition this portfolio. So we will look at all alternatives. We've always said that. I think maybe a year ago, yieldcos were in fashion. A lot of people were saying, why don't you do a yieldco? We really thought that we -- from a fundamental point of view and that's how we always look at things, dispassionately and fundamentally, that partnerships made more sense. They were cheaper. They didn't create obligations for new investments and we think that strategy has played out. So certainly, we have an open mind and from time to time, we look at this. But it has to be something that, really fundamentally unlocks the value and is not something perhaps that's -- I don't know what the word would be, in style or with other people -- we're always open to look at all alternatives. I think we been very dispassionate, in terms of our sale decisions. And we always look at things, again from a fundamental point of view, whether that's investing new money. If we put new money in, for example into Sul, it's because we think that there is significant equity value there. So we do not have some emotional attachments to specific businesses. Operator : Our next question will come from Chris Turnure of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Chris Turnure : Going back to the balance sheet, I wanted to get an update -- or first, I guess, just clarify comments that you made to one of the earlier questions on your deleveraging intent, kind of slowly over time through the end of the decade here. Has anything really changed there over the past 6 or 12 months or so, as a result of Forex and commodity prices and some of the pressures that you've been under? Because it sounds to me like you're trying to paint a relatively consistent message here? And then conversely also, on debt capacity at some of your subsidiaries, could you talk about and just give us an update on Tiete and where that $500 million of capacity stands today? And then, maybe also any incremental availability at Gener or in Europe? Tom O'Flynn: No, I think, our overall credit improvement comments are consistent with what we've said. And when we say, our credit ratio and credit statistic improvement, there's two ways to get there, the numerator and the denominator. We think more of the improvement will be in the numerator, i.e. parent free cash flow goes up which is the distributions from subs is obviously a numerator that we look at the most, for health of our parent credit. So we do expect growth, as we've talked about the 10% or more growth in parent free cash flow is driven by subsidiary distributions. So it's more the reducing debt and interest cost is a smaller part of the story, but it is part of the story. So I think just going back to what I said to Julien, I think we'll do $200 million this year. I think as we see it now, probably do $100 million each of the next two years. And that's consistent I think, with what we said over the last 6 to 12 months which is about $100 million to $200 million a year. It's also pretty consistent with what we did last year. If you look at the debt we paid down, some of it was attributable to asset sale proceeds. But about $150 million, $175 million was attributable to -- in our minds, just paying down debt and trying to continue to advance our credit story. And once again, we think that we can get investment grade type stats over, let's call it 4 to five-year period, on a gradual step. I think we're -- the facts and the pathway is pretty consistent. I think it's more of a focus let's say, certainly senior management, also at the Board level, because we certainly are paying out a pretty healthy dividend. We've got 10% growth and we really want to get shareholders to be comfortable in the stability and growth trajectory. And we think improving our credit will be part of that picture. Just the other thing -- quickly to touch on, yes, Tiete does still have about $500 million of debt capacity. Like all of our Brazilian utilities, they've got a debt to EBITDA coverage and they have very modest debt. So about $500 million would be available under their overall debt docs. I might be a little cautious about that number today, just because Brazil is a challenging place. But they certainly do have debt capacity and as we look to grow at Tiete, it would be with that debt capacity. We do have other -- I mean, in general around our subs, we do look to optimize our businesses. Gener is BBB- right now, I think it's, given the construction program, we don't see a lot of incremental capacity from Gener, but throughout certainly past Alto Maipo, yes, there is. But we do look at debt capacity around the business. One place is in Masinloc, where we're increasing the plant -- the facility side by 50%, with the 300 megawatt increment. That is being done through a financing that joins the credit of existing Masinloc with new Masinloc, that very much minimizes the amount of equity we have to put in. The same story we did in the DR. We did at DR a $260 million project, basically put no equity in, because the new project was stapled to the old one. So we leveraged available debt capacity in that fashion. Andres Gluski : Chris, what I would add, is just to remind everybody, I think our debt is in very good shape. I think Tom and his team have done a great job. At the parent side, we only have $180 million of maturities at the parent and that's in 2018. So we have no maturities at the parent this year or next. And at the subs, 95% of the debt and the functional currency of that business and at the parent 90% is fixed. So this is consistent with what we've been doing. I mean, we have been repositioning this debt to put ourselves in a strong position. When you, for example, you had a tightening of credit over the last couple of years in global market, it's not affecting us. So this is consistent with that philosophy. It is just that, as these new projects come on-line, where we can give more guidance, in terms of the strengthening of our credit into the next couple of years. Chris Turnure : And then, my follow-up is on the overall outlook for 2016 to 2018. Obviously, Forex and commodities have hit you guys pretty hard. And you also mentioned a reduced outlook for demand growth in Brazil on the utility side, as weighing on your outlook versus the last update. Are there any other drivers there, that we should think about better meaningful in the aggregate? Andres Gluski : No. I mean, those are the drivers. As we said, it's commodity prices, it's oil, it's gas, it's FX and it's growth in Brazil. And quite frankly other than Brazil, all of our other markets are growing. Argentina could be flat this year, but we expect a good growth in Argentina 2017 and 2018. Operator : Our next question will come from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie. Please go ahead. Angie Storozynski : I wanted to go back to Brazil. I recall during the EEI, you guys mentioned that you seem to have a pretty significant hydro exposure in the country, both on the TSS side and the utility side. Tiete does have some debt capacity. We seem to be heading to a potential asset sale by other market participants. Do you think it would make sense for you to bulk up on your generation assets on the hydro assets in Brazil or in South America in general? Or would you rather be more conservative and just continue to return cash to investors and not to double-down, especially in Brazil? Andres Gluski : I would say that, thinking about the other people selling some assets in Brazil, we really aren't looking at something -- like a large acquisition in Brazil. I can say that, no, we would take a more conservative position on that. And you are also right, that one of the risks, we want to measure and control really of course, is hydrology in Brazil. We have changed our contracting structure. There's a lot of water this year in South and south east of Brazil, so that spectre of rationing is gone, also with the drop in demand. We've also fortunately I think, had done a good job, the team has done a good job in terms of contracting at Tiete over the next couple of years. So we have prices around 150 reais, 149 reais per megawatt hour and the spot market, because of all the rain and the drop in demand is as low as 30 to 40 reais. So we're in a good position there. But answering your questions, strategically we do not see doing a large -- sort of doubling up as you put it, on hydro risk in Brazil. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And now a different topic, Ohio. So you've just filed your ESP. Similar to all the other utilities you're asking for a PPA for your Ohio coal plants. Now we're likely to have a FERC review of those PPAs with the other players. Now what is your expectation of -- about the future of these assets, if FERC were to somehow challenge the PPAs of the remaining two companies? Would you expect, for instance, Ohio to potentially fully re-regulate its power market? Tom O'Flynn: Yes, Angie, it's Tom. I'd say what we filed in Ohio was a reliability rider, so we're thinking about it from a different perspective than a couple of the other in-state folks. So we would be less focused on their situations at this point. We just filed it. It's generally, obviously, something we'll would expect to get resolved this year. We think it hits the points that I mentioned in my script. It's consistent with the PCO criteria and objectives. It would provide stability for a long period of time and we also think it would provide benefits to rate payers over the 10 year period. The numbers are slightly -- what we filed for is slightly better, than our -- than what we have now in our ESP. I'd say, we'd incorporate something into our guidance, but I'd rather stay away from specifics of what has been incorporated in our guidance. But we do think the plants continue to have an economic value and that is certainly for the 10 year period. And it's based just on the four -- on our coal plants which is about $1 billion of rate base. Operator : Our next question will come from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Stephen Byrd : I wanted to discuss trends, in terms of where AES parent is receiving distributions from its subsidiaries in 2015 and beyond? Could you talk to the trends in terms of changes over time, relative to what we saw in 2015, in terms of where the cash actually came from? Andres Gluski : I'll go ahead and pass that over to Tom. But basically our big contributors are Andes and U.S., have been our big contributors. Asia growing somewhat, because as Mong Duong comes on. But Tom, perhaps you can give a more specific answer? Tom O'Flynn: Yes, Steve, how are you? We got some detail in the back of our deck in the appendix. I think 46 has some detail and there's also some more -- that's by SBU. In general, I think our distributions follow our largest areas. It's the U.S., as well as Andes. MCAC was a big contributor last year, especially with the collection catch-up in the Dominican Republic that we spoke about. And I think that over time, distributions generally follow proportional free cash flow and earnings. There may be some timing off by year. Often our companies will pay out dividends based on prior year's earnings, so sometimes there's a lag of a bit. But I think generally, our distributions are quite close to proportional free cash flow, in PTC. Andres Gluski : Steve, the one thing we maybe -- if we had the full collection from Bulgaria, this would be an upside, because we only include a modest amount of money from Bulgaria and so, we've taken a conservative approach regarding. And as Tom mentioned, recent developments have been very encouraging in Bulgaria. Stephen Byrd : So if BEH is able affect the financing and you are paid as you should be, then there could be further upside in 2016 in terms of distributions? Andres Gluski : That's correct. That's correct, in terms of parent free cash flow, yes Stephen Byrd : Okay. And I presume you don't want to lay out exactly the magnitude of that, at this point, in terms of the incremental? Andres Gluski : I would say, in terms of our guidance, we'd be at the upper end of the range, for the proportional and the parent free cash flow that we'd get in Bulgaria. I would mention that, in terms of encouraging news, the Minister of Energy yesterday came out and said, that they had -- there are two phases to it. The first is, that the BEH, Bulgarian Energy Holdings would receive a bridge loan from banks for later on take-out. As she mentioned yesterday, that they had received significant offers from one of the bank consortiums -- I think expect two or three to come in. And that's very favorable, because we'd get paid with the bridge loan and we wouldn't have to wait for the bond operation. So that really, again that's a favorable development. Let's wait and see. If that does occur, that would -- and given that everything else happens as we expect, we would be at the upper end of the range. Stephen Byrd : Just wanted to follow up, shift over to Latin America and just get your sense at a high level of buyer appetite, ability to finance acquisitions, et cetera, for I guess, Latin America overall and Brazil in particular, is it your sense that there is a viable buyer universe out there or is it a little challenging, given what we're seeing in terms of deterioration in places like Brazil? What's your sense? Andres Gluski : I would really segment Brazil, from the rest of Latin America right now. I would say that Brazil is in a recession. But if you look at the rest of Latin America, its growth rates are actually higher than the U.S. So if you look at Columbia, Chile, Mexico -- Panama is growing at I think about 7%. Dominican Republic is growing, so I would segment Brazil from the rest. So for the rest, I think in most places, yes, there definitely is a market. Even in a place like Argentina, we're seeing greater investor interest, because a lot of the moves that the government has taken, are seen very favorably. I personally was down in Argentina. I can say, it's one of the most impressive executive teams I've seen anywhere, anytime. So they've already started to liberalize tariffs and rationalize prices. But if you get to Brazil itself, I think that these assets are definitely sellable. I think it depends on the asset. There is still appetite. There is still local groups who have the capacity to buy this. There is still a lot of plays of consolidation in the sector and you have foreign investors. You have Italians, Spanish investors, who are on the look-out -- and French who are on the look-out for assets. So I would say that even though Brazil is the market that's not growing and at the same time I think for quality assets, there are definitely buyers. The price may not be what it was two years ago for sure, but again, that's reflected in market valuations. Operator : Our next question will come from Gregg Orrill from Barclays. Please go ahead. Gregg Orrill : Just to follow-up on the Bulgaria discussion, what's in your 2016 earnings guidance from Bulgaria? Tom O'Flynn: Yes, 2016 has an expectation that we settle here in the near term which would be our 14% reduction in tariff. So just from a PTC perspective and the PTC for the year is about $90 million to $100 million which is a little bit down from last year. I think last year, PTC was around[$115 million, $120 million. So it's a little bit down this year. Just from a pure PTC perspective, actually delay in the resolution payment and closing of our PPA adjustment helps PTC. Obviously, a top priority is to get that done -- which gets us on the right path forward and obviously helps proportional free cash flow and parent free cash flow, but bottom line this year it's about[$90 million, $95 million PTC Gregg Orrill : So is the read that you feel your cash flow assumption is conservative? Tom O'Flynn: I'd say in that respect, yes, our proportional free cash flow assumption would be conservative. It's a fairly modest amount that we have included, if you look at our mid-point, would be a fairly modest Bulgaria amount. So yes, if that gets done and Andres gave some color that the signs are certainly turning towards the positive here. If that gets done, then we could well be towards the higher end of our proportional free cash flow range. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ahmed Pasha for any closing remarks. Ahmed Pasha : Thank you, everybody for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any questions you have. Thank you and have a nice day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ahmed Pasha, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Ahmed Pasha : Thank you, Dan. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning are Andr\u00e9s Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom O'Flynn, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will now turn the call over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thanks you, Ahmed. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our first quarter financial review call. Today, I will discuss our first quarter results and provide updates on our progress and our strategic objectives, macro conditions in our markets, and construction and development program. Since our last call in late February, we have achieved a number of key objectives for 2016. We received payment of all outstanding receivables in Bulgaria. We are on track to achieve our three-year $150 million cost reduction and revenue enhancement goals. We saw improvements in our credit ratings and outlook from the rating agencies. Our $7.5 billion construction program is advancing on schedule and will be the major contributor to our cash and earnings growth over the next three years. We continue to leverage our existing business platforms by advancing projects with long-term contracts denominated in U.S. dollars. During the first quarter, we achieved significant milestones on three new projects, which will contribute to our growth after 2018. I\u2019ll discuss these achievements in more detail in the movement. But I would like to summarize our financial results on slide four. In the first quarter, we generated proportional free cash flow of $253 million, in line with last year. The recent collection of $350 million in Bulgaria will be reflected in our second quarter cash flow. Our first quarter adjusted EPS was $0.13, which is considerably lower than the $0.25, we earned last year. Our first quarter operating performance was impacted by adverse movements in FX, lower power prices in the U.S. and the expiration of the power purchase agreement at Tiet\u00ea in Brazil. Our earnings performance was also driven by a tax rate of 50% for the first quarter, which is really a timing issue. We continue to expect a 31% to 33% tax rate for the full year. In terms of our outlook for the full year, we\u2019re reaffirming our guidance on all financial metrics. Nonetheless, we expect our first half adjusted EPS to be relatively weak, due to the continuing impact from the factors I just mentioned and scheduled major maintenance in the second quarter.  Now, I\u2019ll turn to our strategic accomplishments since our last call. As you can see on slide five, we have successfully resolved the outstanding receivables issue at Maritza in Bulgaria. Maritza\u2019s sole customer, the National Electricity Company, or NEK has fallen significantly behind on its payments. In April, we received full payment of the outstanding receivables of $350 million. This is a direct result of the steps taken by the government of Bulgaria to strengthen the financial position of NEK and the long-term sustainability of the energy sector. By meeting all of its contractual obligations, Bulgaria is sending a very positive signal to all foreign investors. Currently, Maritza is providing critically needed power to the Bulgarian electric grid, and we have been collecting in a timely manner, since December 2015. Turning now to slide six and our cost savings and revenue enhancement initiative. Our goal is to achieve a run rate of $150 million per year in bottom line improvement. We are on track to achieve our $50 million goal for 2016 and the additional $100 million to 2018. These bottom line benefits are largely driven by global procurement efforts, moving back office functions to lower cost service centers in Argentina and Bulgaria, and continued improvement in our performance of our plants. Now turning to slide seven, I\u2019ll discuss macro conditions in our markets. First, the impact from hydrology in Latin America should be negligible this year. While cumulative rainfall remains below average in Panama, it is generally improved in the rest of Latin America. Regarding Panama, spot prices have fallen significantly, as a result of the barge based power plant we commissioned there last year, which reduced the effects of low rainfall on our contracted hydro plants. Second, economic conditions in our markets are generally in line with prior expectations, except for Brazil, which is experiencing a deepening recession. At our distribution businesses in Brazil, we are announcing a second consecutive year of 5% decline in demand. While in the U.S. demand is essentially flat, in most of our other markets we continue to see energy demand growth in the range of 4% to 10%. Moving on to slide eight, we are focusing our investment efforts on platform expansion projects with long-term contracts and U.S. dollar denominated revenues. We see a significant opportunity to take a leading role in the distribution and storage of LNG in Central America and the Caribbean. Turning to slide nine, let us review our major new projects. During the quarter, we started construction on the 335-megawatt Masinloc expansion to take advantage of robust growth in the Philippines and our existing infrastructure. The new unit, Masinloc 2 will be one of the most competitive thermal plants in the country employing highly efficient and flexible super critical technology. The $740 million project will be funded by a combination of non-recourse financing, partner equity and cash generated at the Masinloc 1 for facility. Moving on to slide 10, I am pleased to report that we have achieved a number of milestones on our Colon project in Panama. This project encompasses both, 380-megawatt combined cycle plant or CCGT and an adjacent LNG regasification terminal and storage facility. The CCGT is contracted under 10-year U.S. dollars denominated PPA. The LNG facility will have an 180,000 cubic-meter tank, which is sufficient to handle 80 Tera Btu annually. Our CCGT will use about 1 quarter of the tank\u2019s capacity leaving substantial unused capacity to meet the needs of additional power plants for downstream customers. The Colon project seeks to replicate the success of our LNG facilities in the Dominican Republic, which provides gas to our adjacent power plant, another power plant via pipeline and to numerous downstream customers in the transportation and industrial sectors. The Colon project is strategically located near the entrance of Panama Canal and will be able to offer bunkering to the maritime industry as it starts to use natural gas as a fuel. There are many commercial synergies between the LNG terminal in the Dominican Republic and Panama. And with both facilities in service, we will become the largest provider of LNG regasification and storage services in Central America and the Caribbean. All the Colon projects permits are in place, and we have selected the EPC contractor. Project financing for approximately 60% of the project cost is well underway. AES\u2019s equity is expected to be around $200 million, which we will fund over the construction period. The project is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016 with completion of the power plant in 2018 and the LNG facility in 2019. As we can see on slide 11, the repowering of Southland in California is another example of a large project that will contribute to our growth beyond 2018. As a reminder, we were awarded a 20-year PPA by Southern California Edison for 1,384 megawatts of capacity, which includes 100 megawatts of energy storage and 1,284 megawatts of combined cycle gas capacity. Since our last call, we have signed turbine supply agreement and EPC contracts to build the CCGT. We are making good progress on the remaining regulatory approval and expect to break ground in 2017 with completions in 2020. We anticipate funding the $2 billion total project cost with a combination of non-recourse debt and $500 million in equity from AES and a possible financial partner. Turning to slide 12, we remain optimistic on the future battery-based energy storage and our leadership position in this market. We currently have 116 megawatts of energy storage projects in operations across four countries and expect to install another 50 megawatts this year. Additionally, we have another 228 megawatts in advanced stage development, including the 100 megawatts under contract in California. By 2017, we expect to be operating in seven countries, adding India, the Philippines, and the Dominican Republic to the four countries where we already operate, the U.S., the UK, the Netherland and Chile. We see growth in our energy storage business through two paths : AES owned projects, such as the previously discussed 100 megawatts with a PPA with Southern California Edison; and sales of our Advancion energy storage solutions by AES and our channel partners. These sales will target utilities and other large energy storage customers. First, regarding long-term contracts, we see significant potential in many of our markets including the U.S., the UK, the Philippines and Mexico. We continue to work with local regulators to facilitate the development of market structures that enable new investments in battery-based energy storage. Second, over the past eight years, we have learned a tremendous amount about how to integrate the various components to create a proprietary battery-based energy storage solution, which we have named Advancion. To promote Advancion sales in many more markets, we have executed channel partner agreements with Mitsubishi for sales in Asia and with Eaton for sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. We are in discussions with other potential partners to sell Advancion in additional markets. Although battery-based energy storage is still early on its private cycle, we believe that Advancion presents an interesting opportunity for upside in our cash and earnings forecast. Turning now to our projects under construction on slide 13. Our ongoing construction program is a most significant driver of our growth over the next few years. We expect to commission 6 gigawatts of new capacity from projects currently under construction through the first half of 2019. As a remainder, total capital expenditure for this project is $7.5 billion. However, by using financial partners, AES's equity commitment is reduced to $1.3 billion. AES's equity commitment all but $160 million has already been funded. As you can see on slide 13, roughly 74% of our investments are in Americas, and of this, a maturity is in the U.S. and Chile. We expect an average return on equity from these projects of approximately 15%. About 3-gigawatt representing half of the capacity currently under construction are 90% complete and our on track to come on line, on time and on budget this year. In 2017, we plan to commission an additional 670 megawatts of capacity in the U.S. and 112 megawatts in the Dominican Republic. We have completed about 70% of the work on these two projects, and we also expect them to come on line, on time and on budget. The remaining three major projects now under construction, Masinloc 2, OPGC 2, and Alto Maipo all projected to come on line in late 2018 and early 2019. This construction program will drive visible and attractive growth in both free cash flow and earnings. As you can see on slide 14, we expect at least 10% annual growth in proportional free cash flow through 2018, which will support our 10% annual growth in dividend, continued deleveraging of the parent and subsidiaries and investments in attractive platform expansions. Turning now to slide 15, we also see robust growth in earnings through 2018. From 2016 to 2018, we expect an attractive growth rate of 12% to 16% in our adjusted EPS. Approximately 5% of this annual growth rate is driven by cost reductions and revenue enhancements. Another 8% to10% of expected growth is driven by the 2.4 gigawatts of construction projects coming on line in 2017 and 2018. Based on our strong market position in attractive high growth markets, we are optimistic about our ability to drive growth beyond 2018. The three projects I just discussed, Masinloc 2; Colon; and Southland will come fully on line after 2018. With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom to discuss our first quarter results, capital allocation, and full year guidance in more detail. Tom O'Flynn: Thanks Andr\u00e9s. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review our first quarter results including adjusted EPS, proportional free cash flow, and adjusted pre-tax contribution or PTC by strategic business unit or SBU, and I'll cover our 2016 capital allocation, as well as our 2016 guidance. Turning to slide 17, first quarter adjusted EPS of $0.13 was $0.12 lower than 2015. Much of this decline was driven by factors incorporated into our full guidance, certain exceptions, primarily the decline in power markets in the U.S. as well as lower demand in Brazil. Specifically our results reflect the $0.04 impact from a significantly higher quarterly tax rate of 50% in 2016 versus 33% in \u201815. This was mostly driven by the timing of certain tax expenses, the largest of which was the enactment of income tax reforms in Chile. We do expect the rate to recover during the year to full year tax rate of 31% to 33%. Next, the $0.04 impact from devaluation of foreign currency is expected primarily in Latin America and Europe. And also $0.05 lower contributions from SUBs mainly due to anticipated drivers such as the expiration of Tiet\u00ea\u2019s PPA with Eletropaulo. In addition to the drivers included in our expectations, we also saw some softness in power markets and mild weather in the U.S. That being said, we\u2019ve seen some recovery in prices in the last month, which will contribute to our stronger second half of the year and helps give us comfort in our full year outlook. Now on slide 18, our overall results were primarily driven by lower margins in our Brazil, Europe and U.S. SBUs due to factors I just mentioned. Generated $253 million in proportional free cash flow, a modest decrease of $12 million from last year reflecting lower margins, mostly offset by higher collections at our Brazil utilities and lower working capital requirements in Vietnam. We also earned $172 million in adjusted PTC during the quarter, a decrease of $80 million. Now, I\u2019ll cover our SBUs in more detail over the next six slides, beginning on slide 19. In the U.S., our results reflect lower margins at DPL, due to lower wholesale prices and lower contributions from regulated customers; lower contributions from IPL due to mild weather and the partial sell-down and the sale of our Armenia Mountain wind project. Proportional free cash flow also reflects unfavorable working capital changes at IPL. In Andes, our results reflect the 40% devaluation of the Argentine peso, 24% deval of the Colombian peso and lower volumes at Chivor in Colombia. Proportional free cash flow was also impacted by higher tax payments in Chile. PTC also reflects lower equity in earnings at Guacolda in Chile. In Brazil, our results reflect lower margins to the expiration of Tiet\u00ea\u2019s PPA with Eletropaulo in 2015; lower demand at Sul and Eletropaulo and the 26% devaluation of the Brazilian real. Proportional free cash flow also reflects higher collections at Sul and Eletropaulo, as well as a favorable timing of energy purchases at Tiet\u00ea. Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, our results reflect modestly lower margins. Proportional free cash flow largely reflects higher than normal collections in the Dominican Republic in 2015. In Europe, our results reflect lower margins due to the 48% devaluation of the Kazakhstan Tenge and lower dark spreads at Kilroot in the UK. Proportional free cash flow also reflects the timing of payments to the fuel supplier at Maritza in Bulgaria and the unfavorable timing of working capital and tax payments in the UK. Finally, in Asia, our results benefited from higher margins and lower build up of working capital, as a result of start up operations at Mong Duong in Vietnam in April of 2015. Turning to slide 25, I\u2019ll now provide an update on a regulatory filing at DPL and Ohio. As you may recall, in February, DPL filed its electric security plan. Since that time, there have been challenges to regulation in Ohio. We saw the potential for similar arguments to impact the structure of other utilities proposals pending before the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio. Consequently, when we filed our plan, we included an alternative proposal that provided an option for the PUCO to approve a non-bypassable charge structured in the same way as the one approved in our existing ESP. We believe that this alternative falls under PUCO\u2019s authority and also achieves the policy goals set out by the Commission. We continue to believe this alternative provides a viable path forward for DPL and Ohio and that Commission is seeking for reasonable resolution matter before the end of this year. Turning now to our 2016 capital allocation on slide 26. Sources on left hand side continue to reflect $1.1 billion of total available discretionary cash, which includes $575 million in parent free cash flow and announced asset sales. We remain confident in our 2016 parent free cash flow range of $525 million to $625 million, which is the foundation of our discretionary cash available for dividend growth and value creation. Turning to uses on the right hand side of the slide, consistent with our capital allocation plan that we showed during our last call. The 10% growth in our dividend and share repurchases year-to-date, were returning at least a third of this cash to share holders. Going forward, we see our dividend as the primary means to distribute cash to shareholders. Stock repurchases should be less material, absent proceeds from additional asset sales and partnerships. Regarding debt reduction, we\u2019re making good progress on our $200 million target for the year, in our longer term goal of parent credit improvement. In fact, year-to-date, we\u2019ve prepaid a $125 million parent debt. Taking advantage of weak market conditions early in the quarter, we were able to buy this debt at a 7% discount. We\u2019re also seeing positive momentum on the ratings front. In March, Moody\u2019s changed our parent credit outlook from stable to positive; and in April, S&P upgraded our ratings from BB minus to BB. These actions reflect our continued efforts to derisk our portfolio and improve our credit metrics. We think that continuing to strengthen our credit will help us get better recognition and valuation for a growing cash flow and dividend. This positive credit trend along with an overall mark improvement has allowed us to continue to be opportunistic regarding refinancing and extending maturities. To that end, last week, we extended our $800 million parent revolver maturity from 2018 to 2021. Also last week on the non-recourse side, our business in the Dominican Republic was able to replace a short-term financing with a new $370 million, 10-year bond at more favorable terms. We\u2019ve also earmarked $330 million for investments in our subsidiaries, about a third of which is for our Colon project in Panama at Southland in California, coming on line after 2018. Finally, after considering these in our subs, our current dividend and debt prepayment, were left with roughly $150 million discretionary cash, which we\u2019ll invest consistent with our capital allocation framework. As in years past, much of this cash is weighted towards the latter part of the year. Now to slide 27, we are reaffirming our guidance and 2017-18 expectations for all metrics, based on foreign currency and commodity forward curves as of April 30th. We continue to generate strong proportional free cash flow, which will be relatively evenly distributed in the first and second half of the year. And with the settlement of all outstanding receivables at Maritza, we expect our first half proportional free cash flow to be well ahead of last year\u2019s. Regarding adjusted EPS, consistent with the first quarter, we also except the second quarter to be lower than normal. In fact, we are forecasting that 70% to 75% of our 2016 adjusted EPS to be recorded in the second half of 2016 versus about 60% in past years. There are few reasons that our results will be strong in the second half than first half. First, we expect a lower tax rate in the next few quarters. In any given year, there are certain items that influence quarterly rate tend to normalize on a full year basis. As I mentioned earlier, in the first quarter, we recognized a higher than usual tax expense, which when combined with relatively low first quarter earnings and at an outsized impact on our tax rate for the quarter. This tax expense was anticipated in our guidance and accordingly, we continue to expect a 31% to 33% tax rate in 2016. Second, the higher concentration of scheduled maintenance in the first half of the year will position us for stronger performance in second half, for example, San Nicolas plant in Argentina will undergo plant major maintenance entire second quarter, as part of its regular maintenance cycle that occurs about every eight years. Few of our other plants have similar circumstances. Third, forward curves for FX and commodities reflect some improvement over the balance of the year, which will provide a benefit in second half. Fourth, this year\u2019s $50 million cost reduction is more heavily weighted towards the second half. And lastly, we expect to benefit from a couple of items that we are working on to partially offset lower demand in Brazil and lower power prices in the U.S., be in a better position to discuss these later in the year. With that I'll now turn it back over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thanks Tom. To summarize our views on this call, we continue to generate strong proportional free cash flow, which will be evenly distributed between the first and second half of the year. Although we expect our first half adjusted EPS to be relatively weak, many of the negative drivers will reverse in the second half and therefore we are reaffirming our guidance for all financial metrics. In terms of our strategic priorities, in the first few months of this year, we have made significant progress, including resolving the outstanding receivables issue in Bulgaria, receiving positive actions from the rating agencies resulting from our actions to de-risk the portfolio and de-lever the parent, reaffirming our double-digit growth through 2018 in both cash flow and earnings, driven by a largely funded construction program and $150 million in cost savings and revenue enhancements, and achieving significant milestones on three new projects in our development pipeline, to drive growth beyond 2018. I am optimistic about the future of AES. We are delivering strong and growing free cash flow, which we will continue to use to maximize risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. The 6 gigawatts we currently have under construction is the largest driver of our expected growth of at least 10% in free cash flow through 2018. Beyond 2018, we are well-positioned to capture new opportunities due to our strong business platforms in attractive and growing market, and our leadership position in deploying new technologies. Now, I'd like open up the call for questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ali Agha of SunTrust. Please go ahead. Ali Agha : The first question, Tom, you alluded to the fact that while the tax rate and FX drivers in the first quarter were pretty much on plan, the U.S. and Brazil results were somewhat below plan. Could quantify how much below plan from an earnings perspective Q1 ended up? Tom O'Flynn: Yes. I think if you single out those two, it\u2019s probably $0.03 to $0.04 probably split between them, probably about $0.04 equally split. Ali Agha : And you alluded to some offsets in the second half; would they be cost reduction related initiatives or what would be offsetting them in the second half? Tom O'Flynn: Truly list that one through recently cost reductions, a part of the $50 million we are expecting to get as part of our savings plan is more heavily weighted, but truly all the things. Ali Agha : I was talking about that last bucket line, which you had mentioned in those lists of things which were not really listed in more detail, you said more to come on that. Tom O'Flynn: Yes, those will likely be in the second half, the things that -- two things of particular that we are working on to offset these issues and certainly not appropriate to give a lot of color on it, at this point, which I appreciate, people like get more color but we expect to give more color as they materialize in the second half of the year. Ali Agha : Yes. Separately, where do we stand on the Sul, transaction and what's the timing we should be expecting on that? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : As we said last time, we injected $75 million into Sul, we restructured the debt, and we are looking at all options now for Sul. At this point, I really can't comment anymore about that. Ali Agha : Okay. And lastly, on Ohio, Andr\u00e9s, as you mentioned the non-bypassable, you feel, keeps you out of the FERC review, but that still would keep the volatility of that business around. The beauty of the PPA was that it would take volatility out. I am wondering, have you looked at some of the recent filings that some folks have gone back in to try to keep FERC out and yet also keep volatility out or those would be of interest to you? And separately, if non-bypassable is the only way to go here, would you come back to the notion of potentially selling those assets again to get out of the commodity-exposed business there? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : I would say that, again, we believe that our proposal avoided some of the issues raised by the PPAs. We continue to feel that that\u2019s the correct path to go and we feel optimistic. We feel it's in everybody's interest. So, at this point what we would like to do is we continue to go with that path. And you are correct that there is a certain amount of volatility due to the on contract nature of the generation assets at DP&L, [ph] which is separate from that. But we have to -- especially if we get the non-liability rider, we have to think of it as an integrated business at that point. Ali Agha : But these other filings that I think FE and others may have made in response, would any of those be of interest to you? Ahmed Pasha : Yes, Ali, what we have filed is not much different, what they have filed as a new case, if you wish, because we filed is not -- if you look at our plan A, which is not much different what FE has recently filed. Ali Agha : Okay, we would talk more of that offline. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Perhaps, just starting where Ali left off, can you remind us just what the benefit embedded in Ohio is of continuation of the ESP structure et cetera, or whatever structure ultimately is approved there in guidance? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Given a wide range in our guidance I think, so what we have embedded in there I think is a reasonable amount going forward. But as we say, we do have somewhat of a wide range to this. And that\u2019s -- I don\u2019t Tom, would you like to add anything to that? Tom O'Flynn: I think, Julien we have said before, we\u2019re obviously in the middle of our filing and working through it. So, we are careful about too much detail here. But I think we said before we have got a 110 now on in our ESP. We have incorporated something and it will be less than that amount into our \u201817 and beyond numbers. But, it's still a meaningful number, but it's certainly less than what we currently get. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And then turning to the Chilean tax rate change, obviously it's a first quarter item, but as you think about it more structurally, what is that impact in \u201817, \u201818 et cetera, just on an ongoing basis? Tom O'Flynn: It's nothing. We headed into our guidance; it was unclear when the final legislation would be final, final, so be recognized. So, it's about $0.03 to $0.04; we fully expected it in our guidance for \u201816. It's just happen to fall in the first quarter because this final, final in Chile. What is it, it\u2019s revaluation deferred taxes, the tax rate goes up slightly; so, it's a modest revaluation of deferred taxes. It's similar to what we did two years ago, I believe, \u201814, I think it was Q3 of \u201814 as I recall. It\u2019s a similar deal. So, this is a second phase of that same legislation that came in shortly after President Bachelet took office. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And then turning to the asset sales, obviously you were very active in the first quarter here; kind of hit your annual targets already. Can you comment more broadly, I forget talking about specifics like Sul, but ambitions to continue to pursue equity sale downs? And also if you think about the ratio of buyback versus asset sales proceeds, should we assume for the most part they\u2019re going to be earnings neutral for the course of what you\u2019ve announced already and then prospectively? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : We have announced in the past that we would be selling likely on average of $200 million to $300 million in equity proceeds to us of sale downs and getting out of certain businesses. And we continue. I think we\u2019ve quite frankly outperformed the numbers that we have given in the past. Now, we don\u2019t comment on them. But, what we would be doing again is fine tuning our portfolio to have really sort of an optimal mix, optimal mix of risks and position. So, we will continue to do that. And in terms of what we do with the proceeds, we\u2019ll continue to allocate them as we have in terms of a mix, whether it\u2019d be new investments and debt pay downs. And we\u2019ll see what the circumstances are. As Tom said, I think it\u2019s more of a -- we\u2019ll have more of an emphasis on the growth of dividend than we\u2019ve had in the past. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. But give that you\u2019re at seemingly the midpoint of that 200 million, 300 million, you\u2019re saying that you\u2019ve outperformed, so you wouldn\u2019t necessary rule out further asset sales clearly? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : No, absolutely not, absolutely not. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And what is the earnings contribution loss from the asset sales seen thus far? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : We have in our forecast through 2018, we have modest decrease in earnings from those sales, because first you never can deploy the cash immediately, and it depends on the assets you\u2019re selling, its risk profile, whether it\u2019d be accretive or dilute. Operator : And our next question comes from Chris Turnure of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Chris Turnure : I appreciate that you don\u2019t want to give us too much detail on the Sul transaction or the potential of Sul transaction, but would you be able to give us, maybe the trailing 12-month EBITDA contribution from that business or PTC and then tell us how much debt is associated with that asset right now? Tom O'Flynn: The PTC contribution from Sul is -- it\u2019s modest, to be honest, it was a modest negative in the first quarter of the year. And last year, it was probably a couple of pennies of PTC, but it was -- right now, the way Sul is running, it\u2019s a negative PTC. In terms of debt, we had -- it\u2019s about $275, $300, around $300 under the exchange rates, roughly in my head when we paid it down, we got it down to about 275 in dollars. Chris Turnure : The debt is in reis? Tom O'Flynn: Yes, the debt in reis is obviously, I\u2019m doing the math in dollars; but call it $275, $300; it\u2019s all in reis, so call it then 1,100, 1,200. Chris Turnure : And you\u2019re done with the recapitalization of that asset as of now? Tom O'Flynn: Yes, we put in 300 million reis, shortly after our last call paid down some debt, and we get covenants in that part of significant amount of time. Yes. Chris Turnure : And then my second question is about kind of I guess 2019 and beyond. I\u2019m wondering, one, when we would potentially get more color on earnings that year in cash flow that year, and kind of terms of your overall growth rate and what that would mean specifically? And then I also wanted to understand, within I guess that question, the contracting structure of some of your success here on the LNG side. You have clearly at least in Panama one particular power plant where you have a 10-year contract. So, I guess I understand that. But, then how do you guys think about the risk and the structure of the actual importing of the LNG and the regas there and the selling of that to third parties? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Okay. We tend to give our longer term forecast in February of -- so that will be in next year when we sort of move out an additional. What we wanted to do was give your color that our growth will continue post 2018 and fact that we have a good pipeline through 2020 that we recently added to. So that was really the point of this call. Now, talking about the facility in Panama, Colon facility, so it has two parts, as you said, one the 380-megawatt combined cycle gas plant, with a ten year PPA with the credibility offtaker in dollars; and the second is a tank. And the tank, we\u2019re using about a quarter of the capacity for this plant. This leads about three quarters. So, it\u2019s really a question of tolling; we are not going to be taking commodity risk on this. So, this could be tolling fuel for other power plants. We did this in the Dominican Republic, we\u2019re using it. We\u2019ve built a pipeline to the -- our own actually DPP facility and converted from diesel to natural gas. And we\u2019re selling it there to the transportation and industrial sectors. So, what we would have in Panama is first to meet domestic demand; there are power plants nearby, the other power plants that will be built that will require natural gas, so that\u2019s first use. Transportation and industrial use would be second, following the model we had in Dominican Republic. And third which is very interesting is the ship bunkering. We would not be doing the bunkering; we would actually have somebody else do that, but they would use our storage and regas capacity. So, the way to think about this is you basically bring in large efficient, LNG tankers, you unload them in Panama and Dominican Republic and then you have various means of delivering gas to various kinds of customers or actually LNG as well. So, we do not plan to take any commodity per se on these transactions. We\u2019d be providing a service, regasification service, a bunkering service and a hub service. And between the two, this gives us a very attractive position to be able to service people who want services in Panama and the Dominican Republic. Chris Turnure : That\u2019s very clear. It sounds like this would be within your risk tolerance or your risk profile of contracted assets, kind of at least medium term in duration and beyond with no commodity risk? Tom O'Flynn: Yes, that\u2019s exactly right. And with some of the people who would be using these tanks, we would expect to have contracts as well, basically assuring a certain amount of capacity from our tanks. Operator : And our next question comes from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie. Please go ahead. Angie Storozynski : My first question is so, this Panama CCGT, you mentioned it's going to start operations in \u201818. Did you have it previously in your earnings expectations for \u201818; and if that's what's actually causing the guidance to move towards the high end, the percentage wise? That's one. And two, could you comment, if you have any earnings contributions for Sul and Eletropaulo in your guidance in \u201817 and \u201818? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : So, I'll take the first. No, this was not in our guidance previously. Now, realize that the power plant will come on line late in \u201818, so really won't have any effect on \u201818, it\u2019s really \u201819 forward. And the storage tank will become fully operational in \u201819. So, this is outside the window that we have given in the past. Regarding -- I think Tom can talk about the contributions of Sul and EP. Tom O'Flynn: Yes, just to put a fine point, I think Sul has been running at loss and it\u2019s been running at loss really since middle of last year. So, last year, it was down about 20 million to 25 million PTC and this year, we\u2019re forecasting similar numbers. As we look at Sul, the earnings are -- we don\u2019t have Sul in our forecast for \u201817, and inflection point for Sul will be their rate, the next rate case, rate adjustment mechanism, which is in spring of \u201818, that\u2019s if we were to retain the business. In terms of Eletropaulo, the earnings were also very modest. We do have Eletropaulo, we do continue to have it in our business but its contributions are between $0.00 and $0.02, depending upon your forecast for Brazil. So, it's fairly modest number. Operator : And our next question comes from Steven Fleishman of Wolfe Research Please go ahead. Steven Fleishman : Just a brief question on the Ohio plant. I know we had the FERC decision regarding the PPAs, but we also had a decision, not too long ago on AEP's ESP by the Supreme Court that kind of might arguably be comparable to the plans you filed, so do you have any thoughts in context of that decision? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : I thoughts are quite frankly, we see that our filing, we think has been the correct path to take and we think it's within the PUCO\u2019s purview to grant because we think it's a very similar to what we currently have in the ESP. So for those reasons, we remain optimistic. Steven Fleishman : And then just on the longer term drivers, you've given great visibility on the growth drivers and particularly new projects. Just to fill out the picture, are there any visible cliffs or roll offs over this period that we need to match against the growth projects or are those pretty much kind of done with at this point? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : I would say that the only one we have is really Southland, that\u2019s where are repowering. That\u2019s more in sort of 2020 timeframe that we have the roll ups. And I'd say that that\u2019s basically -- and in DPL, we have the -- our application for 2017 would eliminate any such cliff at DPL. So, we have nothing else major out there. Ahmed Pasha : Yes. Steven, this is Ahmed. Just on DPL, our PPA expired in \u201818 but we still operate the plant through 2020; and in 2021, our new plant comes on line -- Southland, sorry. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : This is Southland. So, that\u2019s the only when have we are PPA expires, so we are going to repower the plant. Operator : And our next question comes from Brian Chin of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Brian Chin : A question for you on the batteries\u2019 segment, which is one of the more unique aspects of the Company. You mentioned that you\u2019re seeing growth through two paths. Of the 394 megawatts in operation construction or late development, is there a way you can break out between what AES owns versus build by AES or is that all AES owned projects you\u2026 Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Those are all AES owned projects. So, we don\u2019t have -- we are working very hard on these third-party sales. We have a lot of interest in projects we are working on, some with channel partners, some on our own. And we hope to be giving you news sometime within the next six months. This is in many cases -- we're quite frankly creating the market because we are talking with regulators to make sure that the regulations allow compensation for battery-based energy storage. So yes, that\u2019s 100% our projects. Brian Chin : And then, I know because the market structures are still under development, each project is sort of one-off situation. But, in terms of modeling this growth area, can you give us sort of rules of thumb about how to think about any modeling data points, for example like dollars per KW or return levels, just anything that we can use to try and get a little bit more specific on that? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : First, it\u2019s the way we are looking at it. I mean -- and you are correct, I mean, in some cases, we are putting up relatively small projects, sort of 10 megawatts, 20 megawatts to open up a market. And a lot of the return we believe will come from third-party sales. Now, we also are seeing some markets that are more competitive, and you have basically very rapid build out energy-based storage. And so returns come down. We have others, but we are looking at sort of long-term contracts. So, I think that the way we would look at the returns is that we would expect to earn on average the same as we earned in our other projects. We are not subsidizing this business. What will be new for us, quite frankly is the third-party sales, because there we don\u2019t have to put in any equity; essentially, we are using our intellectual property rights and our experience and the brand name of Advancion. So, it's a -- we have it quite frankly incorporated, the third-party sales, because we really want to get a good feel for what they will be like. But, with our channel partners, we are really casting a wide net. And we will see I think over the next 6 to 12 months much clear how big that business could get. Operator : And our next question comes from Lasan Johong of Auvila Research. Please go ahead. Lasan Johong : Thank you. Okay. So, Andr\u00e9s, I want to ask Julien's question slightly different way. How long do you think AES to sustain this 12% to 16% growth rate beyond the \u201817, \u201818 expectations? Tom O'Flynn: At this stage, it's a little bit -- we are not ready to provide, guide sort of four, five year guidance out. I mean obviously there is a lot factors there that would influence this; what are forward exchange rates going to be, what are commodity curves, energy prices. But, what I think we feel very confident saying is we are not going to sort of run out of growth projects in 2018. We already have significant projects that will come on line 2019, 2020. And we continue to work on ways to accelerate that rate of growth. And part of it is our use of partnerships and our sell-down of assets to continue to turn capital into higher growth, higher return projects. Lasan Johong : Well, is it at least fair to say that AES has now come out of the restructuring mode that\u2019s gone on for about a decade and now we are back into the growth mode; is that at least a fair treatment? Tom O'Flynn: I think in terms of cash flow and earnings, it's a fair statement. That\u2019s how we measure success, honestly; we not going to measure in terms of megawatts. And I think we are going to remain the very disciplined Company that we have been, certainly over the last five years. We are going to be very disciplined and make sure that again not fall into any sort of rapid growth for growth sake, I mean we really want to maximize. And I think one of the things we have shown is that we are willing to have less megawatts and less clients under operation, but have a better risk profile and a better growth profile. That\u2019s really where we want to go. Lasan Johong : Okay. Switching to Panama, is it fair to say you are looking at the source of LNG for the plant in Gulf of Mexico? Tom O'Flynn: Yes. We have a contract through 2023 for gas from Trinidad for the Dominican Republic. In terms of the source of gas for our share, the 25% that we will be using, we have a contract with one of the big suppliers. They can source it wherever they feel best. Probably some of it will come from the U.S. liquefaction facilities in the Gulf. And then when they are -- we feel at the tank and other people are utilizing it and they are taking the commodity risk, it's up to them where they will source it. Lasan Johong : Okay. So, it's coming from [indiscernible] model and not directly from this plant? Tom O'Flynn: That\u2019s correct, unlike the case in Trinidad that we\u2019ve seen, but it was very directed and it was coming from Trinidad at the point, or initially. Now they have optionality. Lasan Johong : Okay. A quick question on Brazil; there are very interesting assets, upper river of Paranapanema where AES's long said that controls that because it provides tremendous benefits, both in terms of cost as well as upgrades and development opportunities. It\u2019s on for sale, any comments? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : I think that it\u2019s true that Paranapanema which is owned by Duke in Tiet\u00ea were once one company and was split in two. Having said that, what we\u2019re looking at our complete portfolio, in terms of our risk profile. We have right now a lot of Brazil hydro risk. So, this really isn\u2019t, we think in our sweet spot at this point in time. And we also understand that they are going to sell the whole package together, of all the other assets. It\u2019s a pretty big ticket and there are other assets that we\u2019re not interested in. So, what I would say is that really at this point, it\u2019s not something we are actively pursuing. Lasan Johong : Last question on Brazil, Brazil\u2019s been long in recession/mild depression for the last couple of years. Do you think the Olympics will help bring it back out of that mode and back to a more possible economic profile or do you think it\u2019s need a political change to get that. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : I think that the Brazil is a much more diversified economy than perhaps it gets credit for. I mean as you look at the GDP of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, it looks more like Belgium than it does to some of the Northeastern states of Brazil, so to realize that point. Now, I think that Brazil got itself into the some funk, some policy issues, not just commodity price drops. So, the good thing is that they can work their way out of it. Our view is that they\u2019ll probably take a couple of years at least for Brazil to get out of it. I don\u2019t think that the Olympics will have any effect whatsoever. I think the key point. Lasan Johong : Really? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes, I really think that. The key point for Brazil is, determine the political process; who is going to be the President within six months and what policies he will pursue; so, having said that, Brazil has a lot of strong points in its economy. So, if they get their political act together and take some tough structural changes, I\u2019m sure, it will be back within five years, I feel very confident that Brazil will be -- can be a strong economy again. Lasan Johong : I\u2019m sorry but I have to ask one last question, which is if that\u2019s the case, then Brazil sounds like it\u2019s on a very fine line between great candidate for divestiture versus great candidate for expansion. AES has available -- slide BNDES, yet still owns a large chunk of everything that AES has a footprint in except for Sul. And there\u2019s been a lot of talk about privatizing the BNDES\u2019 interests. Is that something that you want to pursue more aggressively, depending on the political situation or is this something that\u2019s laid for a long time? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : We can\u2019t speak for BNDES and what they decide to do with their assets. We did have the separation of our assets in Brazil to give us greater operating control in Tiet\u00ea and greater capital structuring flexibility in general. So, we\u2019ve done that. And I would say that, if you look at what we\u2019ve done Brazil, we\u2019ve certainly de-risked our self significantly, because we sold half of our holdings in Eletropaulo in 2006. We spun off the telco from Eletropaulo; sold that for $1 dollars. So we feel that we\u2019ll continue to manage Brazil sort of holistically and look at what are the fundamental exposures we have there. Operator : And our last question today comes from Charles Fishman of Morningstar. Please go ahead. Charles Fishman : Andr\u00e9s, just to follow up that last question; you are probably most knowledgeable person about Brazil that I ever get a chance to ask a question to. In a quarter or two quarters ago, you talked about a turnaround in Brazil, maybe 2018. And now, in response to the last question, I heard you say like more like five years. Has something happened in the last three months that makes you a little more pessimistic? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : No, let me clarify that. I do think the turnaround in two years is still I would say possible, may be sort of 50-50 chance. What I think within five-years, I feel very optimistic at some point, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s three years, two years, they will come back. I think depending on the political resolution of that the crisis they are facing now, I wouldn\u2019t even be surprised that you have a sort of, I don\u2019t know, call it euphoria but a pickup in sentiment in Brazil with the resolution. I mean we\u2019ve seen that when you have certain political developments, they actually appreciate in the market. So, what I think is important to realize is that the crisis in Brazil has a lot to do with certain policies and not just the drop in commodity prices. So that makes the comeback more within their capabilities of doing. Ahmed Pasha : Okay. We thank everybody for joining us in today\u2019s call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any questions you may have. Thank you and have a nice day. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, the conference is now concluded.

All participants will be in listen-only mode [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Ahmed Pasha. Please go ahead. Ahmed Pasha : Thank you, William. Good morning and welcome to our AES's second quarter 2016 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning are Andr\u00e9s Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom O'Flynn, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will now turn the call over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thanks you, Ahmed. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our second quarter 2016 financial review call. Today, I will discuss our year-to-date performance, provide an updates on market conditions and our progress on our strategic and financial objectives. Tom will then discuss our second quarter results and capital allocation in more detail. Before turning to results, I would like to highlight the most significant milestones that we achieved so far on our key objectives for 2016. To continue de-risking our portfolio, we announce our close asset sales with proceeds of more than $500 million well above our target range of $200 million to $300 million. We brought online one-third of our capacity under construction, or 2.4 gigawatts on-time and on-budget. We prepaid $300 million in current debt exceeding our full-year target of $200 million, to accelerate our credit improvement. We are on-track to achieve our three-year $150 million cost reduction and revenue enhancement goals. In Bulgaria, we receive payment of all outstanding receivables and continue to collect timely payment of invoices. And we continue to make progress to resolve DP&Ls pending rate case and our encouraged with recent regulatory developments in Ohio. I will discuss these achievements in more detail in the moment, but first, I would like to summarize our financial results on Slide 4. Year-to-date, we generated proportional free cash flow of $670 million, representing 57% of our full-year guidance and reflecting the collection of outstanding receivables in Bulgaria during the second quarter. Our year-to-date adjusted EPS was $0.32 representing 32% of our full-year guidance, consistent with our comments on our last call. These results keeps us on-track to achieve our full-year financial guidance, which Tom will cover in detail. Now I'll provide an update on macroeconomic conditions in our markets on Slide 5. First in Brazil, although we have seen a modest improvement in energy demand since our last call, we are still projecting negative growth for the year. In U.S. demand is essentially flat, but in most of our other markets, we continue to see robust growth in energy demand in the range of 4% to 10%. Second while we have seen significant volatility in foreign exchange and commodity prices over the last couple of years, we are generally seeing market stabilize, as a result foreign exchange and commodity forward curves are largely in line with our expectation as of our last call. The one exception is that as a result of Brexit the British pound has depreciated by roughly 10%. However, we are largely here in the near-term and more importantly our exposure to the pound, is only about 3% of our pretax contribution. Turning to Slide 6 on our portfolio optimization activities. In Brazil, we are seeing significant consolidation of the regulated utility sector at attractive valuations. We capitalize on this trend with the announced sale of our 100% ownership interest Sul, our most material utility business in Brazil from an investment point of view for approximately $470 million in equity proceeds to AES. We are currently seeking regulatory approval for the transaction and expect to close before the end of the year. Including, the proceeds from the sale of Sul, we have announced our closed a total of $540 million in asset sales this year. Since September 2011, we have announced our closed asset sales with $3.8 billion in proceeds. The corner stone of our strategy in Brazil is [indiscernible] by perusing contracted wind and solar generation. Now that we are seeing the opportunity for reasonable inflation adjusted returns. These investments for help diversified [indiscernible] generation mix, while also allowing us to take advantage of the 300 million to 500 million in untapped debt capacity at [indiscernible]. Turning now to our platform expansion opportunities on Slide 7. Our ongoing construction program is the most significant driver of our growth over the next few years. We are focusing on our investment efforts on platform expansion projects with long-term U.S. dollar denominated contracts. One such opportunity is using our DR and future panama assets, to play a leading role and expanding the use of L&G throughout Central America and the Caribbean. 7.20: We have another 3.9 gig watts of new capacity currently under construction and expect it to come online through 2019. To deliver sustainable growth beyond 2019 we continue to advance our development pipeline. To that end, we recently received approval for the 1.4 gig watts Southland repowering project from the California Utility Commission and we are on-track to receive final environmental permit, early in 2017 and expect to break ground at summer. Turning now to Slide 8. Our 3.9 gigawatt currently under construction represent total capital expenditures of $7.8 billion. However, through a combination of non-recourse financing and equity partners, AESs equity commitment is limited to 1.3 billion of this all but 215 has been funded. Roughly 74% of our investments are in the Americas and of this a majority is in the U.S. and Chile. We expect average return on equity from these projects of approximately 15%. The majority of our construction projects are conventional power plants such as the 670 megawatt Eagle Valley combined cycle gas fired plant at IPL. Additionally, as we have discussed in the past, we are also building the 530 megawatt Alto Maipo, one of the river hydro project in Chile. This project is our most complex, as we are excavating 67 kilometers of underground tunnels. One-third of which are already complete. The project is roughly six months behind its original schedule and we expect to complete the project in 2019. Turning to Slide 9, and Colon project in Panama. We have made significant progress since our last call. As a reminder, the $1 billion Colon project will contribute to our growth beyond 2018 and includes, a 380 megawatt combined cycle gas plant and a 180,000 cubic meter LNG regasification and storage facility. The power plant is contracted under a ten year U.S. dollar denominated power purchase agreement, and our partner Grupo Motta, one of the largest financial and commercial groups in the country. We recently achieved two important milestones at Colon. Closing the financing of 535 billion with the consortium of banks and initiating construction. The Colon project seeks to replicate the success of our Andres LNG facility in the Dominican Republic. Andres provides gas to our adjacent power plant to another power plant via a gas pipeline and to numerous downstream customers in the transportation and industrial sector. Last month, Andres also delivered its first international shipment of LNG to Barbados. This is a great example of our facility\u2019s ability to serve as a reasonable gas hub by breaking large bulk shipments to serve smaller markets. There are many commercial and operational synergies between our LNG terminals in the Dominican Republic and Panama and with both facilities in operation, we will become the largest provider of the LNG regasification and storages services in Central America and the Caribbean. Turning to Slide 10. We remain optimistic on the future of battery base energy storage, because we believe it will play a critical role in an increasingly renewable based generation mix. As you may know with our proprietary advancing system, we are the world leader in battery based energy storage with a 136 megawatts in operation across four countries, 13 megawatts under construction and 228 megawatts in advanced development including a 100 megawatts under our long-term contract. We integrate [indiscernible] view in the energy storage space through two primary business models. First by developing and operating AES own project, such as the 20 megawatt Harding Street battery array we recently commissioned at IPL. As I just mentioned we currently have a 166 megawatts in operation or construction and another 220 megawatts in advance stage development. Second by marketing and selling our Advancion Energy storage solution to other utilities commercial and industrial customers directly or through our sales channels partners, these sales require no investment capital and help advance to capture economies of scale. Thus far this year, we have sold 40 megawatt of Advancion systems third-parties, representing approximately $70 million in growth revenue. Our second quarter results do not include these sales, but margins are on our initial sales will be modest, as we amortize start up cost. Although battery based energy storage is still it\u2019s early adoption cycle and we have not included any matured amount in our projection. We believe Advancion, presents an interesting opportunity for upside. Turning to Slide 11, as a result of all the actions we are taking, we expect at least 10% annual growth in proportional free cash flow through 2018, which will support our 10% annual growth in dividend, continue deleveraging of the plant and subsidiary and investment in attractive platform expansions. As you can see on Slide 12, we also see robust growth in the earnings to 2018. From 2016 to 2018, we expect an attractive growth rate of 12% to 16% in our adjusted EPS. Approximately 5% of this annual growth is driven by cost reductions and revenue enhancements. Another 8% to 10% of expected growth is driven by the construction projects coming online in 2017 and 2018. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom to discuss our second quarter results, capital allocation, and full-year guidance in more details. Thomas O'Flynn: Thanks Andr\u00e9s. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review our results including adjusted EPS, proportional free cash flow, and adjusted pre-tax contribution or PTC by strategic business unit or SBU, and I'll cover our 2016 capital allocation, as well as our guidance and expectations. Turning to Slide 14, second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.17 was $0.09 lower than 2015. This decline is in line expectations communicated on our last call. Specifically, our second quarter results reflect $0.03 lower contributions from SBU, including anticipated drivers, such as timing of schedule maintenance in ANDES and MCAC. A reduction of $0.03, because last year\u2019s results included the favorable impact of the reversal of a liability at Eletropaulo. And the $0.03 impact from the evaluation in foreign currencies as expected particularly in ANDES in Europe. Before moving on, I want to touch on a couple of large impairment charges we had this quarter that are not included in adjusted EPS. First we impaired 235 million of assets at DPL, primarily at Kelin station, this impairment impacts our quarterly diluted EPS, and was larger driven by the results of the recent PJM capacity auction and our expectation of higher future environmental compliance cost under the EPA Effluent Limitation Guidelines in coal combustion with [indiscernible]. Second as you have seen in our 10-Q, as a results of the sale, we have included Sul in discontinued operation and an imperilment was recognized during the second quarter. The remaining loss on sale will be recorded at the closing of the transaction. After taking into account previously recorded cumulative transaction adjustment. The net impact on as is equity will be a reduction of our 100 million. Given this business is in discontinued operations, these non-cash items do not affect either diluted or adjusted EPS. As a result of placing Sul, into Disc Ops, it\u2019s earnings and losses are removed from our 2016 and 2015 results. Consequently, our first quarter results have been restated to $0.15 after moving the $0.02 negative impact for Sul, which brings our year-to-date adjusted EPS for $0.32. Now to Slide 15 and our overall results for the quarter. We generated 417 million of proportional free cash flow an increase of three 355 million from last year a significant of working capital improvements primarily at Maritza in Bulgaria offset lower margins. We also earned a 160 million in adjusted PTC during the quarter, a decrease of 100 million. Now, I\u2019ll cover our SBUs in more detail over the next six slides, beginning on Slide 16. In the U.S., our results reflect relatively flat margins, as lower wholesale prices and lower contributions from regulated customers; at DPL were largely offset by higher contributions at IPL. Including the benefit from the recent rate case and environmental upgrades they came online through this quarter. Also adjusted PTC was up modestly reflecting lower interest expense at DPL and IPL. Proportional free cash flow also reflects favorable working capital changes at IPL. At ANDES, our results reflect the slightly higher margins due to higher spot and contract sales as well as lower maintenance at [indiscernible] in Chile. Partially offset by planned outages in Argentina as well as the devaluation of the Colombian and Argentine pesos. Proportional free cash flow also benefitted from higher collections in Argentina and at [indiscernible]. In Brazil our result reflect lower margins due to the benefit of a liability reversal at Eletropaulo in 2015. The exploration of Tiet\u00ea PPA at the end of 2015 and the 12% devaluation of the Brazilian real. Proportional free cash flow also reflects higher collections at Eletropaulo and Sul. In Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, our results reflect lower margins due to lower availability including a planned outage ion the Dominican Republic, where we were performing interconnection work in the preparation for the expansion of existing DPP gas fire facility. As you may recall for converting the simpler cycle DPP plant to combine cycle. Improving its capacity by 50% to 358 megawatts. Construction on this project is progressing well. We have already completed 80% of the upgrade and it is expected to come online in the first half of 2017. Our quarterly results were also impacted by lower third party gas sales in the Dominican Republic. In Europe, our results reflect lower margins due to 45% devaluation of the Kazakhstan Tenge. Proportional free cash flow also reflects the settlement of our 350 million outstanding receivable at Maritza in Bulgaria this quarter. It\u2019s worth mentioning that we've seen greatly improved collections in the roughly three months since that settlement and payments occurring. As a direct results of recent energy sector reforms our off taker, NEK is now cash flow positive versus substantially negative in 2015. This improved financial condition also drove strong interest in the recent bond issuance by NEKs parent where they are able to raise more than \u20ac0.5 billion and attractive rates. Finally, in Asia, our results reflect steady margins and lower working capital requirements, at Mong Duong in Vietnam. Now Slide 22, I\u2019ll provide an update on a regulatory filing at DP&L and Ohio. Under DP&L current ESP which cover the period from 2014 to 2016. DP&L has been collecting a service stability writer of little over 9 million per month. As you may know the Supreme Court of Ohio reverse the Utility Commission's approval of current ESP in late June. The court has since remanded the case to the commission, which now has jurisdiction. Last week the DP&L filed to withdraw its current ESP and requested that the commission revert to the rates in effect prior to 2014, which would result in an in material financial impact of company. Matters now pending before the commission and we expect a ruling within a matter of weeks. At same time, we continue to progress on our filing for a new ESP. Which we expect to be effectively to begin in 2017. We expect an outcome that will supports the financial viability and credit profile of the business. Now to Slide 23, and the progress we are making to improve our credit profile. We recently completed the refinancing of 500 million of our 2019 notes, extending the tender with 10 tenure notes. Additionally, since our last call, we have prepared a 180 million in parent debt. Bringing our total pay down year to date to 300 million, exceeding our 2016 debt reduction target by 50%. Since 2011 we reduced parent debt by 1.7 billion or 27% and reduced interest by on that 125 basis points, resulting in an annualize interest savings of 180 million. As you can see at the top of the slide, we now have no debt maturities maturing at the parent until 2019 when only 240 million is due. In addition to the refinancing excluded to parent, we have also taken advantage of favorable market conditions and refinanced 1.4 billion in non-recourse debt primarily in Latin America. Through these proactive actions, we have been able to extend our maturities lower interest cost and reduced our exposure to floating rate interest. As you can see at the bottom of the slide, these proactive steps has helped us to reduce our parent leverage ratio from almost 6.5 times to slightly over 5 times debt to parent free cash ratio plus interest. These actions reflect our continued efforts to derisk our portfolio and improve our credit metrics. We believe this will help us reduced our cost of debt and enhance our equity valuation. Now to our parent allocation on Slide 24. Sources on the left hand side, reflect 1.5 billion of total available discretion in cash, which includes 575 million of parent free cash flow. We continue to focus on maximizing cash to core and as a recent example, once with Macori administration looked at currency controls is in Argentina, we took a modest dividend of the first time since 2011. We remain confident in our 2016 parent free cash flow range of 525 million to 625 million, which is the foundation for our discretionary cash available for dividend growth and value creation. Sources also include 540 million of proceeds from asset sales including approximately 470 million sales of Sul. As we expect to sell the close late in the year, the likely not deploy much as capital in 2016. We have however accelerated a portion of the expected proceeds by pre-paying a 180 million of parent debt in July that I just discussed. No to uses on the right hand side of the slide, consistent with our capital allocation plan that we showed during our last call. With 10% growth in our dividend and completed share repurchases we returned about one third of our allocated cash to shareholders this year. Going forward, we continue to see our dividend as the primary means to distribute cash to shareholders. As just discussed we already prepaid 300 million in near term maturities. We also allocated 360 million for investments in our subsidiaries and majority of which is for new projects driving our growth to 18 and beyond. After considering this investments in our subsidiaries, debt repayment and electronic dividend we are left with roughly 450 million of discretionary cash, which we will invest consistent with our capital allocation framework. Finally, turning to Slide 25. We are reaffirming our 2016 guidance and 2017, 2018 expectations for all metrics with the foreign exchange and commodity fortress as of June 30. We continue to generate strong proportional free cash flow with our first half results reflecting the settlement of all outstanding receivables at Maritza. Our first half, adjusted EPS was in line with what we have indicated on our last call. As our results were impacted by higher tax rate planned outrages and softness in U.S. power prices. The majority of our earnings are expected to be generated in the second half of the year and we should benefit from a few factors putting lower schedule maintenance, a lower effective tax rate, the realization of cost savings initiative and a couple of other items we are working on. With that, I'll now turn it back over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thanks Tom. Before we take our question, let me summarize today's call. First we are executing on our priorities for 2016. Exiting certain businesses at attractive valuation completing 2.4 gigswatts of projects on-time and on-budget improving our credit profile and collecting on our outstanding receivables in Bulgaria. Second we continue to invest our growing cash flow to reduce debt and in select gross projects as well as offer our investors a significant and growing dividends. Third, we remain confident in our ability to deliver strong free cash flow growth through 2018, which is driven by our projects under construction and our cost savings and revenue enhancement initiatives. Finally, we believe we are well positioned to deliver sustainable growth beyond 2018 due to our strong business platforms in attractive and growing markets and our leadership position in deploying new technologies. With that, I would like to open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Ali Agha : Thank you good morning. First question, can give us the sense of what gives you the confidence that the Ohio issue is particularly that's a correlation to the non-by passable are going to be resolved favorably and what are sort of the key milestones we should be looking at to figure out how this is playing out? Thomas O\u2019Flynn: We continue to have normal discussions consistent with the process in Ohio. We are obviously aware of developments with the other major utilities in the phase especially [Indiscernible] and they have got little bit different perspectives, but we think those are both constructive directions. We do continue to think that those strong support in the state for in state generations giving the fall of vertex diligent too far removed. The in state jobs in state revenue from taxes and those kind of things. So we think there is strong support for that and I apologize to say we are encourage by discussions as we said we re-filed our rates for the remainder of 2016 to go basically back to the pre 2014 structure and we think that there is constructive and consistent with the sentiments. Ali Agha : And secondly as insulated to that Tom, so what is on that in to both your 2016, 2017, 2018 and outlook for this non by passable and I\u2019m assuming your attiring that continuing. And what if that doesn\u2019t happened, how should we think about the sensitivities with your earnings, whether it\u2019s for this year or for the growth in 2017, 2018 if that goes away? Thomas O\u2019Flynn: I think what we would say is, I think we have been consistent here, number one our most recent filing would not have material impact, assume we go back to the 2013 rate structure, we would not have material impact on our financials for the reminder of 20`6. Going forward, as we discussions this different approaches here, but we generally baked into our guidance is less than what we are currently getting, which is about a 110 million a year or 9 million a month, but it\u2019s still material amount. We haven\u2019t put a fine point on that but certainly it would be meaningful impact if there are a large fall but at this point we believe we will get something in that range. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Remember also Ali, we\u2019ve not taken a dividend out of DPL, for some time and there is no parent free cash flow from DPL at least till 2018 in our forecast. Ali Agha : Okay, understood. Separately Andr\u00e9s when you look at your portfolio today, can you just highlight for us, what regions or assets in general would you consider to be non-core to this portfolio as you continue going down the road of streamlining your platform? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Okay, we have, I think on very well in terms of focusing this company, in terms of getting out of those regions were we didn\u2019t see those markets was so attractive and realizing attractive valuation from those sales. So what we are focused on in terms of growth, it\u2019s going to be those places we can get, long term ideally dollars denominated contracts and were we can bring something besides just money. So these are additions where there are synergies or economics have scale. So we don\u2019t like talking about exactly those places that we are going to get out of until we do it. And you know we have very much stuck to that rule over the years. But I would say those countries, where we don\u2019t see those opportunities. Where we see that, today quite frankly they are either too volatile or we don\u2019t see opportunities for growth. So what I would like to say, we will continue to grow those businesses, especially those that are cash accretive and our real focus is on creating a company where we have a strong sustainable growth in our dividend and that\u2019s what we are focused on. So I\u2019m not going to get into it specifically, but I think if you do it by the process to elimination which is those places where we don\u2019t see growth, where we don\u2019t see long-term contracts and we really don\u2019t have any really sort of particularly advantages position we will get out of. Now we won\u2019t talk about them, until it\u2019s actually done, because obviously those can affect our operations. Ali Agha : Last question, Tom just remind us, why don\u2019t you, you\u2019re not allocated specially cash in terms of your priority of the use of that cash and you just remind us what your priority would be on ranking your priorities? Thomas O\u2019Flynn: Yes, I think will across all the [indiscernible] side I think we will look at incremental growth and I think we have said that we would expect about 300 million to 400 million of contributions into our businesses from core on a normal year. This year we are kind of right in middle of that point. Of course continuing to grow the dividend on a regular basis, we will continue to look to deleverage and may take some of this opportunity to accelerate the deleveraging in our balance sheet. And of course stock repurchases is still something we have authority for, we have done a lot. So as we said, I think our primary focus in terms of cash to shareholders would be by the dividend. Ali Agha : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Julien Dumoulin Smith with UBS. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So, perhaps a few more specific questions on the [Indiscernible] process here just being very clear. How to think about the ESP-1 rate structure for 2013. What I understand it's mostly a regulated structure with fuel pass through how should be think about power prices and just competitive retailers under that rate structure. I know it's a bit detailed, but I'm just to be curious so it is are you still positively exposed to stock prices increasing net-net. I'm just trying to understand how that the supplier recovery gets done and then secondly can you talks you the ESP-3 filing that you have pending are you been to need the re-filing of that or are you been amended to reflect some of the changes that might be necessary out of the Ohio Supreme Court. Thomas O\u2019Flynn: Yes, Julien let me try to tackle that. In terms of number one the market risk and reward that we have is under our restructure and one that we had it or one that we are not going to revert back to is really the gen, is really at our generation that - basis of risking rewards of the market. In terms of structure of going back to, its different kind of financially at the end of day, it's about the same for us, but there was a group of people that have they not chopped then they would go to a defined rate structure. And that kind of slices it up a little bit different way, but the utility is not exposed to that it's a little bit different way to slice up the same amounts. In terms of going forward, we believe that what we had filed earlier in January and February, we can work under that umbrella, if you will. So we don\u2019t need to pull that back and re-file. Remember we had a couple of different alternatives and so we feel that that umbrella gives us the flexibility to shape a solution in different ways. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it and just to be clear. The ESP-1 the 2013 rate structure will remain indefinitely until you got a rate outcome under the ESP-3 structure. So kind of agnostic perhaps too strong award there, but throughout the process whenever you eventually get an outcome in ESP-3 just to be clear. Thomas O\u2019Flynn: Yes, it would remain outstanding until those a supplement for it. And both of them are supportive of our financial structure. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Go it, excellent. And then jus the quick one and following up on the last question as well. Brazil Eletropaulo, can you comment just on what your thought process is there, obviously there has been some media comments there. How do you think about Brazil both on the [indiscernible] and the Eletropaulo by prospectively in the [indiscernible] region and how would you execute the your going into? Thomas O\u2019Flynn: Okay, first given that Eletropaulo is a publicly listed company, we don\u2019t comment on it. I think what we have said is that, we made a significant strategic move by existing Sul. If you look at today\u2019s market price the equity value we had at Sul is more than [indiscernible] the value that we have in the Eletropaulo, so we have made a significant shift. Second, we have been very disciplined in Brazil, specially at [indiscernible]. We always for many years had this leverage capacity and the ability to buy new assets to grow. But we didn\u2019t really see the valuations. We really didn\u2019t see valuations that we are attracted for us. With the correction in prices in Brazil, we are starting to see opportunity that would make it more attractive to leverage up [indiscernible] and buy something in Brazil. Now what would we buy? Well as we said in the past, we are really looking at our sort of risks, and we wouldn\u2019t want more hydro risk in Brazil, so ideally it would be something like sola or wind or perhaps even thermal that would not be correlated to hydrology in Brazil to make our cash flow from [indiscernible] more steady. So again, Eletropaulo being a publicly listed company, it would be process pertinent to that market, but we are going to comment on it. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Sorry and then the last quick one, any update on the assets the you impaired in DPL, just curious if that has any reflection on the future viability of them in terms of retirement or whether they clearly [indiscernible]. Thomas O\u2019Flynn: No that was just at Kelin and that was just because it had a higher carrying value it was reflecting the result of the latest capacity auction. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : They are all cleared Julian, all our [indiscernible] is cleared. Operator : The next question is from Steven Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Stephen Byrd : Hi good morning. Just wanted to check in with you on the storage business, there is increasingly talk about the business and you all obviously are very early into this business, when you think about growth potentials, we are seeing reports that costs are coming down for the actually equipment. Do you see that there are sort of inflections point at which it does become a fairly large driver of spending or is it a more gradual thing, where there is ultimately a step change, buts it\u2019s rather just a gradual increase as you go down the curve. In other words, do you see relatively significant changes within, a year or two or three in terms of where the cost is going that going to allow the businesses to scale up a lot or do you thinks it\u2019s probably more gradual pace? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : What we are seeing in the business, is continued reduction in cost. So if we look at the cost of batteries they have come down 80% in the last five year and we are projecting an additional 50% in the next five. So that would driven them down significantly and really this is not technological breakthrough, it is as much as just really massification of the production process. So the more people that bring online giga factories and drive down battery prices, the batter it will be for people such as ourselves. Now, given that how do you see this market, well this market is growing one of the main let's say things that are slowing it down it regulatory, since these batteries operate differently than just regulatory say [peeking] plans where other people providing ancillary services, because for example it goes positive and it goes negative. But having said that we are seeing this market that was a couple of 100 megawatts last year this it's growing some of the forecast by 2020 could be 10 gigawatts globally. The forecast the lower as forecast you will see it's probably around 6 gigawatts that's still a tremendous rate of growth. Now that there are many applications, there is little bit of the hammer and so you can use it for many different things from load shifting ancillary services capacity release transmission constraint. So that's how we see this market, now I see it kind of growing quickly some markets quicker than others the U.S. is clearly leading great the UK is having an important auction now, we see interesting markets in India with their expansion of renewable. So basically as I said in my speech as you have more renewable on the grid interruptible renewable the greater the need for these batteries, and there are different forms to alleviate that. So we are pursuing it by two means one is on our own platform, we are participating in some of these auctions when they are big enough we do bring in partners like we do on all large projects, but we are also pursuing through some direct sales, but also through sales channel partners global sales. And we have already have had some success with $70 million so far this year. We expect that to grow over the remainder of the year and into next and of course that has overtime will have an interesting margin. But right now one of the things it does it helps to drive down cost, because this is all about scale. So if are one of the largest suppliers to the market I think you will have across advantage. Stephen Byrd : That's very helpful color, Andr\u00e9s. And you had mentioned in your prepared remarks about essentially amortizing some of these initial cost. Could you remind us just sort of how rapidly you think you would be able to kind of [indiscernible] through those cost so that we can start to see significant margins on incremental sales. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Look it's going to depend on - this is volume. So basically think of startup cost and things like that are fixed cost, the more you have the more quickly we are not really prepared to sort of give guidance on the third-party sale, but I really don\u2019t see this certainly not this year and probably next is not being a meaningful contributor. Stephen Byrd : Thank you. I'm sorry? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : And the finally this is not in our guidance for that reason, but this could become quite interesting outside that time horizon. Stephen Byrd : That's great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from Lasan Johong from Auvila Research Consulting. Please go ahead. Lasan Johong : Good morning thank you. Tom, I have a quick question on the 15% rate of return should we expect the hurdle rate to go up as interest rates go up and your cost of capital go up with it? Thomas O\u2019Flynn: Yes, I think the short answer is generally interest rates are being coming down and our cost of capital I think has been coming down so I think that's a good number certainly on the projects we are doing. To the extent that I think Andr\u00e9s mentioned much of our focus will be on long-term U.S. contracted business some of that may warrant some compression of that modestly, but I don\u2019t think we see them going up. Lasan Johong : My point eventually the interest rate are going to go up at some point, right whether it\u2019s a year or two years from now. When that happens, are we going to see is that 15% hurdle rate go up? Thomas O\u2019Flynn: Yes the one thing I would say is we certainly look at our cost of capital IRRs on a real time basis, real time for global interest rates, local interest rates, local risk. So certainly if there is a meaningful change in macro conditions, be it interest rate risk or other things inflation what have you. We would certainly factor that into that into our capital allocation framework. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Lasan I think, one way to look at this is, we want to earn a 200 basis points plus over our sort of weighted cost capital on this projects. So it\u2019s going to depend on their locations. So for example, you are really, we will have a lower ROI for those projects that are rate based on our regular utilities Than we do on some of the other projects which are one different locations. But the one thing we are moving towards, I would say, de-risking the company. And so that I think it\u2019s an important component and I so it\u2019s dollar denominate long term contract, in the good zip code and that\u2019s a great country. Those will have a lower return than some of the other locations. But I do think that when you look at our projects, what is important is there is a lot of synergies between them. So if we look at for example the Panama project, it will have significant synergies if we increase the amount of tolling we do from that facility, you know our power plant will take roughly about 30% of the capacity to tank in the terminal. So we are really looking for a third-party sales, like we do in the Dominican Republic. So once you have the two hubs operating the return from the project will not only be from the project itself, will also be from the existing businesses. So that\u2019s how we are looking at it. and just to say, so I don\u2019t think that if interest rates go up, it depends, how much they go up, but we are also shifting our business to less risky businesses and the returns of the project is also returns to the bits to existing businesses, which perhaps were not included in that ROE. Lasan Johong : No let me flip the question around. How much more businesses you usually get if you drop the hurdle rate to 12% or 10% even? Thomas O\u2019Flynn: I think if we drop the hurdle rate, again we don\u2019t have a universal hurdle rate. The lower the cost of [Technical Difficulty] projects in some other markets [Technical Difficulty] we don\u2019t use the universal hurdle rate. Lasan Johong : Okay. Thank you very much for your help. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead. Brian Russo : Hi good morning. Just curious are there any issues or risk to the Sul approval process, I believe that these acquires, shareholder approval, just may be some comment on the milestones there to get approved? Thomas O\u2019Flynn: Yes the milestone and they have a shareholders\u2019 approval. We believe that they are very confident of getting it. Then there would be an approval of [indiscernible] which is the regulator. And that\u2019s why we are targeting this close for the fourth quarter of this year, but given all that\u2019s happening in Brazil, we don\u2019t expect any issue. And furthermore, it\u2019s a acquisition that makes a lot of sense, which is consolidating the distribution company into state of real grounded to Sul. So there is lot of logic, a lot of cost savings from bringing these together. So we think the fundamentals for the transaction for the acquirer are very strong. Brian Russo : Okay, thanks. And then just on the TPO, Ohio process. I'm just curious what was the thought process to file to revert back to the pre 2014 rate structure. I mean did you have discussions with staff or what made you choose that route versus any of the other alternatives. Thomas O\u2019Flynn: Yes, I mean we did have some consultation, I better not go into the specifics, but following the Supreme Court we wanted to look for something that had the same provision of stability and supporting the overall financial viability of the company, but staying away from let's say the specifics of the Supreme Court. But also appreciating that there was strong motivation for the reason that I mentioned earlier to keep the utility stable and keep our generation viable. Brian Russo : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes is from Brian Chin with Bank of America ML. Please go ahead. Brian Chin : Hi good morning. I have got a question on the effluent requirement and the coal combustion residual requirements. How much extra CapEx is that going to necessitate? Thomas O\u2019Flynn: Yes, we haven\u2019t disclose that specifically. I believe DPL has the three-year forward CapEx table that is in their K. We are still reviewing it, but we did have some preliminary number let's say that were baked into our impairment analysis and it was really the combination of those numbers. They really be out - I believe it\u2019s a 20 to 21 times zone as well as we did have to take note of the recent capacity auction that was down much from 160 to about 100 and that we think a 100s low, we did have to factor that most recent data point into our long-term forecast. Brian Chin : Okay, so just to be clear that CapEx spending would be done in 2021 or there is a deadline for the plants to meet the requirements by 2021? Ahmed Pasha : Brain this is Ahmed. This is [Indiscernible] 2022 and as Tom mentioned I mean we did have a number in our forecast, but based on the revised forecast the projections are slightly higher, but real impact for this impairment is the capacity prices, which came in lower than what we were expecting. So that was the bigger driver than the CapEx. Brian Chin : Got you. And then just going back to your prepared comments on Sul. You mentioned that you had re-classed Sul into discontinued operation and there was a $0.02 sort of swing on year-to-date to adjusted EPS. I'm just assuming that you haven\u2019t change guidance, because $0.02 is relatively minor or immaterial versus the guidance range is that right? Thomas O\u2019Flynn: That's fair and to be honest when we talked last time we did say - when we had a slower first quarter we did say there were some things that we are working on and this is at least one of the thing in the bucket. Brian Chin : Got you. Great, thank you very much that\u2019s all I got. Operator : Our next question is from Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Charles Fishman : Thank you. Andr\u00e9s [indiscernible] discuss the slide. Slide 12, on the third bar. In the 8% to 10% new construction that I get and you have laid that out very well. The 5% from existing business, I wonder if Andr\u00e9s you or Tom could may be give a little more color on that. is that like just a full-year of IPL for instance, improving Brazil or what plays into the 5% over the two years? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : That is our cost savings and revenue enhancement initiative, which is well under way. We have a three year $150 million cost saving new enhancement initiatives in three chunks of 50-50 and 50. This is an annual run rate, prior to this in the previous four years we did a $200 million cost savings and revenue initiative. So we have a lot of experience at this. Perhaps Bernerd our Chief Operating Office can make a few comments on what that consist of. Bernerd Da Santos : Yes thanks Andr\u00e9s, I think we are very pleased that we are on-track with the $50 million that was what we commit for the first year in 2016 and we also have a - we thought the initiative that we have underway well tracking on into [indiscernible] and the $250 million for 2017 and 2018. And just as to reminder a those are the initiatives that we were disclosing our synergies and economics has scales that is one with the pocket that we are working in sourcing. And the service centers that we have in lower cost location and what they can [indiscernible] between the labor cost that we have and deficiencies of standardization that we have in those places and the standardization [indiscernible] improvement that we are doing in our fleet. [indiscernible] sharing or replication of the lead practice of our thermal plants. A best performance thermal plants across the rest of the fleet. So with that, we actually have identified largely he $150 million that need to be delivered and we are very confident to deliver those. Charles Fishman : Okay so lot of 5% is these cost savings, pretty well, we can count on that sound pretty - you can bank that. That\u2019s good. Okay, that was all I had. Thank you very much. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Okay. Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question and answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Ahmed Pasha for any closing remarks. Ahmed Pasha : Thank you everybody for joining us in today\u2019s call. As always the IR team will be available to answer any question you may have. Thank you and have a nice day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Also please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ahmed Pasha, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ahmed Pasha : Thanks, Nicole. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter 2016 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our Web site at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There're many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning are Andr\u00e9s Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom O'Flynn, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will now turn the call over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our third quarter 2016 financial review call. Today, I will provide an update on our year-to-date performance, key market trends and our long-term strategy in the context of those trends. Tom, will then review positive regulatory developments at DPL and Ohio, and our financial results, as well as provide color on our curtain guidance. Year-to-date we generated proportional free cash flow of $1.1 billion, representing 91% of the mid-point of our full-year guidance, and reflecting the collection of outstanding receivables in Bulgaria during the second quarter. Our year-to-date adjusted EPS was $0.64, representing 64% of our full-year guidance, consistent with expectations that we communicated to you previously. These results keep us on track to achieve our full-year guidance, which Tom will address in detail. Now turning to key market trends on slide five. At a high level, we're seeing changes in some of our markets due to the entry of natural gas and low cost renewables. However, we're generally well positioned to take advantages of these changes, because we have already begun to invest in these technologies, and because most of our largely contracted portfolio has locational and cost advantages. Accordingly, despite what we have recently seen in some markets, like Chile, we remain confident in the long-term strength of our portfolio. We see a future with the operator who has an efficient thermal and hydro fleet, and can integrate them with the new technologies will be the winner. We're also on track to meet our expectations through 2018, which are driven by our construction and cost reduction programs. Most of our construction programs are going well with the exception of Alto Maipo, which represents 15% of the total megawatts under construction. There's no question that the future growth across our markets will be heavily weighted towards less carbon intensive gas, wind, and solar generation. Accordingly, we've been taking actions in this regard for some time now. For example, as we've discussed on previous calls, we have been expanding our LNG infrastructure into Central America as shown on slide six. Our $1 billion Colon project in Panama will contribute to our growth beyond 2018 and includes a 380 megawatt combined cycle gas plant, and 180,000 cubic meter LNG regasification and storage facility. The power plant is contracted under a 10 year U.S. dollar denominated power purchase agreement. This project will diversify Panama's reliance on hydro based generation, while also meeting a growing need for natural gas across Central America. By introducing natural gas to the region, we're displacing oil fired generation in favor of a cheaper and cleaner alternative, and also serving the needs of many potential downstream customers, including commercial and industrial users and the transportation industry. On slide seven, we see another example of how we're responding to environmental concerns about coal fired generation. In Indiana, we just completed a multi-year $550 million rate based investment in environmental upgrades through our coal plants and the repowering of several units from coal to gas. We will further shift ideal fuel mix away from coal when we complete the 671 megawatt Eagle Valley CCGT in Indiana in the first-half of 2017. The combined impact of these investments will be to reduce the gigawatt hours IPL producers from coal by about 40%. Turning to slide eight, the growth in renewables, not only provides an opportunity for direct investments in wind and solar generations but creates a market for energy storage. We plan to invest in wind and solar generation in our markets with our primary focus on U.S. dollar denominated long-term contracts. In fact, since last year, we have added more than 150 megawatts of solar with long-term contracts in the U.S., about half of which is operating and the rest will come online in 2017. Regarding energy storage, we believe this technology will play a critical role in an increasingly renewables based generation mix. AES has been designing, deploying and operating battery based energy storage systems for almost a decade. Today, with our proprietary Advancion platform, is the world leader, with more than 400 megawatts in operation under construction on an advanced stage development across seven countries. In 2016, we have already closed Advancion\u2019s sales to third-parties, totaling more than $70 million in gross revenue. With our proven storage platform, unequaled experience, and global reach through AES and our sales channel partnerships, we\u2019re ideally positioned to capitalize on this rapidly growing market. Turning now to slide nine, I\u2019d like to discuss what we consider to be key underlying strength of our businesses, a highly contracted portfolio and the competitive nature of our assts, even in those markets where LNG based and renewable generation are making inroads. As you can see on this slide, as a result of our proactive contracting and portfolio rebalancing initiatives, today, about 75% of our business is U.S. dollar based. About 85% of our business is either contracted generation or regulated utilities. The average remaining life on our PPAs at our contracted businesses is seven years, and when we complete our current construction program in 2020, it will be extended to 10 years. Turning to slide 10, although that\u2019s a long average remaining contract life, there are few markets where our markets will roll-off sooner. Nonetheless, we believe that our position in those particular markets will allow us to continue to earn attractive returns after the current contracts expire. The majority of our businesses are low cost, flexible and reliable energy providers with strong locational advantages. Our knowledge of these markets and critical mass also puts us in a position to take advantage of growth opportunities, or quickly respond to changing conditions. Let me talk about a few of these markets in more detail. In the Dominican Republic, a portion of our contracts are rolling off in the next three years. However, our plans are mostly gas-fired and we offer the lowest cost source of generation in the system, which is 54% oil-based. Based on today\u2019s relative fuel prices, our variable cost is half of that of oil fired generation, which puts us in a good position to re-contract our plans on favorable terms. In 2017, we will complete the closing of the cycle at our DBP gas plant, which will add 122 megawatts without increasing our carbon footprint. In the Philippines, we operated 630 megawatt coal fired plant, and are building a 335 megawatt expansion. The existing Masinloc plant is more than 90% contracted until 2019, and we have already reached an agreement pending regulatory approval with the plant off-taker for an extension to 2022. In terms of the 335 megawatt expansion project, which will come online in 2019, we have already signed 10 to 20 year contracts covering 50% of the capacity. Our plants in the Philippines will be even more competitive once the country\u2019s gas plants, which account for 25% of the system supply, move from base load to mid merit when their current take or pay gas contracts roll-off from 2019 to 2023. In California, our Southland contracts are expiring in December of 2019 and 2020, but we have already re-contracted these facilities under a 20 year PPA that will require the repowering of its assets. With the new contract, we expect to see growth in earnings and the cash flows from this business. Now moving to Chile, on slide 11, where we are largely contracted. Although there has been a slow-down and economic growth, mainly due to the impact of the falling mineral prices on the Chilean economy, we remain optimistic about the future prospect of the country. As you may know, the recent auctions for contracts beginning in 2021 and 2022 cleared significantly below market expectations. We believe these prices reflect aggressive bidding by both new market participants and existing hydro owners. Nonetheless, we do not believe that this will have a meaningful impact on our business in Chile in the near to medium term because AES Gener is largely hedged with an average remaining PPA life of 11 years. So, our exposure for the next five years is quite limited with only 8% of our contracts rolling off in '21 and '22. Although, over the long-term, we do forecast some softening in prices, we do not believe this auction result is necessarily indicative of the long-term price load. While Chile does have excellent solar and good wind resources, some of the assumptions underlying the recent auction outcome may have been aggressive on capital cost declines, load factors, and all-in costs to support renewable assets with a 24/7 load following obligation. We see renewables, energy storage, and thermal resources as complementary in the future Chilean grid. In fact, we believe our existing portfolio will be even more important in the long-term as we see higher demand growth driven by an eventual acceleration and economic growth. Accordingly, our existing assets are well positioned to provide reliable and competitive energy to the Chilean grid. Now turning to slide 12 to our construction program, which is the most significant driver of cash flow and dividend growth in the coming years. Since our last call, we've completed construction of our 532 megawatt Cochrane power plant in Chile, which is 100% contracted for 18 years. This brings our year-to-date commission capacity to 3 gigawatts, all of which were completed on-time and on-budget. We have another 3.4 gigawatts remaining under construction where we are generally making good progress. The main exception to our strong performance on construction is Alto Maipo, a 531 megawatt one of the river hydro plant in Chile, which is by far our most complex construction project underway. Today, the overall project is about 40% completed. As we discussed on our last call, we've encountered geological issues while excavating some underground tunnels. After consultation with the contractor and independent consultant, our expectation is still for Alto Maipo to be completed in 2019, at a cost that is about 10% to 20% over the original budget. We expect the additional capital cost of roughly $200 million to $400 million will be funded by a combination of lenders and project sponsors. Discussions with lenders are underway. I'd note that notwithstanding the challenges we have encountered at Alto Maipo, we have a strong track record of completing projects on-time and on-budget. In the last five years, AES has delivered more than 5 gigawatts of projects, which were completed on-time and on-budget. Accordingly, we are confident that our construction program will continue to drive attractive growth in our free cash flow and earnings. Turning to slide 13, excluding the cost overrun at Alto Maipo, which I mentioned earlier, our 3.4 gigawatts currently under construction represent total capital expenditures of $6.4 billion. However, AES's equity commitment is limited to $1.1 billion. Of this, over $250 million has already been funded. Roughly 70% of our investments are in the Americas, mainly Chile, Panama and the U.S. Before I turn the call over to Tom, I would like to emphasize our de-risking of our Company over the last five years on slide 14. Today, we're in a strong position to execute on the strategic growth opportunities I just discussed in large part because the actions we have taken. We've exited 11 markets, including the riskiest countries in our portfolio. This week we also closed the sales of AES Sul, a utility in Brazil, which decreases our exposure to Brazilian regulatory and hydrology risk to more appropriate levels. In total, our asset sales programs through since September of 2011 has raised $4 billion in cash to the parent. We are investing our discretionary cash towards projects that are better aligned with our strategy like LNG in Central America and renewables in the US. In Panama, our hydro assets will be more valuable by 2019 when we begin the operating the Nation\u2019s first gas fired plant and LNG facility, which will cap energy prices in times of drought. These investments not only drive solid growth in cash flow and earnings but also offer our investors a more robust and optimal portfolio. Last but not least, de-leveraging has been and will continue to be an important part of the strategy. Over the past five years, we have reduced our parent debt by 28%. And based on the growth of our cash flow, we expect to achieve investment grades stats by 2020. We believe that in conjunction all of these actions will deliver attractive risk adjusted returns to our shareholders. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom. Thomas O'Flynn: Thanks Andr\u00e9s, and good morning. Today, I will review our results, including adjusted EPS proportional free cash flow and adjusted pre-tax contribution, or PTC, by Strategic Business Unit or SBU. Then I\u2019ll cover our 2016 capital allocation, as well as our guidance and expectations. Before I get started, I\u2019ll remind you of a couple of items that helped our results in the third quarter of last year, one was the restructuring of Guacolda in Chile that generated $0.06 in equity and earnings. And the other was a large receivables collection in the Dominican Republic, which led to higher than normal proportional free cash flow. Now turning to slide 16, third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.32 was $0.06 lower than 2015. This decline is in line with our expectations that we communicated in our last call. Specifically, our third quarter results reflect positive contribution from our businesses, particularly in the U.S. where we benefited from rate based growth at our utility IPL in Indiana, and improved availability at DPL in Ohio. The impact of the Guacolda restructuring in 2015 and also the $0.02 impact from the devaluation of foreign currencies as expected particularly in Andes and Europe. Now to slide 17, proportional free cash flow and adjusted PTC for the quarter. We generated $400 million of proportional free cash flow, a decrease of $221 million from last year. This reflects slightly lower margins and the impact of working capital in the MCAC SBU specifically to DR, where although collections remained strong, we have the large receivable settlement last year. We also earned $272 million in adjusted PTC during the quarter, a decrease of $43 million largely driven by the Guacolda restructuring. Next I\u2019ll cover our SBUs in more detail over the next six slides, beginning on slide 18. In the U.S., our results reflect relatively higher margins, including the benefit from the environmental upgrades on 1,700 megawatts of capacity that came online through this quarter and from this year\u2019s rate case at the IPL, as well as higher contributions in DPL, reflecting our continuing actions to improve the availability of our generation fleet. At Andes our results reflect higher margins, primarily due to lower spot fuel and energy purchases, as well as the start of commercial operations at Cochrane Unit 1 in Chile. This was partially offset by lower spot prices and generation at Chivor in Columbia, where we replenished reservoir levels after increasing production when energy prices were at record high in December of last year. Margins also reflect a 38% devaluation of the Argentine peso. Adjusted PTC decreased due to Guacolda restructuring, and proportional free cash flow also reflects the timing of lower VAT collections in Chile after Cochran came online. In Brazil, our results were largely driven by lower margins, mainly due to exploration Tiet\u00ea\u2019s PPA at the end of 2015. As part of our rolling hedging strategy that we had in place since 2014, Tiet\u00ea is about 80% hedged over the next two years. In Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, our results reflect lower margins, primarily due to lower rolling 12 month availability in Puerto Rico, which was impacted by fourth quarter outage in 2015. Adjusted PTC was further impacted by lower interest income on overdue receivables in the Dominican Republic where collections have improved. Proportional free cash flow decreased, primarily due to large settlement of receivables in the DR. In Europe, our results reflect lower margins due to the contracting capacity price reduction following the successful settlement of outstanding receivables at Maritza in Bulgaria, as well as the 36% devaluation of the Kazakhstan Tenge. Proportional free cash flow benefitted from higher collections at Maritza. It's worth mentioning that we continue to see improved collections in the roughly six months since that settlement and payments are current. Finally, in Asia, our results reflect steady margins and working capital requirements year-over-year. Now to slide 24, I'll provide an update on our filing at DP&L in Ohio where we've seen some positive momentum on the regulatory front. We remain in active discussions with the commission staff and interveners. As you may know, last month we amended our ESP filing to propose a distribution modernization rider of $145 million per year over seven years with the aim of achieving and maintaining investment grade rating at DP&L. Hearings are now set for early December, and we expect the ruling to be effective beginning in the first quarter of 2017 that'll support the financial viability and credit profile of the business. Now to slide 25 and the progress we're making to improve our credit profile. In the third quarter, we prepaid $180 million of parent debt, bringing our total debt pay-down year-to-date to $300 million. Since 2011, we\u2019ve reduced parent debt by $1.8 billion or 28% and reduced interest by 125 basis-points, resulting in an annualized interest savings of $180 million. As you'll see on the top of the side, we have no debt maturing at the parent until 2019, and only $240 million is due. Turning to bottom of the slide, these proactive steps have helped us reduce our parent leverage ratio from almost 6.5 times to slightly over 5 times debt to parent free cash flow plus interest. These actions reflect our strategy to de-risk our portfolio and improve our credit metrics. We expect our credits to continue to improve, largely driven by a strong growth in parent free cash flow, as well as the modest amount annual debt reduction. As a result, we expect to attain investment grade credit metrics by 2020. We believe this will help us reduce our cost to debt, improve financial flexibility, and also, importantly, enhance our equity valuation. Turning now to our 2016 parent capital allocation on slide 26, which is materially in line with our prior discussions. Charts on the left hand side reflect $1.5 billion of total available discretionary cash, which includes $575 million in parent free cash flow. We remain confident in our 2016 parent free cash flow range of $525 million to $625 million, which is a foundation for our discretionary cash available for dividend growth and value creation. Sources also include proceeds from assets sales, primarily for AES Sul, where we\u2019re estimating net proceeds of $440 million, including a sub-dividend at around $25 million, after accounting for working capital adjustments and transaction costs. Although, we\u2019ve successfully closed the sale in October, we anticipate receiving the majority of the proceeds at the parent in the first quarter of 2017 after meeting the required notice period for distributions. Now the uses on the right hand side of the slide, consistent with our capital allocation plan with 10% growth in our dividend and completed share repurchases, we are returning about a third of our allocated cash to our shareholders this year. Going forward, we continue to see our dividend as the primary means to distribute cash to shareholders. As I just mentioned, we have already prepaid $300 million of our near-term maturities. We\u2019ve also allocated $360 million for investments in our subsidiaries, the majority of which is from new projects driving our growth through 2018 and beyond. After considering these investments in our subsidiaries, debt repayment and our current dividend we\u2019re left with roughly $400 million of discretionary cash. This, together with our 2017 free cash flow, will provide a strong foundation to grow our dividend, continue to de-lever and earn attractive risk adjusted returns by investing in our development pipeline focused on gas and low cost renewables. Now turning to slide 27. As reflected in our third quarter and year-to-date, we continue to generate strong proportional free cash flow. And our third quarter adjusted EPS was also in line with our expectations. Accordingly, we are reaffirming our 2016 guidance for all metrics. Since earlier this year, we\u2019ve also experienced some headwinds, including outages at two of our businesses in MCAC, as well as a slightly negative impact from reverting back to ESP-1 rates and also some dark spread compression at DPL in Ohio. However, we\u2019re expecting to offset these impacts with a couple of items, one of which would lead to a lower full year effective tax rate. Finally, before I hand it back to Andr\u00e9s, I want to briefly discuss our expectations beyond 2016. On our fourth quarter call in February, we plan to provide guidance for 2017, as well as longer term expectations through at least 2019. At that point, we will have completed our annual budget process, and we\u2019ll be in a better position to provide more detailed guidance. Based on our preliminary view, we expect to be within the previously disclosed ranges for average annual growth through 2018. As Andr\u00e9s discussed, the majority of our new projects are coming online in 2018, so we expect growth to be stronger in 2018 and 2017. Accordingly, we are reaffirming our previously disclosed ranges for expected growth in 2017-18 for both proportional free cash flow and adjusted EPS. With that, I\u2019ll now turn it back to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thanks, Tom. To summarize today\u2019s call, we have a portfolio of asset that is generating strong cash flow, and a construction and development pipeline that is driving growth in cash flow and earnings. We are well position to maximize shareholder value through the following. First, we are rebalancing our business mix by exiting certain businesses to reduce risk and redeploying our excess cash in growth projects with long-term U.S. dollar denominated contracts, and focusing on less carbon intensive sources of generation. Second we remain committed to continuing to strengthen our credit, which is largely driven by the successful completion of our construction program, cost reductions and de-levering. Accordingly, we remain confident that we can achieve investment grade stats by 2020. Third, we're capitalizing on our advantageous positive in key high growth markets, and we continue to expect double-digit growth in all key metrics through 2018. Furthermore, we believe that we are well placed to deliver attractive growth in cash flow and earnings beyond 2018. With that, I would like to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Greg Gordon : So, on slide -- couple of things, slide 26, is that compared to the second quarter, so the comparable slide. I see that the only adjustment is that you're assuming that you articulated this in your script. I just wanted to be clear that some of the sales proceeds are slipping into 2017 from '16 otherwise, this slide is demonstrably unchanged? Thomas O'Flynn: That's right Greg. Greg Gordon : So, on the unallocated discretionary cash, you talked about one of the things you didn't talk about was significant further share repurchases, that was notably absent from the script. Is there -- was that on purpose? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Well, as Tom said, we see dividend as our primary way of getting cash back to our shareholders. On the other hand, we do have an approval. And we have shown in the past that if we think that's the best use of our cash, we will go ahead and buyback our shares. So, we're not taking it off the table, but we're saying our primary focus will be on paying and increasing, and growing dividend. Greg Gordon : It's just, it's a very luxurious position you're in, and you don't have any maturities for a few years. And you're already growing the dividend at a pretty high articulated rate, and yet you still have all this unallocated cash. So, if I just, capital allocation is going to be top of mind when we quiz you at EI? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : They\u2019ll be good and it's great to be in a luxurious position. What I'm very glad is that, yes, we've been working on this for a long time because in terms of getting our debt in better shape. And we are in very good shape. And not only that, in terms of terms, length of the debt in terms of -- the majority of the debt is fixed and also it's in the currency of the operating business. So yes we will be talking about that, but that does give us options. Greg Gordon : Two more quick questions, one I think you -- in reiterating your guidance, you've indicated that you're using curves for commodities and currencies from the middle of the year. If I add up all those, and how much they change over the course of since the middle of the year, I think the dollars moved in your favor, but commodities have moved against you. Net-net, it doesn't look like a big negative if anything, it might be a push. Can you comment on how those changes, how those curves have changed since June 30th? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Greg, you're basically right. They're basically flat. I don't know if Tom, you want to add something to that, but the net is flat. Thomas O'Flynn: Yes, that\u2019s fair. Greg Gordon : And then in terms of the earnings drag associated with the Chile construction project, should we think about the earnings impact, as you\u2019re seeing the incremental cost of the debt on the cost overrun? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : This project will be coming-in in 2019, so it currently has no impact prior to that. We have to see again where we\u2019re negotiating now with lenders, how much is from the sponsors, how much is from the lenders and what are the conditions. So it really doesn\u2019t have any impacts through the 2018 window. And I would add to that Hahn Air has its earnings call later today, I think at 11 O\u2019clock, but they come out with their press release. And they had, I think, the best quarter in the last five years. So, Hahn Air is in strong position. But we have to address the issue at Alto Maipo. And as I said, we\u2019re working very constructively with our lenders and also with the construction company. Operator : Our next question comes from Ali Agha of SunTrust. Please go ahead. Ali Agha : First question I just wanted to clarify this comments you have made. When we look at the next couple of years, you have put out you said you reiterated the growth numbers well over 16% EPS growth, but this point about this being greater in \u201918 versus \u201817. Just wanted to understand that a little bit better, is the implication that \u201917 perhaps is lower than the 12% to 16%, but then you catch-up in \u201918 or that \u201917 is 12%, but \u201918 is 16%. I just wanted to understand what you were saying on that \u201917 versus \u201918 growth number? Thomas O'Flynn: Ali, that\u2019s maybe little more fine tuning than we want to get to. At this point, we\u2019re clearly comfortable with the 12% to 16%. We think that \u201918 will be stronger than \u201917 we still think that \u201916 to \u201917 growth rate is going to be stronger and attractive. But I don\u2019t want to get into too much fine-tuning we\u2019ll certainly do that in Feb when we give formal guidance. Ali Agha : But Tom, just to be clear, we should not assume that each year is 12% to 16%, we should assume that that\u2019s a cumulative \u201916 to \u201918 number? Thomas O'Flynn: Yes, cumulative or average, however you want to the math, yes. Ali Agha : Okay. Thomas O'Flynn: But there was growth just between \u201916 and \u201917 we\u2019ll put a fine point on growth each year in Feb. Ali Agha : And then on Ohio, how concerned are you that there will be an evitable legal challenges to any approval you get, even for this distribution rider. What\u2019s kind of the basis on which you guys are confident that this thing will be sustained? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Ali, you always have a process and you have interveners. Having said that, we have the case of FirstEnergy, we just moved forward, we think our case is even more robust. So, we have a high degree of confidence of this moving forward. Thomas O'Flynn: I\u2019d just say as it\u2019s a distribution monetization rider, we\u2019re very focused on doing it for the health of DP&L and for the T&E business. We think having a strong credit profile there is important and this will give us a trajectory to do that. And also, we do think that there is investment in the DP&L T&E business that would be good for customers and would also require capital. And that\u2019s one of the major components of and frankly uses of cash as we talk with the commission. Ali Agha : And just to clarify the timing, you alluded to December 5th, the hearings, but you also have discussions. So is this something that potentially we could hear about a settlement before year-end, or should we expect Q1 when decisions and settlements and those kinds of things happen? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Ali, I think it's most likely Q1. Ali Agha : Last question, Andr\u00e9s. You talked about contracts that are rolling off post '18. You've got stuff that's coming on at that time, as well. I know you'll provide more granularity in February, but just at a high level, when you look at your business over the next, call it four-five years, or 2021. You don't have much visibility and confidence in terms of -- can you sustain the growth rate that you've promised us through '18, or just high level? Or are you seeing more headwinds to slow things down? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Ali, we'll provide more color when we have our fourth quarter call in terms of expanding. But we feel confident of the growth rates that we have given, and we see continued growth rate pass that. We will get more specific into the future. But if you look at our construction programs, you have a lot of things coming online in '19 and '20. And also more discreet items like some of the renewables, such as solar, which we\u2019ll be growing and are quite frankly fully incorporated in some of the construction numbers we give, because they're much shorter periods between development and construction. Ali Agha : Okay, thank you. Thomas O'Flynn: Just to clarify one thing I'd said on DP&L, it's a distribution modernization rider. I think I said something other than monetization. It's a big word for me. Operator : Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So, can I just, maybe starting in on Ohio, following from the last question. Can you elaborate a little bit, is the structure analogous to what FirstEnergy recently approved? And then separately you talked about maintaining investment quality. What metrics that you saw going forward with the DMR and ultimately to get to those IG metrics? Thomas O'Flynn: Just on DP&L, yes, it's similar. FE had some FFO ratios I think it was in 14.5%, it's similar to what we're using, so that's what gets us the $145 million of revenue requirements, or DMR I'll call it that we've requested. We are focused on seven years. They were shorter with an ability to extend, but we do think it's helpful to have a defined longer period, but that's certainly a matter of our discussions right now. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Turning to your longer term guidance, you talked about '18 being still intact. Can you reiterate your confidence in OPG C2, and maybe a just big uptime, as well as also just curious, Alto Maipo. I suppose it indicates back-half of '18. Is that a material contribution to '18 in terms of your confidence to hit that number? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Taking the first one, in terms of Alto Maipo, as I said, it has really no impact on 2018. So, I think the key thing is reaching an agreement with lenders and completing the project. Regarding OPG C2, we will give more information into the future. I think if we look at it as a project in India, that\u2019s overall going quite well. It's a complex project, it does have a rail tracks and coal mine. We\u2019ve got all the coal permits. We\u2019ve got most of the land permits. So in general it\u2019s proceeding well for project in India. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So, you\u2019re confident in first half of \u201818? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : We will update that and OPG C2. We\u2019re making overall good progress. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And then coming back to Chile and just real quickly. Can you comment a little bit more about what you think -- I think your term was an appropriate level for new entry, and how you think that evolves here overtime. Obviously, the use of blocks rather than conventional PPAs really shifts the market dynamic there. Can you comment? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Well, I think what happened in Chile, it's two things. First, you have to realize that there were about $50 billion in mining projects in Chile. I\u2019d say we were looking back three-four years ago. And of those I think probably about $40 billion have been suspended. So, the growth and demand from the mining sector did not materialize, and those projects are on hold. So that really change the dynamics to give you a much higher reserve ratio in Chile than certainly any of the projections had been. So that\u2019s I think the most important thing to understand. So, when there was this auction came in and there have been some changes to the auction process. What we saw was it was below, certainly, I think, consensus estimates. And basically came in on two sides. One was a new entrance on the renewable side. And also we believe on the hydro side, people bid lower than expected. I would say of the thermal bids, we were probably, we believe, the lowest. So we had I think a better view of that. What do we think is a sustainable level? Well, if you go to the market research in Chile today, so the sustainable level is north of $60, $60 a megawatt hour. If you look at where this auction cleared, it's more or like $47. There\u2019re issues here because you have to follow the load with intermittent renewables, and you have to put packages together. So, we think that some of these assumptions, obviously, people are bidding for future prices of the capital investment future prices for other things. And there is a lot of assumptions here. So, we think that more in line with the consensus view overall. And one thing I would say is if these mining projects get reactivated, maybe even a third of them then the situation in Chile will change. Because you also should remember that the very high reserve margin that market had a lot of that is very old, is very old coal plant than other ones that are not efficient. So, we think that that\u2019s reasonable. And that anyway the market moves though, I think that we are in a very good position having that existing thermal and hydro base to combine it with renewables, to be able to offer more secure load following supply. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And then can you comment briefly on the Philippines and after market and this decision to pursue the expansion given, call it, broader pricing pressures that we\u2019ve seen in Chile, et cetera? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Well, different market. In the case of the Philippines, we saw that there was demand for our plant Masinloc and that we could add basically another unit to Masinloc and 325 megawatt is going to be super critical. And we could contract that at attractive prices. So, we started this. It's under-construction today. And Philippine market will change. What you have today is basically a lot of gas plants that are using domestic gas, which are basically first to be dispatched. So, there're base load. When these contracts burn-off in the next couple of years, they go to mid merit. And quite frankly they may have to search for new sources of gas. So, given that this plant will be very well positioned. And basically I think that perhaps where you're going is that the new contracts we're signing for 10 and 20 years PPAs are at the same similar prices. And we basically have an extension on existing Masinloc at the same price with the off-taker. And it is pending regulatory approval, but we expect that to get approved. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Well, how contracted in the second year that you're building? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : The second year to-date is about 50%. But we expect to have it much more contracted by the time it's completed because it's not going to just one big distribution company, it's going to multiple. Operator : Our next question comes from Lasan Johong of Auvila Research. Please go ahead. Lasan Johong : Right now if you look at the valuation on AES, even if you ignored all the utilities, generation is trading at a $1,000 of KW, or that's what the market is telling us. Andr\u00e9s would you say this is enough, I'm going private, I'm going to take out AES and turn it into private company? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Well, I think that if you look at AES today, it's certainly been significantly de-risked, and certainly, I think, has a very attractive future growth profile. And I think that we're very well positioned. I think in terms of our valuation, I mean, we've had, quite frankly, a lot of headwinds over the last five years. Some external, whether it was droughts or commodity prices or FX. Now what we've done is take-out I think a lot of that risk as we go forward. So I think as we deliver on the growth prospects, and deliver on our construction program and certainly deliver on our cost cuts. Because, one of the things, we're today at a run-rate of $250 million less of overhead and general expenses that we were five years ago. So, I think all the trends are right. I certainly think that it's an issue of delivering on it and we should see valuations, which are more in line with our peers. Lasan Johong : Tom, you mentioned that by 2020 AES should be in the investment grade metric area. Is the ambition for AES to try become an investment grade company? And if so, does that change the way AES looks at financing its business? Thomas O'Flynn: I think we'll have a better idea of what the metrics will translate to from the agencies. We want to be careful. I don't want to be presume what their judgment would be, that's why we're trying to control, we can control. It's basically move our -- our ratios have gone from 6.5% to about 5%, and we to go to 4% or low 4s depending upon our business mix, the stability of the business. I don't think it'll materially change our business or financing strategy. I will say that we've done a lot, continue to do a lot to look ahead and refinance, take advantage of market windows, be at the parent, or really all throughout our subs. The project finances or subsidiary finances that would be bundles. But one thing I\u2019d say is that we probably look to do bundles more than one-off deals where we can, and it still fits with the strategy. So, we\u2019re doing that in some places we\u2019ve got expansion right now in the Dominican Republic. But $250 million to close this cycle make a project thermal efficient on its gas usage. And that\u2019s being done. It's basically being bundled with our Andres plant. It\u2019s a very efficient plant. So, we\u2019re bundling those two together. So it means we don\u2019t put in equity, we basically use the equity value of the Andr\u00e9s to bundle that and alleviate equity requirements, and I\u2019ll suggest upgrade the credit packages. We\u2019re doing the same thing in the Philippines where new Masinloc is part of the credit package of the Philippines. So, we\u2019ll look to do more of that. And I think especially as we go and look at some smaller renewables, we\u2019re doing some smaller renewables in the U.S. This year we\u2019ll do about almost 100. And those are the things that you really do bundled financing as opposed to project-by-project. Lasan Johong : Last question, Andr\u00e9s. AES is going very deep and long into battery storage power. I\u2019m just wondering, because I\u2019m assuming battery power could be useful backup to renewables mostly, and to make sure good stability remains in place. But my understanding is that backup power is typically required for six to eight hour periods, and batteries generally don\u2019t give out too much more output than two to four hours. Is there a disconnect between what the objective of the battery is trying to do, and what actual reality is? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : What we\u2019re seeing, first, is this market is growing very quickly. So, we believe I think its next year we\u2019ll have about installations around the world around 1 gigawatt, and we\u2019re starting maybe two years ago at 200. So first it's growing very rapidly. And it\u2019s a technology that has many applications. I mean it has applications for capacity release. Those were some of our first project ancillary services. And you\u2019re right so the substituting taking plants where you have a lot of renewables. That\u2019s our big project in California. But it also has applications to the T&E business in terms of alleviating transmission constraint. Now, part of the lithium-ion battery energy storage solutions, batteries are one component. So, we\u2019ve seen, over the last five years, battery prices were up by 65%. There is no technical reason you couldn\u2019t make it an eight hour if you wanted to. It\u2019s just a question that you have to put on more batteries and it becomes more expensive. So, we expect battery prices to continue to drop because these are the same batteries you use in electric vehicles. So, as that becomes massive fight, it should drop continually. So, we\u2019re projecting a continued drop in those prices. So, the duration is really a function of your battery price. So, we are seeing that it\u2019s a many places the applications are more in the two to four hour today at today\u2019s battery prices, but you could extend those for a longer. And I think that, again, we\u2019re seeing a very rapid growth of demand. And again this year alone, we\u2019ve already closed $70 million in growth revenues from sales to third-parties that is sales to other people to play it on our grade. So, I\u2019m certain that this will continue to grow very quickly. I\u2019m also certain that price will drop. And what we\u2019re really trying to see is our two pronged approach where we put our Advancion product on our own platforms and use them to enhance our renewables or even enhance our thermal plant, and selling it to third-parties. Now that third-party sales we're using channel partners who have sales forces. And finally I would say that the combination of the two, whether we're driving it, we want to be the low cost provider and also quite frankly the best provider of this service. So, third party sales are helpful over the cost to us. Operator : Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie. Please go ahead. Angie Storozynski : So, first going back to the Alto Maipo project. Could you tell us how much of the capacity is going to be contracted? And if there's been any impact on your ability to contract the remainder of the project given the outcome of this August solar power auction? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes, Angie. I think about 40% of the project is contracted today in long-term contract. And in terms of our ability to re-contract, I would say that obviously it will affect the price of any future contracts. When it was being built, the forecast for Chile quite frankly we\u2019re like a $100 a megawatt hour. And what we're seeing is more likely somewhere in the mid-60s, we think is probably a long-term price. So, you're right, the auction, but I think more than the auction, quite frankly, the dynamics in the market. Because, quite frankly, if you did have a rapid pick-up in the mining sector, I think that the prices would reverse. Angie Storozynski : And now, you're assuming that the lenders basically cover the cost overruns. I mean, I am concerned here because it seems like you have fully committed your equity stake here. You've an increase in the cost of construction, and a reduction in revenues, because of the drop in power prices. So is there a scenario where you would actually consider walking away from this project? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : You're right. Certainly, the project looks less attractive today with the cost of overruns and the lower prices that it had initially. It was a very robust project to begin with. And in terms of our commitment to the project, we will look at this as in terms of what we think is the best decision for AES Gener. And obviously we have to reach the right agreement with the lenders to make this project better than not proceeding with the project. So that always remains an option and we're looking into that. But I think that mostly likely outcome is that we do complete the project. Angie Storozynski : And then my second question is on capital allocation. So you aim at investment grade FFO to debt by 2020. So why not use the spare cash that you have, or the capital that is unallocated to actually reduce that debt in order to get to those investment grade metrics earlier? I mean, this is always an issue with the strength of your dividends that is somewhat undermined by this below investment grade rating. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : I think that's a great comment, Angie, something we discussed. We've been paying down the debt consistently try to take advantages of windows in the market. We also have the options of transforming our portfolio for the future, and so taking advantage of the platform. So, we have to balance those two. So obviously that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve looked at, what is the speed of the debt pay-downs that we should do. And what we think is important is to have a very clear north where we\u2019re going and to deliver on that. And as we do asset sales and as we see opportunities to add to our platform, we\u2019ll take that into consideration. But again, I think, we have a good track record in terms of consistently improving our credit profile, de-risking and cutting our cost. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Russo of Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead. Brian Russo : And so 25 you guys outline the debt parent free cash flow plus interest ratios, I\u2019m just curious what kind of your 2020 target and to get to an investment grade like ratings? And are there other ratios that we should be tracking? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : This is the primary one. The target would be around 4%, but it's depending upon, obviously, business mix and those kind of things. But generally it's around 4%, it should be a combination of parent free cash flow growth, which will be the strongest contributor, as well as some continued debt pay-down. Brian Russo : And I think you mentioned earlier to offset some of the first-half \u201916 headwinds, your effective tax rate is a little bit lower. Is that accurate, and then what\u2019s driving that? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yeah, that\u2019s what we\u2019re -- there were two things I mentioned that would be offsets. One is a specific tax matter that would cause our tax rate to be lower. I think we had a range of 29 to 32, and the tax would be at the lower end of the range. And then the other would be specific settlement of a commercial issue. Brian Russo : And then with your portfolio management initiatives, what regions should we consider non-core or some countries or assets that you\u2019re currently evaluating? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Brian, that\u2019s always a very delicate question for us, because we\u2019re operating in these markets. I think in the case of Brazil, when we I think foreshadowed that we had a lot of hydrology risk in Brazil. So, with the sale of AES Sul, we think it\u2019s better balances our portfolio. You may ask, why the hydrology risk, or regulatory risk at AES Sul, quite frankly, when you have droughts and you have an increase in energy prices, because they\u2019re running more thermal, there isn\u2019t an immediate pass-through to the distribution company. So quite frankly that puts pressure on our distribution companies in terms of cash. So, we think there\u2019re main drivers of our value creations as strong cash flow, having less assets in distribution in Brazil, would make our cash flow more stable as we redeploy that cash. So, I\u2019d say it\u2019s clear with our core markets, which we\u2019re going after, I mean, the markets we\u2019re most interested in. And again, those markets where we can get long-term U.S. dollar denominated contracts will have preference. I mean, we can\u2019t get it everywhere. But we want to shift the portfolio again more contracted and with a lower carbon footprint. And that\u2019s what you can see going forward. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Andr\u00e9s Gluski for any closing remarks. Ahmed Pasha : Thanks. This is Ahmed. We thank everybody for joining us on today\u2019s call. We look forward to seeing many of you next week at the EEI Conference. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any questions you may have. Thank you, and have a nice day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode [Operator Instructions]. After today\u2019s presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ahmed Pasha, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ahmed Pasha : Thank you, Daniel. Good morning and welcome to AES\u2019s fourth quarter and full-year 2016 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning are Andr\u00e9s Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom O\u2019Flynn, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will now turn the call over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full-year 2016 financial review call. This morning we will discuss our results and our financial outlook. We will update you on key trends we\u2019re seeing across our markets and the progress we\u2019re making on our construction program and long-term strategy, including our recent announcement that we have agreed to acquire sPower, the largest independent solar developer in the United States. The key takeaway for today\u2019s call include, we delivered on our 2016 financial guidance; we\u2019re seeing positive developments across our businesses in markets; we are on track to achieve our run rate of $350 million in cost savings and revenue enhancements through 2018; notably, we\u2019re expanding this program by targeting an additional $25 million of annual savings in 2019 ramping up to a $50 million incremental run rate in 2020. Despite some challenges we are facing on a 3.4 gigawatt construction program, we expect to complete these projects through 2019. We exited non-core assets to bring $500 million in proceeds to AES that we will reinvest to continue to deliver sustainable long-term growth to our shareholders. We signed an agreement to acquire Spower\u2019s renewable portfolio and growth platform. Spower has an exceptional development team and pipeline, which will contribute high-quality, long-term, and growing U.S. dollar-denominated cash flows. We\u2019re initiating 2017 guidance for adjusted EPS of $1 to $1.10. Finally, we\u2019re introducing our expectation of delivering 8% to 10% average annual growth in free cash flow, adjusted EPS and our dividend through 2020. I will now discuss some of these themes in more detail. Starting with key trends and developments we are seeing across our markets on Slide 4. In general, we are expecting stronger growth in GDP and electricity demand in most of our markets. In Brazil, demand is expected to grow 1% in 2017 versus a decline of 3% in 2016. In Chile, demand is expected to grow 2% to 3% versus 1% in 2016. Turning to Chile, where the regulator recently introduced new rules for long-term capacity auction. Under these new rules, winning bidders who do not develop the projects they bid will face significant penalties. We\u2019re encouraged by this development as the penalty should minimize speculative bidding and force market participants to bid with prices that include a fair return on capital. Moving on to Argentina, where we own and operate 3.5 gigawatts. We are encouraged by positive steps being taken by the new government. This month, the government has raised electricity tariffs and linked generation tariffs to the U.S. dollar. This effectively eliminates our exposure to the Argentine peso. And the result of improved confidence in Argentina, we recently placed a $300 million seven-year bond at 7.75 utilizing a portion of the debt capacity we have in our Argentine businesses. In 2017, we\u2019ve already received $57 million in dividends from Argentina through February following $20 million in 2016. Now, turning to our construction program beginning on Slide 5. As you know, our construction program is the most significant driver of our cash flow and dividend growth in coming years. In 2016, we commissioned capacity of 3 gigawatts, all of which were completed on time and on budget. We have another 3.4 gigawatts currently under construction, where we\u2019re generally making good progress, although, we are experiencing delays at some of our projects. Our projects under construction represent total capital expenditures of $6.4 billion. However, AES\u2019s equity commitment is limited to $1.1 billion, of this all, but $250 million has already been funded. Roughly 70% of our investments are in the Americans, mainly in the U.S., Chile, and Panama. Turning to Slide 6. As you may recall from prior calls, Alto Maipo, an expansion of our existing [indiscernible] power plant in Chile is by far our most complex construction project underway. Since our last call, we have made significant progress on a number of fronts. Specifically, the project is about 49% complete versus 40% at the time of our November call. This progress is in line with our expectations and we remain on track to complete construction in 2019. Based on further validation over the last three months by independent engineers and our discussion with EPC contractors, we continue to expect cost overruns to be in the 10% to 20% range we discussed on our last call. To fund these overruns and any additional future needs, we have signed the term sheet for additional financing commitments for up to 22% of the project cost. We also brought in EPC contractor as a minority partner. These overruns would be funded by a combination of project lenders, AES Gener, Minera los Pelambres and EPC Contractor. Although any cost overruns are disappointing these are within the range we discussed on our last call. We continue to see long-term value in the project, as expansion will further diversify AES Gener\u2019s generation mix and offers locational advantages and a long expected life. Turning to our other projects under construction on Slide 7. As you may remember, we expected three large projects to come on line in 2017. Two of the projects are the closing of the cycle at DPP in the Dominican Republic and the IPL wastewater upgrades with a combined total project cost of $500 million. Both projects are expected to be completed on time and on budget. The third project, the 671 megawatt Eagle Valley CCGT and IPL is behind schedule. Due to productivity issues on the part of our contractor. We now expect the project to come online in early 2018 versus our original expectation for the first-half of 2017. This delay is obviously disappointing, but manageable, since we do not expect a material impact on our forecasts. Having said that, our EPC contractor is taking tangible steps to mitigate this delay and finish the project late this year. We have another three projects totaling two gigawatts that are expected to come online in 2018 and 2019. In summary, we remain confident that our 3.4 gigawatts of projects under construction will come online consistent with our revised expectations and continue to be the key driver of our growth through 2020, which Tom will discuss shortly. Now, turning to our progress on our long-term strategy to deliver attractive free cash flow growth, while at the same time strengthening our credit beginning on Slide 8. As we\u2019ve discussed previously, we are primarily focusing our growth investments on natural gas and renewable projects with long-term U.S. dollar-denominated contracts. We intend to reduce the carbon intensity of our portfolio while ensuring solid growth in cash flow and earnings. These types of projects will improve the quality of our cash flow and help us achieve our credit objectives. Renewables represent an attractive business opportunity in light of several trends such as the dramatic drop in the cost of renewables that have made their energy production competitive. Today, renewables are the dominant type of new generation build across almost all of our markets. And long-term PPAs are available for renewables, providing predictable stable cash flows. The intermittent nature of renewables does pose challenges for the grid. We believe AES\u2019s ability to leverage renewables by integrating them with conventional energy and energy storage can meet these challenges and give us a strong competitive advantage. Turning to Slide 9, to that end, late last week we announced that we have agreed to acquire sPower, the largest independent solar developer in the United States. sPower brings 1.3 gigawatts of installed capacity with an average remaining contract life of more than 20 years with very creditworthy off-takers and a first-class management and development team with a pipeline of more than 10 gigawatts. This acquisition is consistent with our strategy of [indiscernible] our portfolio and increasing the mix of our revenues towards long-term contracted U.S. denominated businesses. This acquisition will provide AES with the scale to secure the best prices when purchasing photovoltaic panels and inverters for our other solar projects around the world. It will also provide us with a proven very successful and disciplined development process that can be used on our renewable projects everywhere. Our partner on this acquisition is AIMCo, a $95 billion Canadian pension fund with experience in making direct investments in global infrastructure. This strategic partnership will help fund sPower\u2019s attractive growth platform going forward. We intend to fund our $382 million share of the investment largely from excess discretionary cash that we received from the sale of AES Sul in late 2016. We expect high single-digit IRRs from the existing assets, while the development pipeline has the opportunity to earn low double-digit returns that will help drive future growth in cash flow. The sPower transaction, which is likely to close by the third quarter of 2017, is expected to be accretive to earnings. Although the EPS contribution may be lumpy from year-to-year due to the nature of the tax equity financing that sPower has utilized, we expect on average a high single-digit ROE, which is better than what we could earn if we use the cash to repurchase a mix of debt and equity. The stable cash contributions from this business and its long-term contract model also help make this a credit enhancing transaction. Now turning to Slide 10, in January Tiet\u00ea in Brazil agreed to acquire 386 megawatts of wind from Renova, which has an average remaining contract life of 18 years. This acquisition is an important strategic milestone for Tiet\u00ea, as this business will not only diversify its generation mix from 100% hydro, but also contribute stable long-term cash flows. Furthermore, this acquisition which is a 100% levered using Tiet\u00ea\u2019s existing R$1.5 billion debt capacity. This acquisition once again demonstrates our ability to utilize local debt capacity in order to grow our business and improve returns. Moving onto the Dominican Republic on Slide 11, leveraging our success with ENGIE in Panama, our LNG supplier for our Col\u00f3n project, in December we signed a partnership agreement with ENGIE to market our excess LNG storage and regasification capacity at our Andres terminal in the Dominican Republic. ENGIE will be able to offer competitive and flexible natural gas products, tailored to meet the needs of downstream customers and dual fuel oil fired generators in the Caribbean. As excess LNG capacity at our terminal gets utilized to meet the needs of these new customers, we will receive enhanced revenue. We see significant potential for this partnership with ENGIE to maximize the value of our existing LNG infrastructure. Now turning to Slide 12 and our progress on our cost savings and revenue enhancement initiative, in 2016 we achieved our incremental $50 million reduction target. We\u2019re on track to reach $350 million in annual savings by 2018. We are now announcing that we\u2019re targeting an additional $25 billion in annual savings in 2019, stepping up to an additional $50 million in 2020 for a total annual run rate of $400 million from our base year of 2011. Turning to Slide 13. Our asset sales sales program has raised $4 billion in cash to the parent since September 2011. We have exited 11 markets, including the riskiest countries in our portfolio. We will continue to recycle capital and we expect to raise more than $500 million in additional equity proceeds this year. Although we can\u2019t be specific on the businesses that we are targeting for sale, our goal is to continue to optimize our portfolio and improve our risk adjusted return. Last but not least turning to Slide 14, delevering has been and will continue to be an important part of our strategy. Since 2011, we have reduced our Parent debt by 28% and we expect to achieve investment price statistics by 2020. This will be largely driven by robust growth in our free cash flow and modest debt prepayments. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom. Thomas O\u2019Flynn: Thanks, Andr\u00e9s, and good morning. Today, I\u2019ll review our 2016 results and capital allocation. I\u2019ll also provide an update on some key business developments and conclude by addressing our guidance for 2017 and expectations through 2020. Overall, as Andr\u00e9s mentioned, we finished 2016 at a strong note, meaning, guidance for all metrics and setting a solid foundation for our growth to 2020. Turning to adjusted EPS on Slide 16, full-year results were $0.98, just below the midpoint of our guidance range. Most of the $0.27 decline from 2015 was anticipated, including the impact of foreign currency devaluation, the expiration of Tiet\u00ea\u2019s PPA, and the absence of some gains that have benefited prior year\u2019s results. Additionally, our tax rate was lower than normal in part due to restructuring completed in the fourth quarter as expected as well as some other tax items that were not anticipated that went in our favor. This was largely offset by an unanticipated $0.06 one-time reserve taken against certain reimbursements in MCAC in connection with a legal matter. Now to Slide 17 in our proportional free cash flow and adjusted PTC for the year. We generated $1.4 billion of proportional free cash flow, which was above the top end of our guidance range and represents an increase of $176 million from 2015. Now results reflect a receipt of overdue receivables at Maritza in Bulgaria, as well as higher collections at our distribution businesses in Brazil. This offset lower margins and a large receipt of overdue receivables in DR in 2015. We also earned $842 million in adjusted PTC during the year, a decrease of $335 million, largely driven by lower margins. Now, I will cover our SBUs in more detail over the next six slides beginning on 18. In the U.S., our results reflect lower margins, including the impact of lower wholesale prices and lower contributions from regulated customers at DPL, which were partially offset by higher contributions at IPL, including the benefits from 2016 rate case and environmental upgrades that came online for year-end. Higher proportional free cash flow also reflects lower working capital requirements, including lower fuel costs associated with the conversion from coal to gas generation at IPL. At Andes, our results reflect lower margins primarily due to lower spot energy price in Colombia and the devaluation of the Argentine and Colombian pesos. Adjusted PTC also decreased due to the restructuring of Guacolda in Chile that generated additional equity and earnings in 2015. Proportional free cash flow also reflects higher collections in Argentina and Colombia. I\u2019d also like to note, as Andr\u00e9s mentioned, the new tariff in Argentina is linked prices to the U.S. dollar, effectively eliminating our exposure to the Argentine peso. Our earnings in U.S. dollar equivalent has now increased to 80%, up from 74% since our last call. As you can see on appendix Slide 56, in Brazil, our results reflect lower margins, namely due to the expiration of Tiet\u00ea\u2019s above market PPA at the end of 2015. As part of our rolling hedging strategy we\u2019ve had in place since 2014, Tiet\u00ea is about 80% hedged for the next two years. Proportional free cash flow increased primarily due to the recovery of high purchase power cost from prior droughts at our distribution businesses, Eletropaulo and Sul. Last year we discussed a strategic shift away from the distribution businesses in Brazil, as evidenced by the sale of Sul. As part of this shift we\u2019re applying to list on the Novo Mercado where only common shares trade. Upon listing, our voting rights, currently above 50%, will become equal to our economic interest of 17% and we would de-consolidate upon losing this controlling interest. For guidance purposes, we\u2019ve assumed de-consolidation for the full year 2007. In Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, our results reflect lower margins primarily due to lower rolling 12 month availability in Mexico and Puerto Rico which was impacted by a fourth quarter outage in 2015. Adjusted PTC also reflects the reserve I mentioned earlier. Proportional free cash flow decreased primarily due to the large settlement of receivables in 2015 in the DR. In Europe our results reflect lower margins due to the contracted capacity price reduction following the collection of outstanding receivables at Maritza in Bulgaria, as well as a 35% devaluation at the Kazakhstan Tenge. Proportional free cash flow benefitted primarily from the collection at Maritza. In the roughly nine months since that settlement payments have been current. Finally in Asia, our results reflect steady margins and lower working capital requirements following commencement of operations at Mong Duong in Vietnam in 2015. Before turning to capital allocation, I want to provide updates on a couple of other developments beginning with our filing at DP&L in Ohio on Slide 24. As you may know, last month we reached a settlement agreement with certain interveners in our ESP case. The agreement includes riders totaling $125 million per year over five years, earmarked for debt reduction in investment in distribution infrastructure. The goal is to achieve sustainable investment grade credit metrics at both DP&L and DPL after the expiration of the ESP. As part of the agreement we plan to either sell or shut down 2.1 gigawatts of merchant coal fired generation. It\u2019s worth noting that while reaching a settlement is a positive development not all parties have signed on in the agreement, including Commission staff. Hearings are now set for March 8th and we expect to rule into the effect at the beginning in late second quarter or early third quarter that will help reduce leverage and support the progression toward becoming a stable and growing T&D business. Next on Slide 25, I\u2019d like to briefly discuss our views on potential tax reform. At this time it\u2019s early in the process and unclear which direction final legislation may take. However, I note that under any scenario we do not expect any material cash taxes to be paid for the foreseeable future due to our large NOL position. We would expect to benefit of course from a lower corporate tax rate, as well as from a potential territorial regime that will be supportive of tax efficient repatriation of cash. Certainly the item that could have the most negative impact will be any limitation or elimination of interest deductibility, given the capital-intensive nature of our business and the important role that debt financing plays. Overall, the impact will be slightly positive under the administration\u2019s plan to slightly negative under scenarios limiting interest deductibility such as the house blueprint. If the reform is enacted, it would likely be a phase in period that allows to mitigate any negative impacts that changes the capital structure and other levers. Now to Slide 26 and the progress we\u2019re making to improve our credit profile. During 2016 we prepaid $300 million in parent debt and refinanced down the $500 million of floating rate debt with 10-year notes at attractive fixed rates. Since 2011 we have reduced parent debt by $1.8 billion or 28% and reduced interest cost by 125 basis points, resulting in an annualized interest savings of $180 million. As you can see on the top of the slide, our nearest maturity at the parent is $240 million in 2019. Turning to the bottom of the slide, these proactive steps have helped us reduce our parent leverage ratio from almost 6.5 times to 5 times debt to parent free cash flow plus interest. We expect our credit to continue to improve, largely driven by a strong growth in parent free cash flow, as well as a modest amount of annual debt reduction. As a result, we expect to attain investment grade credit metrics by 2020. We continue to believe this will not only help to reduce our cost of debt and improve our financial flexibility, but also enhance our equity valuation. Turning now to our 2016 parent capital allocation on Slide 27, which is materially in line with prior disclosures. Sources on the left-hand side reflect $1.2 billion of total available discretionary cash, which includes $579 million of parent free cash flow, just above the midpoint of our expected range. Sources also include proceeds from asset sales, primarily AES Sul. As expected, this month the parents received $300 million, the remaining proceeds from the sale of Sul after meeting the required notice period for distributions. Now to uses on the right-hand side of the slide, consistent with our capital allocation plan, we\u2019ve allocated $400 million for investment in our subsidiaries, a majority of which is for new projects driving our future growth. We prepaid $300 million of our near-term maturities and with 10% growth in our dividend and completed share purchases, we returned about a third of our cash to shareholders last year. Now to guidance on Slide 28, beginning in the first quarter of 2017, we will no longer be giving guidance on proportional free cash flow and instead we\u2019ll report consolidated free cash flow. Our use of proportional free cash flow is intended to provide investors with an understanding of the proportional free cash flow attributable to AES after the impact of non-controlling interests. However, the use of proportional free cash flow is not consistent with the recent SEC guidance in a broader related comment process, so we\u2019ll no longer be disclosing it. Having said that, as a supplemental disclosure in our investor presentations, we provide information about the proportional free cash flow attributable to minority interest. Today we\u2019re initiating guidance for 2017 and providing expected average annual growth rates through 2020 of 8% to 10% for all key metrics. Key underlying assumptions include FX and commodity forward curves as of year-end 2016; tax rate for 2017 in the range of 31% to 33%, in the low 30s for 2020; at least $500 million in assets sale proceeds in 2017 with $0.03 to $0.04 dilution from the timing lag for the capital that we deployed; the deconsolidation of Eletropaulo in 2017, as I mentioned earlier, and the ease for discretionary cash in line with our capital allocation framework, which I\u2019ll discuss in a moment. Now to Slide 29, for 2017, our consolidated free cash flow guidance is $1.4 billion to $2 billion, growing at 10% through 2020. We expect free cash flow attributable to non-controlling interests to be 30% to 40% of consolidated free cash flow through 2020. Parent free cash flow on Slide 30 is expected to be $575 million to $675 million in 2017, a 9% increase over 2016, consistent with our 8% to 10% range. On Slide 31, our adjusted EPS guidance for 2017 is $1 to $1.10, growing at 8% to 10% from 2016 through 2020. For 2017 this represents 5% growth of the midpoint of our 2016 guidance range. As we said previously, we expected growth to be stronger in 2018 than in 2017. As I mentioned, 2017 includes $0.03 to $0.04 dilution from the asset sales due to the timing lag into proceeds that we deployed. The main drivers of growth for our cost savings plan, improved availability at our plants in MCAC, and contributions from new businesses, including closing the cycle at DPP and the acquisition of sPower. Our tax rate in 2016 was unusually low and the negative impacted a more normalized rate in 2017, largely offset by some discrete items that benefit us year-over-year. In terms of our long-term growth, we\u2019re expecting 8% to 10% from 2016 to 2020, primary drivers of this growth are contributions from projects under construction coming online through 2019, the benefit from our ongoing cost savings and revenue enhancement initiative and capital allocation including investment in new businesses like sPower. Regarding the profile of growth over the period, we see stronger growth in 2018 and expect to be at the low-end of our prior range of 12% to 16%. In 2018 we\u2019ll bring online 70% of our current projects under construction. In addition, we expect to benefit by allocating our discretionary cash into both debt reduction at the parent and investment in new growth projects. We also see operating improvement at some of our existing businesses. Now I\u2019ll discuss our 2017 parent capital allocation on Slide 32. Beginning on the left, sources reflect $1.5 billion of total available discretionary cash. Parent free cash flow, the foundation for our dividend growth and value creation is expected to be $575 million to $675 million, up 9%. Sources also reflect asset sales. And as I mentioned, we expect to raise at least $500 million this year in addition to the almost $300 million received in 2017 through Sul. Now to uses on the right-hand side. Including the dividend increase we announced in December, we\u2019ll be returning almost $320 million to shareholders this year. We expect to pay down at least $200 million to $300 million of debt, a portion of which reflects our continuing efforts to improve our credit profile and achieve investment grade metrics by 2020. The remaining portion will be to maintain credit neutrality associated with planned asset sales. We\u2019ve allocated $382 million for acquisition of sPower. This represents our share of the $853 million purchase price plus $90 million in acquisition debt funding provided by our partner. We also plan to invest $250 million in our subsidiaries, the majority of which is for new projects under construction and in late-stage development. After considering these investments in our subsidiaries, debt prepayment and our current dividend, we\u2019re left with almost $300 million of discretionary cash. Before turning back to Andr\u00e9s, I\u2019d like to discuss how we plan to allocate the discretionary cash we\u2019re generating through 2020. On Slide 33, you can see we expect to have $3.7 billion of discretionary cash, primarily from growth in parent free cash flow. After current shareholder dividends, 2017 planned parent debt reduction, as well as the investments in projects under construction and the sPower acquisition, we will have $1.5 billion available for other discretionary uses. Our guidance assumes targeted 8% to 10% annual dividend growth consistent with parent free cash flow, modest parent de-levering to continue our credit improvement and support our goal of reaching investment grade credit metrics by 2020. And lastly, investments in attractive gas infrastructure projects such as Southland, as well as renewable growth opportunities, including harvesting the sPower growth portfolio, where we own attractive risk-adjusted returns with high quality long-term U.S. dollar- denominated contracts. With that, I\u2019ll now pass it back to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thanks Tom. To summarize today\u2019s call, we ended 2016 on a high note by achieving or exceeding our guidance. We made further strides on our strategic goals by making progress on our construction program, which is the biggest driver of our near-term growth, extracting additional cost savings and synergies from our existing platform, rebalancing our business mix by exiting non-core businesses, and redeploying the proceeds in less carbon intensive businesses with long-term U.S. dollar-denominated contracts such as sPower, offering 8% to 10% growth in all key metrics, including free cash flow, earnings and dividends. We\u2019re encouraged by our performance in 2016 and the progress we are making to continue to de-risk the portfolio and deliver compelling returns to our shareholders. Now, we will be happy to take your questions. Daniel? Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Ali Agha : Thank you, good morning. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Good morning Ali. Ali Agha : First question Andr\u00e9s or Tom, just to clarify the dilution that you\u2019re seeing in 2017 in your guidance that $0.03 to $0.04. I\u2019m hearing you right, you are saying that\u2019s a timing issue in terms of when the proceeds are invested, so when \u2013 you do end up investing those proceeds, let\u2019s call it in 2018, is the ultimate impact neutral, accretive or still dilutive, how should we think about this? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : You\u2019re right, it\u2019s $0.03 to $0.04 and it\u2019s really a timing impact. We think that the effect should be probably about neutral, be very minimal. Of course it will ultimately depend exactly on the transaction that we invest, but you know I wouldn\u2019t expect it to be strongly you know certainly dilutive. Ali Agha : Okay. And then also clarifying, Tom, the profile that you were laying out to us, as you mentioned at the mid-point of your 2017 guidance, you are up 5%. If I\u2019m hearing you right, in 2018 you should be up like 12% over 2017, if I heard that right? And then should we assume fairly even growth in 2019, 2020 as part of your profile? Thomas O\u2019Flynn: Yes, that\u2019s fair. Ali Agha : Okay, so those two years have mapped them out consistent? Thomas O\u2019Flynn: Yes and actually the 12%, Ali, was off of midpoint of 2016. Ali Agha : Is that a CAGR or is that a \u2013 I\u2019m little confused? Thomas O\u2019Flynn: We had previously said that we thought growth in 2016 to 2018 would be 12% to 18 \u2013 12% to 15% EPS, so we still think that 2018 will be at the low-end of that 12 and 12 range. We obviously want to go our path then to give investors a longer profile. Ali Agha : Right, but that\u2019s a CAGR we are talking, 2016 through 2018 12% CAGR. Thomas O\u2019Flynn: Yes. Ali Agha : Okay, and then third question, just to understand some of the assumptions that you mapped into this longer term outlook. So I\u2019m assuming, do we assume in there that the Ohio settlement is approved as such and kicks in with that $125 million number, is that assumed in there? And what FX moves have you assumed? Is it just looking at the forward curve in the outer years as well or some assumed dilution, what have you assumed there? Thomas O\u2019Flynn: Yes, we assume forward curves as always. And in terms of DPL, it\u2019s in the range \u2013 we\u2019re in discussions, so I\u2019d rather not be too specific, but it\u2019s in the ballpark of what we\u2019ve been discussing. Ali Agha : Okay. And then lastly, the points you made about the free cash flow usage of roughly the $1.5 billion that you\u2019re left with. When you assume some investment in there, are you assuming the average ROE of 14% or what kind of return are you assuming on that excess cash? Thomas O\u2019Flynn: Well, some of it\u2019s for defined projects like [indiscernible] so we got a pretty good visibility on that, but we\u2019re really looking across our portfolio based on \u2013 as we look at our portfolio, we look at risk and returns consistent with the country, the project etcetera. So it\u2019ll be a range of things from 14%, down to things in the low double-digit consistent with Andr\u00e9s\u2019s comment on the sPower sales pipeline. Ali Agha : I see, okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning. Lots of things to talk about. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : That\u2019s right. Good morning, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Perhaps first just a real quick question, a couple easy ones. sPower, what kind of EPS should be assuming once that closes on annualized basis. Is it simply taking a high single digit ROE from the equity invested or because of the ITC [indiscernible] something lower than that in terms of the ongoing ROE? Thomas O\u2019Flynn: Hey Julien, it\u2019s Tom. It\u2019s only a few cents a year, as Andr\u00e9s said, it\u2019s lumpy, so \u2013 but generally it\u2019s a few cents a year. If you look at over longer period, the ROEs would line up with the IRRs. The ROEs in the early years are little better, because the nature of the accounting comes with the tax equity investments, obviously it\u2019s bigger if we \u2013 if it\u2019s more size \u2013 size of\u2026 Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it, so it\u2019s shooting above that level in the earlier, so is there kind of a \u2013 what\u2019s embedded in 2017 guidance for instance, or as you think about 2018 with the sPower deal\u2026 Thomas O\u2019Flynn: I think... Julien Dumoulin-Smith: \u2026[indiscernible] and also the trajectory thereafter? Thomas O\u2019Flynn: Yes, few cents a year. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay, just a couple cents give or take. Thomas O\u2019Flynn: Yeah. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay got it. And then moving \u2013 what\u2019s the impact of deconsolidating Eletropaulo in EPS, just \u2013 I just want to make sure. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : None. Just on that\u2026 Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay, great. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : \u2026just on the consolidated free cash flow. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right, and also what\u2019s reflected in terms of DPL in your 2017 guide and onwards? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : I think Tom answered that in terms of \u2013 you know basically we are not going to discuss it, but it\u2019s within the range that\u2019s public. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. All right, fair enough. And then following on Ali\u2019s last one, the 12% to 16% well in, so that would be roughly above 24, 12% compounded, two years off of 2016\u2019s dollar? Thomas O\u2019Flynn: Yes, that\u2019s right. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And then what do you think about a normalization of the effective tax rate, 31% to 33%, how do you think about that in 2018 and onwards, just as you \u2013 more structurally. Thomas O\u2019Flynn: Well, that\u2019s the rates we\u2019ve always talked about, it\u2019s sort of in the low 30s. Obviously there is talk about tax reform in the U.S. and we\u2019ll of course incorporate any changes there. I mean it\u2019s a very positive thing such as territorial tax, lower rates. On the other hand there is talk about limiting interest deductibility, and so we\u2019ll see how that washes out. So I mean basically we\u2019re looking at \u2013 we do not believe most of the proposals in the reasonable range will have a material impact on us. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And lastly, if you can elaborate just quickly, timing on OPGC 2, just on shifts, what\u2019s the latest status if I can? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : I mean we are making very good progress on OPGC 2. We had talked about that versus the original expectations, we\u2019re about six months behind, we haven\u2019t lost any more time and basically the project is up and running and we\u2019ve done the related infrastructure projects, whether it be the rail or the new housing. So that project is coming along very nicely. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. All right, I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you very much. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thanks, Julien. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Stephen Byrd : Hi, good morning. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Good morning Steve. Stephen Byrd : Thanks for the comprehensive guidance you\u2019re looking out. I wanted to go to your Slide 33 and think about the discretionary cash bid. When you think about the targeted credit metrics that you\u2019re looking to achieve later in the decade, can you give us a bit of color on how we should be thinking about those metrics? Thomas O\u2019Flynn: Hey Stephen, so our ratio is now five, we think we need to get down the four range, obviously it\u2019s dependent upon business mix, but we\u2019ve gone from 6.5 to five and we think something in the four range would be would represent investment grade metrics. So, that will come with some parent debt reduction and also continuing growth in our parent free cash flow. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : One thing I\u2019d like to add about that also is the qualitative aspect. As we have more dollar-denominated long contracted cash flows, that is qualitative aspect, I think it\u2019s very important. So that\u2019s part of that evolution as well. Stephen Byrd : All fair points and it looks like you\u2019ll have a fair amount of true discretionary cash even achieving those leverage metrics, so that\u2019s great. And just shifting over to sPower, when we think about how you\u2019re going to finance the growth and those returns, I assume that you laid out are levered returns. Should we be assuming that you\u2019ll avail yourself with a typical project financed debt leverage levels which you can get? And then for the equity check, will it likely be 50-50 with your partners or should we be thinking about that differently? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes, you\u2019re right. I mean, we\u2019re thinking of 50-50 with our partner with AIMCo. I would say that in terms of you know how to finance them is a continuation of the mixes which you have now and obviously you\u2019ll have some phasing down of the ITC, we still see that there will be appetite from financials for tax equity into these protects. One thing I\u2019d like to stress about the acquisition of sPower is really the effect it will have on our whole portfolio and obviously we can do solar project all over our platform and we have some very attractive opportunity, especially where we can integrate them with our existing conventional plans. We think that is a very interesting product offering that sort of load following energy that can be supplied and taking into account the sort of intermittency of renewables we can offer a better product. So really with the pipeline that should be delivering between 500 and 1 gigawatt of new projects per year, this really is a \u2013 we\u2019ll be bale to leverage this across our portfolio whether it be purchasing. And also we think that this team has been extremely successful with a very disciplined development projects, it really has a proven track record. So when we think about sPower, we think about the JV with AIMCo, which will continue to grow on a 50-50 basis. But in addition, there will be synergies, which will be beneficial to other AES projects, but also to the JV, because the more we buy and the \u2013 had those economies of scale, the JV will benefit from this as well. Stephen Byrd : That\u2019s a great color, Andr\u00e9s. And just on the pipeline what we\u2019re talking about that it\u2019s a huge number in terms of the potential size. Is there anyway for us to get a better sense for the degree of risk or flipped around the degree of certainty that you might have in terms of pursuing this pipeline, is it some very early stage or some quite advanced and you feel quite good about your prospects, how should we think about that, just given how big it is? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Well there is over 200 megawatts which already has PPI contracts. There is another over 200 which has, are under PPI negotiations. There are about 2 gigawatts which are platform expansions and those again have lower risk because you already have operating assets in those areas. And then the rest are various degrees of development. I would say that a lot of this rest upon sPower\u2019s reputation and with clients which range not only from utilities, but corporate as well. So we see this is a very robust pipeline in general, and we will see how this develops over the following years, but it is more or less sort of commissioning 500 megawatts at first and it should ramp up to 1 gigawatt. Now I would say also that this is not, this is something we tried, when we acquired main stream power, which is more distributed energy smaller, but it is interesting. The main stream has done about \u2013 I believe a little bit less than 60, 70 megawatts in its entire history. Last year under AES, they did 88 megawatts, and this year it could be as high as 200 megawatts. So I think this shows how bringing in sort of AES\u2019 financial capabilities, also our market knowledge can empower this. So, we see this as you know we tried on a much smaller scale and now we are going to a large scale. Stephen Byrd : Super, helpful. Thank you very much. That\u2019s all I had. Operator : Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Angie Storozynski : Thank you. So wanted to talk about the guidance for free cash flow growth. I understand the dilution on the earnings impact, the diversities and their impact on the EPS CAGR, but about the cash flow CAGR, I mean that has come down a little bit, right? You had expected a 10% CAGR in proportional free cash flow, I don\u2019t think that the controlling interest has had any impact here. Why the reduction here in growth expectations? Thomas O\u2019Flynn: Angie, remember the 10% was through 2018. So we are doubling the period, going to 2020 and saying 8% to 10%, so it \u2013 I think it is still consistent with our general trajectory. We did use the base line as a mid-point of 2016 guidance. Remember that we got about 300 million from interest, so, in 2016 so you are not going to yet normalize for that. Angie Storozynski : Okay. Ahmed Pasha : And this is Ahmed. I think the shape will be more front end loaded because we have about $1 billion of equity in our construction projects. So those projects are coming on line in the 2018, so we will see more contribution front end loaded from those investments. Angie Storozynski : Okay. Secondly on Alto Maipo, so basically you have about 300 million in cost overruns and do you agreed on financing only 22% of it, is that correct? Thomas O\u2019Flynn: Put it this way. We have the cost overruns are expected to be in the range of 10% to 20%. We have financing that we are closing on for up to 22%. So, we would cover even the sort of worst estimate in terms of cost overruns. Angie Storozynski : Also that 22% is not of the cost overrun, it is of the entire project? Thomas O\u2019Flynn: That\u2019s correct. The 110% of the worst case of the cost overruns, it would be like 220% of the expected case. Angie Storozynski : Okay, fantastic. And then lastly on your EPS guidance, I mean just looking at how your CAGR \u2013 I mean that would imply about $1.40 to $143 in EPS by 2020, which is probably ahead of your prior expectation for 2020 earnings. I know that you were not giving explicit guidance, but it almost seems like there is a slower earnings growth initially and then it accelerates by \u2013 and basically exceeds expectations of prior earnings growth by 2020? That\u2019s your assessment? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : That\u2019s correct. Yes, that\u2019s correct. Angie Storozynski : Okay, thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Keith Stanley from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Keith Stanley : Hi, good morning. Do you think it\u2019s possible that DPL to still get PUCO Staff on board to a deal here? Do you expect the case to be fully litigated at this point? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : We think it\u2019s possible to get PUCO Staff onboard, very much so. Keith Stanley : Okay. And that would be before the March date [ph]? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yeah, I mean, obviously, Keith, time is running out, but we continue to have an open dialogue and open door and expect something will be figured out, sir, that\u2019s \u2013 we are certainly open to that. Keith Stanley : Okay, great. And then at Eletropaulo \u2013 well, on the asset sales, besides Eletropaulo, I mean, do you get the $500 million, it sounds like there is some other material sales you are planning or several assets being marketed right now or at a high level how can we think about what you might be looking to sell? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Well, again, you know, these are ongoing businesses; we never talk about them before its close. But what I would say is that look at what we\u2019ve said as our strategy, in terms of de-risking the portfolio of reducing our carbon intensity. Those are the types of assets we have sold and we will continue to sell. Obviously, with the number of $500 million, we have something specific in mind, which is advanced for us to feel confident in terms of getting this guidance, so that\u2019s as far as I can go, but I would say that \u2013 as we\u2019ve always said, we will continue to sort of churn our assets and invest them in better -adjusted returns. Keith Stanley : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Gregg Orrill with Barclays. Please go ahead. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Good morning, Gregg. Gregg Orrill : Good morning. Can you provide a little more detail or perspective around the $0.06 reserve from the fourth quarter and then thoughts on returns around your investment in wind in Brazil? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Okay. Taking the first one, I mean, that was basically we had a legal case, which we had \u2013 let\u2019s say the possibility of getting it funded and we did took a reserve against that, we don\u2019t want to get into more detail about that. Certainly, a close case, there shouldn\u2019t be anything more going forward. Gregg Orrill : Okay. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Regarding the wind in Brazil, this is Renova\u2019s asset, these are contract \u2013 18-year contract in reals indexed to CPI. I think we are buying them at a very attractive price. We will remain the people that in the past when Brazil was really booming, we never bought anything that \u2013 at those prices we didn\u2019t think it was attractive, now we see this is being at attractive prices. I also think that it\u2019s very important to get Tiet\u00ea to be growing again and we are utilizing 100% of local financing for this project. So it\u2019s an attractive acquisition and it really is a milestone for Tiet\u00ea. Gregg Orrill : Okay. So around the reserve, I think you said this, it\u2019s not an impact for ongoing earnings or how are you getting paid, I mean, it still be the case? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Absolutely not. It\u2019s a short case. Gregg Orrill : Okay, good enough. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Lasan Johong with Auvila Research Consulting. Please go ahead. Lasan Johong : Andr\u00e9s, the 8% to 10% compound annual growth rate guidance, I assume has some 80% level of your vast development projects in it, can you kind of give me some color how much of your development projects outside of your vast development projects are embedded in that 8% to 10% growth rate. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Well, I think this is really anchored in the projects that we know. Southland is in these projects. The energy storage of Southland is there as well. We have the completion of OPGC 2 and the completion of Alto Maipo in 2019. Now besides that we do have some modest \u2013 we have the growth of sPower, that I\u2019ve talked about 500 megawatts ramping up to 1 gigawatt towards the end of that period. We also have some growth in terms of distributed energy as well around 200 megawatts a year. Other than that it\u2019s basically redeploying that cash, there will be other acquisitions that could be smaller ones add-ons, and there could be some additional energy storage project, again, modest energy storage project and \u2013 besides that growth. So, that\u2019s what embedded in those numbers. Lasan Johong : So, if I may, what you are telling me is that, this is about as conservative as you are going to get in terms of your guidance going forward? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : I think it\u2019s reasonably conservative. I do think if some markets really pop like energy storage and third party sales or something it could be superior to that. We have other things that we are looking at from diesel to other applications, but I think it\u2019s reasonably conservative is the right approach to it. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a most conservative case. Lasan Johong : Yes, you\u2019ve been going through a lot of restructuring, selling, buying assets, where \u2013 can you tell me where you see AES\u2019 mix of businesses, is that \u2013 what are you trying to drive towards? I mean it\u2019s pretty clear in the U.S. you want to get clean, okay, so we understand that. The rest of world, what are your objectives in terms of how you want to poster AES going forward? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : That\u2019s a great question. What we see is we will continue our strategy, simplifying the portfolio. And I always said that we don\u2019t need to be in 20 countries to really have the advantages of diversification. We do see having a strong footprint in the U.S. because it gives us stable cash flows, it\u2019s also the most technologically advanced market in all regards, whether it would be energy storage, whether it would be \u2013 on the commercial sense and then we really see ourself being the bridge from that to faster growing markets. And with the big emphasis in Latin America and a big emphasis to the extent we can get dollar-denominated contracts. So that\u2019s where we see AES of the future. Now we do see conventional energy as being an important part of this. We really see that as a great advantage to the extent you can integrate renewables into your product and service offerings to final clients. So there is a greening of the portfolio in large part because we are just seeing energy prices from renewables come down so much, also it\u2019s because you can get long-term contracts for renewables. And finally because that\u2019s a part of the market that\u2019s growing, I mean almost 60% of new adds in the worlds are renewables. So in virtually all of our markets that\u2019s a segment, that\u2019s why we want to be there. On the other hand we see the advantages of AES as being able to integrate that into existing platforms. So platform expansions continues to be an important part of our strategy and it\u2019s one of things we like very much about sPower, they have a platform expansion strategy. Lasan Johong : Is it safe to assume that Brazil is going to get absorbed into MCAC at some point, once you deconsolidate Eletropaulo and it becomes a really small part of your business? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : No, and I would say the following reason, I mean, Brazil has its own market, it has its own relations, it has its own regulatory structure, so we think they will have to continued to be managed in that way. Tiet\u00ea is also a publicly listed company. Now we are very happy to start Tiet\u00ea growing again, because I think that will have a good impact on local investors and the multiple we get for Tiet\u00ea. Remember, our SBUs are basically organized around markets, so what we would like is that the teams there face similar clients, similar regulators, similar financial institutions. Lasan Johong : Last question, Argentina, it sounds like AES is starting to think about keeping that business unit, is that something I\u2019m imagining or is this something new that\u2019s developing? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Well, we\u2019ve always said that Argentina had significant upside potential and we are seeing that this year or actually started seeing it last year. I mean, Argentina, we sold it out of the distribution businesses, which were, I would say, difficult. Lasan Johong : Yeah. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : But we are left with a very solid, excellent technically generation business, which has made money pretty much every year. We had three years where weren\u2019t able to pay dollar dividends, but Argentina is part of Andes SBUs, this is \u2013 synergies and some interconnections with the Chilean market. Lasan Johong : Yes. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : But we are seeing a tremendous progress in Argentina, tremendous progress in our business and I think it\u2019s very much in line with what we were telling everyone before is that Argentina had significant upside potential and some of that upside potential is being realized. I think there is even more potential going forward. Lasan Johong : Opportunities for more investments in Argentina possible? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Well, I think, if we did anything in Argentina, I would be using local leverage capacity, like we are doing in Brazil, like we are doing in the Dominican Republic. Lasan Johong : I understand. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : And in the past when we talked about proportional free cash flow and how we were paying down sub-debt and creating opportunities, I think, between DPP and Tiet\u00ea are two excellent examples of how we can lever the local business, 100% levered and come up with attractive, in both cases very carbon friendly projects with long-term contracts. Lasan Johong : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Charles Fishman : Good morning. Andr\u00e9s, can you give \u2013 are you able to give anymore color on what the staffs objection was \u2013 Ohio staffs objection was to the settlement agreement? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : No, we really aren\u2019t. We are in negotiations now and we think we will reach the settlement, but we can\u2019t give any more color. Sorry. Charles Fishman : Okay. I thought that would be your answer. And then the second question was just to make sure I understand this, on the way you are reporting now, if I look at Slide 29, the consolidated free cash flow growth and if I deduct my estimate, okay, between 30% and 40% for the non-controlling interest, that would be equivalent to the way you used to report proportional free cash at the consolidated level, correct? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : That\u2019s right, yes. Charles Fishman : Am I? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes, you are right. Charles Fishman : Okay, thank you. Got it. I just want to make sure I have it right. That\u2019s all I had. Thank you very much. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : All right. Thank you, Charles. Ahmed Pasha : Okay. So I think with this we conclude today\u2019s call and we thank everybody for joining us on this call. As always IR team will be happy in answering your questions. Thank you and have a nice day. Operator : Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode [Operator Instructions]. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions [Operator Instructions]. Also please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ahmed Pasha, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ahmed Pasha : Thank you, Ryan. Good morning and welcome to AES\u2019s First Quarter 2017 Financial Review Call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning are Andr\u00e9s Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom O'Flynn, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will now turn the call over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2017 financial review call. Today, I will discuss our financial results and provide updates on our strategy to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders.  Since our most recent call in late February, we have made significant progress on a number of key objectives for 2017. We advanced our construction program, which will be the major contributor to our cash flow and earnings growth over the next four years. We capitalized on our existing platforms to further enhance future growth by targeting long-term US dollar-denominated contracts. We have taken steps to decrease our covenant intensity and merchant exposure. These steps will reduce our financial and operational risk. We continued our efforts to strengthen our credit profile by prepaying $300 million of Parent debt. This also increases Parent free cash flow by lowering interest expense. We are on track to achieve our $400 million per year cost reduction and revenue enhancement program. I will discuss these achievements in more detail in a moment, but first I would like to summarize our financial results on Slide 4. In the first quarter, we earned $0.17 of adjusted EPS versus the $0.15 we earned in the same period last year. We generated $546 million of consolidated free cash flow, $56 million higher than last year. Based on our first quarter performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are reaffirming our full year guidance for all metrics. Now I would like to turn to our strategic accomplishments. As you can see on Slide 5, we have 3.4 gigawatts under construction and expect it to come online through 2019. Overall, we have achieved significant progress on all of these projects.  Turning to Alto Maipo on Slide 6, as you may recall Alto Maipo is an expansion of our existing Alfalfal plant in Chile. As we discussed on our last call, the project has been experiencing tunneling challenges resulting in cost overruns estimated in the range of 10% to 20%. Over the past couple of months, we have made significant progress on this project. First, we have secured additional financing commitment for up to 22% of the project cost equivalent to $460 million including contingencies, of which $117 million will be funded by AES Gener and the remaining $343 million will be funded by the project lenders main contractor and minority partner. Second, Alto Maipo is now about 52% complete and we remain on track to reach COD in 2019.  Turning to Slide 7, at our Eagle Valley, CCGT in Indiana, the EPC contractor is sub-contracting some of the work in an effort to accelerate the recovery plan. On our February call, we\u2019ve revised the completion date for this project to the first half of 2018.  However, the EPC contractor is projecting substantial completion before year end 2017. Although any delay is unfortunate, we have a fixed price contract with the EPC contractor under which they are incentivized to finish the project in a timely manner. The CCGT has achieved several important EPC milestones, and we expect first fire to occur in the third quarter. Turning to Slide 8, in our 1320 megawatt OPGC 2 project in India, we continued to make steady progress on construction and the project is expected to come online by the end of 2018.  Finally, turning to Slide 9 and Col\u00f3n in Panama. I am pleased to report that we have reached a number of milestones on our Col\u00f3n CCGT and LNG regasification facility in Panama. The LNG facility is efficient to handle 80 Terrra BTU annually. Our CCGT will use about one quarter of the tank\u2019s capacity leaving substantial upside potential to meet the fuel needs of additional power plants, ship bunkering services, and downstream commercial and industrial customers.  We will continue to focus on providing a cleaner, more cost-effective alternatives to oil-fueled power generation while at the same time satisfying a growing need for natural gas in Central America and the Caribbean.  To that end, on Friday, we announced that we have entered into a joint venture with ENGIE to market and sell LNG from our Panamanian LNG terminal to third parties in Central America. This joint venture will help us monetize the tank\u2019s remaining capacity as additional LNG is sold using our terminal. It also further strengthens the agreement we signed last year to jointly market LNG in the Caribbean from our Andres regasification facility in the Dominican Republic. With ENGIE as our partner, and both Colon and Andres online, in 2019, we will have the leading position in Central America and in the Caribbean\u2019s LNG regasification market.  Turning to Slide 10, as you know, we are the world leader in battery-based energy storage. We currently have 394 megawatts in operation, under construction, or in late-stage development not including the 82 megawatt of our advanced energy storage platform that we have sold to third-parties.  Since February, we have delivered 37.5 megawatts of four hour duration storage, the largest lithium ion energy storage installation in the world, the San Diego Gas and Electric. Following our successful commissioning of this project, San Diego Gas and Electric has awarded us another 40 megawatts four hour duration project. Although energy storage has significant potential for growth, at this point, we have not assumed any material contributions in our outlook.  Turning now to Slide 11 and our cost savings and revenue enhancement initiatives. This year, we are merging our Europe and Asia strategic business units which will drive significant savings. We are also continuing the work we began last year on standardization and improved sourcing and reliability. These initiatives put us on track to achieve $50 million of incremental annual benefits in 2017 and to hit our $400 million annual savings target by 2020. Now turning to our continuing efforts to reshape our portfolio beginning on Slide 12. As we have discussed on our recent calls, we have been repositioning our portfolio towards businesses that are less carbon-intensive and have long-term US dollar-denominated contracts. This repositioning is a key element of our strategy to reduce the risk of our portfolio. This year, we have already announced our plan to sell or shutdown 3.7 gigawatts of merchant coal-fired generation in Kazakhstan and Ohio. This is 26% of our total coal-fired capacity and 70% of our merchant coal-fired capacity. Specifically, we divested 1.7 gigawatts of coal-fired generation in Kazakhstan for net proceeds of $24 million. With this sale, our only remaining assets in Kazakhstan are two plants with 1 gigawatt of hydro capacity, which are under concession that expires in the fourth quarter of this year. We expect to exit Kazakhstan following the expiration of this concession. We have already announced the shutdown of 1.3 gigawatts of merchant, coal-fired capacity at DPL. Subsequently, we\u2019ve also agreed to sell an additional 739 megawatts of DPL owned generation for $50 million in net proceeds. Although the Kazakhstan and Ohio merchant coal sales appear to have low value on a per kilowatt basis, on a PE basis, we managed to achieve a multiple of roughly nine times.  We will continue to update you as we make progress on additional asset sales to further reshape our portfolio.  Turning to new businesses. Slide 13 provides an update on our Southland Repowering in California. As a reminder, we were awarded 20 year PPA by Southern California Edison for 1384 megawatts of capacity which includes 100 megawatts of energy storage and 1284 megawatts of combining cycled gas capacity. Last month, we received final environmental approval for the project. We are on track for financial close and to begin construction by mid-2017 with completion of the gas-fired capacity in 2020 and the energy storage capacity in 2021. We anticipate funding the $2.3 billion in total project cost with a combination of non-recourse debt and approximately $400 million in equity proceeds from AES.  Turning to Slide 14 and our pending acquisition of sPower. We continue to see the potential for adding 500 megawatts to 1 gigawatts of renewable contracted power annually with attractive low double-digit IRR. Furthermore, we see an opportunity to capitalize on the development skills of the sPower team to tap into the growing market for renewable PPA for large corporate and incorporating energy storage on their platforms.  We received the FERC approval for the transaction last month and expect to receive the remaining approvals and close no later than the third quarter.  As you can see on Slide 15, we are also making progress on renewable in Mexico, and Brazil. In Mexico, we were awarded exclusivity to negotiate 25 year US dollar-denominated PPA with private offtakers to build a 306 megawatt wind project and a 60 megawatt co-generation plant.  These are our first Greenfield developments in Mexico in many years and we see a number of other good growth opportunities in light of the market reforms implemented by the Mexican government. Lastly, we signed the acquisition of the 386 megawatts, Alto de Sert\u00e3o wind farm in Brazil that we announced on our last call. This project will help diversify Tiet\u00ea\u2019s fuel mix and hydrological risk. With an average remaining contract life of 18 years, the project will also help to reduce future exposure to short-term price movements. This 600 million Real acquisition is being funded entirely with debt capacity at Tiet\u00ea demonstrating once again our ability to utilize local debt capacity in order to grow our business and improve returns.  Turning to Slide 16, this brings us to our portfolio, which we expect to generate 8% to 10% average annual growth in all of our key financial metrics through 2020. This growth is largely driven by the completion of our projects under construction, our cost savings and revenue enhancement initiatives, lower interest expense, as we continue to delever, and attractive returns from recent acquisitions and our development pipeline.  We see further upside potential if we are able to capitalize on the LNG and energy storage opportunities I discussed earlier.  Turning to Slide 17, our portfolio will generate $3.8 billion in discretionary cash through 2020. This is largely driven by Parent free cash flow and the proceeds from asset sales. This internally generated discretionary cash is sufficient for us to meet our dividend growth commitment to fund our growth platform and reduce our corporate debt to achieve our strategic objectives. Overall, we remain confident that we can deliver attractive growth to our shareholders through 2020 and beyond.  With that, I will turn the call over to Tom to discuss our first quarter results, capital allocation and guidance in more detail. Thomas O'Flynn: Thanks Andr\u00e9s, and good morning. Today, I will review our first quarter results and 2017 capital allocation. Overall, we had a solid quarter benefiting from higher margins at many of our SBUs and lower tax rates. We also generated strong free cash flow and made good progress on Parent debt reduction.  Turning to adjusted EPS on Slide 19, first quarter results of $0.17, a $0.02 increase from 2016. The increase was primarily driven by the tax rate, which was lower than first quarter 2016 rate, but higher than our expectation for full year 2017. Operations were relatively steady as benefit from a legal settlement in Brazil and foreign currency appreciation were largely offset by lower contributions at DPL in Ohio. Before moving on, I want to touch on $168 million impairment charges again this quarter that are not included in adjusted EPS. Almost all of this is related to the exit of merchant coal assets that Andr\u00e9s mentioned namely, the 1.7 gigawatt sale in Kazakhstan and the planned shutdown of our 1.2 gigawatt Killen and Stuart plants at DPL in Ohio.  Now to Slide 20 and our consolidated free cash flow and adjusted PTC. We generated $546 million of consolidated free cash flow, an increase of $56 million from the first quarter of 2016. That was also largely driven by higher margins, as well as lower tax payments in Andes and MCAC SBUs. We also earned $190 million in adjusted PTC during the quarter, an increase of $5 million largely driven by higher margins. Now I\u2019ll cover SBUs in more detail over the next six slides, beginning on slide 21. In the US, our results reflects slightly lower margins primarily due to the impact of major planned maintenance at Hawaii and lower contributions from DPL due to lower regulated ESP rates. Adjusted PTC also decreased due to a gain on a contract termination that occurred in 2016 at DPL related to its competitive retail business. Lower consolidated free cash flow also reflects higher purchase power and fuel cost at DPL. At Andes our results reflects higher margins primarily due to higher reservoir levels and generating volume in Columbia. Consolidated free cash flow also reflects lower tax payments at Gener in Chile. In Brazil our results reflects higher margins, primarily driven by higher spot sales and energy prices at Tiet\u00ea. Adjusted PTC also benefited from the settlement of the legal dispute at our CCBT Uruguaiana.  Consolidated free cash flow benefited from these impacts, but was partially offset by the recovery of high purchased power cost in 2016 from prior drivers and our distribution business Eletropaulo. It\u2019s worth mentioning that while we are expecting the low hydro conditions this year in Brazil, the impact will be much less than it\u2019s been in prior years, due to changes we\u2019ve made to our hedging strategy. We are now 83% contracted in 2017, which leaves us well positioned to absorb hydro shortfall. In Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, higher margins were driven primarily by higher availability in Mexico. Consolidated free cash flow also reflects lower tax payments in the DR. I\u2019d also like to note that in the first quarter, the DR was awarded new five year PPAs to recontract 470 megawatts of existing capacity.  The PPAs were awarded in a competitive option and our cost efficient plant with the only capacity to clear. Pricing is in line with our existing PPAs and prior expectations. We are now 95% contracted for 2018 and 85% contracted for 2022. In Europe, our results reflects lower margins, largely due to the restructuring of the PPA at Maritza in Bulgaria in the second quarter of 2016.  Consolidated free cash flow increased due to lower CapEx for environmental projects completed in 2016 and higher collections in the United Kingdom.  Finally, in Asia, our results reflect steady margins and slightly higher working capital requirements at Mong Duong in Vietnam. Now to Slide 27, an update on our filing at DP&L in Ohio. As you may know, last month we reached a settlement agreement with Commission\u2019s staff and certain interveners in our EFP case. The agreement includes a distribution Modernization Rider totaling $105 million per year over three years with a two year extension earmarked for debt reduction. The ultimate goal is to transform DPL into a stable and growing T&D business. To that end, DPL has already announced plans to sell or exit all of its 2.1 gigawatts of coal-fired capacity by mid-2018 and is exploring strategic options for the remaining 1 gigawatt of peaking capacity. Evidentiary hearing in the EFP case concluded April 11 with a final decision likely by late second quarter or early third quarter. We expect the ruling that will help DPL continue to reduce leverage and transition to investments-grade rating.  Now to Slide 28, and our improving credit profile. Since February, we have prepaid $300 million of parent debt targeting our largest maturity with some of the highest coupons. This brings our total parent debt to $4.4 billion, which is a $2.1 billion or about a third reduction since September of 2011. Our Parent leverage ratio continues to improve dropping from 6.5 times in 2011 to 5 times last year and to expect it 4.6 times by year end. Through discipline debt reduction, and strong growth in Parent free cash flow, we expect to attain investment-grade credit metrics by 2020. We continue to believe this will help us to not only reduce our cost of debt and improve our financial flexibility, but also enhance our equity valuation.  Now to our 2017 parent capital allocation on Slide 29, which is materially in line with prior disclosure. Sources on the left-hand side reflects $1.5 billion of total available discretionary cash which includes roughly $625 million of Parent free cash flow. As we discussed last quarter, in addition to $300 million we received from the sale of Sul in Brazil, we are targeting $500 million in asset sale proceeds. We continue to make progress on this target, although much of that may occur later in the year.  Moving to uses on the right-hand side of the slide, including the dividend increase we announced in December, we will be returning almost $320 million to shareholders this year. We\u2019ve allocated $340 million to prepay parent debt as I just discussed.  We\u2019ve allocated $382 million to our acquisition of sPower and planned to invest $350 million in our subs, the majority of which for new projects under construction and in late-stage development. After considering these investments in our subs, debt prepayment and our current dividend were less with roughly $100 million of discretionary cash.  Now to guidance beginning on Slide 30. Based on our performance year-to-date and foreign currency and commodity forward curves as of March 31, we are reaffirming our 2017 guidance and expectations for 8% to 10% average annual growth through 2020 for our metrics.  As we\u2019ve discussed previously, EPS growth in 2018 is expected to be higher than the average annual growth we are projecting through 2020. In fact, we are forecasting approximately $0.20 of EPS growth in 2018. About a third of this growth is related to the 2.5 gigawatts or 75% of construction capacity coming online where our invested equity is approximately $700 million.  These projects include the three CCGTs in the Dominican Republic, Indiana and Panama. About a third of this growth is being driven by our cost savings and revenue enhancement initiatives and operating improvements at our businesses. The remaining growth in 2018 is largely driven by contributions from growth in renewable through the sPower and the benefits of lower interest expense.  With that, I\u2019ll now turn it back to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thanks, Tom. We have made significant progress in executing on our strategy by advancing our construction programs which is the key driver of our earnings and cash flow growth capitalizing on the advantages from our existing platform in markets where we have a strong position to make investments to ensure growth beyond 2020, rebalancing our portfolio to reduce risk and complexity by exiting non-core businesses and redeploying the proceeds consistent with our capital allocation framework, prepaying parent debt to improve our credit profile and achieving investment-grade metrics and optimizing our cost structure to improve operational efficiency and achieve our $400 million in annual savings target by 2020.  With these actions, we are positioned to deliver average annual growth of 8% to 10% in all key metrics including free cash flow, earnings, and our dividend. Combining this growth and our current dividend yield will result in a total return of greater than 12%. We believe our attractive total return proposition will be better reflected in our share price as we continue to make progress on our strategic objectives and guidance. Now, we will be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Ali Agha : Thank you, good morning. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Good morning, Ali. Ali Agha : Good morning, Andr\u00e9s. First, just a housekeeping item, perhaps Tom, you had a 41% effective tax rate in the first quarter, are you still targeting 31% to 33% for the year? Any reason why Q1 was so much higher than that? Thomas O'Flynn: Yes, we are still targeting 31% to 33%, first quarter was just the timing of certain events, but 31% to 33% is still what we expect to be for the year. Ali Agha : I see. And then, second on the asset sale front, the $500 million target that you have for the year, the Ohio sale of $50 million and this Kazakhstan sale of $24 million, do they count against that or are they separate from that? And related to that, in the past, you told us that you resumed about a $0.03 earnings dilution from the asset sale primarily from the timing. Given your comments that the timing maybe later in the year, is that $0.03 dilution still valid for 2017? Thomas O'Flynn: So, Ali, as we talk about asset sales proceeds, those are \u2013 that\u2019s cash to corp. So the DPL money will all be used within DPL to retire debt, so that would not count into that. The Kazakhstan $24 million would, and yes, you are right, we had said $0.03 to $0.04 from dilution. We now expect that to be later in the year some maybe $0.02 or somewhat less. That will be a bit of a help from a timing perspective. Ali Agha : Okay, and thirdly, in terms of mapping out your full year growth profile and as you point out, there is a fair amount of free cash flow that you\u2019ll generate over that period as well. Can you remind us for the cash that\u2019s unallocated at this point, what kind of return are you assuming on that cash that kind of gets you to that 8% to 10% overall annual growth rate CAGR? Thomas O'Flynn: Yes, we are assuming cash in the \u2013 cash return in the high-single digits on that, which is consistent with our \u2013 at the lower end of our return on investments that obviously we could look at other things such as paying down debt or repurchasing stock. Ali Agha : Okay, and last question, on the Colon project, with this ENGIE LNG contract, does that change your expected economics, the ROE that you resumed on that plant or was this already factored in into your overall ROE for that project? Thomas O'Flynn: Yes, Ali, we have assumed quite \u2013 say modest use of the tank in regasification facility in our numbers. So to the extent that we can use, make more use of what\u2019s basically existing capacity in the tank and in the terminal, that will be upside. So, with ENGIE in the Dominican Republic where we are using about 50% of the tank\u2019s capacity, and in the Panama where we had basically 25% of the tank\u2019s capacity being used, the sooner we fill this up, the better it will be.  What is the upside potential? Well, if we utilize all of the existing tanks, say, by 2020 and 2021, that\u2019s between \u2013 depends a little bit on the timing, but somewhere between, say $0.03 and $0.05 of upside. Furthermore, we have the land that we could \u2013 and capacity at the terminals that we could, in each location build the second tank and that would be further upside potential.  So we are very excited about this opportunity. We\u2019ve been quite successful on our own selling gas in the Dominican Republic for transportation and for industry. We\u2019ve done our first shipments in thermal tanks or really containers of LNG to other, another island in the Caribbean.  So this is an upside. We see that in the future, certainly ship bunkering will be important. We also see again more conversion of plants, industry, transportation in the Caribbean and in Central America. And with a strong partner like ENGIE that can provide structured products to offtakers, we are very well positioned, but we are just starting and that\u2019s why we have very modest assumptions in our numbers. Ali Agha : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Our next question today comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Hey, good morning. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Good morning, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : So, quick couple of questions here to follow-up. First on the SG&A reductions, you announced sort of an acceleration. Is that already reflected in your guidance as you see it for this year, and just to clarify that?  And then separate, just the distinction, as you think about the 2018 uplift of $0.20 you discussed, can you discuss some of the other puts and takes? I am curious as to what the net EPS impact is of the divestment and/or sale, and the retirement of the DPL asset? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Okay, let me take the first one. In terms of the first, this is what we have announced before, I mean, I think we\u2019ve delivered, actually more than delivered every year in terms of the guidance we set out. So what we are saying is we feel very comfortable with the $50 million that we announced and is in our guidance for 2017, and an additional $50 million in 2018 and last time we also announced that we \u2013 that program will continue -- this sort of productivity improvements will continue in 2019 and 2020 although somewhat at a decelerated pace. So, basically, this is just a reaffirmation of what we announced before. Now on the \u2013 sorry, the second question is in terms of, when you are talking about the dilution from the sale of the DP&L assets. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Yes, I was thinking, sorry, go for it. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes, Julien it\u2019s probably couple of things when you look at DPL it\u2019s probably about a penny and obviously it depends upon terms et cetera. But maybe it\u2019s about a penny in terms of the \u2013 what we are looking at, but that was all contemplated when we gave our guidance in February.  I would say on a cash flow basis, DPL will be pretty neutrally cash flow EBITDA minus CapEx is pretty much breakeven as we see it through our forecast period even before other indirect costs. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Got it, excellent, and then can I just clarify, because I thought I heard you talk about an acceleration in SG&A. How does the classes of European and Asian business together fit within the context of SG&A? Is that still part of the 50 or is that actually going to potentially see some more of that 100 biased toward the 70? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : No, Julien, that is part of the 50 for this year and part of the 100 for the end of next year. So we will continue to take steps, obviously as we divest those assets, that also helps us to accelerate this process. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Got it. And to clarify for 2018, you talk about $0.20 of uplift, obviously DPL is not a huge impact there in terms of offsets. What are some of the other known factors that we should just be aware of it, if you will? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Well, I think, what Tom and I said, I mean, the main is our construction program. So we had three CCGTs that will be online in 2018 we have the cost-cutting program that we have announced and we\u2019ve had the continued delevering. So those are the three main items that are going to contribute to the increase in our earnings and cash flow in 2018. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Right, absolutely any other offsets there, so the $0.20 contemplates the construction program and doesn\u2019t include the cost-cutting? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes, it does. It includes all. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Okay, okay. So that\u2019s a net number year-over-year inclusive of balance sheet SG&A and net contract degradation against growth? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes, that\u2019s correct. And like all of our numbers, that\u2019s based on currency and commodities, forward curves as of today. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Right, excellent, all right. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you all very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Greg Gordon : Thanks, Good morning. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Good morning, Greg. Greg Gordon : I think most of this \u2013 most of my questions have been asked, but what I am looking at slide 53, and I am comparing it to your capital allocation slide. Your investments in subsidiaries is up $100 million versus the Q4 disclosure and it looks like your investment in Alto Maipo is up from $335 million of AES equity to $413 million.  So that looks like it represents the majority of that increase. Am I correlating that correctly? And if so, does that in fact \u2013 taking into account the cost overrun or not because the footnotes still says it excludes the cost overrun. Thomas O'Flynn: Yes that does take into account. The full 20% cost overrun in Alto Maipo. Greg Gordon : Okay, so that \u2013 so the footnote should have been excluded then starts it\u2019s kind of a typo? Thomas O'Flynn: Well, it\u2019s an additional 100 in 2017 from Gener and we own 67% of Gener. Most of the financing again is coming from the lender and the minority partner. Greg Gordon : No, I understand that. I am just asking a very simple question. In the Q4 deck you have $335 million invested, but the footnote saying excluding the overrun. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Greg you are right. This includes the cost overruns. So there is a typo there, as you mentioned. Greg Gordon : Okay, so that typo should have been removed. Great, I just wanted to clarify that. Thank you. And then \u2013 but overall\u2026 Thomas O'Flynn: Greg, it\u2019s Tom. First off, it\u2019s impressive you saw the typo on Page 53. But just going back to your first question on the up 100, you are right in terms of investment subs. It\u2019s in smaller pieces, we do have a modest acceleration of our investment in Colon from 2018 to 2017, so it\u2019s a part of it and then the other large part is an investment in renewable including sPower. That\u2019s the biggest of the diff in that 100. Greg Gordon : Okay, great. So, we\u2019ve got Alto Maipo, Colon and sPower and that represents the change? Thomas O'Flynn: Yes, Alto Maipo is very modest for this year, because A, it\u2019s funded by Gener, lower dividends, but it\u2019s really not factoring into that, because it\u2019s funded by Gener and it\u2019s funded over the next couple of years. Greg Gordon : Okay, I understand. Okay, so, when I am looking at Page 53 versus this year\u2019s capital allocation, 53 is total not just this year, it\u2019s happening over a period of time, that\u2019s the difference. Thomas O'Flynn: Correct. Greg Gordon : Okay, got you, perfect. And then also your \u2013 it looks like your total cash flow over the 2020 period, you\u2019ve raised at the midpoint by about $100 million. Is that just because you\u2019re accelerating debt reduction and retaining more cash from interest savings or is it a combination of other small things? Thomas O'Flynn: Yes, combination of small things. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes, probably, maybe just rounding. Thomas O'Flynn: Yes. Greg Gordon : Okay, thanks guys. Operator : Next question today comes from Chris Morgan with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Angie Storozynski : Hey guys, it\u2019s actually Angie Storozynski. So, I didn\u2019t hear any comments about Brazil. Could you say about \u2013 anything about economic recovery and the future of your utility there? Thank you. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Sure, hi, Angie. In Brazil, what we are seeing is, last quarter, we saw flattening of the decline and this year we might seeing a slight pickup in demand. But, more like 1% demand has decreased like 10%. So, overall, we are modestly optimistic about Brazil. The President is taking a number \u2013 on a number of the important reforms that it flow through, going very well for the country, but we expect a gradual slow recovery in Brazil.  Now this year, they are having a drought and as Tom mentioned, I think, it\u2019s a good example of how our change in commercial strategy and the level of contracting that we have had made it, quite frankly a very small issue, where two years ago it was a very big issue for us. And so, it\u2019s basically the same asset I should say, but it makes a very big difference. So, with the acquisition of the wins that will help provide Tiet\u00ea with basically assets which are not correlated with hydrology which are contracted at 18 years at good prices. Now regarding our utility, which is Eletropaulo and remember we sold, Sul. What we are doing is moving forward on listing it on Novo Mercado and that is going well.  And so basically, being on the Novo Mercado means, one share one vote and therefore we would no longer consolidate Eletropaulo in our numbers. Now the company has had a significant recovery in its share price this year and it\u2019s continuing to make improvements operationally. Angie Storozynski : Okay, and then, in Chile, so, thanks for the update on the construction progress on Alto Maipo. Is there \u2013 have you managed to secure anymore contracts for this asset? And also any indication on pricing for power, especially ahead of the next forward power auction? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : We have not secured anymore contracts for Alto Maipo at this stage. It\u2019s part of the Gener portfolio. So, they have basically the Gener, it\u2019s highly contracted through 2021, 2023. So we don\u2019t have any immediate issues at Gener. I mean, last year was a record year for Gener, both on earnings and cash flow.  This year is also looking extremely good. So, what we are seeing, again, as re-contracting rates passes that window, what we\u2019ve seen on the \u2013 we have signed some new contracts, especially one of our subsidies of Gener which is Guacolda and these were rates around 70.  But we continue to see sort of a long run price in the sort of mid $60 per megawatt hour and that\u2019s without assuming any sort of rebound in mining activity or more rapid growth of the economy. Chile is growing about 2%, 2.5% and traditionally it\u2019s been growing more sort of at 4%, 5%. So we have a pickup in economic activity. We think these prices could improve further. Angie Storozynski : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Lasan Johong with Auvila Research Consulting. Please go ahead. Lasan Johong : Thank you. I wanted to ask a strategic question in a sense that, what \u2013 is it going to stay 2.5 to 3 gigawatts of new construction projects per year would jump your growth rates from around 10% to 20% a year? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : That will depend a little bit on \u2013 to what extent we have partnerships in those deals. This year, with the acquisition of sPower and some of the new things we\u2019ve commissioned, we\u2019ll be close to that number in terms of new projects and acquisitions. So, but it will depend on how much of those projects we own and whether it\u2019s 50%, whether it\u2019s 80%. We continue to plan to basically include partners on most of our big projects. Lasan Johong : That makes sense and I am moving in. So, in terms of discretionary cash flow, you guys have about $1.4 billion through 2020. And right now, to what - less than over $400 million has been dedicated to new projects. So, if all of that remaining discretionary cash flow to be used for growth projects, is it correct to assume that you can reach that 20% type compound annual growth rate? Thomas O'Flynn: No, that seems awfully high, quite frankly, no. One thing is very important, we will continue to be very disciplined in terms of our capital allocation and we were committed to growing the dividend, reaching investment-grade and continuing to decrease our risk on this portfolio from all factors. So, that seems high. I mean, to get there, I mean if you had some dramatic improvements in some of the economies and commodity prices, perhaps, but we do have significant upside as I mentioned on LNG and which we\u2019ve quantified.  And on energy storage, we are continuing to work on that. We are making good progress and when we feel confident that we can provide some numbers, we will do so. But, again, this is our plan. We will be disciplined and ensure that when we grow, it\u2019s profitable growth. And all of our growth has to come on to our platform really has to \u2013 we have to be able to provide synergies or economies of scale or something like that before we do an acquisition. Lasan Johong : So, just a little clear, the $1.4 billion would not get you to the 20% growth rate? Thomas O'Flynn: Probably, not, I mean, of course it really isn\u2019t our goal. So what\u2019s more important for us is to be disciplined, decrease risk and hit those \u2013 grow our dividend and improve our credit metrics. So, with that in mind, I don\u2019t see it quite frankly. Lasan Johong : Okay, then the flip side of the question is, once you get to a position where you think your risk is lowering off and the debt payments have gotten you to an investment-grade credit metric, what is going to be y our forward-looking strategy from that point on? Is it going to be more constrained on growth? Is it going to be maintaining the ship on course? How would you change that strategy? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Well, when I think of the new strategy that we announced, based on the prior five year strategy, it would be an evolution of it. We think that the key elements are really having platforms, integrating renewable with existing capacity from thermal and hydro. And also being a leader in new technology. So, we are all about three months into the new strategy and we will update you next time. Lasan Johong : Okay, fair enough. Thank you, Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thank you, Lasan. Operator : The next today comes from Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Charles Fishman : Thank you, and good morning. Yes, I had the same question, Greg did about the $100 million. But I can assure you I never would have seen the footnote error on Slide 53. Here is my other question that I got left.  Andres, you talked on Slide 6, Alto Maipo, the problem is the tunnel. And tunnel on these type of projects can be certainly \u2013 you are not the first to experience tunneling challenges. Of the 52% complete right now, what percent of the tunnel is complete? Or is that \u2013 are you talking about the tunnels? Is that the main part of the project or how should we look at that? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : That\u2019s a very perceptive question. It\u2019s 52% complete that includes all of the works and all of the equipment. On that tunneling we are more than a third complete on the tunneling. And basically what happened here is that the rock ended up being a less crusted than all of our projections and that\u2019s what\u2019s really slowed us down, because when you have to do more reinforcements you have to go more slowly and it was a bit surprising, because this is an expansion of an existing facility Alfalfal.  So it\u2019s in the same mountain. It reterminates some of the same water. But that is what it is and as you are right, we are not the first to have encountered a different lock and what was expected once you start tunneling. Charles Fishman : Okay, and then on Slide 6, I assume, that\u2019s a tunnel boring machine we are looking at, is that the machine that\u2019s actually in there now working? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : That\u2019s exactly right. We have three of them in operation now, three TBMs and a fourth one on order that\u2019s coming down. So we will have four TBMs operating on this site Charles Fishman : Okay, so your \u2013 because it sounds like you are accelerating the thing to get it done. Okay, good. That was the only question I had left, Andres. Thank you. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Okay, thank you. Operator : And we have our last question today coming from Gregg Orrill with Barclays. Please go ahead. Gregg Orrill : Yes, thank you. Can you walk through the details around the EBITDA guidance reduction for DP&L? I think it was obviously, you sold some of the generation assets, but it looks like it was down around $60 million from the fourth quarter? Thomas O'Flynn: Yes, so, I think, what you are referring to is about $50 million drop, I mean, part of this is, as you know, Gregg, we have announced the sale of our coal-fired generation that accounts for about $30 million to $40 million.  The total shutdown plus sale and then we also have incorporated updated non-bypassable, which is now $105 million versus what we were expecting, which was slightly higher than that. So net-net, I think that is \u2013 that accounts for most of the change. Gregg Orrill : Okay, thanks. Operator : This concludes our question and answers session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ahmed Pasha for any closing remarks. Ahmed Pasha : Thanks everybody for joining us on today\u2019s call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Thank you and have a nice day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Joining me this morning are Andr\u00e9s Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom O'Flynn, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will now turn the call over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thank you, Ahmed. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our second quarter 2017 financial review call. Today, I will discuss our financial results and provide updates on our projects under construction, capital allocation, and cost savings. These actions are the foundation of our expected 8% to 10% average annual growth in earnings and cash flow. Since our previous call in early May, we have made significant progress on a number of key objectives for 2017. At the same time, we experienced a setback at one of our construction projects Alto Maipo in Chile. I will discuss Alto Maipo in detail in a moment, but first I would like to highlight our accomplishments since the first quarter call. In the second quarter, better availability and lower Parent interest contributed to an $0.08 improvement in our adjusted EPS of $0.25. Based on our year-to-date performance and outlook, we are reaffirming our 2017 guidance and expectations through 2020. We successfully completed the expansion of our DPP gas-fired plant in the Dominican Republic. We secured $2 billion in non-recourse financing on favorable terms and make ground on our 1.4-gigawatt Southland Repowering project in California. With the exception of the 531-megawatt Alto Maipo project, our 4.7 gigawatts under construction are progressing well, and remain on track to be completed through 2020. We closed the acquisition of sPower, the largest independent solar developer in United States, to increase our long-term contracted U.S. dollar-denominated renewable portfolio. To take advantage of our leadership position in energy storage, we announced a 50-50 joint venture with Siemens, to create a global energy storage technology and services company. We are on track to achieve our $400 million per year cost reduction and revenue enhancement program. Not turning to Alto Maipo on slide four. As we've discussed in the past, the project has experienced construction difficulties, resulting in projected cost over and above to 22%. Since our previous call in May, productivity by the construction contractors has been slower than anticipated. And Alto Maipo terminated one of the projects contractors for performance reasons. Nonetheless, construction of the project is continuing and Alto Maipo has been engaged in discussions with potential replacement contractors and the non-recourse lenders to address these challenges. The Alto Maipo project is looking for modified construction contracts and flexibility in financing terms. But it is uncertain efforts will ultimately be successful. Having said that, I would like to emphasize that. First, our total exposure to the project is approximately $415 million. 87% of which has already been invested. Second, as we were for the challenges at Alto Maipo, we will be disciplined when it comes to the valuating any incremental investment from ASN [ph] in Alto Maipo. And third, we do not expect any material impact on our 2017 guidance and expectations through 2020. As we had already substantially reduced our expectations from Alto Maipo, when we provided our long-term outlook in May. The developments at Alto Maipo are obviously very disappointing. As over the past five years, we have completed 6 gigawatts of projects on time and on budget. Turning now to the rest of our construction program, beginning on slide five. We recently completed the 122-megawatt expansion of our DPP gas-fired plant in the Dominican Republic. By closing the cycle DPP now has 358 megawatts of capacity. There will be one of the lowest cross generators in the Dominican Republic. The additional 122 megawatts are contracted under long-term U.S. dollar-denominated PPA. The budget cost of $260 million was a 100% funded through non-recourse set at AES Dominicana. Next, turning to our 671-megawatt Eagle Valley CCGT in Indiana, on slide six. We remain confident there is a project we'll achieve commercial operations in line with our prior expectation of the first half of 2018. The EPC contractor, CBI has created positive momentum by subcontracting some of the critical work and right now there are presently a thousand workers onside. CBI is working to achieve substantial completion by year-end 2017. Now turning to our 1.4-gigawatt Southland Repowering project in California, on slide seven. As you know, the 2.3 billion Southland Repowering project is a key component of our strategic objective to increase our U.S. dollar based long-term contracted position. In June, we issued $2 billion in non-recourse step with the 4.5% yield and the 14-year average life. This financing demonstrates the strength of the project, which has 20 years PPAs with Southern California Edison. The project not only includes the 1.3 gigawatts of gas-fired capacity, but also includes a 100 megawatt of 4-hour duration energy storage. 400 megawatt hours. Making it the largest energy storage facility in the world as well as the largest non-recourse financing ever that includes battery-based energy storage. The Southland CCGT will be constructed by Kiewit under fixed price turnkey EPC contracts. Kiewit is one of North America's largest engineering and construction contractors with the successful track record of completing similar projects in California. We recently broke ground on the project and expect completion in the first half of 2020. Turning to slide eight. As I said earlier, a site from Alto Maipo, we are making good progress across all of our construction projects, including our thermal plant OPGC2 in India and our CCGT and LNG regasification terminal, Col\u00f3n in Panama. These projects will be a key contributor to our earnings and cash flow grow through 2020. Beyond our current construction program, we're primarily focusing our growth investments on natural gas and renewable projects with long-term US dollar-denominated contracts. This will contribute to our growth in our cash flow and earnings, will also reducing our average carbon intensity. To that end over the last few months, we have made significant problems towards re-positioning our portfolio. Specifically, as you can see on slide nine, we completed the acquisition of 1.7 gigawatts, which includes sPower 1.3 gigawatts of solar and wind projects in the United States. We also recently closed on the acquisition of 386 Alto de Sert\u00e3o spinning wind farm in Brazil. This project will help diversify Tiet\u00ea's fuel mix and hydrological risk. With an average remaining contract life of 18 years, the project will also help to reduce future exposure to short-term price movements. These 600 million Real acquisitions, was funded entirely with debt capacity at Tiet\u00ea. With these acquisitions, AES is operating renewable portfolio increases to 9 gigawatts for approximately one-quarter of our durable portfolio. Finally, through our efforts to capitalize on our development pipeline across our portfolio, we expect at least 1.5 gigawatts of solar and wind through 2020. In fact, we have already signed PPAs per 400 megawatts and we're in exclusive negotiations for another gigawatt. We have sufficient internally generated cash to fund our equity contribution for both our projects under construction and the development projects I just discussed. Turning to our energy storage business on slide 10, ten years ago we saw market need and created and deployed the first utility scale lithium iron batter on the grid. Since then we have remained a market leader having 476 megawatts of energy storage deployed or under contract in seven countries. Today, the world-wide install base per energy storage is around 3 gigawatts. But it is projected to grow to 28 gigawatts over the next five years, as energy storage prices decline and the penetration of intermittent renewable increases. To take advantage of our leadership position and this unique market opportunity, in July we're joining forces with Siemens, to create Fluence, a global energy storage technology and services company. The new 50-50 joint venture combines the scale, experience and resources of AES and Siemens and will offer both AES advance and Siemens sea storage battery based energy storage platforms. Fluence will continue to develop new storage solutions and services while leveraging the reach of Siemens global salesforce, which is active in more than 160 countries. The joint venture is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year following regulatory approvals. Finally, turning to slide 11 and our cost savings and revenue enhancement initiative, as you know since 2012, we have achieved an annual run rate savings rate of $215 million. We are on track to achieve $50 million of incremental cost savings in 2017 and our $400 million run rate target by 2020. There are a number of work streams that we've established to capture these savings ranging from asset management to global sourcing to heat rate improvements. We're also continuing to standardizing our processes across all functional areas allowing for organization or consolidation. As a result, this year we're combing our Europe and Asia strategic business units, which will drive significant savings. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom to discuss our second quarter results, capital allocation and guidance in more detail. Thomas O'Flynn: Thanks Andr\u00e9s, and good morning. Today, I will review our second quarter results, capital allocation, and guidance. Overall, we had a strong quarter benefiting from higher availability several of our businesses and lower Parent interest expense. Turning to adjusted EPS on slide 13, second quarter results were $0.25, and $0.08 increase from 2016. Year-to-date, we've achieved 40% of guidance point consistent with our historical pattern. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily driven by higher margins, as availability improved at several of businesses primarily an MCAC in Argentina. They also benefited from paying down approximately 500 million of Parent debt since a year ago. Now to slide 14 and our adjusted PTC and consolidated free cash flow. We earned $243 million in adjusted PTC during the quarter, an increase of $83 million largely driven by higher margins and lower Parent interest. We generated $106 million of consolidated free cash flow, a decrease of $448 million from second quarter of 2016, which was driven by large collections receivables in Europe and Brazil SBUs in 2016. Now I'll cover SBUs in more detail over the next six slides, beginning on slide 15. In the U.S., our results reflect slightly lower margins primarily due to a true-up for deferred fuel cost following the rate case of IPL in 2016, as well as lower regulated ESP rates at DPL. Adjusted PTC increased marginally largely due to growth in our distributed energy business. Lower consolidated free cash flow also reflects the timing of working capital requirements at DPL. At Andes, our results reflect higher margins primarily due to higher availability in Argentina where our CTSN plant completed a major plant outage in the second quarter of last year. Although, margins increased adjusted PTC decreased due to lower capitalized interest related to completed construction projects in Chile and lower interest income in Argentina. In Brazil, our results reflect steady margins with lower cash flow due to the recovery of high purchase power cost in 2016 from prior droughts and our distribution business Eletropaulo. It's worth mentioning on a full-year basis, we continue to expect low hydro conditions in Brazil. But the impact will be much less than prior years due to changes we've made to our hedging strategy. We now have about 80% contracted in 2017, which leaves us well-positioned to absorb hydro shortfalls. In Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, our results reflect higher margins driven primarily by availability in Dominican Republic, Mexico and Puerto Rico. As you may be aware our offtake in Puerto Rico, PREPA recently filed for bankruptcy which result in a technical default of our non-recourse debt. AES Puerto Rico continues to provide the lowest cost generation on the island and accordingly is being fully dispatched and paid. We're working constructively with the lenders and continue to monitor the bankruptcy proceedings closely. In Europe, our results reflect higher capacity margins in United Kingdom. Consolidated free cash flow decreased due to the collection of overdue receivables in 2016 at Maritza in Bulgaria. Finally, in Asia, our results reflect steady margins and slightly high working capital primarily due to the timing of fuel payments at Masinloc in the Philippines. Now to slide 21, an update on our filing at DP&L in Ohio. As you may know, in March, we reached a settlement agreement with Commission's staff and certain interveners in our EFP case. The agreement includes a distribution modernization writer [ph] totaling $105 million per year over three years with a two-year extension option. The ultimate goal is to transform DPL into a stable and growing T&D business. To that end, DPL is selling or exiting all of its 2.1 gigawatts of coal-fired capacity by mid-2018 and is exploring strategic options for the remaining 1 gigawatt of gas-fired peaking capacity. The post-hearing briefing in the EFP case concluded on May 15th and we expect final approval by the Commission this quarter. Ruling consistent with the settlement agreement, we helped DPL continue to reduce leverage and transition to investment grade rating. Now to slide 22, and our improved credit [ph] profile. This year, we have prepaid $300 million of Parent debt targeting some of our highest coupons bonds resulting in an annualized interest rate as $20 million. This brings our total Parent debt to $4.4 billion, which is a $2.1 billion or about a one-third reduction since 2011. Also in the second quarter, we refinanced an additional $500 million Parent debt, which will reduce our interest expense by $15 million per year. Through disciplined debt reduction and strong growth in Parent free cash flow, we expect to attain investment grade credit metrics by 2020. We continue to believe this will help us to not only reduce our cost of debt and improve our financial flexibility, but also enhance our equity valuation. Now to our 2017 Parent capital allocation on slide 23, which is in line with our prior disclosure. Sources on the left-hand side reflects $1.5 billion of total available discretionary cash, which includes about $625 million of Parent free cash flow. As we discussed last quarter, in addition to the $300 million we received from the sale of Sul in Brazil, we continue to target $500 million in asset sale proceeds. We expect to announce by the end of the year, however received a proceed may take a bit longer possibly into early 2018. One of the uses on the right-hand side of the slide, include the dividend increase we announced in December will be returning almost $320 million to shareholders this year. We allocated $340 million to prepay Parent debt, as I just discussed. We've allocated $382 million for our acquisition of sPower and plan to invest $350 million in our subsidiaries, the majority of which is for new projects under construction in late-stage development. After considering these investments in our subs, debt repayment in our current dividend were left with roughly $100 million of discretionary cash in 2017. Now looking to our capital allocation over the next four years on slide 24. Our portfolio will generate $3.8 billion of discretionary cash due 2020, which was largely driven by Parent free cash flow. This internally generate cash is sufficient to fund our dividend and construction projects. We'll also provide a capital to further create shareholder value through dividend growth, reducing leverage and opportunistic investments in our development pipeline including renewable projects, Andr\u00e9s has discussed. Finally, at in slide 25, based on our performance year-to-date in foreign currency, in commodity forward curves as of June 30th, we're reaffirming our 2017 guidance and expectation for 8% to 10% average annual growth due 2020 for our metrics. Overall, we remain confident that we can deliver attractive growth to our shareholders in 2020 and beyond. With that, I'll now turn it back to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thanks, Tom. Before we take your questions, I would like to summarize today's call with the following takeaways. We're encouraged with the performance of our portfolio during the first half of the year. We're exploring all options to address the construction challenges at our Alto Maipo project in Chile. And we are hopeful that we will reach a resolution before your end. To drive our near-term growth, we are on track to complete our remaining projects under construction and our revenue enhancement and cost reduction initiatives. We have made significant progress towards repositioning our portfolio by adding renewables in natural gas with long term, U.S. dollar denominated contracts. We have continued to reduce our leverage to improve our credit profile and achieve investment grade metrics. Accordingly, we are reaffirming our 8% to 10% annual growth through 2020 in all key metrics including free cash flow earnings and dividend. Now, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Ali Agha : Thank you. Good morning. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Good morning, Ali. Ali Agha : Good morning, Andr\u00e9s Gluski and Tom first question, so when we look at the first half results, how does that position you when you look at the range for the year, now that half the year is over, can you give us some more color on how you're trending within that range? Thomas O'Flynn: Well, it's a - most of that is 40% of year-to-date, we tend to be somewhat seasonal towards the second half, so it puts us right within the range and right within our guidance. Ali Agha : Okay. And Andr\u00e9s on the - on Alto Maipo, as you mentioned, expect to have a resolution before year-end, assuming you too decide to walk away from the project and take the write-off as supposed to the risk of further construction delays et cetera, would that in any way impair and Gener ability to dividend cash up to the Parent, if there is a write-off et cetera? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : No, we expect to receive the cash from Gener, I mean there may be somewhat of a difference in terms of dividends versus return of capital. But otherwise, it will not affect our expected cash from Gener. In the short-term it actually provides more cash at Gener, and Gener is doing very well from a cash basis. Ali Agha : And so, I know that the rating agencies had put them on some credit watch et cetera, any rating downgrade et cetera would not impair their ability to dividend cash up. Thomas O'Flynn: Well, it's important that and Gener maintain its investment grade rating. And Gener I would expect AES Gener to take all steps to maintain its investment grade rating. Ali Agha : Okay. And final question, your message is pretty clear, you're executing, you're hitting what the track guidance that you laid out for us. Yet you stock stays caught up in this very narrow range doesn't seem to be reacting to the results that you are posting. Does that cause you to step back and take a more holistic or a bigger picture view on what it will take to get your stock up and especially when you look at that capital allocation pie chart that you've showed us over the next few years. Does that cause you to rethink how you'd like to reinvest some of that unspoken for cash or some other steps that you think are required given that your stock does not seem to be reflecting the results you're posting? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : It's a great question, Ali. Periodically since I became CEO, five years ago, we have used third parties to look at our strategy and look at our execution talking about banks, I am talking about consultants. To look at our strategy, and to look at our execution and see if there is any that we can increase value creation for our shareholders. So, we've continue to do that to have a really so give them card plants and say, okay, this is our portfolio, this is our plan, what we can do better? Now based on that, what we are seeing, if we execute on our plan, we expect our stock to react. And so, we really have to have a development of several quarters of hitting our numbers. Here is hitting our numbers and execute on these projects. Then execute on our cost savings. And if we do that, we think that our stock will react. Now, obviously, we are 70% filled outside of the U.S. 50% approximately in Latin America. And the last five years have - you've seen a secular decline in commodity prices and in Latin America. Now, we are starting to see turnaround in some other countries. I mean Brazil has actually stopped declining in terms of GDP. It's flat and starting to turn up. Argentina is doing much better. And certainly, Argentina is one case where we've seen the country to do significantly better. So, our forecast is based on a continuation of the current situation, but I think if you start seeing a turnaround from some of these countries that would-be upside. Ali Agha : Yes, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Angie Storozynski : Thank you. I have a question about - but first okay. So, you just acquire [indiscernible] can you tell us how it adds to the 8% to 10% earnings growth? And basically, just give us a sense of what are the biggest drivers behind the earnings growth for the 2020? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Sure, Angie. I think for sPower as you know has a pipeline of around 10 gigawatts. But as you saw in what we were forecasting we have about less than 2 gigawatts over the next three years of growth coming from renewables and a good part of that is sPower. So, sPower has a number of facilities currently under PPA to be built. And it also is an exclusive negotiation for quite a lot of gigawatts well. So, that's one way we see it. We also see that it gives us a scale to be more competitive on renewables especially solar around the world. So, giving us to that scale to buy panels and balance of plan as cheaply as possible, improve our designs and then the same thing with wind. So, if you see what we've done lately, I mean we have quite a lot of renewable not only in the states, we have it on our platform whether it'd be Jaite [ph]. We have another project in Mexico which are both over 300 megawatts. And I would say that outside of the U.S., the returns tend to be higher, especially when we use our platform especially when we are financing it locally. So, all these platforms expansions we are looking at mid to higher-teens returns and we're looking at sort of low double-digits in the states for return. So, this is how they contribute them. I don't know if Tom, you'd like to add something. Thomas O'Flynn: No, I think that covers at it mean. Angie, we showed some of the growth on page nine, I think those are relatively conservative because our focus on signed PPA and things with exclusive negotiations obviously we - the teams are focusing on bigger things, I think it's consistent from sPower perspective, it's consistent of what we said, we expect them to do about 500 megawatts a year of new projects probably three to four to start and six to seven of as you look over four to five-year period. So, slide nine would be generally consistent. And then also be generally consistent with our growth is driven by new projects, by continued cost management and few capital allocation and investments and things like sPower. Angie Storozynski : Okay. With the assets that have already PPAs have you procured or has the company procured panels so that you don't have an issue with any pair of changes for imported panels? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes, we have procured the panels, we have secured the panels for everything we have under PPA. Now of course you know in terms of the projects and advanced negotiation, we will match up the purchase of the panels with having the contract, we don't want to be long or short panels. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And for Alto Maipo, you keep showing that you've largely paid your equity investment into the project, but is this a signal that there is basically no scenario under which you're going to increase the equity commitment to the projects? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Well, this really would be a decision at AES Gener and it would be strictly again AES Gener not an AES contribution. But it would have to be part of a complete solution, which includes greater financial flexibility and a modification of the contracts we have where the contractors are say stick to the milestones and stick to the progress that we expect from them. So, these are the two changes that we have to occur. Now having said this, if Alto Maipo is completed, will give AES Gener 750 megawatts of hydro next is country's load in Santiago and it's an asset that will last 100 years so we're evaluating the possibilities and we're trying to get everybody lined up and so as I said, we will have ourselves and AES Gener have indicated we will have a lot of discipline when it comes to any additional money, in addition to what's been committed. Angie Storozynski : Okay. Thank you. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thank you, Angie. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Stephen Byrd : Hi. Good morning. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Morning, Steve. Stephen Byrd : Just two quick follow-ups on Alto Maipo briefly, just so I understand. If you were able to have construction contractors in place that we're able to firmly commit to the existing timeline etcetera with this higher budget is that sufficient to make an economic to complete the project or do you need essentially further concessions of some sort to make the project worthwhile complete? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : If I understand your question correctly if the contractors comply with the restructuring that we did earlier this year, that would be sufficient to me that we have sufficient funds to meet that plus have some contingency. So, yes that would adequate. What concerned us is we had to terminate one contractor it's the smaller of the two contractors but we really have to have a performance that's in line with what they had committed to. Stephen Byrd : Understood. Andr\u00e9s, so essentially either the current contractor could assume that obligation or you could bring in another party but you would need that commitment in order to able to move forward. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : That's correct. We have to have modification construction contracts to make sure that they're delivering and don't miss the milestones in the targets. Stephen Byrd : Okay, understood. Just shifting to the U.S. in terms of the remaining generation assets to be disposed of, is there a potential for significant tax loss that could be beneficial in the event of a disposition whether it's pull for cash or some of the assets are simply shutdown? Thomas O'Flynn: Stephen, its Tom. There may be, remember we already have a large NOL, so anything that we had would really add to that NOL, but our NOL is over $3.5 billion at year end so\u2026 Stephen Byrd : Just be additive to that yes\u2026 Thomas O'Flynn: Yeah, I don't know the details of the closure of the coal plants. But it would be longer term NOL benefit. Stephen Byrd : Okay, understood. And then just lastly on your storage joint venture very interesting development, assuming the business is successful on a joint venture basis. How generally would that impact your financials overtime? Would there be like I'm thinking about working capital contributions profits from project sales versus ongoing contracts in which you receive revenues? How, just sort a high level with this potentially impact your bottom-line knowing that it's early day still? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Sure. As I said, this is a market that is expected to grow almost by a factor of 10 in over five years. So, obviously it's going to grow very quickly and that's going to require funds at the JV. So, we expect - we don't expect as significant contributions from the JV for two years, it might be a modest drag, very slight. And then afterwards, we would expect it to use that funds to continue to grow slightly. So, it'd be some time before we get cash back from the JV, if it successful and growing very quickly. But we would expect to use as non-consolidated subsidiary to have the earnings from that two years of going forward. So, this is I think very promising. It certainly a unique JV, because nobody has our experience, 19-year platform which has been used for 10 years and Siemens is globally reach. And one thing to understand is Siemens has also contributing their energy storage solution which consist storage, which is more sort of C&I, just smaller. So, the two are complementary, so this will allow us to have the full gambit. So basically, what we have in our guidance right now is very conservative, so JV does very well, there will be upside. But I would expect it to take two years to really start materializing, but we think this is very promising. Now, we will also have energy storage of our own on our platform and we will be a client affluent for our own projects. For example, such as Southland. Stephen Byrd : Understood. And Andr\u00e9s, just in terms of the types of margin you would get from this joint venture, could it be servicing margin what more likely to be essentially product sales margins? What kind of margin generally should we expect there? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : It will be a combination of both. So, obviously Siemens has a lot of experience on this. So, there will be a margin on the sale and then there will be a margin on services. And obviously you try to have a balanced. Again, there is a lot of interesting possibilities here, as you know there is Siemens has a financing hour to make this. So, we'll have to see how the market develops and what are the different options. So, we have a great team I think there is tremendous energies between the two and stay tune. Stephen Byrd : Excellent. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Lasan Johong with Auvila Research. Please go ahead. Lasan Johong : Thank you. So, going back Alto Maipo very quickly I have a couple of follow-up questions. Does the new investment increase AES ownership we have in Jan, and with all 40% now it 62% really grown up until if you make an additional investment? Thomas O'Flynn: Let see, we owned 67% of AES Gener. AES Gener to cover for a nominal's amount of the 40% that our share our partner had - our local partner had in Alto Maipo. So, now we have about a 93% share. So, it will depend on how the negotiations go, because the contract has 7%. So, as part of the solution, they could take a greater stake. So, I don't see anything meaningful happening to the sort of 62% like we one or two up but or down. So, we'll have to see but now it's not going to go up materially. Lasan Johong : And if any [indiscernible] I know just start beside to answer more important continue to invest, you need to modify your long-term interim contract, offtake contract? Thomas O'Flynn: No. Lasan Johong : Okay. So, how do you preserve your ROE or ROI results? Thomas O'Flynn: I'm sorry, the question is how do we preserve the ROE on Alto Maipo or overall on our... Lasan Johong : Alto Maipo is you are investing more money, but you're not... Thomas O'Flynn: That's fair. Obviously, Alto Maipo will not fulfill ROE expectations. We have been reducing them overtime. The decision what we made on the basis of marginal returns from marginal investments. Lasan Johong : Okay. Also, just on Fluence, is one of the objective to research of funding and research and energy storage or Fluence experimentation. Thomas O'Flynn: Well, Fluence is a commercial operation. We've always seen our energy storage is a business and a need to make profit for it. Now, Fluence will continue to upgrade the design, look at ways stripping out the cause, looking at new applications. I mean, one of the things we've only - I'd say there's a lot more applications for energy storage that have been deployed to date. So those are all those things that Fluence will do. So, there will be some design and some creations of innovation at Fluence. But it's not just a sort of or indeed for its own sake. It's exceptionally commercial orientation. Lasan Johong : Yeah. I'm just wondering if you'll going to be R&D component. One last question from long-term perspective, 8% to 10% growth there are some utility in U.S. that are doing that kind of rate risk? What can AES do to boost that 8% to 10% growth rate going forward. Thomas O'Flynn: I think again we're paying a 4% dividend and we're looking at 8% to 10% growth, that puts sort of 12% to 14% range. And we think we have upside from things like a recovery in the secular sort of cycle that we've seen in the countries - some of the countries where we operate and there have always been cycles in the last five years it's basically even in one direction, it's been down. Lasan Johong : Yeah. Thomas O'Flynn: The growth has been down in all these countries. We have things like Fluence, which would be upside. And the other thing to mention, if you compare us to U.S utilities is that I say two things, one, we're trading at a much lower PE, so as we improve our credit we would expect to have an uptick on our TE, same thing, if we deliver on our results. And the other thing, is we are in markets which are growing. Because it's in the states, we're doing what everybody is doing in terms of switching to gas, doing renewables. We have the upside of seeing with sPower and how can we incorporate more energy storage on to that base, but it's very - it's nice to be in countries where demand is growing anywhere from 5% to 10%. So again, we tend to be conservative on our estimates. We're using forward curves. And at some point, we think the cycles beginning to turn around. Lasan Johong : Excellent. Thanks very much. Thomas O'Flynn: Thanks, Lasan. Operator : Our next question today comes from Chris Turnure with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Chris Turnure : Good morning. You've touched on this a little bit, and definitely touched on in the press release and the announcement of Alto Maipo from a couple of weeks ago. But how can we think about the kind of exact contribution that's in your guidance right now through 2020 from that project? You have a substantial amount of growth over the next couple of year according my calculations that project could have released initially been a major contributor to that growth rate. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : On the numbers we're providing, it's absolutely minimal and significant through 2020. Chris Turnure : Okay. So, when you say minimal, should we think about that as you pushing out an online date passed 2020 or into the middle of 2020 or just substantially lowering the returns from a fully operational project? Thomas O'Flynn: Yes. I would say when we looked at it put our guidance in February through 2020 we had dialed it back considerably. It had some modest contributions quite modest in 2019 and 2020. So, within our guidance range here, it was very modest. Obviously, if we extend it goes forward, it could have more meaningful, but as Andr\u00e9s said. It's certainly much lower ROE, IRRs than we initially envisioned three years ago, when we went with the project. Chris Turnure : Okay. That's great to hear. And then, also obviously your long-term guidance is still marked off of I think December 31st ForEx curves and things have gone very much in your favor since that time and you've announced and closed the sPower acquisition should we think about there being kind of other tailwinds to that growth rates versus your original expectations as well totally separate from Alto Maipo? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : So, there is various puts and takes our reaffirmation guidance today is based on four curves as of June 30th. We've done a lot of effort to reduce some of the evolve in foreign currencies we're now 80% U.S. dollar so to the extent there's any uplift that less than it has been also have hedges in place for on a rolling one to three-year basis depending upon where we are so net-net we're looking at forward curves as of June 30th. Chris Turnure : Okay. And then lastly, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that there's still $500 million placeholder of asset of sales this year it might spill in terms of closure into early next year, can you kind of remind us of maybe strategically where you are in the process of divesting non-strategic assets, how far or long you are there and I don't know if the decision to, I guess merge the Asia and European business units kind of speaks to that directional a little bit as well? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Sure. This is Andr\u00e9s. As we said, we'll continue to sell assets and churn that capital. As you know this year we're likely to leave Kazakhstan being one less country. We have a number of sales going on some are for the whole asset and some are partial sell downs. So, we will let you know when these occur, we don't like to let them know ahead of time because we can have operations impacts. Thinking about our portfolio what we've always said is that we've gone from 30 countries. We'll be down to 16 by the year end anywhere between 12 and 15 is the right number. I think what's most important for us is that we really have platforms from which we can expand that their true synergies and economies of scale and rather than just a number of countries so we have two adjacent countries and the market's being integrated say something like Central America it's placed where it's in the number of countries than really what does it take to manage these assets well. So, we really look at those situations where we can add more value, we're more likely to sell down and we don't see expansion opportunities for sell down where we don't see synergies to sell down. So, as I think we said in the past to give the numbers of $200 million to $300 million ongoing - we'll continue to do this and to perfect our portfolio so as we've said we've been moving much more into dollar denominated contracts. We have a big expansion of gas whether it be Southland, whether it be Eagle Valley, whether Colon in Panama and also obviously renewables and our vision is how do you integrate all of these renewables plus the thermal or conventional energy to provide more attractive and competitive solutions for our clients. Chris Turnure : Okay, great. Thanks, Andr\u00e9s. Operator : Our next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Greg Gordon : Hey good morning. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Good morning, Greg. Greg Gordon : One just quick question on the slide, so looking at the first quarter slides the second quarter slides your commuted investments in some senior region has gone up from 425 to 700 and that came out of an allocated discretionary cash I'm presuming that that's capital commitments to the renewables business? Thomas O'Flynn: Yeah, Greg, its Tom. We incorporated Southland. Greg Gordon : Right that's right. Thomas O'Flynn: Because we're fairly literal with our commitment so we certainly vision that we enclose the financing is a firm commitment so that's we got... Greg Gordon : Okay. So, it's Southland it's not\u2026 Thomas O'Flynn: Yeah. Greg Gordon : Okay. Thank you. Thomas O'Flynn: Right. And back to the Southland financing is going to be pretty close to COD late 1920. Greg Gordon : Got you. Okay, great. It's a merger sort of strategic question, do you guys see your renewables development flat form and your sort of renewables footprint for sort of being strategically complete? Or if there is an opportunity to do another big step out into renewables platform in the U.S. would you participate in that sort of looking at that opportunity, because it looks like there is a lot of portfolios for sale. There are - there is at least one growth type format, now that you said that they are looking to sell it partially or completely? Thomas O'Flynn: What I would say Greg, we've made a big step-up, we have a good growth platform, not to say that we wouldn't opportunistic with some purchase that would add-on, but it would really, I have to provide operating synergies and other things. So, we're position with sufficient scale, especially when you think of us on a global basis. So, we certainly don't have to make any acquisitions at this time. And of course, we'll continue to be very disciplined, so I think it was very important to establish a beachhead which then allowed us to move to the direction of the market growing, but we certainly don't have to make any sort of follow-up if there were some assets that were adjacent to or provided synergies or gave us a bigger footprint with a particular client, we would look at those. Greg Gordon : Okay. But there is not just asset for sale, I mean, let's be frank I mean NRG yield is for sale. And they're not just selling assets, they are looking the sale potentially the entire platform including their wind development business, their backlog of undeveloped projects, so theoretically that can really push your business mix into a whole different realm of tilting away from coal I mean in to renewables which is what you're trying to achieve here in first place, so I don't know how much you can comment on whether a strategic deal like that what you can be remotely in the ballpark of opportunity for you? Thomas O'Flynn: Well, that's certainly is not high on our list. And what I can say we are on a gradual transition, our coal plants are under contract. Those which are merchant which will be the disposing of over the next couple of years, so we're making that big transaction, we have - between those dispositions in the U.S. but we've done in Kazakhstan in some other places, we've already reduced our coal fleet by a quarter in just a last couple of years. Greg Gordon : Okay, thank you. Take care. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steve Fleishman : Thank you. One clarification question on the - I guess it's for Tom on the long, I thought on the long-term guidance you don't update to the current June 30, marks, it's goes back to December. So just on the long-term guidance roughly the team currencies are [indiscernible] better commodities maybe worse, but just generally, if you did update would you still be in the rough ballparks of your growth rate? Thomas O'Flynn: Yeah. I think Steve, bottom-line we would. I mean it's various puts and takes. Currencies have been help some commodity offsets if you said so, I mean we're kind of bundle them altogether and do a check at June 30, 2017. Steve Fleishman : I see, okay. Thomas O'Flynn: Yeah. Steve Fleishman : Got it. Okay and then on the - in terms of the growth rate sPower renewables generally I think you mentioned 400 megawatts to PPAs already for 2020, is that correct? Thomas O'Flynn: Yes. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yeah, yeah, that's correct. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And is that, can you give us a breakout of that a little or at least kind of regionally U.S. versus non-U.S.? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : That's basically U.S. Steve Fleishman : That's all U.S. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yeah. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And then just in terms of funding the growth of sPower, your plan is to basically would be able to fund that through internal year equity investment through internal cash? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Okay you don't - you're not looking to find other funding vehicles for that? No. Okay. Thank you. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : To the - sorry. Keep in mind about 80% of the capital is funded through non-recourse debt and equity, it would expect to fund but to the extent there is other sources of funding that could hands returns we'll certainly keep our eyes open. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Thank you. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Our next question is from Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Charles Fishman : Good morning. Alto Maipo, Andr\u00e9s is that still a tunneling issue. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes, Alto Maipo, yes, we've done about 40% of the tunneling new project, if you take everything else civil works is more like at 53%, 54% completed. So, the main issue is the progress rates on the tunnels. Now, since one of the contractors left, we've had actual manufacturer working on the TBM internal boring machine, making better progress than they had. So, the issues really one of our tunneling rates and costs. Charles Fishman : Okay. And then just a second question, the fact that you're combining Europe and Asia, that sort of sand and signal committed the development pipeline as probably not as strong or you're making that decision cannot go as hard in the development knows countries. Is that a correct assessment on my part or am I reading or do you have anything else stay out at about why you're doing now? Thomas O'Flynn: Well, I think it's a correct assess we're focusing more on certain markets, suddenly where we have the bigger footprint. So, sort of Eurasia Group, there is certainly some opportunities in northern island where we are looking at things in Vietnam, quite attractive and potentially some add-ons in India. We're doing our energy, the first grid scale energy storage project in India together with Tata Group. So, those are the three where we have the sort of some development activity going on in other countries we do not have any activity going on. But this is the result, we were leaving Kazakhstan as we've said and we've gotten out of number of countries as most of the countries that we've gotten out of actually we're in the Eurasia region. So, we will be making significant synergies. The headquarters will be in Amsterdam, which is better than from the States, you only have sort of six given our time difference with the region and its much closer from flights. Charles Fishman : Okay, that's all I had. Thank you. Thomas O'Flynn: Thanks, Charles. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ahmed Pasha for any closing remarks. Ahmed Pasha : Thanks everybody for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be happy to answer any question that you may have. Thank you and have a nice day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Ahmed Pasha, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Pasha, the floor is yours, sir. Ahmed Pasha : Thank you, Mike. Good morning, and welcome to AES\u2019 third quarter 2017 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning are Andr\u00e9s Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom O\u2019Flynn, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will now turn the call over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Well, good morning, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2017 financial review call. Today, Tom and I will discuss our results for the quarter and year-to-date as well as our progress on our strategic and financial goals. We are reaffirming our prior guidance for 2017 and our expectations through 2020. During the third quarter, we made significant progress on our construction projects and the integration of our renewable acquisitions. This morning, I will provide some color on the returns we expect to realize from these investments. I will also discuss our plans to accelerate and expand our asset sales program and cost-cutting and revenue-enhancement initiatives. Before turning to these areas, I\u2019ll first discuss the impact of the recent hurricanes on our businesses in the Caribbean. Our sympathies are with the people of Puerto Rico, many of whom are still without power and water. Our number one priority before, during and after the recent hurricane was the safety of our people and their families and impacted communities. Fortunately, our people and their families are safe, and our two plants in Puerto Rico sustained only minor damage. Both plants are currently available to meet their obligations under their PPAs. We expect the local transmission system to be energized and ready to take our much-needed power by the end of November. Tom will discuss the effects of the hurricanes in our financial results for the third quarter in more detail. Today, we\u2019re announcing that we will be significantly upsizing our asset sales program. We now expect to realize $2 billion in proceeds during the 2018 to 2020 period. Approximately $1 billion of this is expected to occur by year-end 2018, including the sale of Masinloc, our coal plant in the Philippines. Interest remains very strong, and we expect to sign this sales agreement before year end and receive the proceeds early next year. We\u2019re also announcing that we are aggressively pursuing significant additional cost savings. These G&A and O&M savings are likely to be earnings neutral in 2018 due to onetime restructuring costs, but accretive to 2019 and beyond. We will provide more detail on our fourth quarter call. Turning to Slide 4 and our construction program, which is the key driver of our growth. Milestones were being met across our 5 gigawatts of projects under construction, including Alto Maipo in Chile. Although the Alto Maipo project has experienced construction delays and cost overruns, it is making progress towards overcoming these challenges. First, the smaller of the two main contractors, CNM, was terminated. The Tunnel Boring Machine they had been operating is now being operated by Robbins, its manufacturer. They\u2019re progressing at a multiple of the historical rates achieved by CNM, and the Alto Maipo project is now 58% complete. Second, Alto Maipo is in negotiations with various contractors for a fixed price, lump sum EPC contract. The new EPC contract would include substantial capital and performance commitments from the contractor, incentivizing timely completion. The restructuring would also require additional concessions from the project lenders and meaningful contributions from AES Gener, which would be tied to construction milestones. The objective is to significantly reduce execution risks and preserve the value of Alto Maipo while, at the same time, remaining disciplined with additional equity from AES Gener. We will provide you with updates as Alto Maipo continues to make progress on these negotiations. Turning now to the rest of our construction program, beginning on Slide 5. Our 671-megawatt Eagle Valley CCGT in Indiana is on track to achieve commercial operations in the first half of 2018. Construction is 99% complete, and the project is now in the commissioning phase. In fact, this past weekend, the project achieved a major milestone with the first fire of the turbine. The unit was synchronized to the grid and produced its first electricity. Now turning to our 1.3 gigawatt Southland CCGT project on Slide 6, which is a repowering of our existing gas generation facilities in Southern California. Construction is ongoing, and the project is on track to be operational by the first half of 2020. Our remaining construction projects are proceeding as planned, including our thermal plant, OPGC 2 in India; and our CCGT and LNG regasification terminal, Col\u00f3n, in Panama. These projects will be key contributors to our earnings and cash flow growth through 2020. Turning to Slide 7. We have been reshaping our portfolio to reduce our carbon intensity and deliver attractive returns to our shareholders. To that end, our growth initiatives beyond the projects under construction have been focused on investments in natural gas and renewable projects with long-term U.S. dollar-denominated contracts in our existing markets. On a portfolio basis, these investments are expected to produce average returns in the low teens. These compelling returns are driven by several factors, including investing in markets with lower renewable penetration and faster growth rates than the U.S.; using local debt capacity in the businesses to fund the investments; and using our business platforms and global scale to lower costs. Our project returns also benefit from bringing in partners to reduce our equity commitments while providing management and development fees. I\u2019ll walk through some specific examples of how we have boosted returns on some of our recent investments, beginning on Slide 8. In July, we closed on our acquisition of sPower with the Alberta pension fund, AIMCo. We are encouraged by the quality of sPower\u2019s people, operating assets and development pipeline. In fact, we are well positioned to capitalize on sPower\u2019s 10-gigawatt-plus development pipeline by closing on at least 500 megawatts of solar projects annually in the U.S. Additionally, we have received a number of inbound indications of interest to partner on a portion of sPower\u2019s operating assets. We\u2019re evaluating these proposals, which would increase our overall returns and allow us to redeploy the capital into sPower\u2019s attractive growth pipeline. Turning to Slide 9. In Brazil, during the quarter, Tiet\u00ea moved forward on three growth transactions. Tiet\u00ea closed the acquisition of the 386-megawatt Alto Sert\u00e3o wind plant, finalized the acquisition of the 75-megawatt Boa Hora solar project and signed an agreement to acquire the 150-megawatt Bauru solar complex. The wind plant is currently operating with an 18-year contract, and all solar projects are expected to be operational in 2018 with 20-year regulated contracts. The BRL1.6 billion of capital needed to fund these 611 megawatts of renewable expansions in Brazil has been secured by tapping into the available debt capacity at Tiet\u00ea without any equity. Returns on these long-term contracted assets are in the mid-teens in U.S. dollar terms. Finally, turning to Slide 10. In Mexico, we\u2019re also seeing attractive returns for our development projects. With our partner, Grupo Bal, one of the largest business groups in Mexico, we have developed a strong 2.5-gigawatt pipeline of renewable and natural gas projects. We are targeting long-term bilateral contracts with creditworthy, large industrial off-takers. For example, we recently signed an agreement to acquire the 306 Mesa La Paz wind development project, which has a 25-year U.S. dollar-denominated PPA. The project site also has sufficient additional land to accommodate up to 200 megawatts of solar, which could be an attractive upside in the future. We expect to reach financial close early next year and begin construction of Mesa La Paz shortly thereafter. In summary, as you can see on Slide 11, we will be adding 8.4 gigawatts of new capacity by 2020. This includes almost 7 gigawatts of projects under construction or recently acquired. The remaining 1.5 gigawatts represent projects in advanced-stage development. As a result of these additions, our average remaining contract term will increase from 6 years currently to 10 years by 2020. We have sufficient internally generated cash to fund our equity contributions for both our projects under construction and the development projects I just discussed. The projects we have under construction and the more recent investments we have made are helping us to significantly reshape our portfolio to achieve our financial objectives. At the same time, we're reducing our carbon intensity and deploying tomorrow's technologies. As you can see on Slide 12, by the end of 2020, our coal generation will decline from 41% to 33%, while renewables and cash generation will increase from 55% to 63%. We've also been driving the adoption of energy storage in our markets as shown on Slide 13. We are a global leader in the industry with presence in seven markets, including 228 megawatts in operation and another 250 megawatts under contract or construction. In the Dominican Republic, we recently completed 20 megawatts of new energy storage. In September, these facilities performed flawlessly, working twice as much as normal to ensure the electric grid stayed online during Hurricanes Irma and Maria. We believe the integration of energy storage and renewables is key to accelerating a cleaner energy future. This is one of the most promising opportunities in our industry, and our businesses are leading the way. For example, in Hawaii, we're helping the island of Kauai reduce their reliance on diesel generators by delivering a 28-megawatt solar farm and a 20-megawatt, five-hour duration energy storage. Integrating energy storage to enhance the output of solar and wind facilities is a key focus area for Fluence, our new energy storage joint venture with Siemens. The Fluence JV received anti-trust approval from the European Commission in October and is expected to close by the end of this year. Once closed, we expect Fluence to deliver energy storage solution and services to a broader group of customers, from commercial and industrial companies to utilities and power developers in 160 countries. Together with Siemens, our goal is for Fluence to be the market leader in this high-growth segment that is expected to grow tenfold in five years, reaching at least 28 gigawatts of installed capacity by 2022. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom to discuss our third quarter results, capital allocation and guidance in more detail. Tom O'Flynn: Thanks, Andr\u00e9s. Good morning. Today, I'll review our third quarter results, capital allocation and guidance. Overall, our results were lower than the prior year for the quarter largely due to a higher intra-year tax rate and the impact of recent hurricanes. However, based on our year-to-date performance and outlook, we remain on track to deliver on our 2017 guidance and expectations through 2020. Before moving on, I want to provide a brief update on the hurricanes on Slide 16. As we disclosed in October, the estimated impact from hurricanes in 2017 is $0.03 to $0.05 a share. We recognized $0.02 in the third quarter, mostly related to reserves taken at our corporate captive insurance business for estimated property damage in our solar plants in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. To a lesser degree, it also reflects a loss of operations at our thermal plant in Puerto Rico, which was down for 11 days in September. Our business in the Dominican Republic was not affected. Since mid-October, the Puerto Rico plant has been available to meet its obligations under its Power Purchase Agreement. The plant can resume delivering much-needed energy to the grid as soon as the local transmission lines are repaired. On that front, we're pleased with the resources and attention federal and local officials are allocating to restore the power grid, which is a top priority. Repair work is underway, and we're seeing real progress. Momentum should continue to build as EEI in various U.S. utilities have begun to assist in PREPA's restoration efforts. We expect the majority of the grid to be operational by the end of the year. When the plant is reconnected to the grid, we expect it to be dispatched since it's the lowest cost producer of energy, highly reliable and its location is critical to maintaining grid stability. Now turning to adjusted EPS on Slide 17. Third quarter results were $0.24, an $0.08 decrease from 2016. For the year-to-date, adjusted EPS was $0.66, $0.02 higher than 2016. The quarterly results reflect a $0.05 impact due to a higher quarterly tax rate of 35% versus 23% the prior year. We expect a lower rate in the fourth quarter, bringing our average annual rate in its expected 31% to 33% range. Third quarter also reflects the $0.02 hurricane impact and lower margin at Andes, offset by positive results in the remaining SBUs. Now to Slide 18 and our adjusted PTC and consolidated free cash flow. We earned $245 million in adjusted PTC in the quarter, a decrease of $27 million, due in part by the impact of the hurricanes. We generated $601 million of consolidated free cash flow, a decrease of $64 million from third quarter 2016, as higher working capital requirements in Brazil, U.S. and MCAC offset higher consolidated margins. Now I'll cover our SBUs in more detail in the next six slides, beginning on 19. The U.S. margins were down slightly, largely due to moderate weather at IPL. Adjusted PTC increased primarily due to equity earnings from sPower, following the acquisition in July. Lower consolidated free cash flow also reflects higher working capital requirements at DPL and IPL. In Andes, our results reflect lower margins primarily due to planned major maintenance and the impact of green taxes at AES Gener in Chile. This decline was partially offset by positive contributions from Cochrane Unit 2, which achieved commercial operations in October 2016. Adjusted PTC was also impacted by modest write-offs in Argentina and Chile. In Brazil, margins increased due to lower fixed costs, higher tariffs and the recovery of prior tax payments at our distribution business, Eletropaulo. The increase in consolidated free cash flow reflects higher margins, partially offset by higher working capital requirements in Eletropaulo due to recovery of high purchase power costs in 2016 from prior droughts. Before continuing with the quarterly results, I'll provide an update on our efforts to simplify Eletropaulo's ownership structure. As you may know, we own only 17% of this business. However, we are the controlling shareholder and, therefore, consolidate the full financials. We've now received all third-party approvals to migrate to Novo Mercado on the Brazilian stock exchange. As a result, we will no longer have a controlling interest and expect to deconsolidate the business in the fourth quarter. This will simplify our financial statements and also provide greater flexibility. In Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, our results reflect higher margins driven primarily by higher availability and higher contracted sales in the Dominican Republic, following the completion of the DPP project this year. Hurricanes were not a major driver for the quarter in MCAC as most of the $0.02 impact I mentioned earlier was incurred in our captive insurance business at corp. Consolidated free cash flow is flat as higher margins were offset by the timing impact of lower collections in the Dominican Republic. That said, outstanding receivables were settled in full in October. Finally, in Eurasia, our results were largely driven by higher energy and capacity margins at Ballylumford in the UK. Now on Slide 24 and the resolution of our filing at DP&L in Ohio. As you may know, on October 20, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio ruled at our ESP case. The order was consistent with the March Stipulation agreement with only minor modifications. As expected, the ESP includes a Distribution Modernization Rider totaling $105 million per year over three years with a two-year extension option. As previously announced, DPL is selling or exiting all of its 2.1 gigawatts of coal-fired capacity by mid-2018. DPL is also running sales process for the remaining one gigawatt of gas-fired peaking capacity and expects to announce the transaction by year end, with closing expected in the first half of 2018. The commission's ruling in the exit of merchant generation are important steps that will enable DPL to transition to an investment-grade growing T&D business. In fact, you see significant potential to increase the regulated asset base through distribution infrastructure, smart grid and other grid modernization investments. We're pleased to see that these actions are being appreciated by the rating agencies, including a 2-notch upgrade of the DPL family to BB from Fitch earlier this week. Now to Slide 25 and our improving credit profile. This year, we\u2019ve prepaid $300 million of parent debt and refinanced another $1 billion with long-term debt at attractive rates, resulting in annualized interest savings of $40 million. Excluding drawings on our revolver, this brings our total parent debt to $4.5 billion. This represents a $2.1 billion or about a one-third reduction in parent debt since 2011. Through disciplined debt reduction and strong growth in parent free cash flow, we expect to attain investment-grade credit metrics by 2020. We believe this will help us to not only reduce our cost of debt and improve financial flexibility but also enhance our equity valuation. Now to our 2017 parent capital allocation on Slide 26. Sources on the left-hand side reflect $1.4 billion of total available discretionary cash, including parent free cash flow. We expect to be comfortably in the middle of our range of $575 million to $675 million. In addition to the $300 million we received from the sale of Sul in Brazil, we have closed another $80 million of sales, including $60 million from the sell-down of our business in the Dominican Republic. In September, one of our existing partners acquired an additional 5% of the business, implying a total equity value of $1.25 billion. Total asset sale proceeds for the year are about $400 million left than we had shown previously due to a timing difference as we expect to receive those proceeds in early 2018. We plan to use our revolver to fund the temporary shortfall and repay the drawings in early 2018. Moving to uses on the right-hand side. Including the dividend increase we announced last December, we\u2019ll be returning almost $320 million to shareholders this year. We used $340 million to prepay and refinance parent debt, as I just discussed. Finally, we used $382 million for our acquisition of sPower and plan to invest $350 million in our subsidiaries, the majority of which is for new projects under construction and a late-stage development. Now looking at our capital allocation from 2018 through 2020 on Slide 27. We expect our portfolio to generate $3.3 billion of discretionary cash, which includes parent free cash flow and asset sale proceeds. We have conservatively included half of our $2 billion asset sale target, reflecting the transactions we expect to close in 2018. In terms of uses, after funding our dividend and construction projects, we have $1.6 billion of capital to create additional shareholder value. Of this, we\u2019d expect to allocate about 40% to 45% to dividend growth and debt reduction and the remaining amount to invest in attractive growth opportunities. Finally, turning to Slide 28. We are reaffirming our prior 2017 guidance and expectation for an 8% to 10% average annual growth through 2020 for all metrics. As you know, we pointed to the lower half of our guidance range for adjusted EPS in October, following the hurricanes. We still expect a higher rate of EPS growth in 2018 in the low to mid-teens, off the midpoint of our 2017 guidance. This will be largely driven by contributions from new projects, cost-savings and revenue-enhancement initiatives in lower parent interest. To give a little bit more color by SBU, we expect growth in the U.S. to be driven largely by positive regulatory developments at DPL as well as growth in renewables. Andes will benefit from continued market reforms in Argentina, higher contracting levels at Angamos and higher generation in Colombia. Growth in MCAC is expected to be driven largely by completed construction projects, including a full year of operations to the DPP combined cycle in the Dominican Republic as well as a partial-year impact from the commencement of operations at the Col\u00f3n CCGT in Panama. Growth will be partially offset by business exits in the Philippines and Kazakhstan. Finally, we expect a benefit from our cost savings and revenue-enhancement initiatives as well as lower parent interest. Consistent with our prior practice, we\u2019ll be providing more detail and specific guidance for 2018 on our year-end call in February. With that, I\u2019ll now turn it back to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thanks, Tom. In summary, we\u2019re taking a lot of actions at AES to deliver on our strategy and commitments to shareholders. Our sector is undergoing significant change, and we\u2019re undertaking a further transformation of our business to take advantage of new opportunities. Specifically, we\u2019re accelerating and increasing our asset sales program to achieve $1 billion in proceeds by end 2018 and a total of $2 billion by 2020. We\u2019re on track to achieve our target $400 million in annual cost savings and revenue enhancements, and we\u2019re aggressively pursuing additional savings that we will announce on our fourth quarter call. We\u2019re advancing on our 5 gigawatts of construction projects and are aiming to resolve the issues at Alto Maipo in the first quarter of 2018. We are pleased with our acquisition of sPower and see many attractive renewable opportunities across our portfolio. We expect Fluence to close this year, and our goal is to maintain our global leadership in a market that is projected to grow tenfold over the next five years. These actions will result in a simpler portfolio, earning higher risk-adjusted returns and a stronger balance sheet with improved credit metrics. Our overriding objective is to generate 8% to 10% average annual growth in earnings and free cash flow. When combined with our dividend, we expect to deliver a total shareholder return of at least 12% annually. Now we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question we have comes from Ali Agha of SunTrust. Please go ahead. Ali Agha : Thank you. Good morning. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Hi, Ali. Ali Agha : Good morning. First question, with regards to the 2018 guidance, earlier in the year, Tom and Andr\u00e9s, when you had talked about 2018, you had told us, net-net, it\u2019s about $0.20 higher than 2017. [Indiscernible] somewhere $1.25 range. But now you\u2019re telling us low to mid-teens, which implies a lower implied number for 2018. So what has changed for 2018? Tom O\u2019Flynn: Yes. Good morning, Ali. It\u2019s Tom. I mean, yes, if you cut through the dis from the percentage increase, it\u2019s part of our $0.05. I mean, first I\u2019d say that we\u2019re still in the final stages of our budget process, and we\u2019ll come up with firm numbers in Feb. We just want to give people a general ballpark. There\u2019s nothing major. I\u2019d say, there\u2019s \u2013 perhaps, there\u2019s a couple of cents in the U.S. DPLs may be a little softer from the regulatory outcome and some plant closure numbers. And the rest is kind of a $0.01 here and a $0.01 there. But we\u2019re still grinding through it. Ali Agha : Okay. So I mean, could you get back to that $0.20 delta? Or do you think that\u2019s a bit unrealistic here? Tom O\u2019Flynn: I mean, I think that\u2019s certainly \u2013 we certainly always look for things to do more of. Andr\u00e9s talked about really doing a very heavy look at costs across the company that we\u2019re in the process of. So we certainly look for that. But that said, I think we want to give people a general expectation of where things were trending to. And so we\u2019d probably be closer to $0.05 below. So it\u2019s still a fair amount above 2017. Ali Agha : Right, right. Second question, with regards to the asset sales, I just wanted to be clear. So previously, we had thought there would be a $500 million sale this year, which, I think you\u2019ve confirmed, will be Masinloc. But now what you\u2019re telling us is that probably still gets announced by year end, but you get the proceeds next year. Did I hear that right? Tom O\u2019Flynn: Yes. And just to be clear, earlier on in the year, we put a placeholder in for $500 million. There were different things that we were considering. It\u2019s not clear that we can do $1 billion, that Masinloc will be \u2013 can do $1 billion and close that $1 billion by the end of 2018 and that the Masinloc process is quite deep in the process. We got very heavy interest. So yes, specifically with Masinloc, we expect to announce Q4 in the next, what, six weeks, and we expect to close it in the first half of 2018. But that $500 million was done before we had thought about a specific candidate. We think that Masinloc will be well in excess of that. Ali Agha : Yes. And broadly speaking, when you look at the $2 billion number, I mean, is the motivation to essentially exit non-core markets, can you give some sense of [indiscernible] Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes, Ali, well, when we started, we were in 28 countries. When we exit the Philippines, we\u2019ll be in 15. We\u2019ve always said that somewhere between 12 to 15 countries is kind of our probably we thought that where we would end up. So I think it\u2019s looking more like a dozen. And of course, we never announce anything before the sale is actually done. So some of it will be exiting some countries, and some of it will be selling down from certain assets. And in some cases, may be selling down a portion of the assets. For example, as we did recently in the Dominican Republic, to realize value. I think the important thing is that where we want to end up and what does that portfolio look like. And as we said, it will be simpler. It will be in less countries. It will be less carbon-intensive. And we will be, if you will, sort of turning capital into growth areas where we get higher returns and then sitting on some existing assets. Ali Agha : Okay. Last question, Andr\u00e9s, if I could. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on what\u2019s been happening in the IPP merchant power space. Companies have basically concluded that the public markets are not giving them credit for their portfolios. Many are going private. They\u2019ve been sold. Major restructurings happening. Are there any lessons learned for AES given how your stock gets valued in the public markets today? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Well, I will say \u2013 well, I think the lessons \u2013 I mean, we moved to get out of merchant generation, I think, on a timely basis. I think we\u2019ve exited a number of markets that since I\u2019ve been troubled on a timely basis, and I think we\u2019ve generally sold our assets at very good prices. So we didn\u2019t do really any sort of fire sales. We waited in some cases until the contracts ran out. Now if you look at our strategy, we\u2019re moving into much more contract, and we\u2019re lengthening our average contract versus what we have even today. So I think we have a quite different strategy from most. I think we\u2019re changing our risk profile. We\u2019ve significantly derisked. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll notice that on this call, we did not talk about the weather in Brazil. That used to be the main focus of these calls, quite frankly. And we have been able to derisk from the way we\u2019ve contracted. I think, as Tom mentioned, when we deconsolidate Eletropaulo, it will make a better correlation between really our economic, our financial profile and our consolidated profile. And lastly, we\u2019re moving aggressively to become investment-grade. So I think on all these fronts, I think our strategy has been considerably different from other firms, which have remained less contracted and also, quite frankly, which aren\u2019t moving into the newer technologies. So I think we have the advantage of being in more rapidly growth markets and being well-positioned. Having said that, ever since I\u2019ve been CEO and Tom\u2019s been CFO, I mean, we have looked at all alternatives, and we periodically have third parties come in and look and say is there any way we can sustainably add value to the company? So we\u2019re always open to these any ideas, but we\u2019re only going to do things which makes sense for the company in terms of a sustainable company. So we\u2019re open to all alternatives. I\u2019ve seen the \u2013 some of these. And obviously, in the sector, there\u2019s been a lot of consolidation to take out costs, but we\u2019ve taken a lot of costs. And we\u2019re also, as we\u2019ve said on this call, going to be aggressively looking at our cost structure. This is partly the result, I\u2019d say, of the actions we\u2019ve taken, the systems we\u2019ve put in place and also the simplification of our portfolio. Ali Agha : Thank you, Andr\u00e9s. Operator : The next question we have will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Good morning, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So maybe let me follow up a little bit on the asset sale strategic positioning here. Can you talk about how you think about the \u2013 let\u2019s not talk about the IPP peers but the YieldCos and just the overall market subsector there. How do you think about yourself relative to that sector? And how do you think about desirability that you recycle capital in that direction, i.e., I hear you guys talk about more asset sales. I hear you expanding your renewable platform as it stands today. Can you provide any further thoughts just putting all these pieces together? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes. That\u2019s a great question. When you remember, when YieldCo\u2019s first started, it was a lot of, I\u2019d say, questions we were getting from various people like, why don\u2019t you do a YieldCo? And one of our concerns was not to have a \u2013 to be sort of committed to growth in case markets turned. And I think, in general, that has been the, right now, the right decision. Now if you look at what we\u2019re doing today, we did mention, for example, that on sPower, we are looking at selling down a portion of the operating assets to enhance our returns and be able to move that money into new projects, the 10-gigawatt-plus pipeline where we think we can improve our average return. So in that sense, we, I think, have shown that we can access private money. We\u2019ve raised about $3.8 billion over the last six years of partner equity, including \u2013 from the large Canadian pension funds. So in that sense, I think that our view is that we are very interested in coming up with ownership structures, which are win-wins, where we provide for people looking for long-term, stable, investment-grade assets. And at the same time, it allows us to reduce our participation and improve our returns be it through management fees or promote \u2013 or development fees. So that is part of the market. Now I think where we\u2019re somewhat different is that we see the advantage of having a platform in these countries. So for example, having a strong partner in Mexico opens a lot of opportunities for us in renewables. Having a strong position in various markets opens that up. So we want to use our scale and in cases, integrate the new renewables with our existing assets because, obviously, energy prices from renewables, in many cases, are lower. But if you can integrate that with the capacity from existing assets, you can have some very interesting propositions for your customers. In the longer term, we think batteries can supply that in many markets. But right now, we see that opportunity. So to answer your question, we have approached the problem from a sort of customer-centric position. We\u2019re taking advantage of our platforms, and we\u2019re bringing in capital and selling down when we see the opportunity that, that would improve our returns. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Now just in thinking through committing to any kind of structure, would you be open to investing in a third-party structure to establish an independent acquisition vehicle? And if so, to \u2013 how would you think about establishing that just given the discrepancies in multiples and the perceived accretion or dilution involved just at the outset? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Well, I think, again, if you think of something like sPower, we have a partnership with them. sPower, as we\u2019ve said in the past regarding acquisitions, we would look opportunistically at that. If we think that there are acquisitions where we have significant synergies, it\u2019s 2 plus 2 equals 6, add to that portfolio. On the other hand, we\u2019re not looking right now at sort of big acquisitions, et cetera. We\u2019re sort of looking at asset acquisitions that could enhance that portfolio. And as I said, if there are interested parties in taking a portion of that from the sPower JV, that\u2019s fine as well. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. All right. Excellent. I\u2019ll leave that there. Can I move a little bit further down to the Gener level? Just curious, in light of the developments on the Alto Maipo side, how are you viewing cash distributions back to the parent right now? Obviously, things are somewhat fluid there vis-\u00e0-vis finalizing up the EPC, et cetera. I suppose plan \u2013 you\u2019re moving ahead with plan, and you don\u2019t necessarily anticipate any limitations in terms of distributions given any credit concerns that, that\u2019s up. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : I think this is a \u2013 the negotiations in Alto Maipo are proceeding. The Alto Maipo team and Gener team are doing a great job. I would say that Gener will remain an investment-grade company, that any equity contributions from Gener to the Alto Maipo project would maintain that investment grade, will be very \u2013 looking at the sort of marginal returns of that investment. And we don't expect it to significantly affect any dividend distributions from Gener into the future. So those are the things. Now we've also said that should we decide not to proceed with the project, that would also, in terms of the cash distributions from Gener, those would continue, although they might take a different form in terms of like return of capital. So we're looking at both. We will be very disciplined. On the other hand, we think that there is a win-win solution here, which would be good for all parties, including, obviously, Chile and Chile electric system from completing the project. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And is there anything, just lastly, coming back to what Ali was talking about, reason why you're not including the full $2 billion in your pie chart there around use of cash? I imagine maybe it's just too early to anticipate what exactly and what form it takes or you tell me how specific you are in your asset sales at this point. Tom O'Flynn: Yes, Julien, it's Tom. I'd say that traditionally, we put things up here when they're either announced or close to being announced. So I think we feel very comfortable that we've got a good line of sight on $1 billion. Execution is underway. Good comfort with being able to sign near-term close, certainly next year, if not in the first half of the year. So as we continue to think through more businesses, assets, et cetera, that make a win to that, then we would expand that piece accordingly. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And just a quick... Andr\u00e9s Gluski : I mean, you know that when we first announced that we'd be doing asset sales, I believe we used a number of around $1 billion. I think we're at $4 billion now. We announced Cal's, as we've said, $100 million. We're at $200-million-plus now. So generally, we just want to be, as Tom was saying, have a real clear line of sight. Now obviously, we have a number of opportunities that would make sense from a strategic plan that I outlined that we think can easily get us to that $2 billion number by 2020. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And just to be clear, in setting an expectation here, would you expect any of this to be EPS dilutive or accretive to the extent to which you kind of know which assets you're thinking about here against the plan? Tom O'Flynn: Yes. I think it's a mixture. Certainly, some could be accretive, some that could be dilutive. I think if you look at the overall group, there is some modest dilution. I think we factored that into our overall growth rate. I think some of the incremental cost efficiencies we plan to put in place may give us the offsets to be able to transition the portfolio and also meet our numbers. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes. And what I'd say is we are \u2013 our overriding objective is to meet that 8% to 10% growth rate we've committed. So there will be puts and takes, like Tom said, but it won't affect us reaching our objectives. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And you guys didn't raise your cost target for the long term here, right? Obviously, there's some shifts, but. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : No, not specifically. We just \u2013 it's something we're evaluating, and we'll talk more about it on our year-end call in Feb. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Thank you for taking some of the questions. Appreciate it. Have a good day. Operator : Next, we have Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Greg Gordon : Hi, guys good morning. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Good morning. Greg Gordon : So just want to make sure I heard you correctly in the response to Julian that the \u2013 you see the incremental cost cutting announcement as supplementing your ability to hit the 8% to 10%. You don't think you'll be in a position to move that range as a function of that, and that's partly because of the friction that might happen when you reposition the portfolio through these assets sales and redeploy that capital. Is that a fair summary? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : What I'd say as a summary, the additional cost cuts that we're working on and will announce in the fourth quarter will give us additional comfort of hitting that range. So this is \u2013 it's additional to what the cost cuts we've announced in the past. On the other hand, we're not changing that guidance range. It will give us additional comfort. Because as we \u2013 as Tom said, there's puts and takes, so we want to make sure that we hit our numbers. Greg Gordon : Well, what are some of the takes that happened since you last gave the guidance that are \u2013 where these cost cuts are going to fill in there? Tom O'Flynn: Yes. No. Greg, my comment on puts and takes is more on EPS impact from certain sales. Some are accretive, some are dilutive. Greg Gordon : Got you. And I just wanted to make sure that was clear. The second question I have is, and I feel like it's d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again with this, the stock is obviously down a lot. It's performing okay today. But if consensus expectations for your earnings are right, the return on buying back your stock is in excess of the return \u2013 average expected return on the investments you're making. There's no placeholder in your capital plan, whatsoever, for buybacks. Just I really am a little bit agitated by that, and I want to understand your thinking. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Well, we have done a considerable amount of buyback over the years, and we do have an outstanding approval. So we're not saying that we're \u2013 won't do buybacks. We're just not announcing any specific buybacks at this point in time. So obviously, we are not happy at all with where our stock is trading, and we always consider that. But I think that at this point, we're undergoing a transition program, and I think it will be very important that we deliver on our numbers. But certainly, we're not saying that we won't do stock buybacks. Greg Gordon : Can you remind us what the outstanding authorization is for the buyback? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Currently, we have $250 million still remaining on our prior authorization. Greg Gordon : Okay. Look, Andr\u00e9s, I look at the reinvestment you're making in the business and how you're repositioning it, and I think it's very attractive. So I'm not arguing that what you're doing to reposition the company is not well thought out and obviously you have a plethora of opportunities. The issues that the return on a buyback at these prices is like a mid- to high-teens ROE. And the return on the investments you're making, even though they're very attractive, is not as attractive as the stock. So I think you really need to consider being more aggressive with the market and show them that you have confidence you can hit your targets by buying back the stock when it's attractive. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Point taken, Greg. As I said, we've \u2013 today, we're returning through the dividend about 55% of our parent free cash flow. So I think we remain committed to giving money back to our shareholders, and we have done, I believe it's about $1.5 billion of stock buybacks, at least over the past five years. So I certainly don't want to say that this is off the table, and point taken. Greg Gordon : Okay. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions)] Next, we have Lasan Johong of Auvila Research. Lasan Johong : Hi Andr\u00e9s, Thanks for taking my question. I just want to make a quick comment. I am very much opposed to share buybacks. It does not create value. It's a waste of money. You're shoving money out of your left pocket and putting in your right pocket. And other than signaling purposes, it's a waste of capital. Moving on, please. I'm assuming, since you're selling the Philippine, you're not doing Masinloc 2? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Masinloc 2 is under construction. The construction is going well, and that would be part of... Lasan Johong : No, I understand that. But are you going to finish that construction? Or is that part of the sale of Masinloc? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Well, we would finish the construction under our contract for the new seller. Tom O'Flynn: So we'd expect the \u2013 it's Tom. Just to clarify, we'd expect the sale to close before the construction is complete. And it's \u2013 the construction is going very well. It's pretty clean. It's got an EPC, so it's not a material issue. Lasan Johong : No, I understand that. But when you say you're selling Masinloc, are you're selling Masinloc 1 only? Or Masinloc 1 and the construction project? Tom O'Flynn: No, 1 and 2. We're selling the business. We see this one... Lasan Johong : Okay. Great. The \u2013 a couple of years ago, Argentina instituted an accounts receivable financing of new generation, and people were kind of skeptical. Can you give us a view as to whether it's working out or not working out in Argentina with that accounts receivable financing? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Sure. I\u2019d say, first to say that Argentina has really made a comeback. I think, starting from the top level as the \u2013 politically, as you know, they had a recently elections for Congress, and Macri\u2019s party got 40% of the vote, much more than people had expected. So the reforms are going forward in Argentina. In our sector, they\u2019ve made very important reforms : one is dollarizing; second is increasing moderately, prices \u2013 retail prices but also generation. And they will move towards a liberated market. People forget, but in the 1990s, Argentina had one of the best regulations on the planet in terms of liberated markets. So Argentina is doing much, much better. Our business is doing much, much better. We had two years where we did not receive dividends from Argentina, even though the business has always made money. So it\u2019s obviously, we perceive much more dividends and making much more money. Getting to your point about this was the FONINVEMEM, one of the more difficult acronyms we have to pronounce. They have been paying the interest on the FONINVEMEM. These are actualized. Part of the bonds are tied to the completion of actual generation assets. In this case, it was the Guillermo Brown as being the largest one. So that plant is up and running. So that whole \u2013 and what I would put it was basically part that the CAMMESA would take part of your payments and essentially give you these bonds and use the funds to build a new asset. But they have paid interest. The plants have been completed, so that \u2013 that\u2019s going well. Lasan Johong : Okay, great. I\u2019m a little confused about Fluence. The existing energy storage facility, is that part of \u2013 going to be \u2013 going forward, is it going to be part of Fluence? Or is that separate, and then Fluence will be a new stock with new projects? Tom O'Flynn: Yes. What I\u2019d say is, look, we have about 228 megawatts of energy storage facilities on our platform. Those are not being sold. Those remain with AES because they\u2019re our assets. Fluence is a joint venture to develop and to sell our Advancion 4 product, and Advancion 5 that will be coming out, and Siemens\u2019 Siestorage product. So we both contributed a product to this. With the net result is that we\u2019re the only, let\u2019s say \u2013 Fluence is the only firm which can offer the full gamut from commercial and industrial small units to the largest utility scale, 100-plus megawatt energy storage. So we\u2019ve combined those two. So we\u2019re moving R&D together. Fluence will be doing that. We will be taking advantage of Siemens\u2019 platform, and we\u2019ll be taking advantage of Siemens\u2019 sales force. Siemens is active in 160 countries. It\u2019s been selling electric equipment for more than 100 years, so it has a great brand name. So we think bringing these together is very, very powerful. And we really don\u2019t see anybody else like it in the market, at least today. So the point is this will be a separate company, a JV. It\u2019s 50-50. Siemens and us. We\u2019re both contributing people to that project. It will use Siemens\u2019 sales force. When we put energy storage on, say, our solar projects, that sPower, we\u2019re a client. So it\u2019s separating the two. So we expect this to grow very quickly. As we say \u2013 have said in the past, we don\u2019t expect any cash or earnings contributions for, say, two more years during this rapid growth phase and thereafter. But we think it should be a very valuable company within a time period of five years. We\u2019ve done things like this before, just to remind people, in the case of Brazil, we had rights of way. We developed a broadband supplier. This is a company we sold for $1 billion to Telecom Italia a couple of years ago  So we think this could grow very rapidly. But again, it\u2019s separate from us. We will continue to do energy storage. For example, on Southland, we have a contract with Southern California Edison for 100-megawatt facility. That will be ours under potentially a contract with Southern California Edison. That\u2019s not part of Fluence. It will buy the equipment from Fluence. Lasan Johong : Got it. One last question. AES stock lag, if you leave the DOE report for August, they\u2019re pretty much suggesting that in a high renewables area, base-load plants are either going to be obsolete or they\u2019re going to have to get paid for things that are not currently being compensated for, such as Brazilian characteristics and reliability characteristics. Does that worry you that AES Southland is being built as a CCGT, not as a SCGT facility? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : No, because of the contract we have. I mean, I think that when you speak about it, it would \u2013 what I think is interesting is that with energy storage, we\u2019re seeing that regulations. And they have a lot of \u2013 they do a lot of things, which aren\u2019t translated in the current regulation. All over the world, what we\u2019re doing is, let\u2019s say, testing and actually, certifying some of our coal plants to run at lower MINs [ph] to give them greater flexibility to be ready for that future. But I don\u2019t know, Tom, do you want to add anything? Tom O'Flynn: Yes. No, Andr\u00e9s said, I\u2019d just add that our California plant, the one that\u2019s under construction in Southland, has got very good flexibility. That\u2019s what the SoCal Ed was focused on. So it\u2019s got quick ramp capacity and low MINs, and it\u2019s also in a very critical location in the transmission infrastructure. Just, what is it, 30 miles south of L.A. So those are all things that I think we\u2019re taking into account in our proposal and SoCal Ed\u2019s request for bid now two years, two and a half years ago. Just in terms of the overall DOE proposal, given that we\u2019re essentially getting out or will be out of the merchant generation business mid-next year, we don\u2019t see it as a major impact. I suppose we\u2019re closing a couple of coal plants down to the extent that another party looks and says that\u2019s an opportunity for them to step in, we\u2019re certainly open to those kinds of ideas. Lasan Johong : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Well, at this time, we\u2019re showing no further questions. We\u2019ll go ahead and conclude our question-and-answer session. I will turn the conference back over to Mr. Ahmed Pasha for the closing remarks. Sir? Ahmed Pasha : We thank everybody for joining us on today\u2019s call. We look forward to seeing many of you next week at the EEI Conference. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any questions you may have. Thank you, and have a nice day. Operator : And we thank you sir and to the rest of the management team for your time also today. Again, the conference call has concluded. At this time, you may disconnect your lines. Thank you, again, everyone. Take care, and have a great day.",

And welcome to the AES Corporation\u2019s Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Financial Review Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode [Operator Instructions]. After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Ahmed Pasha, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ahmed Pasha : Thank you, Kate. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to our fourth quarter and full year financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our Web site at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning are Andr\u00e9s Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom O\u2019Flynn, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will now turn the call over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thank you, Ahmed. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial review call. During 2017, we delivered on all of our financial metrics. Adjusted EPS was $1.08 toward the upper end of our guidance range. Cash flow also came in at the upper end of our ranges. Based on our strong performance in 2017 and our confidence in our outlook, we are reaffirming our 8% to 10% average annual growth rate through 2020. Further, we continue to transform and simplify the company. To that end, we are maximizing our efficiency with a new organizational structure which will yield an additional $100 million in annual cost savings by 2019. We\u2019re reducing our financial risk by prepaying $1 billion impairing debt. We\u2019re leveraging our platforms by adding 4.4 gigawatts of new capacity that its currently under construction. Through a balanced approach, we\u2019ve been reshaping our portfolio, while reducing our carbon exposure; first, by acquiring 2.3 gigawatts of renewable and launching the Fluence energy storage joint venture with Siemens; second, we announced that we are selling or retiring 4.3 gigawatts of merchant coal-fired generation. Through this successful execution of our strategy, we are lowering the risk of our portfolio, particularly the volatility of our earnings and cash flow. At the same time, we are well positioned to deliver 8% to 10% average annual growth and adjusted EPS comparing free cash flow through 2020, achieve investment grade credit metrics in 2019 and reduce our carbon intensity by 25% from 2016 through 2020. I will now discuss these themes in more detail, beginning with maximizing our efficiency on slide four. We implemented a new $100 million cost savings plan as a result of our recently announced reorganization. This year, we are reducing our global workforce by 1,000 to 12%. These additional savings will strengthen our ability to deliver on our long-term financial commitments. Next, I\u2019ll provide an update on some of our construction projects. In total, we have 4.4 gigawatts currently under construction, most of which are expansions of our existing plans and businesses. Beginning on Alto Maipo on slide five. As you may recall, this 521 megawatt hybrid project has been experiencing significant construction delay and cost overruns. However, since our third quarter call in November, we have reached a significant milestone whilst resolving outstanding issues. Specifically, Alto Maipo negotiated a fixed price lump sum EPC contract with Strabag, the project\u2019s main contractor for the entire project. The new EPC contract, which is pending approval from the project lenders, transfers all of the geological risks to the contractor and includes material capital commitments from Strabag. The restructuring will require concessions from the project lenders and meaningful equity contributions from AES Gener, which are tied to construction milestones. We expect to receive approval from the lenders in the second quarter. Although, we were very disappointed with the extended delays and increased costs to build out the Maipo, the new contract provides much greater certainty on both the schedule and the total costs to complete the remaining 38% of the project. Once completed, Alto Maipo will diversify AES Gener\u2019s generation mix and provide a zero emission source of power and capacity in Chile\u2019s load center for many decades. Turning now to the rest of our construction program, beginning on slide six. Our 671 megawatt Eagle Valley CCGT in Indiana achieved full load earlier this month. This plant is now in the commissioning phase and is expected to be completed in the first half of the year. Now, turning to our 1.3 gigawatt Southland CCGT project on slide seven, which is a new construction on our existing gas generation sites in Southern California. Construction is proceeding as planned and the project on track to be operational by the first half of 2020. Shortly, we will also begin construction on this site on our long-term contracted 100 megawatt four hour duration lithium ion energy storage facility. This project will be the world\u2019s largest lithium ion energy storage facility. Turning to slide eight, and our LNG businesses. In Panama this month, we started commissioning at our 380 megawatt Col\u00f3n CCGT. We expect to achieve first fire in March and COD early in the second half of this year. As you may remember, we\u2019re also building an LNG re-gasification and storage facility on the same site and expect to reach COD on time in 2019. In the Dominican Republic, we are in advanced discussions to secure new client for the access capacity at our LNG storage facility and to build the pipeline to connect the LNG terminal to the Eastern side of the Island. The pipeline will allow us to sell our access capacity as existing plant convert from heavy fuel oil and diesel to natural gas. We expect to earn attractive returns given the limited amount of investment necessary and that the project will require no cash in corp. Our remaining construction projects are proceeding as planned, including our 1.3 gigawatt thermal plant OPGC 2 in India. These projects will be key contributors to our earnings and cash flow growth through 2020. Turning to slide nine. We have been reshaping our portfolio to deliver attractive returns to our shareholders, while reducing our carbon exposure. Our focus in on renewable projects with long-term U.S. dollar denominated contracts. On a portfolio basis, these investments are expected to produce low to mid-teen IRs assuming a conservative terminal value. In general, we expect to receive at least 85% of the cash flow during the life of PPA. These compelling returns are driven by several factors, including; about half of our investments are in markets with lower renewable penetration and faster growth on U.S.; using our business platforms and global scale to lower cost, such as PV panel and wind turbine purchases; utilizing local debt capacity in the businesses to fund the investments; and bringing in partners to reduce our equity commitments, while providing management and development fees. Turning to slide 10. In the last year, we acquired $2.3 gigawatts of renewable capacity with long-term contracts in three markets. First in the U.S., we closed on the acquisition of sPower together with the Alberta pension fund, AIMCo. sPower was a key driver in our 2017 growth and is continuing to execute on its more than 10 gigawatt development pipeline in the U.S. In fact, this year sPower signed long-term PPAs for 582 megawatts of solar and wind capacity with investment grade customers. Second in Brazil, AES Tiet\u00ea acquired 686 megawatts of long-term contracted wind and solar generation. The equity required for these expansions was funded by using the debt capacity available at Tiet\u00ea. And third in Mexico, where we have 2.5 gigawatt development pipeline of renewables and natural gas infrastructure. We acquired a 306 megawatt Mesa La Paz wind development project. Mesa La Paz has a 25 year U.S. dollar denominated PPA with an investment grade private sector off-taker. The project site has sufficient additional land to accommodate up to 200 megawatts of solar, which could be an attractive upside in the future. We expect to reach financial close in March and begin construction shortly thereafter. During 2017, we also made good progress on our initiative to offer new innovative energy solutions. As a result, in Hawaii we\u2019re delivering two solar plus energy storage facilities for a total of 47 megawatts of solar and 34 megawatts of five hour duration storage on the Island of Kauai. The first of these pioneering projects is under construction, and will satisfy energy demand during peak hours in the evening, as well as the rest of the day. We also closed on Fluence, our joint venture with Siemens. Fluence will deliver energy storage solutions and services to a broad group of customers from commercial and industrial companies to utility and power developers around the globe. In fact, the team is currently pursuing more than one gigawatt sales opportunities in 15 countries. The goal is for Fluence to consolidate its position as market leader in this high growth market. Lithium-ion base energy storage is expected to grow tenfold in five years, reaching at least 28 gigawatts of global install capacity by 2022. In summary, as you can see on slide 11, we will be adding 8.3 gigawatts of new capacity by 2020. This represents 25% of our current install capacity and includes seven gigawatts of projects either under construction or recently acquired. The remaining 1.3 gigawatts reflect projects in advanced stage development, half of which are under signed contracts. As a result of these additions, our average remaining contract term will increase from six years currently to 10 years by 2020. We have sufficient internally generated cash to fund our equity contributions for all the projects I just discussed. We're taking a balanced approach to decarbonizing our portfolio, recognizing that coal will continue to play a role. In 2017, we announced the exit of 4.3 gigawatts of merchant coal-fired generation, representing 30% of our coal fired capacity. Through these actions, we are significantly reshaping our portfolio to achieve our financial and strategic objectives. As you can see on slide 12, by the end of 2020, we expect our coal fired capacity to decline from 41% to 29%, while renewables and gas will increase from 55% to 68%. Further, as you may have seen in our press release this morning and on slide 13, I am pleased to announced that based on these steps we've taken to-date, we are on track to reduce our carbon intensity by 25% from 2016 to 2020, and we will be aiming for a reduction of 50% by 2030. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom to discuss our financial results, capital allocation guidance, and expectations in more detail. Tom O\u2019Flynn: Thanks Andr\u00e9s. Good morning. Today, I\u2019ll review our 2017 results and capital allocation. We'll also discuss some recent business developments and conclude by addressing our guidance for this year, and expectations through 2020. As Andr\u00e9s mentioned, we finished 2017 on a strong note, achieving the upper end of our guidance range on all metrics and setting a solid foundation for growth through 2020. Adjusted EPS was $1.08. In the last two months of the year, we benefited from stronger margins at some of our businesses, a lower impact from hurricanes and a lower overall tax rate. As shown on slide 15, most of our growth in 2017 was driven by higher margins, particularly in MCAC, contributions from new solar projects in the U.S. and the absence of a one-time reserve taken in 2016 in MCAC. Now to slide 16, our adjusted PTC and consolidated free cash flow. We earned a little over $1 billion in adjusted PTC during the year. This was an increase of $167 million, primarily due to the same drivers as adjusted EPS. We generated $1.9 billion of consolidated free cashflow, a decrease of $323 million from 2016, primarily due to large receivables collections in Eurasia and Brazil in \u201916. Now I\u2019ll cover our SPUs in more detail over the next five slides, beginning on slide 17. In the U.S., margins were flat. Adjusted PTC increased, primarily due to equity earnings for new solar projects at sPower and our distributed energy business. Lower consolidated free cash flow also reflects higher working capital requirements at DPL. Regarding sPower, we\u2019re very pleased with the businesses\u2019 performing since the acquisition. In November, sPower closed a $420 million 19 year financing at 4.6%, enabling us to meaningfully increase our returns on the business. We also continue to receive inbound indications of interest at attractive valuations to partner on sPower\u2019s operating assets. Incorporating such a partner would further increase our overall return and transition a greater percentage of our capital into sPower\u2019s robust development pipeline. This backlog continues to grow and is yielding excellent projects with double-digit returns, including the 580 megawatts of recently signed PPAs, Andr\u00e9s mentioned. In Andes, our results were relatively flat. Higher pricing in Argentina and a full year of operations at Cochrane in Chile were largely offset by the impact of Green Taxes and planned major maintenance at AES Gener in Chile. Lower adjusted PTC also reflects higher interest expense in Argentina. Consolidated free cash increased largely due to lower working capital requirements at Gener. In Brazil, margins were flat while adjusted PTC benefited from the settlement of a legal dispute at our CCGT [indiscernible] in the first quarter 2017. The decrease in consolidated free cash flow is largely due to the high recovery in 2016 Eletropaulo to purchase power cost from prior drops. Most importantly, as part of our strategic shift away from the distribution business in Brazil, in Q4 we reclassified Eletropaulo to discontinued operations. This reduces our volatility and eliminates the disproportionate exposure to Brazil in our consolidated financial statements, given our 17% ownership interest. For example, we\u2019ve been consolidating over $3 billion of revenue with over $1 billion of unfunded pension liability with only $3 million of income in 2017. Mexico, Central American and the Caribbean results reflect improved margins, driven primarily by higher contracted sales in the Dominican Republic, following completion of the combined cycle last year, as well as higher availability in Mexico. Adjusted PTC in \u201916 also reflects the reserve taken against certain of the reimbursements in MCAC in connection with a legal matter. Consolidated free cash flow also benefited from receivables collections in the fourth quarter in the Dominican Republic. I\u2019ll also note that our plan in Puerto Rico is now being dispatched and delivering much needed energy to the grid. Payments from the off take of preps have also resumed and we received $40 million since December. Finally Eurasia, results reflects stable margins and the collection of a large overdue receivable in 2016 at Maritza in Bulgaria. Since the structuring and Maritza\u2019s PPA in 2016, the off-takers have been paying on-time. On the regulatory side, Maritza expects to have discussions later this year with the Government of Bulgaria regarding the European Commission's review of the PPAs compliance with [indiscernible]. We\u2019ll keep you updated as discussions progress. Now to slide 22, and update on the impact of tax reform. As you know, we incurred a one-time non-cash charge of $1.08 in 2017 upon enactment of the new law, which was largely related to deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. This is a complex bill and some issues still remain to be clarified. As we disclosed last month, in the near term we expect $0.05 to $0.08 annual impact, largely driven by two aspects; first, we expect meaningful limitation on interest deductions, which are now capped at roughly 30% of non-regulated U.S. EBITDA; second, under the new global intangible income rules, un-repatriated foreign earnings above a certain threshold can now be subject to U.S. tax. We have taken actions to offset these impacts and we'll continue to evaluate additional tax planning opportunities. In the longer term, these aspects of the tax reform they are beneficial to AES. For example, the adoption of a territorial tax regime will provide more flexibility in structuring new investments and repatriating profits. Now to slide 23 and our improving credit profile. We ended \u201917 with $4.7 billion of parent debt and almost $2 billion reduction since 2011. As we announced in December, we used all the proceeds from the billion dollar Masinloc sale to further reduce parent debt, which will bring our debt to about $3.8 billion. As a result, we now expect to achieve investment grade credit metrics in 2019, a year earlier than our prior expectations. We also have a high priority goal of attaining an investment grade rating by 2020. We believe this will help us to not only reduce our cost of debt and improve our financial flexibility, but also enhance our equity valuation. Now to 2017 parent capital allocation on slide 24. Sources on the left hand side reflect $1.5 billion of total available discretionary cash consistent with our expectations. This includes $637 million of parent free cash above the midpoint of our expected range. Uses on the right hand side of the slide are largely in line with our expectations. Investment from subsidiaries are slightly higher than our prior disclosure, largely due to additional investments in U.S. renewables. Now turning to our guidance on slide 25. Consistent with industry practice, these numbers exclude costs directly associated with major restructuring programs and the one-time non-cash charge of $1.08 resulting from the enactment of tax reform in 2017. Today, we're initiating guidance for 2018 adjusted EPS of $1.15 to $1.25 and reaffirming our target of 8% to 10% average annual growth through 2020. Growth this year will be largely driven by contributions from new projects, cost savings and lower parent interest. To break this down by SBU, we expect growth in U.S. to be driven largely by positive regulatory actions at DPL, as well as growth in renewables. And these will benefit from continued market reforms in Argentina, higher contracting levels at Angamos in Chile and higher generation in Columbia. Growth in MCAC is expected to be driven largely by completed construction projects, including a full year of operations at are combined cycle in the Dominican Republic, as well as the partial year impact from the commencement of operations at the Col\u00f3n CCGT in Panama. Finally, we also expect to benefit from cost savings and long-term interest. This growth will be partially offset by business exits from the Philippine and Kazakhstan, and a higher tax rate driven by U.S. tax reform. Beginning this year, we\u2019ll no longer provide guidance on consolidated free cash flow, which does not accurately account for AES\u2019s ownership interest and our underlying businesses. We believe that parent free cash flow is the most tangible measure of our ability to achieve our financial goals, including strengthening our balance sheet and delivering value to shareholders. Turning to slide 26. Parent free cash flow is expected to be relatively flat this year from $600 million to $675 million. This reflects lower expected distribution from Gener to allow for incremental investments in Alto Maipo and ensure the maintenance of their investment grade credit ratings. Consistent with prior expectations, we still expect 8% to 10% average annual growth through 2020 off the 2017 base. I\u2019ll now discuss our 2018 parent capital allocation on slide 27. Beginning on the left side, sources reflect $1.9 billion of total available discretionary cash, including the $600 million to $675 million of parent free cash flow just mentioned. Sources also assumed $1.25 billion in asset sale proceeds, including $1 billion sale of Masinloc in the Philippines and $250 million placeholder for additional asset sale this year. Regarding Masinloc, we recently received a key regulatory approval for the sale to close as early as the end of first quarter. Now, the uses on the right side of the slide. Including the 8.3% dividend increase we announced in December, we\u2019ll be returning $345 million to shareholders this year as expected. We expect to use over $1 billion to reduce parent debt, including revolver drawings. Finally, we plan to invest at least $250 million in our subsidiaries, primarily from projects under construction leaving about $100 million unallocated cash. Now looking at our capital allocation from 2018 through 2020 beginning on slide 28. We expect our portfolio to generate $4.2 billion in discretionary cash, roughly 60% of our market cap. This reflects parent free cash flow for the period, as well as our $2 billion asset sale target for 2020, half of which will be realized from Masinloc. In terms of uses on slide 29, whether half has been allocated to the current shareholder dividend and debt reduction about 750 is allocated to identified investments in our subsidiaries, including projects under construction and late stage development. The remaining $1.25 billion, which is largely weighted towards \u201919 and 2020, is available to create shareholder value through investment in compelling growth opportunities, modest deleveraging of about $100 million to $200 million per year and potential growth in our dividend. With that, I\u2019ll now turn it back to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thanks, Tom. Before we take questions, let me summarize the concrete steps we\u2019re taking to transform and simplify the company; reducing our headcount by 12% this year for $100 million in sustainable cost savings; lowering our parent debt by 20%; investing in profitable, renewable projects with long-term U.S. dollar denominated contracts, including the 2.3 gigawatts we acquired in 2017; and reducing our carbon exposure by exiting 4.3 gigawatts of merchant coal-fired generation. Accordingly, as a result of our successful execution, we will deliver 8% to 10% average annual growth and adjusted EPS in parent free cash flow through 2020, achieve investment grade metrics in 2019 and reduce our carbon intensity by 25% from 2016 to 2020. Our overarching goal is to deliver sustainable and attractive risk adjusted total returns to our shareholders. Operator, we would now like to open up the lines for questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator instructions]. The first question is from Ali Agha of SunTrust. Please go ahead. Ali Agha : First question Andr\u00e9s on the Alto Maipo. In the past, when you have put that project as part of your construction pipeline, you resumed a zero return on the investments you've already made there. Can you give us a sense of what\u2019s roughly the incremental investment you will need to make and the economic or financial case internally that you went through to decide, we should go forward with this as opposed to perhaps writing-off the previous investment you've made there? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : I can\u2019t comment right now on what the amount of the additional investment AES Gener would have to make at this point. But that will happen when the financing is closed. But I would say that what is important is Gener has been strengthening its balance sheet, selling some assets. Also, as Tom mentioned, there'll be somewhat less dividends this year as a result of investments to be made in Alto Maipo. Now in terms of what to do with the project going forward, of course what matters is just the marginal costs and the marginal benefits. And that's what we have been looking at. I think that from a strategic point of view, having Alto Maipo plus Las Lajas and Alfafal, that\u2019s all part of one big complex, you will have at the end 750 megawatts of capacity and power right in the low center of Chile. So this we think will be a very attractive asset. And as you know, this will, I\u2019ll say balance Gener\u2019s risk because Gener has been very heavily weighted towards the coal plant. And as again Tom mentioned in his speech, we did have the impact of green taxes in 2017. So that's what we're looking at Ali. We\u2019ll look at the entire picture, it's like the marginal returns on the investments we're making and the positioning of Gener as a company into the future. Ali Agha : Second question, as you mentioned the parent free cash flow profile is relatively flattish in \u201918. How does that impact your dividend plans? And when you think about the 8% to 10% growth in dividends, could we expect that as an annual number or would that follow the parent free cash flow profile? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : I think if you look at the growth of our dividend, I think we've had the fastest dividend growth of any company in our sector. And so I think going forward, we\u2019ll continue to analyze what's the best use of our cash. Certainly, we don't think we're getting a lot of credit for our growth in the dividend and the fact that we're on a path to become investment grade. So we will look at what we think is the best use of our cash going forward. I think we\u2019ve laid out our priorities as want to become investment grade and into that we have the transformation of the company that\u2019s underway that we\u2019ll decrease risk and we\u2019ll also ensure our growth into the future. Ali Agha : And Andr\u00e9s just to clarify remind me again, that 8% to 10% growth in EPS and better free cash flow \u201918 through 2020. Are you also committing to an 8% to 10% growth in the dividend commensurate with that? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : At this stage, we haven\u2019t made any comment on an 8% to 10% growth in the dividend. We\u2019re committing to adjusted EPS growth and the parent free cash flow growth. Ali Agha : Last question, the billion dollars of asset sales that you are planning between \u201918 through \u201920 period. Is the impact of that already factored into that 8% to 10% EPS growth that you\u2019ve laid out for us? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Absolutely. And so I mean, we\u2019ve been talking about a balanced approach. I think if you look at our sales, we\u2019ve really gotten good value for our shareholders on those sales. As I said, we also think that coal will continue to play a role. But what we\u2019ve focused on, certainly we focused on coal merchant plans going in, we\u2019ve also focused on simplifying our portfolio. Now, depending on the quality of the asset whether it\u2019s a creative or dilutive that will depend, but this is baked into our vision of the future and what we will deliver. So we feel very comfortable about hitting that billion dollar target, some are could be selling out and some could be selling down. And another factor in our strategy, which we perhaps haven\u2019t highlighted in this speech, but we\u2019ve attracted more than $4 billion of partnership capital. So we\u2019re really looking at maximizing our returns and partnership capital in general has given us a lot of flexibility and the allocation of our resources, helped us manage risk and it\u2019s also helped us into our returns. Operator : Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie. Please go ahead. Angie Storozynski : So two questions. How does the new solar power impact your growth plans for sPower? And then secondly, if you could elaborate a little bit about those negotiations concerning Maritza and some state aids that you mentioned. Thank you. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Let\u2019s talk a little bit about the solar panel. The impact of the tariff, the 30% tariff, is baked into our forecast. And it hasn\u2019t had a material impact on the business. So I don\u2019t know Tom perhaps you\u2019d like to comment on it. Tom O\u2019Flynn: I think as Andr\u00e9s has said, I mean the expectation of a tariff have been obviously out there for some time since early or middle of last year. Some of the being thrown around were actually higher than that so it\u2019s certainly within expectations of what was going to be passed. I think that was taken into account by our teams at sPower and our distributed energy business, so generally we\u2019ve moving forward. Sure on the margin there were small number of opportunities that fell off or at least that put on hold. But I think the team has been moving forward, most of it is evidenced by the large signing of contracts that we identified just most recently. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Okay, let me take the second question which is regarding Maritza. We just wanted to mention this at this stage it's very early to say what the outcome of this would be. It's basically known that DG comp of the European commission does reviews of long-term PPAs, and then whether they contain what's called illegal state aid. We feel we have a very strong contract. We will -- that there's a lot of ways that this could be resolved, and at this stage and I will keep you informed as it progresses. But again we feel that we have a very strong contract. And as you know, a couple of years ago they ran up a very significant IOU, more than \u20ac400 million. On our calls we said, look, we expect to be paid because of the strength of our contracts and quite frankly because of the investment grade of Bulgaria and the fact the public sector had the means to which to pay. Those things were resolved, stay tuned, we'll see where this turns out. But again, we think we're starting from a strong position. Operator : Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Julien Smith : Just wanted to follow up on the last question a little bit. You\u2019ve alluded to or you reaffirmed today the 8% to 10%. Can you just clarify to the extent to which that that is inclusive of the asset sales basically that sort of an implicit guide up, because I think before you talk about the 8% to 10% being exclusive of those and needing to have find, call it cost cuts and/or other sources to offset the dilution from asset sales. Am I thinking about that correctly? Tom O\u2019Flynn: I think maybe we weren\u2019t as clear in the past. But I think the 8% to 10% is inclusive of asset sales. I think there\u2019s a basket of some things that we may sell out or sell down as Andr\u00e9s said. And it does also assume use of capital for deleveraging and reinvestment, I would say our reinvestment is at rates less than what we\u2019ve been investing at. So we feel quite good about those. Julien Smith : Said differently again, you basically found the cost savings this point to fully offset the full slate of 2018 through 2020 asset sales. And again, just to make sure this is clear, that it\u2019s only billion dollars of asset sales that's reflected in that 8% to 10% or what magnitude through the full three year period? Tom O\u2019Flynn: No, it's only an additional billion, so it's Masinloc plus a billion. Operator : Our next question comes from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Greg Gordon : I have one, one other question. The language you used to describe the impact of tax reform, as you say in, near term impact of $0.08 to $0.10. What is -- does that imply that the impact, all things equal and obviously this is before what you're doing to offset it, changes over time? And if so, can you give us some insight into whether it gets better or worse over time and a base case before offsets? And then other than the cost cutting which you\u2019ve been announced. What are the things that you\u2019re doing to offset that base case impact of tax reform? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : So let me take at a high level and then I\u2019ll pass it to Tom. What we\u2019ve talked about is $0.05 to $0.08 initially. There are two sides, so this one is the limitations on interest, expense, deductibility related to EBITDA in the U.S. And the second is the global intangible low tax income. Now, there remains a lot to be clarified on this law. So this is -- we\u2019re taking conservative approach to it. Why does this change overtime, well it changes because your asset base changes and also has to do with your level of indebtedness, changes overtime. So what happens overtime it gets better as the effects of a lower tax rate kick in. So that\u2019s number one. Number two, as Tom said in his speech, we really clean the slate by basically using our NOLs to pay for the tax expense of deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. So really as a result of it, we\u2019ll have a much more transparent tax position as time goes by. Now, we do need a further clarity, clarifying need to make sure that any actions we take to optimize our capital efficiency are the ones in the long term. So with that I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom. Tom O\u2019Flynn: Greg, I think we say near-term it\u2019s a two to three year period. We look beyond that we\u2019re seeing lower impacts based on we see in that -- as we see it. There is lot of moving parts but in general as we work through our NOL position and as part of the charging took at the end of the year and the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings, we used about $1.9 billion of our NOL. So as our NOL decrease and we move towards a taxable position over the next two to three years, the overall impact of tax reform from an earnings standpoint can actually be less. But I would probably say near-term $0.05 to $0.08 call it two to three years. And then as we look at it, we would see that number of potentials right down. Obviously, we\u2019re trying to make numbers lower and having the ramp down effect accelerated possible. So those are the things that are still work in progress. Greg Gordon : And all that being said, that\u2019s fully baked into the growth rate expectations that you\u2019re aspiring to earnings and cash flow? Tom O\u2019Flynn: Yes, we have the $0.05 to $0.08 impact baked into 2020. Operator : The next question is from [Gregg Orrill] of UBS. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Maybe you\u2019ve address this a bit earlier. But in terms of your stance to keep AES Gener investment grade. What do you think is required there? What levers would you pull? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Well, we\u2019ve basically been pulling the levers we talked about in the past. We said Gener have a lot of levers, realized that Gener had a very good year in 2017. So we\u2019ve had some asset sales, sales in non-core assets. We have sold a peaking plant. And we\u2019re also in the process of selling some other non-core assets, which we think quite frankly were at very good multiples. And these will be used to pay down debt at Gener to shore it up. So while the Gener price has suffered greatly in the last say two years, at the same time, Gener in terms of if you look at it, our earnings this year or cash flow is really at record levels due to the fact that we cut the ribbon on time and on budget on the other projects. So Gener again, we will keep it the investment grade, there are a lot of levers to pull. And as we said, we weren't putting in more money from AES into Gener. Tom O\u2019Flynn: Gregg, I\u2019ll just say, basically the dividend we got last year from Gener was around $160 million, $170 million, it was AES share. And all the numbers we expect to have to be a lower number. I don't want to get specific because obviously Gener is a public company, but I\u2019ll just leave it that we are being more conservative with expectations for \u201918 until Alto Maipo gets tied up moving forward. Operator : The next question is from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steve Fleishman : The question on the cost cuts and you said strengthening the 8% to 10%. Could you maybe just give a little more color on what you mean by strengthening? Are you seeing yourself higher in the range or you have more cushion in the event that something doesn't go right. How should I think about that? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Well, I think when we talk about strengthening, it\u2019s quite frankly. I\u2019ll say decreasing the band, increasing the certainty that you're going to hit your numbers. We had a lot of these things, I would say, in the works but it certainly feels good to have executed on them. So just to be clear on the cost savings program that we just announced, I mean, that's mostly executed. And we will have those numbers in hand in the first half of this year. And of course, we have the one time severance costs as well included in our number. So most of this is that we feel that as we execute, we reduce the -- or increase the certainty around our numbers and makes them more robust to any unforeseen possibility. Steve Fleishman : And as you stand today, what do you see as the biggest risk to achieving the growth target, if any? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Well, I would say, look. We have I think listed them. I think it's very important to close an Alto Maipo that we have, even though it does mean Gener has to make material contributions, this is very dramatic shift and the risk of this project, because we're going from one where essentially when it came to geological risk, it was cost plus to a one where we have certainty on the cost. And second, where we really have one contractor rather than two and that contractor will have significant skin in the game and every incentive to finish at the lowest cost and as early as possible. So I think that is very important. I think, you know, as I mentioned regarding Bulgaria, this is something that we have to see the resolution of it. We think we're in a very strong position, like we thought we were -- when we ran at the \u20ac400 million of IOUs. But stay tuned, because it's too early to say where that would turnout. I think that we have opportunities for the upside in a number of our markets. I am very encouraged by the returns we're getting on our renewables and gas projects, especially outside the U.S., we have an excellent pipeline of projects in Mexico, dollar denominated with private sector off takers. I'm very excited about the solar plus energy storage possibilities. We're excited about the sPower pipeline. And regarding Fluence, I think we're seeing that that market is starting to turn. This is a classic new technology, which will go through s-curve and we have to see when that turns up. Now speaking about Fluence, I think that\u2019s more of a play where it\u2019s not incremental earnings per year it\u2019s just really creating a lot of value, three years to five years from now probably, like we did with the Brazilian Telecom. Steve Fleishman : And then last question just on the -- Tom, I think you mentioned something about a potential partner for sPower. Could you give a little more color on that and just -- or is it just mainly for somebody who would buy a stake in current operating projects? Tom O\u2019Flynn: Steve, we\u2019ve been approached by some parties about stakes in operating projects. And it would be something that we would do obviously with [s] and with AIMCo jointly. I mean it\u2019s just reinforces that value of their operating portfolio where we\u2019re obviously quite focused in the growth portfolio. But it reinforces the value of their operating portfolio and it\u2019s potentially attractive to some co-investors, so we\u2019ll see. Steve Fleishman : And how it effectively part of your asset sales? Tom O\u2019Flynn: Yes, it\u2019s part of a bucket of opportunities, basket of opportunities, yes. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : So instead of opportunities, $2 billion we got $1 billion is Masinloc of the billion dollar set, the set of opportunities is greater than billion. Operator : The next question is from Charles Fishman of Morningstar Research. Please go ahead. Charles Fishman : Just specific I guess I\u2019m looking at slide 52 where you break down the adjusted PTC breaking by SBU. And Andes certainly had some strong growth, \u201918 versus \u201917. And I realized you don\u2019t -- you\u2019re not giving, when you talk about 8% to 10%, you\u2019re not breaking it down by SBU. But certainly, there is some very significant growth opportunities that you\u2019ve outlined in the U.S. as well as MCAC. I thought that maybe with the problems at Alto Maipo it would maybe take the wind out of the sales of the growth in Andes, and yet you hadn\u2019t good growth in \u201818. Am I being too hard on -- or the other opportunities in that SBU just greatly outlaying the problems at Alto Maipo or is Alto Maipo not as bigger hit as maybe I thought and I realized you haven\u2019t disclose that. Where am I going wrong maybe on my outlook for Andes? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Let me clarify. First, remember that again Gener had a record year last year. The Alto Maipo issues are perspective. This is not current. The drop in the price of Gener stock is part of I think a decrease in prospective prices, the market is thinking what are the future prices. Now realize Gener is fully contracted through 2023 and 50% thereafter, realize also that Gener is taking a very large market share of commercial and industrial contracts. So Gener is a strong company an investment grade company. Now talking about Andes itself, we had a very good year in Argentina. We have 3 gigawatts of excellent assets in our Argentina, we\u2019ve always had. We\u2019ve had relatively low debt in Argentina. So to the extent that the wholesale market has liberalized in Argentina and dollarized, this has been a positive for us. Also realize that AES Gener is about 30% Columbia, 30% hydro in Chivor. So Andes is a SBU, it\u2019s much more than just Alto Maipo, and you realize that you're talking about, in total, almost 7gigawatts of capacity that you have in Andes and Alto Maipo being 500. So the important thing I think is to resolve Alto Maipo to decrease the uncertainty and I would expect to have a positive reaction in terms of Gener stock and hopefully AES stock as well. Charles Fishman : So really Andes will contribute again realizing you're not breaking the 8% to 10% down by SBU. But you foresee Andes contributing through that 8% to 10%, just along with U.S. and MCAC, correct? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : I'd say certainly we don't see it as a drag. I mean, we have interesting renewable opportunities in the region and that even Gener has solar projects now under construction. So there is a lot of opportunities in the region. And what we are looking forward to is resolving the issues of Alto Maipo and have certainty, and getting pass that and really focus on the other projects in the future. Charles Fishman : Well, it sounds like your team has done excellent job of being close to resolving a difficult situation in Alto Maipo, so that's certainly a positive. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Lasan Johong of Auvila. Please go ahead. LasanJohong: Andr\u00e9s, I'm a little confused. In the press release, it says that ASC classifying and Eletropaulo as a discontinued operation. And then Tom said that is going to be deconsolidated. My understanding was there going to deconsolidated not sold. So is there a change in status of Electropaulo? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : It\u2019s both deconsolidated and classified under discontinued operations. So that would be, as I said, will be part of -- so it\u2019s true on both counts. In other words, our revenues and operating costs and everything don't flow through our financials, which makes our financials much easier to understand, especially given the debt and unfunded pension and those kinds of things. But also as classified as discontinued operations that would say that we're going to continue on our strategic shift with respect to Electropaulo and assess our ownership interest. LasanJohong: So at some point, it would be up for sale? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : I don't want to get too specific, it\u2019s a public company, but that\u2019s being -- I think discontinued operations, you can bring it from there. LasanJohong: Make our own assessment, okay. Andr\u00e9s, it sounds like AES is moving much more towards a carbon de-risking portfolio in the U.S. And so it's interesting, the development of sPower going forward. Would it be advisable at some point for AES to sell IPL and DPL and use that capital to bolster both sPower\u2019s development program and maybe do further renewable acquisitions in the U.S.? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : To me put a little bit carbon de-risking in perspective. So we're taking a balanced approach. We can see that coal could have a role to play in some markets well into the future. If you take our U.S. operations, for example, IPL, IPL will go from 79% coal to about 44% coal when we cut ribbon on Eagle Valley. So what we\u2019re really talking about is we see this as a long-term sort of de-risking. And we also will be doing things like we have found ways to run our coal plans at lower means, we\u2019re talking about taking down from 50%, 40% down to around 20%. So this combined with at certain hours of the day very cheap renewables will allow us to run our coal -- decrease our carbon footprint, but at the same time take advantage of our coal plants using basically like large batteries. So when you talk about something like, IPL we think it\u2019s -- or DPL, these are part of that strategy and that they really complement what we are in terms of the various sources of financing we have and the various growth opportunities. So right now we would consider those utilities as core to our business proposition. LasanJohong: Last question to Tom, the interest deduction restricts on the U.S. portion. Obviously, back on the envelop calculation, it looks like about $20 million to $30 million would not qualify out of about $265 million. Is that about right, are we in the same for the ballpark? Tom O\u2019Flynn: Just on a standalone basis, it\u2019s hard to look at the tax -- any tax piece of puzzle in isolation. But our U.S. income that would be available to shelter our interest would be less than that. Keep in mind that the U.S. income that\u2019s in the utilities and some of the other investments is not income that\u2019s available to offset interest, but it\u2019s a longer story than that. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : I think it\u2019s in our interest\u2026 LasanJohong: Just an unregulated stuff\u2026 Tom O\u2019Flynn: But as always, it\u2019s not quite that simple. I would say just coming down meaningfully our interest last year was about -- was well over 200, I think as we see it after paying down the billion dollars of debt and also looking at some other opportunities, we\u2019ll be under $200 million on a run-rate by mid-year. So next year we expect interest to be maybe $180 million or something in that ballpark. So by reducing debt, we\u2019re meaningfully limiting the issue. LasanJohong: So next year how much of the interest expense would not qualify for the reduction? Tom O\u2019Flynn: I think there is a lot of moving parts that started baking all together and said $0.05 to $0.08. And once again, it\u2019s hard to look at. Even some as before and some of the issue we talked about access taxes on foreign that could be an offset in part to the interest. So it\u2019s a lot of different equations but just to boil it down, we think $0.05 to $0.08 for the next two years or three years. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ahmed Pasha for any closing remarks. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research Lasan Johong - Auvila Research Consulting Charles Fishman - Morningstar Inc. Operator : Good morning, and welcome to The AES Corporation's First Quarter 2018 Financial Review Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ahmed Pasha, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ahmed Pasha : Thank you, Austin. Good morning, and welcome to AES' First Quarter 2018 Financial Review Call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning are Andr\u00e9s Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom O'Flynn, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will now turn the call over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s? Andr\u00e9s Weilert : Thank you, Ahmed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2018 financial review call. Since our last call, we have made significant progress on a number of fronts. We delivered first quarter adjusted EPS of $0.28 and remain confident in our full year outlook. We continue to transform the company, simplifying and streamlining our businesses, reducing costs and improving our overall risk profile. Since our last call, AES Gener has significantly derisked the Alto Maipo hydro project in Chile by signing a new fixed-price construction contract. We implemented the $100 million annual cost reduction program that we announced on our last call. We closed the sales of 2 gigawatts of merchant generation, including 1 gigawatt of coal-fired capacity in the Philippines, and allocated $1 billion to reduce our parent debt, which was rewarded by the rating agencies.  We also advanced our profitable growth projects, including signing long-term U.S. dollar-denominated PPAs for more than 800 megawatts of renewable projects and signing a major long-term contract to provide storage and transportation capacity from our LNG terminal in the Dominican Republic. Finally, we're excited about being a leader in applying new technologies to reduce our operating costs and deliver innovative solutions to our customers.  With these advancements and trends, I am very optimistic about the future of the company. I will now discuss these in more detail. Beginning with Alto Maipo on Slide 4. AES Gener entered into a new contract with Strabag, the principal contractor, and is securing additional funding from project lenders and Strabag for its Alto Maipo hydroelectric project in Chile. The new contract is fixed-price and lump sum, transfers all geological risk to Strabag and provides a date certain for completion, with very strong performance and completion guarantees. The restructuring agreements with Strabag and the lenders have been signed and are expected to close this week.  AES Gener, our subsidiary in which we own 67%, will be committing up to $200 million, which will be contributed to the project on a 50-50 basis upon meeting milestones along with additional nonrecourse debt. AES Gener will also commit to contribute up to another $200 million near the completion of the project in 2020, which can be used either to pay down project debt or fund any remaining project costs. On an ownership-adjusted basis, AES' maximum additional exposure will be up to $270 million. I would like to point out that all of AES Gener's Alto Maipo commitment will be funded entirely from its own cash flow and that the maximum amounts have already been factored into our cash flow forecast. By executing a fixed-price contract with a firm completion date, AES Gener has significantly reduced the risk associated with Alto Maipo. When completed in 2020, the Las Lajas, Alfalfal and Alto Maipo complex will give AES Gener 802 megawatts of hydroelectric capacity near the country's load center in Santiago and will significantly diversify AES Gener's generation mix in Chile, reducing its coal weighting from 72% to 64%.  Turning to Slide 5. To improve AES' competitiveness and achieve our goal of $100 million of additional annual cost savings, we restructured our strategic business units and reduced our global workforce by 12%, including eliminating 30% of management positions. This leaner, simpler corporate structure will improve our agility, and the related cost savings will strengthen our ability to deliver on our long-term financial commitments.  Turning to Slide 6. As you know, our success in asset sales has allowed us to meaningfully derisk our portfolio while, at the same time, unlocking value. A good example is the recent sale of our Masinloc business in the Philippines, which we closed at an attractive P/E multiple of 20. With this sale, we reduced our exposure to merchant coal and also exited the Philippines. Today, approximately 90% of our earnings are from just 8 countries.  Next, beginning on Slide 7, I will provide you with an update on our profitable growth initiatives, starting with our projects under construction. Last month, our 671-megawatt Eagle Valley combined-cycle plant in Indiana became operational. With Eagle Valley, we have replaced nearly half of IPL's coal-fired generation with cleaner and more efficient natural gas.  Now turning to our 1.3-gigawatt Southland combined-cycle project on Slide 8, which is a redevelopment of our existing gas generation in Southern California. Construction is proceeding as planned and is on track to be operational by the first half of 2020.  Turning now to Slide 9 and our 380-megawatt Col\u00f3n combined-cycle project in Panama. In April, we achieved first synchronization and completed the steam blow of one unit. The project is on track, and we project the commissioning of the plant early in the second half of this year. As you may remember, we're also building an LNG regasification and storage facility on the same site. The regasification facility is complete and will receive Panama's first LNG shipment this month. We will utilize a floating storage unit until the storage tank is completed next year. LNG is going to play an important role in Panama as it does today in the Dominican Republic. I will discuss our overall LNG strategy shortly.  Finally, turning to Slide 10. In Hawaii, we're delivering 2 solar-plus-storage facilities for a total of 47 megawatts of solar and 34 megawatts of 5-hour-duration energy storage on the island of Kaua'i. The first of these pioneering projects is under construction and will satisfy energy demand during peak hours as well as the rest of the day. Once both of these projects are completed, they will represent the largest solar-plus-storage installation in the world.  Our remaining construction projects are proceeding as planned, including our 1.3-gigawatt thermal plant, OPGC 2, in India. These projects under construction will be key contributors to our earnings and cash flow growth through 2020. Now on to Slide 11. We have been reshaping our portfolio to deliver attractive returns to our shareholders while reducing our carbon exposure. Our focus is on natural gas and renewable projects with long-term U.S. dollar-denominated contracts. On a blended basis, these investments are projected to produce low to mid-teen IRRs, assuming conservative terminal values. For example, the renewable investments we made in 2017 are earning a weighted average 10% after-tax return in the U.S. and more than 16% in Brazil and Mexico. Looking forward, we expect to earn low double-digit returns in the U.S. as we focus on new development at sPower and AES Distributed Energy.  These compelling returns are driven by several factors, including, using our business platforms and global scale to lower costs such as PV panel and wind turbine purchases; utilizing local debt capacity in the businesses to fund these investments; bringing in partners to reduce our equity commitments while providing management and development fees; and about half of our investments are in markets with lower renewable penetration and faster electricity demand growth than the U.S. Turning to Slide 12. Year-to-date, we have achieved significant milestones on the 838 megawatts of renewable projects in our development pipeline. Specifically in the U.S., sPower signed long-term PPAs for a total of 618 megawatts of solar and wind, and AES Distributed Energy signed long-term PPAs for 120 megawatts of solar. This capacity will come online between 2018 and 2020.  In Argentina, the government has implemented profound reforms to improve the long-term sustainability of the power sector. Electricity tariffs have been raised and are now denominated in U.S. dollars. The government also established a public bidding process for 25 gigawatts of additional capacity through 2025. As part of this process, AES Argentina agreed to acquire a 100-megawatt wind development project, which has a 20-year U.S. dollar-denominated PPA. The project will be funded 100% by AES Argentina.  In summary, as you can see on Slide 13, we will be adding 6.6 gigawatts of new capacity by 2020, which is the equivalent of 20% of our current installed capacity. Of the new capacity being added, 5 gigawatts are projects either under construction or recently acquired. The remaining 1.6 gigawatts are projects in advanced-stage development, 80% of which are under signed contracts. These additions will help us to significantly extend our average contract life, which Tom will discuss shortly. Next, I'd like to discuss the opportunities to expand our LNG business in Central America and the Caribbean on Slide 14. We see ourselves as well positioned to take advantage of the growth of low-cost U.S. LNG exports due to our existing platforms, market knowledge and marketing partnership with ENGIE. As you may know, we own the only 2 LNG storage terminals in the Caribbean with reexport capability. We have annual storage capacity of 150 tera Btus, only half of which is contracted. Our remaining capacity is available to meet customer demand in the region, which has the potential to grow sixfold to 800 tera Btus per year.  As we discussed on our last call, in the Dominican Republic, we will build another gas pipeline to connect our LNG terminal with the East, where there is significant demand from generators and transportation. To that end, yesterday, we signed a long-term gas supply contract with an anchor client. We expect to earn attractive returns on the sale of our excess LNG capacity as it does not require any new investment. The Eastern pipeline will not require any cash from corp either as it will be funded locally. We're also excited about our leadership in applying new technologies, such as drones and digitalization, to reduce operating costs and deliver innovative solution to our customers. Our most mature example is lithium-ion-based energy storage on Slide 15. Fluence, our recently launched joint venture with Siemens, has contracts that will double its current installed capacity from 259 megawatts to 514 megawatts, and they're pursuing an additional 2.5 gigawatts of sales opportunity.  Turning to Slide 16. AES has made a modest strategic investment in Simple Energy. Simple Energy has a digital platform that serves 29 utilities in the U.S., including IPL and DPL, with access to over 35 million end customers. Simple Energy's digital platform allows utilities to accelerate energy efficiency and demand response programs while improving customer experience.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom to discuss our financial results, capital allocation, guidance and expectations in more detail. Thomas O'Flynn: Thanks, Andr\u00e9s. Good morning. Today, I'll review our first quarter results, improving credit profile and capital allocation. We started 2018 well, with higher contributions from all of our SBUs. As shown on Slide 18, adjusted EPS was $0.28 for the first quarter, putting us on track to achieve our full year guidance of $1.15 to $1.25. Much of our growth in the quarter was driven by higher margins in the U.S. and South America, reflecting higher regulated pricing and lower maintenance costs. We also benefited from a lower tax rate and debt paydown at the parent.  Now Slide 19. We earned $288 million in adjusted PTC during the first quarter, an increase of $98 million. As part of our cost reduction program, we've streamlined our structure and will be reporting our financial results in 4 segments down from 5. US and Utilities includes the U.S. and Puerto Rico plus the utilities in El Salvador. South America combines our previous Andes and Brazil SBUs and includes Chile, Colombia, Argentina and Brazil. MCAC is comprised of Mexico, Panama and the Dominican Republic. And the Eurasia segment remains unchanged.  Now I'll cover our results in more detail over the next 4 slides, beginning on Slide 20. In the US and Utilities, PTC improved due to lower maintenance costs and higher regulated rates at DPL in Ohio following the resolution of ESP last November. Results also reflect higher availability in Hawaii and lower maintenance expense in Puerto Rico. In South America, improved results reflect higher tariffs in Argentina following market reforms enacted in early 2017 as well as higher contract pricing in Chile and Colombia. This was partially offset by the favorable settlement of a legal dispute at Uruguaiana in Brazil in 2017.  In MCAC, higher PTC was largely driven by Panama, where we've seen a return to more normal hydro conditions. We've also benefited from higher availability and the completion of the combined cycle last year in the Dominican Republic. Finally, in Eurasia, our results primarily reflect higher energy prices in the United Kingdom, offset by the sale of our businesses in Kazakhstan. Over the last few years, we've taken a number of steps to reposition our portfolio towards markets with attractive risk-return profiles. We've also been extending the contract lives of our generation businesses, as seen on Slide 24. We've been reducing volatility by selling assets with merchant exposure and investing in new businesses with long-term contracts and sustainable, competitive positions. This has increased our average remaining contract life to 8 years. Looking forward to 2020, we expect this to increase to 10 years as we bring online the growth projects in our pipeline. It's also important to keep in mind that about 15% of our PTC is from stable regulated T&D or integrated utilities, which are not reflected in this average contract life. Using 30 years as a proxy for regulated businesses would imply a blended average life of about 13 years in 2020.  I'd also note that most of our PPAs are in line with the market so that future recontracting should be at similar prices and margins. One exemption is the Gener in Chile where the average remaining contract term is around 10 years. Contract prices are above market, but we believe that is more than fully reflected in Gener's current stock price. In fact, accounting only for the present value of Gener's PPAs and our hydro assets in Chile and Colombia, we believe the net equity value of Gener is well in excess of its current market cap.  Now to Slide 25 and our improving credit profile. In the first quarter, we made significant progress towards achieving our investment-grade goals. After closing the Masinloc sale, we allocated $1 billion to pay down parent debt. We also refinanced nearly $1 billion of high coupon bonds, with new notes averaging 4.25% for annualized interest savings of $25 million.  As a result, net of transaction costs, we expect to end the year with roughly $3.8 billion of parent debt. This puts us well on our way towards achieving investment-grade metrics in 2019 and ratings by 2020. We believe this will help us to not only reduce our cost of debt and improve our financial flexibility but also enhance our equity valuation. We're pleased that the commitment to improve our credit profile continues to be recognized by the rating agencies, as shown on Slide 26. In March, S&P upgraded us to BB+, and Moody's revised our outlook to positive. In addition to improvement at the parent, DPL received an upgrade from S&P and is now investment grade. This is a result of our actions to significantly derisk DPL by exiting 3 gigawatts of merchant generation and paying down $1 billion in debt since 2011. Now to 2018 parent capital allocation on Slide 27, which is in line with prior disclosure. Staying on the left-hand side, sources reflect $1.9 billion of total available discretionary cash, including $600 million to $675 million of parent free cash flow. Sources also reflect $1.25 billion in asset sale proceeds, including the $1 billion from Masinloc and a $250 million placeholder for additional asset sales this year. As you may be aware, there are competing tenders right now for Eletropaulo in Brazil, with an auction scheduled for June 4. We're assessing options for our stake, which is currently valued at about $265 million.  Now to uses on the right-hand side of the slide. Including the 8.3% dividend increase we announced in December, we'll be returning $345 million to shareholders this year. We'll use over $1 billion to reduce parent debt, including revolver drawings. And we plan to invest at least $250 million on our subsidiaries, primarily for projects under construction, leaving us with about $100 million of unallocated cash.  Finally, moving to our capital allocation from 2018 through 2020 on Slide 28. We expect our portfolio to generate $4.2 billion in discretionary cash or over half of our current equity market cap. More than half of this has been allocated to the current shareholder dividend and completed debt reduction. About $750 million is allocated to identified investments in our subsidiaries, including projects under construction in late-stage development.  Taking into account the additional $750 million in asset sales, we're factoring in about $450 million in additional parent debt reduction. The remaining $800 million, which is largely weighted to 2019 and 2020, is available to create additional shareholder value.  As Andr\u00e9s mentioned, we believe we have a strong set of opportunities and expect to continue to invest in some of these in 2019 and '20. As you know, since 2011, we've invested $4.2 billion to reduce our balance sheet, with almost 40% going towards share repurchases. We'll continue to compete new investment opportunities against share buybacks.  Regarding dividend growth, we've grown our dividend at an annualized rate of 9% over the last 3 years and 27% over the last 4. We believe that as our credit ratings continue to improve, we'll achieve better valuation for attractive dividend. We'll evaluate the potential level of dividend growth with our board going forward and will be influenced by the extent to which the dividend is reflected in our share price. With that, I'll turn it back to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s Weilert : Thanks, Tom. Before we take your questions, let me summarize today's call. We have delivered strong results during the quarter and implemented the $100 million cost savings program. We remain on track to achieve investment-grade credit metrics in 2019. We're making progress on our 4 gigawatts of projects under construction. We have continued to transform, simplify and derisk our portfolio while delivering attractive, long-term growth by reshaping our portfolio through selective asset sales; adding profitable investments in renewables, natural gas and LNG with long-term U.S. dollar-denominated contracts; using partnerships, management contracts and our local platforms to improve our returns; and exploiting our leadership in applying new technologies to lower expenses and grow revenues.  We expect to generate substantial amounts of discretionary cash from 2018 through 2020, which we'll deploy consistent with our capital allocation framework. And we are therefore reaffirming our full year 2018 guidance and 8% to 10% growth rate target through 2020. With that, we will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Ali Agha with SunTrust. Ali Agha : Andr\u00e9s, first question, coming back to Alto Maipo. Can you tell us now, when you look at this project and the increased equity investment going in, how should we look at the returns for this project for AES? And what does it do for sort of your overall merchant exposure, if you will, in that market? And how did you look at this decision versus the abandonment decision, which I know was one of the things you had been looking at in terms of deciding what to do with Alto Maipo? Andr\u00e9s Weilert : Sure, great question. I would say the first is that we have to look at this project in the light of AES Gener. So I think what's very important about this project is that it diversifies AES Gener from being very reliant on, say, coal generation to have a more diversified mix. As you know, there's a $5 a ton carbon tax in Chile, and having Alto Maipo will give the Gener a lot of options. And as you can see also that Gener has a very good portfolio of long-term contracts, so this gives us, the company, a lot more flexibility. The second one, thinking of the project itself, we had to really think of the returns on the marginal investments that we would make. So we are -- besides derisking the project, derisking Gener, are achieving reasonable rates of return on these additional investments. And I think also stay tuned because there are also opportunities to improve the returns on Alto Maipo. I would say, first, there is the possibility again of using it to diversify away from coal. There's also the opportunity, and this is very early stage, to apply new technologies, whether it be energy storage, for example, to have the world's first hydro project with energy storage because in Chile, you've had a big buildout of renewables, but you haven't had a big buildout of capacity. So having this capacity near the load center of Santiago, we think, will be very valuable over time. Ali Agha : And so in the context of looking at the incremental return, in the past, in your slides, you had assumed zero return for Alto Maipo in terms of the equity that has gone in. So for the incremental investment, how should we think about -- is it low single-digit? Or roughly how should we be thinking about that? Andr\u00e9s Weilert : Well, look, well, we said that there would be no returns, nothing in our forecast through 2020. So we have assumed, and you will notice that we used the word up to because there's the possibility of having partners come into this project. So we have up to. We have said that there were no returns for the 2020 period, and we have very modest projections going forward from the project. But we do think again that having 800 megawatts of hydro capacity near the load center, thinking of AES Gener and thinking of the whole complex, remember, this is an expansion of an existing facility, which was built in 1985, we'll have better returns. So stay tuned. I think this is an important step to reduce the risk, get dates certain and the -- getting the contractor to step up, put in significant completion guarantees and provide part of the financing. Ali Agha : Yes. Separately, on the asset sale front, I just wanted to clarify, the Eletropaulo stake, assuming the auction goes, and as you mentioned, it's currently $265 million for you, that would go as part of the asset sale program that you laid out. So in other words, Eletropaulo alone gets you to the $1.25 billion rough target that you have for the year. And related to that, if you do another $750 million on top of that, are you then done, and is your portfolio where you would like it to be? Or are there more opportunities even beyond that extra billion? Andr\u00e9s Weilert : Okay, let me take the multipart question. The first, the answer is yes. Eletropaulo would get us to the amounts that we talked about this year. That is $250 million. Then the remaining $750 million that we had identified, well, that could be selldowns. That could be selling out of some businesses. I think we'll continue to optimize our portfolio. So there is no hard limit on this. To the extent that we can get partnerships in places where we could sell down and improve our returns on invested capital, we will do so. So again, we are, I think, in a strong position. All of our businesses are making money and that we have this opportunity going forward. So as you'll note, the numbers that Tom gave are quite conservative in terms of sales and what we can achieve this year. Ali Agha : Right. Lastly, you didn't mention it this time, so I thought I'd ask. Any updates on Maritza given what you told us last quarter? Andr\u00e9s Weilert : Yes. We had identified that in Bulgaria, we were in talks with the Bulgarian government regarding, let's say, the claim of illegal state aid on the PPA of Maritza. I would say those discussions continue underway. I don't think anything will happen in the very short term. They are up-to-date on their payments. We're getting paid regularly. The plant is performing well. The plant is necessary for the Bulgarian system. So it's really a question of, how will we resolve this issue for the -- for a win-win situation for the Bulgarian energy system and us? So stay tuned. And again, the -- I would say we're progressing constructively. Operator : And our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Can you hear me? Andr\u00e9s Weilert : We can hear you loud and clear. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Well, just to follow up on Ali's question just real quickly, just to be perhaps exceptionally clear about the Alto Maipo situation. How does this change your financial forecast at the end of the day versus what you all had talked about last quarter? Because I know some of this had been -- potentially would be partially contemplated. So I just want to be very clear about that, and I got a follow-up. Andr\u00e9s Weilert : Okay. The first question, it doesn't change it at all, zero. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay, excellent. Just wanted to be very clear about that. And then separately, if I can follow up here. Asset sales, how are you thinking about U.S. versus international and then gas versus coal selldowns? I mean, obviously, there's kind of a repositioning taking place here, but I'd be curious about priorities and opportunities. Andr\u00e9s Weilert : Well, I would say that first, we were in 28 markets. We're down to 15. 5 years ago, I said somewhere between 15 and 12 was the optimal number. So again, stay tuned for that. Regarding -- our priority, quite frankly, has been to sell merchant and specialty coal assets. So if you think of the Philippines, you think of some of the DPL, you think of some of the assets we've sold, and that's just basically because as part of our derisking, I mean, we derisk the company from hydrology, we derisk it from a commodity point of view, from a currency point of view. We also think that derisking from a carbon intensity point of view is important for the long term. So of that, that would be really our priority. We can hit both carbon intensity and merchant, like the Philippines, that is ideal. Now regarding selldowns in the states, we have partnerships in the states, and we can sell down to the extent that, one, it improves our returns; and two, it gives us capital to redeploy. As I mentioned in my script, that to the extent we do more development and new projects with sPower, we will improve our average returns. So there's a lower price obviously for spinning assets than there is for developing greenfield projects. So we are focused on increasing our returns on invested capital. We're increasing on -- focused on, I'd say, continued derisking long-term dollar-denominated contracts. So you put that all together, our contract length will increase substantially by the end of this year. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. And can I follow up just real quickly? I think this may be more of a time question. You talked about the PV of the PPAs as well as the hydro asset in Chile and Colombia being, I think, well in excess of the current value. I just want to be very clear, can you elaborate on that a little bit? And is that net of the -- both the recourse and nonrecourse debt at those subsidiaries? Thomas O'Flynn: Yes, Julien, that's fair. That's how we looked at it. We just did an asset -- as we look at it, and we obviously do this on a regular basis, look at the major assets, which is the PPAs. And once again, they're average 10 years, but some of them are much longer. The average life of them is 10 years, including Alto Maipo. But you look at the value of the PPAs plus the value of the hydro at fairly conservative level zone dollar per kilowatt. And you look at the liabilities, which should be all of the debt, and we compare that to the value of the equity, and we think the equity value -- or that the net asset value, if you will, is well in excess of the current equity market cap. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And just to be clear, can you elaborate on discount rates or anything? I mean, I'd just be curious by how much you see that delta. Thomas O'Flynn: Yes. Probably want to stay away from the details and maybe some broader discussion, but it's probably better to take place at the higher level, I mean, a little sensitive given the higher -- public level. But it's asset and liabilities both, so it's not as discount rate sensitive as you might think. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. All right, fair enough. And just lastly, very quickly, the LNG updates, how material is that in terms of your outlook for the Dominican Republic? Andr\u00e9s Weilert : Well, we have one gas pipeline from the Andres facility to Los Mina. This would be significantly -- I'd say the potential is significantly larger than that. We cannot disclose the amount in the contract. But I would say that this -- once the pipeline is built to the East, there's significant upside. We have some of the upside of the current contract built in, but there's significant contract -- upside for more. So I think just the important message, I think, here is that we still have about more than 40% of this storage capacity at Andres under -- not utilized. So there's a -- anything to increase the utilization essentially comes to our bottom line. And the same will be true for Panama. We're only going to be -- we're going to be using less than 40% of that tank, and there's -- any additional clients that we put on would just make that project more attractive. So we always use our projections based on our own plant, but we expect additional usage. And in the DR, we have good experience with that. We're already selling 10% to -- not to ourselves but to third parties for transportation and commercial use. Operator : And our next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore. Gregory Gordon : So looking at Slide 28, it seems fairly straightforward, just the update from Q4. You've just sliced -- there was a bucket of $1.25 billion of unallocated discretionary cash in Q4, which you've now sort of sliced into $450 million, which is essentially targeted for potential debt paydown and $800 million, which is still unallocated versus the $1.25 billion that was unallocated on the Q4 call. What's the math there, that the $450 million is what you need to get to the targeted credit metrics to tip you to investment grade, and then therefore there was $800 million left over? Or is there some other rationale there? Thomas O'Flynn: Yes. Greg, it's Tom. It's very consistent with what we had last time. Last time, I think we had $1.25 billion, and then we had a note to the side with about $400 million of debt -- of potential debt retirements And we just wanted to be more clear and break that into a separate wedge, ergo, the $450 million wedge. But it is looking at, yes, from our own -- from our standpoint, with $1.25 billion of asset sales, including Masinloc and the placeholder, $250 million, we think we just need to do another $100 million or -- $100 million, maybe $200 million debt paydown to get -- to do investment grade fast, to get to investment-grade stats. That said, we're going to sell another $750 million of assets. Depending upon the cash flow of those assets, we're putting a placeholder in for some more debt retirement as a part of use of proceeds from those asset sales. So the $800 million -- so that's an estimate. Obviously, it could change up or down based upon how rich the cash flow is of the assets we're selling, but we wanted to break it out to be more clear. Gregory Gordon : So the $800 million wedge is the use of that proceeds will flex based on the outcomes in terms of asset sale prices and cash flow, that sort of... Thomas O'Flynn: Yes, but we think that's a good number. I mean, we think -- we believe we'll get to the $2 billion. We're at $1.25 billion now. And I think we've shown a record of hitting our asset sale numbers earlier and with bigger numbers. So we're comfortable we'll get there in the $800 million. That's a big movement in the numbers. Gregory Gordon : Yes, no doubt. I'm not questioning that at all. I'm -- just sort of almost a rhetorical question that the $800 million -- where the $800 million gets consumed will be a function of the price you get and the cash flow that goes with those assets, correct? Thomas O'Flynn: Yes. Andr\u00e9s Weilert : Yes. Gregory Gordon : Okay. And then my second question is just a cleanup question, too, on Slide 50. I know it's all the way in the back of the deck. But the slide that, that replaced used to have ROE and cash yield targets for the portfolio. Now I'm just wondering, obviously, the Alto Maipo returns are under pressure. But when we look at Col\u00f3n, OPGC 2 and Southland repowering, are the expected returns on those investments the same as they were in the Q4 deck? Or has something also changed there? Ahmed Pasha : Yes. Greg, this is Ahmed. Yes, you're right. I think, given that we have already included a slide on return, Slide 11, so we thought, I mean, the returns are pretty much in the same ballpark range. So yes, you don't need to read anything between the lines, but the returns are somewhere close to mid-teens. Gregory Gordon : Okay, that's actually what I thought. I just wanted to sort of confirm that. Ahmed Pasha : Yes, yes. Gregory Gordon : And then my final question for the call anyway is always questions. But you talked about potentially bringing in third-party capital to, I mean, coinvest with you in certain types of projects. Have you seen any interest in coinvesting in things like the Fluence JV or sPower from third parties that would sort of help validate the potential growth -- the growth potential in those businesses and help you free up some of your discretionary cash? Andr\u00e9s Weilert : Yes, I'd say that -- let's take the Fluence. We just launched it. Its cash needs are very modest as it gears up together with Siemens. So I mean, at this very first stage, clearly, I think we have to grow that business and really, let's say, get the market share that we're aiming for, which is around 20%, 25% of that market. First, I think it's way too early to think about bringing in third money for a validation here. This is -- it's a different business from the usual. And usually, when we think about partners, it's on more mature businesses. So if there are situations where we can bring in a partner for, say, spinning assets and then take that money and redeploy it at higher returns or bring in a partner and receive a management fee or a development fee, that's it. So Fluence would not be one of those, let's say, in -- certainly in the short term. Thomas O'Flynn: I think, Greg, regarding sPower, I think we've said maybe on the last call that we have had some incoming inquiries from some financial investors about taking an interest in some of the operating assets or pieces of the operating assets. And those are things that we are pursuing with our partnering co. We'll update you to the extent something specific unfolds, but those would be at valuations that would improve our all-in returns. Operator : And our next question is from Christopher Turnure with JPMorgan. Christopher Turnure : I wanted to get a little bit better sense on your overall growth plan in the renewables business and get a sense for how much of that you'd expect to come from U.S. or North American contracts versus outside of North America, and within the U.S., maybe you could comment on the market that you're seeing for corporate counterparties versus utilities. Andr\u00e9s Weilert : That's a good question. As we said, today, we're sort of half and half in terms of the new projects that we're signing. We do see increasing demand from corporates, and that is one of the most exciting areas for, say, sPower. We're also seeing sort of community solar for distributed energy in the U.S. In the case of outside of the U.S., which is basically Latin America, what we're seeing is more sort of auctions, be it in Argentina or be it in Brazil, for renewable power. We are making significant inroads, say, in Chile with commercial and industrial customer PPAs. So we're seeing this sort of blend and extend in a lot of our markets, and corporates are becoming more important. And I'd say the -- probably the majority of the corporates are looking for renewable energy. So regarding the sort of mix, the pipeline of sPower is quite large. We've talked about 10 gigawatts. And it's very solid, and we're seeing that they're having success on it. So that sort of 50-50 mix may shift a little bit towards the states. But we do have a lot of projects that will be coming online, Brazil, Argentina. We have El Salvador. And there are other markets that are also very interesting. So the key is that we have to get a PPA, which is either dollar denominated or inflation indexed. Christopher Turnure : Great. And then could you speak a little bit in more detail about the international contracts? Obviously, the returns that you detailed today are pretty good, and you mentioned that you used conservative terminal values there. But when we think about the overall package of risk that you're taking in order to get that return, is it fair to say that you're comfortable there that, whether it's FX or non-U.S. dollar-denominated contracts, capacity factor assumptions, et cetera, are all kind of where you maybe expected them to be or better versus when you entered into this JV and this investment a year plus ago? Andr\u00e9s Weilert : Well, again, the projects outside of the U.S. are not with sPower. Those are with our platforms. So I think a key component on the, I think, compelling returns that we're seeing is using our platforms. So you really have the advantage of having everything from a commercial team to a management team to everything in place. Second, you can use local leverage to optimize it, optimize your returns from it, and your local relationships. So for example, in the MCAC bucket, that return is 100% dollar-denominated contracts. The only ones that we have that are nondollar denominated are in Brazil, and those are in reais. Those are indexed to inflation. And the debt is in reais. So we feel very comfortable with this -- with the risk that we're taking on these projects because the debt and the cash flows are in the same currency. They're inflation indexed or they're dollar denominated. So these -- we think these are very, very strong contracts. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steven Fleishman : Just first, what is the date certain on Alto Maipo now? Andr\u00e9s Weilert : The date certain, we're talking about 2020. Steven Fleishman : Yes. Is there a specific date with which we can kind of track it? Andr\u00e9s Weilert : Well, here's the thing, with Alto Maipo, there are several, let's say, important milestones. So part of -- this is the -- you have the Las Lajas that's, let's say, lower down in the mountain and would be the first ones to come on. And then you'd have the Volc\u00e1n, which is the -- say, higher up in the mountain. And so that would come on at somewhat later date. But we'll start earning money as soon as the first sections are completed. Steven Fleishman : Okay. And then just how is -- what's the plan at Gener to fund the equity commitment? Andr\u00e9s Weilert : Well, Gener has sold some assets. It's strengthened its balance sheet. So Gener has the cash flow to make these investments as required. Thomas O'Flynn: They've also done a couple of asset sales, Steve. They've, with the asset sales, about $300 million that should close shortly. That's some older fossil plants. They had also said, it's public, that they're assessing the potential sale of some transmission assets. So that will be part of their -- the cash flow that would help them fund this. And also, they continue to pay a strong dividend. Steven Fleishman : Okay, great. And then on the sPower, its potential selldown, is there kind of a sense on timing of that? Thomas O'Flynn: There are discussions where -- that are ongoing. So it will be something we'd assess this year. Steven Fleishman : Okay. And then just in terms of, Tom, and, I guess, your comments on the end on potential uses of capital. And you talked about the dividend growth you've done and then trying to assess whether you're going to get kind of credit in the stock for it and buybacks and the like. Just is there kind of a time horizon when you will be in a position to have kind of really made that assessment? I -- because I guess you're not really getting to investment grade until 2020, which is still a couple of years away. So is that the time line? Or is it sooner than that? Just how are you going to think about this from a time standpoint? Andr\u00e9s Weilert : Steve, well, we just raised the dividend 8.3% this year. And I think we have the strongest track record in terms of growing the dividend. So what we are doing is strengthening our credit. So we're in, we think, a very coherent position of being investment grade or having investment-grade metrics and paying a substantial dividend. So as Tom mentioned, we will review any increase of the dividend at the year-end with our board. But we just made a dividend increase. That's a bit early. Then regarding sort of the use of capital for stock buybacks, we've also said we made very significant stock buybacks of the company. And we will assess those over time if there's a need for any stock buybacks. But I think what's very important, our priority is, first, getting to investment grade. Second, you -- we have some very attractive investment opportunities that we should complete. And I think that in terms of the derisking of our portfolio, it's very important to understand, like we have 777 megawatts of hydro in Panama. With the completion of the combined-cycle gas plant, those hydro assets should be more valuable because you're really going to have a cap on hydro -- on energy prices in years of drought. So it's going to lower the volatility and strengthen the earnings from that. The other thing to realize is that in the Dominican Republic and in Panama, we -- since we have the reexport capabilities, there's some very attractive upside. So we have to take those things into consideration. But I would point out, we have made very substantial stock buybacks in the past, and we just raised our dividend as well. Steven Fleishman : Okay. I guess my -- I'm just trying to interpret the answer there. So it's something where you're going to give it time because obviously, you've just raised the dividend, and you're not going to kind of change course quickly on that, it would seem. Andr\u00e9s Weilert : Yes, that's correct, that's correct. Operator : And our next question comes from Lasan Johong with Auvila Research Consulting. Lasan Johong : Tom, kind of hypothetical for you, maybe you may not want to answer this question. But if you -- if AES had $1 billion of unallocated cash, would you rather buy back AES stock or make a risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital plus 1% investment? Thomas O'Flynn: Yes. I mean, that's a part of how we look at things. I think we've done both over the past number of years. I think in the near term, going to that slide that shows capital allocation through 2020, that's what you're trying to get to, I think in the near term, we're really focused on improving our credit and getting to investment-grade stats that we think we'll do by next year, and then with some seasoning, get to investment grade, we would expect by 2020. So we think we do have close to $1 billion, let's call it $800 million, to think about, it's really a '19 and '20 level of thought. And we do look at returns on investment opportunities. We do take them in the context of the overall business, not just one-off assets because we do think about things on a platform basis, not on a one-off, you-pump-it-out, asset basis. And we do -- and we will look at that relative to the share purchase, which is what we've done in the past. Lasan Johong : Okay. Is the reason why -- in the past, AES has always said that if it has an asset that has no future prospects, no growth prospects, you're willing to, just kind of assuming they're spinning off cash, that it's most likely better utilized by others. DPL and IPL would fit that description to a T now that you've -- now that AES has disposable generation and so on and so forth. Is the reason why AES is still sitting on IPL and DPL because it needs it to get to the investment-grade rating? And once you -- once AES obtains the investment-grade rating and finds adequate backstops, would that be a point at which DPL and IPL make an exit from AES' portfolio? Andr\u00e9s Weilert : What I'd say is we are doubling the rate base at IPL, and we think that the new investment grade-rated DPL also has significant rate base growth. So a lot of catch-up because a lot of the utilities in the area have been investing a lot in their rate base. And DPL has not been in a situation that it could do that. And so we think -- believe there's catch-up. So no, we think there's attractive growth, risk-adjusted growth in both of those utilities, and we expect them to do quite well. Lasan Johong : That's great. Last question is, and maybe I'm beating a dead horse here, but is there a way for AES to get to a 15% to 20% compound annual growth rate over the long -- more of a longer term? And what would it take to get there? Is it impossible? Ahmed Pasha : This is Ahmed. I think we just gave our guidance, so let us deliver on this. We can talk about the rest later. Apologies. Operator : Our last question for today will be Charles Fishman with Morningstar Research. Charles Fishman : Andr\u00e9s, those of us in the utility industry, that follow the utility industry, certainly have the experience in the past year of the Westinghouse situation. And I guess my -- what we learned here is that the value of a guarantee from an EPC contractor is only as good as the checking account at the parent. How deep of a pocket does Strabag have? I mean, or is there a bank performance guarantee behind it? Or what gives you the confidence this is really of its price contract at this point? Andr\u00e9s Weilert : That's a great question. I'd say, number one, the guarantee here is from the head office, Strabag, which is an investment-grade company listed in Austria. Second, that the LCs will be bank guarantees. So when we say that there are strong guarantees, these are backed by significant, investment-grade bank LCs. So on both counts, Strabag is a company that's in good shape, and second, that these are your top-notch bank guarantees LCs. Charles Fishman : Okay. You can see where my question is coming from after the Westinghouse experience. Andr\u00e9s Weilert : No, it's a very fair question. Operator : And this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ahmed Pasha for any closing remarks. Ahmed Pasha : Thanks, Austin, and we thank everybody for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any questions you may have. Thank you, and have a nice day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ahmed Pasha, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ahmed Pasha : Thank you, Andrew. Good morning and welcome to AES' Second Quarter 2018 Financial Review Call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at www.aes.com. Today we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning are Andr\u00e9s Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom O'Flynn, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will now turn the call over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our second quarter 2018 financial review call. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.25 puts us at $0.52 for the first half of 2018, which is 24% higher than the $0.42 we earned in the first half of 2017. We will remain on track to hit our 2018 guidance and longer term expectations. Tom will discuss our results in more detail shortly.  I\u2019m pleased to report that the positive momentum of the last quarter continues. During the quarter we achieved a number of milestones towards improving our risk profile and shareholder returns. Specifically, our credit ratings were recently upgraded by Fitch and Moody's and we are now rated just one notch below investment grade by all three agencies. We expect to achieve investment grade metrics by 2019 and ratings by 2020.  We brought online the 671 megawatt Eagle Valley Combined Cycle Gas Plant in Indiana in April and we will be inaugurating the 380 megawatt CCGT and LNG regasification terminal Colon in Panama later this month. Of the remaining 3.9 gigawatts currently under construction, we expect 2 gigawatts to be commission between now and year end. We made significant progress in advancing our growth pipeline. Year-to-date we have signed nearly 1.5 gigawatts of renewable PPAs, which brings our backlog of capacity addition, including projects under construction to 5.7 gigawatts. At our utilities in the U.S., IPL and DPL we settled two rate cases. Once approved, these widely supported settlements will position both utilities for future investments. We're on track to deliver $100 million in sustainable cost savings in 2018 as a result of our restructuring and transformation program. We received $310 million in net proceeds from the sale of our interest in Eletropaulo in Brazil, reducing our regulatory risk and simplifying our financial statements.  Lastly, we continue to be a leader in applying new technologies including energy storage. Our JV with Siemens, Fluence tied 80 megawatts of new projects in three countries bringing its total to 16 and IPL\u2019s rate case settlement included one of the first rate based battery storage projects in the world.  I will now provide more details on some of these achievements beginning on slide four. Of our 4.3 gigawatts currently under construction, nearly half are expected to come online in 2018. Since our last call we have made significant progress on these projects, which I will highlight on the following few slides starting with a 380 megawatt Combined Cycle Plant in Panama on slide five.  I'm pleased to report that the regasification terminal is complete and that it has accepted the first shipment of LNG in Central American history. We expect that the entry of low cost U.S. LNG will transform the Central American energy sector, much as it has in the Dominican Republic. Construction of the combined cycle power plant is nearly complete and we expect to achieve COD in September, on-time and on-budget. The project will provide long term and predictable U.S. dollar denominated returns. The storage tank is expected to be completed in 2019. Approximately 48 of the 70 tera Btus of storage capacity is uncontracted and represents potential upside as natural gas use increases over time in the region.  Now turning to our 1.3 gigawatt, Southland Combined Cycle Plant, which is a redevelopment of our existing gas facilities in Southern California. Construction is proceeding as planned, with the project now 40% complete and on track to be operational by the first half of 2020.  Next in Hawaii, we're delivering two solar-plus storage facilities for a total of 47 megawatts of solar and 34 megawatts of five hour duration energy storage on the Island of Kaua'i. The first of these pioneering projects is under construction and will satisfy energy demand during peak hours, as well as the rest of the day.  The second for the U.S. Navy is expected to begin construction later this year. Once both of these projects are completed, they will represent the largest solar-plus storage installation in the world.  Finally, we're making good progress at our 1.3 gigawatt Thermal Plant OPGC 2 in India. Construction is advancing as planned. The project is now 96% complete and we expect the plant to come online by the end of this year on budget.  As you may recall, AES Gener successfully restructured the Alto Maipo hydroelectric project in Chile in May. Since closing the restructuring, the main contractor Strabag is performing in line with the revised EPC contract and has been meeting the agreed upon construction milestones. Alto Maipo is now 68% complete, including 56% of the tunneling work and the rate of progress on tunneling has significantly improved as of late. We expect Alto Maipo to achieve commercial operations in 2020. Our remaining construction projects are renewable energy. These projects are proceeding as planned and will be key contributors to our earnings and cash flow growth for 2020. Now turning to slide 10. We have been reshaping our portfolio to deliver attractive returns to our shareholders, while lowering risks, including reducing our carbon footprint. Our focus is on increasing the share of natural gas and renewable projects with long term U.S. dollar denominated contracts. We're earning attractive returns on our equity investments by utilizing our existing platforms, global scale, lower cost capital partners and non-recourse financing. On a portfolio basis, our investments are projected to produce low to mid-teens IRRs on average assuming conservative terminal values. We expect our projects in Latin America to earn returns better than the portfolio average.  As you can see on slide 11, so far this year we signed 1.5 gigawatts of long term PPA's for renewable projects and now expect to exceed our internal projection of 2 gigawatts for the full year 2018. Year-to-date, sPower has signed long term PPAs for 1.2 gigawatts with large credit worthy C&I customers such as Microsoft and Apple as well as utilities. This is more than double the 500 megawatts annually assigned PPAs that we expected to achieve when we acquired sPower last year. In light of our progress this year, we are on pace to assign 2 gigawatts to 3 gigawatts of new PPAs annually for 2019 and 2020. This would result in 7.5 gigawatts of new renewable PPAs being signed through 2020, all of which would be online by 2022.  To summarize, as shown on slide 12, we expect to add 11.8 gigawatts of new capacity through 2022. This includes 5.7 gigawatts of projects under construction, plus 9 PPAs which we referred to as our backlog, as well as 6 gigawatts of additional PPA's we expect to sign through 2020. Most of the capital needed for these projects will be funded by non-recourse financing and partner equity. Our equity requirements for these projects will be funded from our internally generated cash. Tom will discuss our capital allocation plan through 2020 shortly.  As I had noted, our goal is to earn attractive returns while greening our portfolio. As you can see a slide 13, renewables make up 75% of the 11.8 gigawatts of new capacity additions. The remainder is conventional generation, all of which is currently under construction and expected to come online through 2020. This growth will significantly extend our average contract life from eight years currently to 10 years by 2020 and help us achieve our goal of reducing our carbon intensity by 25%. We are also working on enhancing some of our current contracts by blending and extended existing PPAs, by adding renewable energy. We call this approach green blend and extend and we will provide more color on future calls.  I would like to emphasize that we do not plan to grow simply for the sake of adding megawatts. We will invest in new projects if and only if we can earn attractive risk adjusted returns. Finally turning to slide 14, we continue to be a leader in applying new technologies such as battery based, energy storage, since our last call of Fluence, our joint venture with Siemens, have signed contracts when additional 80 megawatts and delivered eight projects with a total capacity of 55 megawatts. Fluence has now delivered a total capacity of 271 megawatt. Total deliveries will exceed 550 megawatt in 16 countries once their existing backlog is installed.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom to discuss our financial results, capital allocation and guidance in more detail. Tom O'Flynn : Thank Andr\u00e9s. Good morning. I'll cover our second quarter results, improving credit profile and capital allocation. We continue to make good progress towards our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $1.15 to $1.25 with $0.52 earned year-to-date.  As shown on slide 16, EPS was $0.25 in the second quarter, reflecting high contributions from South America and MCAC, as well as debt pay down at the parent. Offsetting this was the sales of our coal plants in the Philippines and Kazakhstan. Our results also reflect $0.02 from a quarterly tax rate of 36% which is a timing issue as, we continue to expect a full year tax rate in the 32% to 34% range.  Onto slide 17, adjusted PTC during the quarter was $255 million, an increase of $13 million. I\u2019ll cover our results in more detail over the next four slides beginning on slide \u201818. In the U.S. and Utilities operations were generally in line with the prior year. PTC was down a part due to the timing of a planned outage in Hawaii which occurred in second quarter this year versus the first quarter of last year.  Regarding sPower the business has outperformed our expectations since we acquired it, both from an operational and development perspective. Since the acquisition, sPower has distributed about $100 million in cash to the parent or roughly a quarter of our original investment. The business also continues to have good access to capital markets, having just closed a $500 million portfolio refinancing with a 14 year average life and a 5% coupon.  Back to our second quarter PTC, in South America improved results reflect higher contract pricing in Columbia, as well as higher contracted sales and lower interest expense at AES Gener in Chile. In MCAC higher PTC was largely driven by the Dominican Republic due to the completion of the Combined Cycle last year, as well as improved availability. Finally in Eurasia, our results primarily reflect the sale of our business in the Philippines and Kazakhstan. Shifting to our year-to-date results on slide 22, adjusted EPS increased $0.10 to $0.52, which represents 43% at the midpoint of our full year guidance versus 39% achieved year-to-date 2017. Our results reflect higher contributions from U.S. and Utilities, including higher regulated rates and lower maintenance expenses of DPL. In South America contracted sales were up in Chile, Colombia and Argentina and we also benefit from lower parent debt. These impacts were partially offset by the asset sales in Eurasia.  Turning to our improving credit profile beginning on slide 23, in the third quarter of 2016 we established a goal of reaching investment grade. At that time we had $5 billion in parent debt and leverage of 4.9x. We expect to end this year with $3.8 billion in debt and leverage 4.3x. Our goal is to achieve investment grade metrics of below 4x by 2019.  As shown on slide 24, the rating agencies are recognizing our commitment and actions. As of third quarter 2016, we rated BB- and BB. Today after recent upgrades by Fitch and Moody's we are rated BB+ by all three agencies just one notch below investment grade. We continue to believe that obtaining investment grade rating will help us not only to reduce our cost of debt and improve our financial flexibility, but also enhance our equity valuation. Now to 2018 current capital allocations on slide 25, which is in line with our prior disclosure. Beginning on the left hand side, sources reflect $1.9 billion of total available discretionary cash, including $600 million to $675 million of parent free cash flow. Sources also reflect $1.2 billion in net asset sale proceeds from Masinloc in the Philippines and Eletropaulo in Brazil.  Now to uses on the right hand side of the slide. Including the 8.3% dividend increase we announced in December, we\u2019ll be returning $345 million to shareholders this year. We've used over $1 billion to reduce parent debt, including revolver drawings. We plan to invest $300 million in our subsidiaries, primarily for projects under construction, leaving about $40 million of unallocated cash.  Finally moving to our capital allocation from 2018 to 2020 beginning on slide 26, we continue to expect our portfolio to generate $4.2 billion in discretionary cash, which is roughly half of our current market cap. But half our discretionary cash is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow. The rest comes from our $2 billion asset sales target, $1.2 billion which we have achieved to-date. Turning to uses for this discretionary cash on slide 27, roughly two-thirds has been allocated towards current dividend and delevering. Earlier Andr\u00e9s laid out 11.8 gigawatts of additions, 60% of which is coming online in 2020. Our equity needs for this capacity are manageable as we bring in partners and use non-recourse financing.  Specifically we're planning to fund $800 million for our equity investments in our backlog and project PPAs coming online through 2020. This is only $50 million more than our expectations on our last call. This quarter we are also showing $150 million for our equity investments in projected PPAs coming on line in 2021. Once completed, all these projects will contribute to our growth through 2020 and beyond.  The remaining $600 million of unallocated cash which is largely weighted to 2019 and 2020 is available to create additional shareholder value, including investments in subsidiaries and dividend growth. As you know, our annualized dividend growth rate is 9% over the last three years and 27% over the last four. Although, we don't plan to continue growing the dividend at such an exceptional rate, we expect dividend growth to remain an important part of our value proposition. We review our dividend annually with our Board in December.  With that, I'll turn it back to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thanks Tom. Before we take your questions, let me summarize today's call. Our performance year-to-date puts us on track to achieve our 2018 guidance. We are well positioned to achieve investment grade credit metrics in 2019. Our 5.7 gigawatt backlog of long term contracted projects will enable us to achieve our key objectives of profitable growth and greening the portfolio.  We expect to generate substantial amounts of discretionary cash from 2018 through 2020, which we will deploy consistent with our capital allocation framework and we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our 8% to 10% average annual growth in adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow through 2020.  Operator, we are ready to take your questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Ali Agha of SunTrust. Please go ahead. Ali Agha : Thank you, good morning. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Good morning Ali. Ali Agha : Good morning. My first question, you didn't bring this up on your remarks. If you could give us an update on where things stand with Maritza and Bulgaria, and more I think to the point as you've said to us before, I think that we should be expecting something to change there on the contract eventually, either a buyout or restructuring.  And my question is, when you sort of model the different scenarios with what could play out with Maritza eventually, how that does that impact that 8% to 10% profile of earnings growth you\u2019ve laid out \u201818 through \u201920. Does it change it in any way? Is that already factored in? How should we be thinking about that, that's my first question? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Sure, well we aren't in any formal negotiations yet with the government. As I\u2019ve said in the past, an issue was raised with the European Commission regarding illegal state aid. It hasn't been declared as such, but you know both sides are expected to begin negotiations sometime in the future. As I\u2019ve said, we have a very strong contract. We're being paid on time. Bulgaria is an investment grade country; it's growing and the situation of our uptick or NEK continues to improve. So really you know it's very too early to say when this will come out. And as I said you know, we have a good contract and we will defend our interests. The plant is needed in Bulgaria, so you know we will keep you informed of this in terms of sort of how this would affect our future.  You know we do have contingencies in our numbers and we have to see where this turns out. There are a range of outcomes and we don\u2019t have a satisfactory outcome. Obviously arbitration is a possibility. So sort of stay tuned. There will be more information as it\u2019s happening. We really don't have much more to report than we did on the prior call. Ali Agha : Okay. Second question, you laid out some of the new projects, PPAs backlog that will likely come online beyond 2020, 2021 and 2022, etcetera. So in that context, I wanted to get a sense of what your visibility is for your growth profile beyond 2020 as you start factoring these projects in, and is the growth rate that you laid out for us through 20 sustainable going forward. Do you have line of sight? Can you give us some sense of how the profile would look like beyond 2020? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Well Ali, we will update you on that after are \u2013 on our fourth quarter call. I think what we are showing here is that we do have a very robust pipeline of projects, and that as we continue to growth the renewable pipeline as to develop competitive advantages of scale and of combinations of technology, I expect this pipeline to continue. So I can't really give you any specific number, but I think that as time passes, I think you're seeing the robustness of the pipeline, the many opportunities that we have and that you know how fast we grow will depend on making sure that we have attractive returns on that growth. I would add that you know besides just megawatts, we have other projects such as the LNG and it's not only the regasification terminal that we should be inaugurating within 10 days officially in Panama, but we also have the eastern gas pipeline in the Dominican Republic. So we have some businesses which are growing in addition to just the megawatts. Ali Agha : Last question, more near term. You alluded to the fact that the tax rate impact in the quarter has been more of a timing issue should come down in the second half. But if you looked at the overall earnings that you have reported and generated though the first half, that you said it\u2019s up 24% year-over-year, how does that compare to your own internal budget in the context of the full year when we look at the adjusted earnings that have come through, through the first half? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Well, I think as you know Tom and I said, I mean we're on track to hit our numbers and sometimes tax rates can be a little bit lumpy for us, because it depends on where the earnings came from specifically. So we really \u2013 I wouldn't read too much into a sort of a one quarter tax rate and you know we really planned for the year. Tom O\u2019Flynn: Yeah, and Ali its Tom. We pointed out that last year our earnings will shape the same. We tend to have third quarter and fourth quarter are historically strong for us. So this is consistent with where we started the year. Ali Agha : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie. Please go ahead. Angie Storozynski : Thank you. So going back to the growth at sPower, I remember that when you get acquired the business, I think the assumption was that there would be about 500 megawatt of growth per year. Now it seems you are significantly exceeding that rate, yet you are keeping your earnings growth projections unchanged through 2020. Why is that? Is it just because the growth is more towards 2021 and beyond and hence there isn\u2019t a positive earnings, you know providing upside to your growth rate till 2020. Tom O\u2019Flynn: Well, you know I think, thinking of sort of our growth rate, I would make some mentions. You know one is sPower obviously it\u2019s a big contributor. We are also doing very well in our distributed energy business, it\u2019s smaller, but it's also a big contributor to this.  Overall about 50% of our renewables growth is wind more less, 50% is solar, 50% is U.S., 50% is outside, so we have a very robust wide portfolio. So you know I think that you know again, we\u2019ll talk about our longer term projections. But as you mentioned, there is \u2013 we\u2019re a portfolio, we have a number of things going on, so you know we feel uncomfortable about hitting our numbers for this year and we feel comfortable with our guidance to 2020 of 8% to 10% growth. Angie Storozynski : Okay, now you mentioned that the incremental growth would be financed with internally generated cash flows, but the thing we all seem stories about you potentially divesting a share of some of your operating assets. I'm talking about the contracted renewables. Could you talk about that? Tom O\u2019Flynn: Yeah Angie, it\u2019s Tom. Yeah, we have mentioned in the past that we, after closing sPower we did get some inbounds on buying some piece of operating assets. We continue to see if that's a an opportunity. That would be something that would fit into our asset sale piece, the 1.2 versus $2 billion, so the $800 million to go. We'll see and continue to think about those opportunities in conjunction with our partner income.  But those are really sell downs of partial pieces of operating assets. Obviously the front side of the business, the growth development side, we want to keep that driving forward as it is, and if we did things like that, that\u2019s probably we\u2019ll continue to be the operator, owner-operator-manager, which is also adding value as they are now. By year end they\u2019ll be self-operating in the solar, about 85% of their facilities, which is adding some incremental margin on the upside. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yeah NGOs, so to put this in context you know, we will be on looking for opportunity to leverage our equity, by bringing in lower cost capital partners. So you know whether that be a partial sell down in different assets, that allows us to use our equity towards higher returns us, for example development and then putting into operation plants and then once they are up and operating if we can get lower cost capital, then that's what we will do.  So you know over the last years we've raised quite a lot of capital by selling assets, and let's say reinvesting some of that capital in higher return projects. So this is you know right on our strategy, so expect more of that. Angie Storozynski : And lastly, I know you\u2019ve said actually twice already that you will be providing us with updates on growth beyond 2020 only on the fourth quarter call. But during this this year's fourth quarter call you didn't roll forward your earnings to 2021 as you had historically provided. You know we have this concern us among investors about your contract and that you are rolling off and providing a potential earnings clash. So could you at least give us a sense directionally if 2021 would be an apt year versus 2020 based on what you see currently? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : You know, as I see that really when we don't have any cliffs in 2021, actually we have a lot of assets coming online in 2020. So you know I would just say that the momentum, you know 2021 should be a good year, because that's when all these assets will be online and you know that includes things like the energy storage, 400 megawatt hours of energy storage coming online in Southland.  In terms of cliff, we really you know \u2013 the only \u2013 we have contracts falling off at AES Gener in 2023 and that's only half of the contracts. So Gener is you know pretty much fully contracted through 2023, so know we don't see a cliff in 2021. Angie Storozynski : Okay, thank you. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning. A - Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Good morning Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, thank you for the time. I wanted to follow up a little bit on Angie\u2019s direction for questioning. Can you elaborate a little bit on the equity investments that you intend to make in the renewable segment just to make sure we're clear about this.  I think I heard you say for instance in \u201821 that you're going to put about $150 million in that specific project here. (A) Is that a good cadence of the capital, and (B) historically we think about maybe low to mid-teens returns on these kinds investment. Is that basically to say that perhaps that\u2019s equal to $0.02 to $0.03 of earnings accretion based off of that investment or is it maybe a little bit lower than that just given the return profile of contracted sellers. A - Tom O\u2019Flynn: Hey Julien, it\u2019s Tom. So on my slide 27, the $150 million, this is projected \u2013 obviously it depends upon capital structure, partnership things and also location of projects, but we had $150 million that could be invested in 2020 for projects to go COD in \u201921; that's roughly half of the amount of say \u201821 COD projects.  So in terms of cadence if you just think about the layers, cadence is probably 300 in total renewables, probably about $300 million, maybe $350 million a year, something like that, which if you look back at our history, I think at least the last five years, that\u2019s generally about our equity investment in projects. It's been about 300 to 400 per year and so this would be very consistent. Obviously less lumpy in things like Colon or other things of that nature and more going to more smaller investments in renewables in the U.S. and obviously in our key markets.  In terms of returns, I think generally in the U.S. we're seeing low double digits and internationally depending upon where we are, we see low to mid-teens. So we expect those to be accretive as we move along and we would factor that into our guidance updates for 2021 and beyond. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Let me be clear about this, just a little clear. So you know basically the thought process is 300 to 350 a year in cadence and you're saying low double digits. Is that an IRR or is that an ROE in the current year? i.e., should we take say the mid-point of that, say 300 to 400, 350; put say a low teens ROE on that to kind of get a sense for what the earnings contribution is, say about a nickel or so. Tom O\u2019Flynn: Those are fair for ROE\u2019s and probably if I was going to use the cadence, I\u2019d use 300 to 400 and those are reasonable for ROE\u2019s. Some of them are a little bit \u2013 it depends on the region. Some of them are a little more near term ROE beneficial and some are a little more sloped. But as a portfolio those IR\u2019s are pretty reflected in those ROE\u2019s. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And this is \u2013 and to be further clear about this and distinguished, on slide 50 you talked about global renewables with a total equity investment of 136. How does that compare, just to make sure we're not double counting here and thinking about this separately? Ali Agha : I\u2019m sorry, which slide again? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Slide 50 talks about global renewables. That's a separate investment bucket for equity contributions than the\u2026 Ali Agha : So these are the projects in construction. So I think so as Tom mentioned you known on an annual basis we are talking about $300 million to $400 million of equity investments moving forward. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: This is a slightly different cut of that, right? $300 million to $400 million and then right now you've got $136 million actively invested, but this is the 136\u2026 [Cross Talk] Andr\u00e9s Gluski : \u2026 Cash power they\u2019ve signed 1.2 and all our numbers are AC year-to-date, so most of those projects have not yet started construction. They will shortly like the big Microsoft-Apple project and Virginia will start construction next quarter, so it's not right. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So 136 is a small factor of the total equity. A - Andr\u00e9s Gluski : It\u2019s a small piece yeah, because it just has the stuff that's already gone NPP, it\u2019s already construction. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And sorry, just sort of another one there just to clarify. The source of the success from the solar, I mean I know you have a list of projects thus far. But if you were to define as power sort of MO in the store space, is this principally [inaudible] contacts. I mean where are we basically orienting themselves for opportunity? A - Tom O\u2019Flynn: I\u2019d say sPower is right at probably 60 \u2013 on new business is shifting towards 50-50 wind and solar. They are probably right now about 60% solar, 40% wind, but they are shifting. When we closed on the acquisition, they were about 85% solar. They were making the shift, they are very client focused. So folks like Microsoft and Apple are obviously great clients, so we\u2019d look to do additional business with those and other clients like that. We do still do some utility transactions and you know some other large utility type players such as a couple of CCA's in California. Our smaller DE business tends to be more program focused, so they look at a state program and then build that on a state program, we are doing a lot of that right now in Massachusetts. Hawaii project, as Andr\u00e9s mentioned, the two solar storage projects is opportunities for the EP business in Hawaii. So they can be more regional focused. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yeah, and Julien don't forget that 50% of this is outside the U.S. and they were mainly C&I customers, you know investment grade, dollar contract, long term dollar contracts. So it\u2019s a mix of things, and again to the extent that we can bring in partner equity or sell down, you know that also improves our returns. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Great, excellent! Thank you very much. A - Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thank you, Julien. Operator : The next questions comes from Christopher Turnure of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Christopher Turnure : Great, good morning. Andr\u00e9s you mentioned in your prepared remarks briefly that you continue to be I guess hopeful for new LNG projects, but I was hoping you could give us more color there on either the existing Panama or Dominican Republic contracts. The types of customers you might be talking to, duration and when we might have an update their? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Okay. Well, I think that you know first of all what we're doing in Panama is replicating what we've done successfully in the Dominican Republic. So in the Dominican Republic we have the very nice business of selling to industrials and transportation LNG at our facility. So we have those capabilities built into the Panama project already.  Now it will take some time for the Panama Central American market to develop. Now we have a strategic alliance with ENGIE to market our gas from these two facilities and they can create products for clients, for example, that are offset some of the risks of having \u2013 you know competing with diesel or competing with heavy fuel oil for clients to sign up for long term gas contract.  So in Panama what we are saying is basically the 22 tera Btus will be used by the plant, our plant coming online. There are more plants in the area that could be converted and would require the construction of some gas pipelines. We are fully capable of you know again, discharging from the LNG from that plant as well. So that\u2019s a market that\u2019s going to take some time to develop as it has in the Dominican Republic.  Now, in the Dominican Republic we have a very significant growth with the building of the Eastern gas pipeline that's about 12 tera Btus and the offtakers Barrick. So again, investment-grade, offtakers for its mines and it's basically converting its generation at those mines to gas. There is also potential for you know transportation in that area. So once that eastern gas pipelines is built, there is a lot of other potential diesel plants and heavy fuel plants and transportation that could be converted.  So it\u2019s taking a successful business case from the Dominican Republic replicating it in Central America. So the Panamanian market is very attractive, but you know we could also use it as a hub to deliver gas into other Central American countries, such as Honduras. Christopher Turnure : Okay, great. And then just remind me, how much if any capacity is left in the Dominican Republic right now? Is it a percentage of I guess the total capacity? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : I would say in this Dominican Republic we probably have another 15 tera Btus, 20 tera Btus to go, because that\u2019s a 80 tera But tank, so that would be the world about 60. So it gives an idea of how we can fill it up. Now again, it's very attractive to do tolling and which is what we do without taking any commodity risk on these projects. You know longer term we have mentioned in the past we have a potential very large similar project in Vietnam. So that would be more sort of a 2023 project. Christopher Turnure : Okay, and then switching gears, could you give us more color on your decision to sell the Chilean transmission assets and pay off debt down there. Kind of anything specific about those assets that made the time appropriate to sell here? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Well you know AES Gener is doing sort of a restructuring program of its asset, and so it\u2019s sold a gas peaking plant and it solid the transmission assets we think for you know attractive prices, and it\u2019s used those proceeds to pay down debt.  So it\u2019s you know similar, let\u2019s say to what AES has done and in terms of we\u2019ve sold assets that we think are more valuable to others and non-core assets and taken those funds and used the delver the company, so it\u2019s very similar. Christopher Turnure : Okay. Makes sense. Thanks Andr\u00e9s. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Fleishman of Wolf Research. Please go ahead. Steve Fleishman : Yeah, good morning. A couple of quick questions; first any risks you are needing to manage from the tariff trade war issues. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Okay, you\u2019re talking about the tariffs on solar panels? Steve Fleishman : And more broadly. Tom O\u2019Flynn: More broadly. And more broadly -- no quite frankly we're not much affected if at all. I would say a first the biggest one year you could mention sort of NAFTA negotiations in Mexico. Remember that our strategy has been to contract long term dollars with private sector. So you know we're really not seeing any effect in any of our markets directly. If you're talking about solar panels in the U. S., both sPower and our distributed energy you know have sufficient panels on contract and on attractive terms for \u201818 and \u201919. So we're well positioned and quite frankly some of the uncertainty favor I think the bigger players such as us. Steve Fleishman : Okay, good, and then just in terms of \u2013 so it sounds like the kind of accelerated renewables investment is already embedded in your 8% to 10% growth rate for 2020, that\u2019s correct. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : That\u2019s correct. Steve Fleishman : Okay, and could you be to agree that it\u2019s still the same number and that\u2019s additive to the growth. Could you be a little bit more clear on what areas maybe are a little less than before or you kind of higher within the range? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Well, I think again we\u2019re within our range. I would say you know this is on our strategy of greening our portfolio. Remember we\u2019ll also be selling down some assets, you know as we\u2019ve been doing so you have the give and take. But basically the way I think about this, the overall arching theme here is really derisking. So in derisking we're going towards a you know more longer term contracts, more dollar contracts, less construction risks, because they are more individual small projects rather than large projects and you know we obviously have a contingency in our numbers and so you know stay updated, but basically this is very positive news.  I think that if you notice, the chart we put up for the returns on renewables in the U.S. increased and we had a 10% average IRA up to 11 you know and we think we\u2019ll continue to make progress there. So you know overall I think the news is very good and the way to think about is it our portfolio continues to be less risky you know and then the portfolio in the past and it\u2019s you know in line with an investment grade company. Steve Fleishman : Okay, and then just maybe lastly, since sPower is still relatively newer to the company, can you just maybe give a little more color on kind of the process from \u2013 I think you said it\u2019s done better than you expected, operationally. I assume financially as well, so far is that true? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yeah, I mean the answer is yes. I mean again we are quite conservative on our terminal values on our growth prospects. So when we bought it, if you recall, on our earnings call we were talking about 500 megawatts of year of signed PPAs and obviously we've done better. You know at the same time you know we were hitting our return criteria and finding ways to improve that. So I would say overall it\u2019s a good start Steve Fleishman : Any expansion of the growth is more, because you are just seeing a lot more opportunities at your returns than you initially expected. Is that\u2026 Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Well, I think a better way to phrase it Steve might be that we were conservative. You know we were hoping for this. But on the other hand we were conservative and saying you know what is a you know P95 and that\u2019s what we were talking about, so you know we're very pleased with it.  You know we are also very pleased with our distributed energy unit. It\u2019s doing you know probably three to four times the business we had originally anticipated when we bought that business. So you know, this in generally we've been conservative and likewise we\u2019re also being very conservative about terminal values when we calculate our returns. Steve Fleishman : And then one last question, just in the U.S. on the solar projects I assume you booked IPCs upon startup and then when did you address PPC's for the 10 year, and just thinking about the way the earnings layout of the two segments? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yeah Steve, generally we are not \u2013 we are using tax equity. We expect to continue to use tax equity for the next couple years, but from an earnings standpoint PPC dos come through via tax equity to our earnings and then ITC does help buy a tax equity in the initial couple of years for solar. Steve Fleishman : Thank you. Operator : The next questions comes Lasan Johong of Auvila Research Consulting. Please go ahead. Lasan Johong : Thank you. Great call. I love the clarity, so I appreciate it, thank you very much. But I got a few questions (A) Andr\u00e9s, the pipeline business in Dominican Republic, is that going to be a \u2013 is that one a one off project or is this something that you guys want to delve into more deeply on a more broader basis. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : We had one pipeline in the Dominican Republic, going from Andres to out DTP facility. So this would be you know getting us to a larger market, because it\u2019s not only within Santo Domingo, it's going to the east where there is a.... Lasan Johong : No, I understand that, but \u2013 I apologize for interrupting. I understand that, but is pipeline going to be another investment vehicle going forward or is this going to be on a one off basis depending on the need for a particular project. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Basically you know I would say we're not getting into the pipeline business. I mean if a pipeline is needed for example in Panama to a specific demand, maybe like there's a couple plants within say a 10 mile radius, then we will we will build it, but it\u2019s very much tied to the facility. So we're not going to build a separate pipelines that aren't sort of helping us realize the value, you know the value that our storage and reclassification has. So it will be very linked to that. We're not getting into the pipeline business otherwise. Lasan Johong : Great! On the investment grade rating, once you change investment grade rating, it kind of frees up a lot of issues that were kind of handcuffs if you will in past transactions. So is it possible at that point to bring some businesses up to the current level. Say for example DPL and IPL could be at the parent levels to insure for example that the interest expense reductions are not limited at the parent level, something like that or are there any other structural changes you would make with the changes in the investment grade rating. Tom O\u2019Flynn: Yeah, it\u2019s Tom I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll change our basic philosophy of having our subsidiaries, be it standalone, nonrecourse entity. As you know most of those entities are investment grade rated or investment grade structures in the event of not going to investment grade countries. DPL has recently become investment grade. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll change \u2013 and the changes you said would not help us from a \u2013 structural change, like that would not help us from the US tax perspective. But in general we feel the shift to investment grade we think will help \u2013 when we primarily focused on it for our equity valuation, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to change. There are a lot of things that we cannot do today, but we will able to do. I feel quite comfortable with our financial flexibility as we stand today and the best part is [inaudible] support and demonstration of approving this profile. Lasan Johong : Well Tom, at some point the cash flows are going to be kind of overwhelming, as you are not be able to use the money to pay down debt. So what\u2019s the kind of the longer term plans for that massive excessive cash flow coming? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : I think we\u2019ll use our capital allocation framework and we\u2019ll keep you updated and we\u2019ll have to see. But I think again, what Tom was saying, we've been able I think to do a number of very good sale of assets, of non-core assets and part of that is that you know we really had the financial flexibility to wait until the timing was right and get the right deal going forward. So becoming investment grade is I think will give us even greater financial flexibility and make us more robust for any changes in capital markets. Lasan Johong : Yeah, but what are you going to do with all this cash flow coming at you in the next \u2013 hopefully in the next three or four years? Well, you can\u2019t use that money to pay down debt. There\u2019s not going to be enough debt left to pay down, so what\u2019s the plans for that excess cash? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : We\u2019ll keep you updated when that happens. Lasan Johong : Okay, last question, AES has gone through an incredible amount of transformation since 2000. I\u2019ve been following you since 1998. What does AES look like in five years? I have a pretty good understanding of the picture now, because of today's call, but I just want to get it straight from you guys. Are you guys shifting more and more towards renewables and kind of laying back on conventional generation. Is that kind of the idea of where you are talking about? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Well definitely as I said you know, we're reducing risk and part of that is greening the portfolio. We think that\u2019s part of our risk reduction program. That's also quite frankly in some markets where the demand is. You know if you want to get new PPAs in the U.S. market and its heavily weighted towards renewables.  Now we do see a transition. We do think that having the existing conventional assets gives us an advantage, because you know renewables are energy, but they are really not capacity. So the two ways to get to capacity is you can either put in battery and that's great because you can sell a lot of batteries, but that you're talking about hundreds of billions of dollars globally would have to be invested.  And in the transition you can use your existing plant, be it hydro, gas or coal and actually some of the green blend of extent we're seeing has very interesting possibilities, which is a combination of you know low cost energy from renewables [inaudible] combined with the capacity of the coal plant for example in some markets or gas plants. So, you know what do I think of the next five years? Well, we\u2019ll be leading that transition in many markets. We\u2019ll continue to be leading in the new technologies, whether it be combining solar storage or quite frankly combining the solar with conventional as well. We hope to be a leader in the market as well. Lasan Johong : Thanks a lot. I'd just like to add one more question. In Vietnam you said you know it\u2019s difficult to replicate the Colon type projects. Does that mean that you would also look into the potential of exporting gas from Vietnam to say Cambodia and Thailand? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : In this case I mean mostly it\u2019ll be total length, so it would be a very big facility and that would be \u2013 there are several trenches of combined cycle gas plants that go with that. So you know at this stage you know I think that yeah that the possibility exists. You know we have a MOU signed with Petro Vietnam and it would have to be really what their policy is at that point. So that\u2019s ways off as I said. That would be more like a 2023 project. Lasan Johong : Thank you. Great call! Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ahmed Pasha for any closing remarks. Ahmed Pasha : Thanks everybody for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any questions you may have. Thank you and have a nice day!

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ahmed Pasha, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ahmed Pasha : Thank you, Brendon. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter 2018 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning are Andr\u00e9s Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom O'Flynn, our Chief Financial Officer; Gustavo Pimenta, Deputy Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will turn the call over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our third quarter 2018 financial review call. We had a strong quarter demonstrated by solid financial results and excellent progress towards achieving our strategic goals. We continue to improve the returns from our existing portfolio and position AES for long-term sustainable growth. Our third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.35 puts us at $0.88 for the first nine months of 2018 which is 35% higher than the $0.65 we earned in the same period last year. We remain on-track to achieve our 2018 guidance and longer term expectations. Tom will discuss our results in more detail after I provide a review of our strategic accomplishments. I will structure my remarks today around four overall themes; first, optimizing our returns; second, our growing backlog of renewable projects; third, advancing our LNG strategy; and finally, deploying new technologies. I have discussed these themes in the past, and on this call I will provide concrete examples of how we're delivering on each in support of our overall strategy. Beginning on Slide 4 with optimizing our returns. We have been reshaping our portfolio to deliver attractive returns to our shareholders while reducing our overall risk and carbon footprint. As can be seen on the slide, our renewable investments are projected to produce low-to-high teen IRRs across all markets assuming conservative terminal values. Specifically, as you may recall, we bought sPower in 2017 at a high single-digit return; since then we have taken steps to enhance that return including refinancings and operational improvements. This morning we announced that we have agreed to sell 24% of sPower's operating portfolio to Ullico. As a result of all of these actions we have improved our expected return on sPower's operating portfolio to around 13%, and we will use the proceeds to help fund new solar and wind projects in the U.S. Now turning to our backlog of renewable projects beginning on Slide 5. Our robust pipeline continues to increase driven by our focus on select markets where we can take advantage of our global scale and synergies with our existing businesses. So far this year we have signed 1.9 gigawatts of long-term PPAs for renewable projects or 93% of our internal projection of 2 gigawatts for full year 2018. We are on pace to sign 2 to 3 gigawatts of new PPAs annually for 2019 and 2020. We expect this capacity to be split 50-50 between the U.S. and internationally, and similarly, between solar and wind. By the end of 2020 we expect to have signed 7.5 gigawatts of new renewable PPAs all of which will be online by 2022. To complement our strategy to invest in attractive renewable projects and expand our environmental, social and governance related disclosures; next week we will be releasing a climate scenario report that complies with the guidelines of the task force on climate related financial disclosures and includes updated carbon intensity reduction targets that reflect our renewable growth. Now onto Slide 6 and how we are capitalizing on our existing footprint. As you may recall, on our last call we introduced our green blend and extend strategy. With this win-win strategy we leverage our existing platforms, contracts and relationships to negotiate new long-term PPAs with higher returns than we would otherwise get through a bidding process. We see potential opportunities to execute on this strategy across many of our markets including Chile, Mexico and United States. In the near-term we see an addressable universe of 7 gigawatts across our portfolio which could substantially increase as other markets capitalize on the economic benefits of renewables. Turning to Slide 7; we have signed two green blend and extend contracts for a total of 576 megawatts in Chile and Mexico. The contract in Chile was the first of it's kind; we signed an 18-year contract with an existing customer for 1,100 gigawatt hours of annual delivery [ph] which is equivalent to 270 megawatts of renewable capacity. This will lengthen AES Gener's average contract life to 11 years, replace 5% of AES Gener's total load, and 40% of the thermal PPAs expiring in 2022. We are also implementing a similar contract in Mexico with our off-taker Penoles. To help Penoles gradually replace pet-coke with greener, efficient renewable energy, we negotiated a 25-year PPA to build the 306 megawatt Mesa La Paz wind project leveraging our strong existing customer relationship and our global renewables capabilities. This will increase our average contract life with Penoles from 8 years to 17 years. In summary, we are very encouraged by our progress to-date on the green blend and extend concept, and we are well positioned to take advantage of this significant opportunity. Turning to Slide 8; since our last call we've made good progress on the 3.9 gigawatts of projects under construction. Currently 80% consists of large conventional projects which are significantly more capital intensive and complex, and have longer lead times. Our conventional generation projects under construction are progressing well and the majority of the capacity will be completed by the end of next year. I will now review some of these construction projects on the following slides beginning on Slide 9. Construction on our 1.3 gigawatts Southland [ph] combined cycle plant in Southern California is proceeding as planned, on-time and on-budget; and we are now well over halfway complete. All six turbines and generators are in place and the focus is now on the installation of piping and electrical components. The project is expected to be operational by the first half of 2020. OPGC2 in India and Alto Maipo in Chile are both advancing as planned. OPGC 2 is 97.5% complete and is expected to come online later this year. Alto Maipo is 70% complete with the tunneling work 61% complete, and is expected to come online in the second half of 2020. The remaining 20% of our projects under construction are solar, wind and energy storage which compared to construction of conventional generation are generally much less complex. As I previously discussed, the vast majority of our future construction will be renewables. Currently our 776 megawatts of renewable construction projects are expected to come online through 2020. In Hawaii, we're delivering two solar plus storage facilities for a total of 47 megawatts of solar and 170 megawatt hours of 5-hour energy storage on the island of Hawaii [ph]. These pioneering projects will serve base load energy needs including satisfying 24/7 demand with renewable power. The first of these projects is under construction and the second for the U.S. Navy is expected to begin construction later this year. Once both of these projects are complete, they will represent the largest solar plus storage installation in the world. Furthermore, we were recently awarded two additional projects with 90 megawatts of solar plus 360 megawatt hours of energy storage, also in Hawaii. We are currently finalizing the PPAs for these projects and will provide additional details once the contracts are signed. To summarize, as shown on Slide 12, we expect at 11.3 gigawatts of new capacity through 2022. This includes our 5.7 gigawatt backlog, as well as 5.6 gigawatts of additional renewable PPAs we expect to sign through 2020. These projects will be key contributors to our growth through 2020 and beyond. Turning now to our LNG strategy on Slide 13. As you may know, we have 2 LNG regasification terminals in Central America and the Caribbean with a total of 150 tera Btus of LNG storage capacity. These terminals were built to supply not only the gas for our co-located combined cycle plants but also to meet the growing demand for natural gas in the region. This excess capacity provides us with significant upside potential as the fixed cost of the terminals are covered by our captive requirements. We are making good progress on the commercialization of this capacity, in fact, this year we have signed three contracts yielding $35 million in additional annual margin to AES beginning in 2021. With the sales we will monetize much of our excess capacity in the Dominican Republic. However, we have options for further expansion in the Dominican Republic as needed. In Panama, the storage tank at our recently inaugurated Colon power plant and regasification terminal will come online in mid-2019, and approximately 60% of the terminals capacity is still available. This represents an additional potential margin of more than $60 million annually for Colon. Together with our strategic partners total, we are already making progress on selling natural gas to third-parties in Panama. The expertise we have gained in the Dominican Republic and Panama has positioned us well in Vietnam where we have signed an MOU to build a similar LNG regasification and storage facility. This facility would have an annual storage capacity of 300 tera Btus and provide much needed natural gas to serve a rapidly growing market. Although in the early stages we will provide updates as this project progresses. Now onto new technologies on Slide 14. We are a leader in deploying new technologies such as battery-based energy storage, drone applications and digital customer interfaces. These initiatives have already allowed us to reduce O&M costs, improve customer experiences and deliver innovative solutions to the market. As one example, we are already saving $10 million annually through drone applications alone. By expanding our use of digital technologies, we expect to further reduce O&M and back-office costs by an additional tens of millions of dollars. Year-to-date, Fluence, our energy storage joint venture with Siemens, has been awarded more than 250 megawatts of new projects. Fluence has now delivered or been awarded 75 projects in 16 countries with a total capacity of 701 megawatts. Furthermore, as you might have seen, last month we pointed Sanjeev Addala for the newly created position of Chief Information Digital Officer. Sanjeev comes from GE Renewable Energy where he served as Chief Digital Officer. We've already done a lot of work to prepare for digitalization, including the strategic investment in Simple Energy earlier this year. Simple Energy is the leading provider of utility branded online energy efficiency marketplaces and customer engagement software in the U.S. Finally after 6 years as CFO, Tom will be stepping into a new role to help us secure greater amounts of third-party financing through innovative means. Tom has played a key role in our growth in U.S. renewables, and considering the size of our pipeline and the importance of sourcing capital effectively, I have asked him to take on this new role. We plan to address this effort in more detail when it's further along but would note that we view it as the next step in our partnership strategy which has already raised approximately $3 billion and proved returns on our invested capital. Tom will be succeeded by Gustavo Pimenta, who many of you have met over the years; for the past nine months he has served as Deputy CFO, and before that as CFO of several of our Latin American operations, including the publicly-listed companies of Eletropaulo and AES Tiet\u00ea [ph] in Brazil. The financial discipline and rigor that Tom and I have embedded in our capital allocation framework will of course continue unabated with this transition. Now, I will turn the call over to Tom to discuss our financial results, capital allocation, guidance and expectations in more detail. Tom O'Flynn: Thank you, Andr\u00e9s. The past 6 years as CFO have been rewarding time and I'm truly proud of the Company's transformation. The business is significantly derisked and on an attractive growth path. I'm also pleased that I've helped lead our growth in renewables and I look forward to my new challenge where I will be focused on raising third-party capital to systematically and cost effectively help finance this growth. Now I'd like to cover our third quarter results, improving credit profile and capital allocation. As shown on Slide 16, EPS was $0.35 for the quarter reflecting higher contributions from South America and U.S. in utilities, a lower quarterly tax rate and debt paid down [indiscernible]. Offsetting these were the sales of our coal plants in the Philippines and Kazakhstan. Turning to Slide 17; adjusted PTC during the quarter was $327 million, an increase of $89 million. I'll cover our results in more detail over the next four slides beginning on Slide 18. In the U.S. utilities SBU higher PTC was primarily driven by our generation of [indiscernible] which came in from a long-term agreement in May. Since then AES has benefited from the facilities location by selling energy in the constrained region of the California market. These plants are being repowered under a long-term contract starting in 2020. Regarding our regulated utilities, the Indiana commission concluded IPLs rate case last week, the ruling was consistent with the prior settlement agreement, and also our expectations. This constructive outcome together with DPLs rate case in September leave our U.S. utilities well positioned for the future rate based investment in T&D infrastructure. IPL has grown it's rate base considerably over the last few years and looking forward, there is still potential for growth in the mid-single digits. At DPL where the focus has been on restructuring the business, we could see growth in the high single digits. The captured portion of this potential growth DPL will be filing it's smart grid investment plan by year end. In South America, PTC improved on the strength of record high quarterly results at AES Gener driven by higher contracted sales, prior year plant outage and lower interest expense. Our results also reflect higher contract price in Colombia, as well as higher tariffs in Argentina following the 2017 reset. In MCAC, lower PTC was largely driven by an event at our Andres [ph] plant in the Dominican Republic. In early September, a lightning strike caused major damage to the plant forcing offline for about three weeks. The local team has performed admirably and we expect to get the plant back up to roughly 75% load within the week. Further measures are underway to return the plant to full capacity by the first quarter. Including reserves for property damage taken in our captive insurance business, the total impact of the third quarter was about $0.03 which backed this to be the bulk of the overall impact and the plant is fully insured. Filing new raiser [ph], our results primarily reflect the sale of our businesses in the Philippines and Kazakhstan. Based in part and our strong year-to-date results we are reaffirming our guidance for 2018. Relative to fourth quarter 2017, this year's fourth quarter will be impacted by a higher expected tax rate compared to only 18% last year, as well as an unplanned outage at our Warrior Run plant that have just been completed. Regardless, we feel very confident with our guidance for the year. Turning to our improving credit profile beginning on Slide 22; the third quarter of '16 we established a goal of rich investment grade. At that time we had $5 billion parent debt and a debt-to-EBITDA coverage ratio of 4.9 times. Since then we've reduced debt by almost $1.2 billion, and we expect to end this year with a ratio of 4.3 times. Our goal is to achieve investment grade metrics of below 4 times next year which positions us well to achieve an investment grade rating by 2020. As shown on Slide 23, we're now rated BB plus by all three agencies, just one notch for investment grade. We believe these credit improvements are helping us not only to reduce our cost and debt and improve our financial flexibility but also to enhance our equity valuation. Now the 2018 parent capital allocation of Slide 24. Beginning on the left hand side, sources reflect $2 billion of total available discretionary cash, including $600 million to $675 million of parent free cash flow. Sources also reflect $1.3 billion in net asset sale proceeds which includes close sales in the Philippines and Brazil in the recently announced sell-down of sPower's operating portfolio. Another use is on the right hand side; including the 8.3% dividend increase we announced in December will be returning $345 million to shareholders this year. We've used over a $1 billion to reduce parent debt including revolver drawings, and we plan to invest $300 million in our subsidiaries, primarily for projects under construction leaving about $100 million of unallocated cash. Finally, moving to our capital allocation from 2018 through 2020 beginning on Slide 25. We continue to expect our portfolio to generate $4.2 billion discretionary cash which is more than 40% of our current market cap. About half of our discretionary cash is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow, the rest comes from our $2 billion asset sale target, $1.3 billion of which is completed or announced. Now to the uses of this discretionary cash on Slide 26. A quarter of this cash has been allocated to the current dividend of $0.52 per share. As you know, our annualized dividend growth rate has been 9% for the last three years. Looking forward, we expect the dividend to grow in line with the industry average and remain important part of our value proposition. We review our dividend annually worth our Board in December. Back to the slide, $1.7 billion is allocated to debt reduction, 70% which is completed. We're also planning to fund $950 million of our equity investments in our backlog in projected PPAs. Once completed all these projects will contribute to our growth through 2020 and beyond. Remaining $600 million of unallocated cash which is largely weighted to 2019 and 2020 is available to create additional shareholder value including investment and subsidiaries and dividend growth. With that, I'll now turn it back to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thanks, Tom. Before we take your questions, let me summarize today's call. We are delivering on all of our financial and strategic objectives. We have grown our backlog of projects to 5.7 gigawatts of which 1.9 gigawatts are long-term renewable contracts signed this year. We are successfully commercializing our excess LNG storage capacity. We are on-track to achieve investment grade metrics by 2019 and ratings by 2020. Our portfolio will be generating $4.2 billion in discretionary cash from 2018 through 2020 which we will redeploy consistent with our disciplined capital allocation framework. Finally, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our 2018 guidance and our 8% to 10% average annual growth in adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow through 2020. Operator, we are ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust. Ali Agha : Now that we have nine months of the year behind us, just one quarter to go, and given the kind of year-over-year growth you've already reported through the nine months; is it fair to say the higher tax rate notwithstanding that we are probably trending right now above the midpoint of the full year guidance because you should have the $0.10 band and we only have one quarter to go, just wondering if you could narrow that down a bit given that nine months is already behind us? Tom O'Flynn : As usual, I think we'd prefer to stay away from range within the range. I think we're very comfortable with the range. As I pointed out, remember the businesses are performing well. We've had a couple of headwinds, the most notable of which is the DR that we've recovered well in that, and that's only $0.03. I did point out the unusually low tax rate in Q4 of last year, so on a year-over-year basis that will normalize but I think it's better just to leave it there, we're very comfortable with our range. Ali Agha : And then my second question; the 24% sell down at sPower, can you also tell us how much net income goes away with that sell down? And related with that Tom, as part of your new role; is that the kind of activity we should see going forward as you're funding your renewable growth that -- as projects come online likely sell down the minority stake and then refund; I mean, is that the philosophy here? Tom O'Flynn : In terms of the net income that goes away, I think it's a modest amount and it was still looking forward with our trajectory obviously for '18 and another 8% to 10% still 2020. In terms of my new role, it's -- over the last few years we've certainly have worked on partnerships, as Andr\u00e9s said of over $3 billion; that is the type of investor and the type of transaction that we'd like to do on a more systematic basis. Provided doing it one-by-one we'd like to think about doing it with a variety of investors and with capital that could be available with good foresight let's say. Ali Agha : Andr\u00e9s, as you look at slightly longer term outlook for the company, what is the visibility that you're seeing right now to sustain your growth rate beyond 2020? As you mentioned, the larger projects are going to be less important but renewables are going to pick up; so what's your line of sight or visibility for your growth rate as we look beyond 2020? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : We feel very good about our longer term growth prospects. As you know, a number of our projects are coming online in 2020 -- between now and 2020. So for example, Southland [ph] being a notable case. We also have a lot of renewables projects that will be coming online. So we feel good about it, we feel that the green blend and extend, for example, in the case of AES Gener is extending those contracts. And so we see that we will continue to grow well and we will provide more guidance in the fourth quarter -- on our fourth quarter call we will provide a longer term guidance. But as we've been saying for some time, we expect a continued good growth past 2020. Operator : Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Actually, maybe let me kick it off right there. Tom, we'd love to hear a little bit more about the innovative capital raising effort that you're heading off here to lead. I mean obviously, you all have spearheaded a lot of perhaps less than intuitive opportunities to sell down in different ways; what is this latest effort -- how different is the latest effort from the minority sales that you've done traditionally? Tom O'Flynn : I think it's systematically quite consistent. As Andres said, I think it's really the next step for the company and also, obviously another step, another challenge for me. But we've done a large number of partnerships, some were strategic but a number of them have been with large financials. And we want to capitalize on that and as I said do it in a more systematic basis and also have capital more available as opposed to say just in time or one by one. But we'd look to tap into a variety of investors, many of who manage billions -- hundreds of billion dollars of investments, would have a competitive cost of capital, and are very interested in long-term contracted assets which is obviously what we're about -- I'd say this is not any of our numbers for AES, this would all be upside to AES. I think as Ali asked, the Ullico transaction is quite indicative, thematically they would look to do it on a larger scale and with a variety of investors. I would say we're not focused -- at least I will not be focused on public market alternatives. But it's really -- the things I've done in terms of working in the industry, in terms of working with partners, and also more recently for the last year too have been very focused on our green growth. I think I'm excited about it; I'd say -- and I think we've gotten some questions, this is not about me slowing down, I think -- some of you know I tried that about seven or eight years ago and it was -- my wife told me that was a failed experiment. And even then I had a little league baseball team to coach that was successful but now the only baseball team I could coach would be a fraternity softball team that would be kind of awkward. For me it's a new challenge, it could be quite interesting and it could be quite beneficial for AES. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Maybe to follow-up on the financing front; I know you alluded to rolling things forward next year but you also alluded to growing the dividend more of -- I think your term as an industry average. Why is that the case; how are you thinking about financing the growth in the balance between earnings growth and dividend -- ongoing dividend and dividend growth at this point? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : As I said, we will review the dividend with the board in December, and I think -- we have -- depending on the time period you take, we've been growing the dividend over the last, say five years, it's like 27%; almost more than 9% in the last four years. So we're saying that we will expect it to grow it, more in line with the industry average. In terms of finding the capital, as Tom mentioned, this new initiative would be upside. And one of the things that we've been able to do is really transform this company into a company much more based I'd say on renewables and leading technologies; and we've been able to do that in part by using third-party capital to grow. So we feel that in the space going forward economies of scale are very important, and we really want to be a low cost constructor/developer. And that we have $4.2 billion of discretionary cash available from 2018 to 2020 but this would be additional to that. I would also say that in terms of sort of our guidance for the next couple of years, we feel very good about that and we also feel that just to give you an example, it is resilient to -- for example, any likely outcome in Bulgaria but we feel good about our guidance and we have upside from finding more third-party capital like we've done, very successfully. We also have upside I would say regarding commercializing more of the LNG storage capacity, we feel very good that -- I had been saying for a lot of calls saying that we had this excess capacity, we've planned to commercialize it. Well, in the Dominican Republic we'd pretty much use that capacity. Now that doesn't mean we can't do more, I mean we could do everything from differently logistics to parking FSU, to even building a second tank if the demand continues to grow. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Actually since you're bringing it up, I'd be curious just if you can more clearly define how much -- what is the EPS upside from the LNG updates today to be very clear? And also, if you can clarify the FX -- I know you're shorting the Argentine peso on '20; how much of a benefit is that versus what you initially targeted in your 8 to 10 for the FX swing that we've seen in the year-to-date period? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : On the year-to-date you're right that we're -- there are a lot of things going on with the Argentine peso; I mean there was some tax assets which caused -- we had to book a loss in the prior quarter on a regular ongoing basis because we have a big back-office operations there, we are slightly -- I would say, short the Argentine peso, so it's not a major issue going forward. Now having said that, the Argentine peso has appreciated of recent and the situation has stabilized, and -- when I talk to a lot of you, I said really the key leading indicator was to look at the agreement with the IMF. So it's in place, it's being executed well; so we see the regulatory developments there as positive in addition to that. So in terms of the upsides, I don't want to go any further than what I've said in the past that we have approximately an upside for -- AES Panama would be about $60 million on an ongoing basis, if we're able to utilize all of that storage capacity as we have in the case of the Dominican Republic. And as I said prior with Total [ph], we're already making progress on selling gas to third-parties and as any contracts are signed or made concrete we will let you know. Operator : Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Angie Storozynski : Can you provide us with an update what is the asset sales target right now? Maybe you have a view on what's the targeted number of countries that you're going to be exposed to? And also in a pie chart with allocation of excess funds, you talk about some potential incremental debt pay down; if you can explain what that's for and then what's roughly the use of the remaining cash? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Let me take the first part, then I'll pass it over to Tom to talk about the cash allocation. What we had announced was a program of around $2 billion. We've already completed $1.3 billion and we haven't -- the big chunk which was the sale of Eletropaulo and [indiscernible] in the Philippines we've received; there is some money coming in from the 24% sell down of sPower to Ullico. So that leaves about $700 million left to complete the program. That can be done in several ways, I mean that can be selling out to some countries or businesses or selling down. As you know, we don't talk about it until it's concrete because it -- we feel that that is most appropriate with our people. And as you know, we've -- in some of the countries like, say The Netherlands, we've exited our big asset there, we just have energy storage left in The Netherlands, so we continue to simplify our portfolio. So I'll pass it to Tom to talk about the potential pay down of additional debt. Tom O'Flynn : So the $450 million on Slide 26 maybe about 40% of that would be without asset sales, i.e. just to continue to get our metrics down from 4.3 to under 4 and hit our investment grade target objectives. The other 60% be related to asset sales; that amount varies depending upon how cash rich the earnings are or the equity is from the asset sales but we'll call it $250 million, $300 million would be there as a placeholder for asset sales. As you know, we don't really comment on asset sale candidates until it's fully cooked and we're at the point of -- at or very close to announcement. Angie Storozynski : And just one follow-up; you continue to expect the rich investment grade metrics by the end of 2019. Can you tell us if you have the discussions of credit agencies that give you a sense when those potential upgrades would happen, would we really have to wait until 2020? Tom O'Flynn : We've obviously been discussing this with the agencies for the last two or three years. Our parent cash flow numbers are very consistent, when we have meetings -- when we talk about what we said we're going to do, what we've done it's very straightforward story. I think the agencies have on-time in general, maybe they can always be a little quicker but in general, they have appreciated our credit moves and our forward-looking commitment that comes from -- obviously, the finance team from Andres and from the Board. So our target here is to hit the numbers next year and we think there may be some seasoning, obviously if we can season faster, we'll make that case and try to see whether we can get the actual upgrades sooner. But I think from a planning standpoint, we think it's reasonable to hit numbers next year and have a little bit of seasoning and get the letters in 2020. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : I would like to add that there is not only the numerical aspect but the qualitative aspect. And so now that we're over 80% contracted in dollars, as our contract length increase, as we complete the construction projects, as we go more into renewables -- and in addition, we've already significantly reduced our commodity exposure, we've reduced our weather exposure as well, for example, with the gas coming online in Panama that decreases our weather exposure by 50%. So if you look at it, it's not only quantitative but it's really qualitatively where we're at, and we feel that that's an important component in our discussions with the rating agencies and why we feel confident with some appropriate seasoning, we're on-track to become investment grade. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolf Research. Steve Fleishman : Do you have any information on the pricing of the sPower sell down you can provide us? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : I think it hasn't closed Steve, so we will not be talking more and more in detail about that at this point. What I could say is that like all our sell downs, it helped us increase our return, our invested capital which is part of the purpose of what we've been doing, we sell down and obviously to people who have a lower cost of capital than we do, and we provide the development and the economies of scale. Steve Fleishman : Just maybe some color as we think about the renewable backlog growth. The 13% return that you're now earning on the operating asset you've bought; is that a rough kind of target for what you kind of see coming through the growth backlog or how should we think about that aspect? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : I think we have just separated by market and by product type; so yes, I think that's -- from the U.S., that's an appropriate range that you're giving. We would expect to make more outside the U.S., we expect to make more where it's part of the green blend and extend product. So we're finding ways to increase our returns and we think they're very competitive, we're working very hard to reduce the costs on these projects, by scale and by synergies with existing assets. So green blend and extend, plus our local platforms, plus what we've already achieved in the U.S., plus continued use of third-party capital; so all these things we expect to continue to be in the range as we've given or we've achieved today. Steve Fleishman : And then maybe just any sense on the timing of more clarity on the new -- kind of more structured third-party venture that Tom you're leading; when we might have more color on that? Tom O'Flynn : It will probably be in the next year to be honest. How we're doing, obviously, we're trying to ramp things up, we also need to be mindful just -- in which forms we talk about things but it will probably be in the -- let's say Q2 of next year. Steve Fleishman : And then lastly, you threw out this DNM [ph] LNG project which sounds very large. Could you just give us maybe a little more color on that project and when it -- what you need to do to make it officially kind of part of your backlog? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : I mean, right now it's preliminary, we've signed an MOU, I mean it was part of the President Trump's visit to Vietnam, it was one of the marquee projects which were signed, it's a joint venture with Petro Vietnam; so right there we have a partner to start-off with. This is just the LNG storage and regasification, actually it would satisfy existing demand a lot of it, so unlike our prior projects it would be much more utilized and say just off the get-go because it's replacing offshore gas which they've used to-date and it's running out; so it's bringing LNG to substitute that. This would be a project that -- if it goes along, and again, it's preliminary, would come online probably something like 2023. And there are other power blocks associated with that, we don't have an MOU or anything signed or any associated power blocs with it but it's obvious that we've been successful in bringing gas to Central America, bringing gas to the Caribbean, it would be a natural add-on. And as you know, we have a bigger platform company in Vietnam already operating very successfully. Operator : Our next question comes from Christopher Turnure with JP Morgan. Christopher Turnure : You touched on a couple of items in your prepared remarks but I was wondering if you can give us a sense as to kind of performance in 2018 so far from existing assets, and what might not repeat in 2019; that lightning strike I think was one of them. But I'm particularly interested in Southland and the ramped up performance of that [ph]? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : You've touched on I'd think two items. I mean that certainly, Southland, it was a capacity constraint and we were able to dispatch profitably from that plant. I think that the case of the lightning strike was also very much unexpected and is a very odd circumstance, the way it happened. But those I'd say were the most two, I'd say in general our operational performance has been good this year. So other than some lumpiness in the tax rates, I don't expect any significant differences for next year; hopefully, no lightning strikes in this case but perhaps we had a little bit of the offset in the case of Southland. I don't know Tom, if you want to add anything. Tom O'Flynn : No, I think that's fair. I think once again, relative to some prior years, we're explaining some things with hydrology and other things. I think the businesses are performing very much on target. Christopher Turnure : And then, I don't know if I missed this in one of the earlier responses but -- Tom, you indicated that the dividend growth rate was something that you wanted to be in line with the industry average. Can you give us a bit more color on that? And if the payout ratio is something that you're considering here as well, and if so, how you define that? Tom O'Flynn : I think I'll let you be the judge of industry average which you can look at people who are generally from the utility industry is what we think is a reasonable group. So it will be less than nine but still a good number and still a good return when you combine dividend growth with earnings growth. In general, we have used about half of our parent free cash flow for the dividend, we don't have a defined payout ratio but in general, our wallet -- the affordability of the dividend is determined by long-term sustainable parent free cash flow, and that's been generally around the 50% range, that's -- I think that's a more meaningful number than earnings growth. Christopher Turnure : And given the investment kind of horizon that you have right now versus kind of where you've been for the past couple of years, is it fair to say that you have competitive usage of that capital that you maybe didn't have before? Tom O'Flynn : Generally I think -- we think dividend growth is a meaningful part of our value proposition as I said. But certainly as we look at over a backlog, the 2 gigs of renewable sign is here, we think 2.5 and 3 over the next couple of years is very reasonable given our run rate. So we think that is generally about $300 million to $400 million of AES equity when you back out leverage, U.S. and tax equity, some partnerships, generally but $300 million to $400 million. So we think, yes, as our parent free cash flow grows up to the end of this 2020 horizon we're at 800 or over, we think we have the ability with some modest dividend growth and to invest in our businesses. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Chris, I'd also add in sort of the longer time horizon; we'll also be doing less than pay down once we reach investment grade. So more of the credit improvements will come from the growth in our cash flow rather than that pay down. We've done the heavy lifting, I mean if you look at that chart, you know have well over $1.2 billion that we've already done in terms of debt pay down this year; so we'll have more cash available for other things. Operator : Our next question comes from Lasan Johong with Auvila Research Consulting. Lasan Johong : I [indiscernible] but it sounds like AES is going to be exiting the coal-fired generation business, at least new construction going forward; am I taking too much of a conclusion here? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : What I would say is the following that -- certainly, we've been reducing our coal-fired generation as a proportion of our fleet, we're retiring about -- retired or sold over 3 gigawatts this year, I should probably go about this year. So certainly we're building over 2 gigawatts to 3 gigawatts going forwards of renewables a year, so that is going to switch. We're going to release our report next week, and we can be discussing that more with you. So the way this is coming is that -- it's really our renewables are growing, and we're selling or shutting down on economical coal; so this is a natural transition and we will achieve our goals basically really just following good business principles. I would say furthermore that we have to complete the coal plant in India, OPGC 2, and that will very likely be the very last coal plant that AES built. The company has done -- I think had a remarkable transition because if you go back say 10 years, that was really sort of our strongest core competency; so now it's renewables, new technologies and combining, quite frankly, existing thermal or hydro capacity with the renewables. I mean one of things I think people don't talk about enough is the need for capacity and not just energy, and so what we're doing is really by green blend and extend is a way of combining capacity with energy. Lasan Johong : I know at least a couple of years ago, AES was pursuing [indiscernible] in Vietnam; is it safe to say that that is no longer going to be the case going forward? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes. Lasan Johong : Can you layout for us what the global opportunities sat for LNG and renewables that AES is pursuing going forward? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : I think it's a little bit hard, I mean -- I think the way I look at this is right now what's an addressable universe for us. So I think the 7 gigawatt of green blend and extend in the three markets we mentioned, that's -- to some extent sort of proprietary to us, that's existing contracts where we can add renewable energy and get a longer contract from that. I mean, in many of those cases as we can provide new renewable power cheaper than the variable cost of -- for example, burning coal on those units; but we still have the capacity contract for the coal, so we combine capacity with cheaper renewable energy. So that's -- that could be quite -- that could be larger as you have more renewable penetration in other markets. I would add that most of these aren't -- really aren't dependent on subsidies, it's just really the cost of new renewable power versus the variable cost of existing thermal power in some of these markets. Now regarding LNG, that's a fuel that's -- especially with the shale gas revolution in the U.S., you're going to have long-term low prices from the U.S., and you have sufficient liquefaction capacity. So, for example, if you look at the Dominican Republic, the costs for the country of importing U.S. LNG versus burning diesel and heavy fuel oil is saving the country about $500 million a year. It's also reducing carbon output by 4 million tons a year; so that could be replicated in the Dominican Republic. Now in the case of Vietnam, they are running out of gas, they need the gas; so this is very much a needed project and obviously, there is a great interest. So I think that as you see, we have a robust pipeline; one of things Tom will be pursuing is ways that we can leverage our own capital to do more of these projects and increase our return on our invested capital. So there is ample opportunities now. I would also say that we're not pursuing all for growth sake, if we don't see the returns we're not going to make the investments. Lasan Johong : Just following on that LNG issue; it seems to me that it's rational for AES to go up the food chain, meaning, do a liquefaction facility. I understand there is land near Southland that AES owns, any chance of putting a liquefaction facility there? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : That is not part of our plans. We don't see that as our core competency, there is a lot of liquefaction available. Furthermore, we do have the strategic relationship with Total, and Total can provide our final customers with structured projects -- products that we cannot; so it's been very successful thus far and we look forward to doing that more but there are no plans to go up the food chain. Lasan Johong : Once you get your investment grade rating it could be argued that financing projects at the corporate level versus doing bankers free [ph] amount of subsidiary it's going to be lower cost to AES and the shareholders. A) Do you see it that way? B) Ami I kind of dreaming this up or it's just a process that -- yes, it will eventually up? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : It's interesting. I think that train left the station a long time ago; I think we're going to stick with our process to have the businesses, the projects stand on their own, and AES will provide equity. I think that's the way the house is built and I don't see it being rebuilt. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ahmed Pasha for any closing remarks. Ahmed Pasha : Thank you, all. Our IR team is available for any follow-up questions. In next week we look forward to seeing many of you at the EI Conference in San Francisco. Thanks again, and have a nice day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Ahmed Pasha, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ahmed Pasha : Thank you, Carey. Good morning. And welcome to our fourth quarter and full-year 2018 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our Web site at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning are Andr\u00e9s Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer;  Gustavo Pimenta, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior management of our management team. With that, I will turn the call over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thank you, Ahmed. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full-year 2018 financial review call. 2018 was a good year for AES, demonstrated by our strong financial results and excellent progress towards achieving our strategic goals. We delivered on all of our commitments, including our financial guidance and hit key milestones on our strategy positioning AES for long-term sustainable growth. Some of our key accomplishments last year were; we reached the high-end of our expected ranges for both earnings per share and free cash flow; we achieved a key investment grade financial metrics one year ahead of our plan; we met our expectation of signing long-term PPAs for 2 gigawatts of renewable capacity and increased our backlog to almost 6 gigawatts; we accomplished key milestones on our 4.4 gigawatts under construction and completed construction of an additional 1.3 gigawatts; we introduced a longer term target to reduce our carbon intensity by 70% from 2016 through 2020; we now expect to achieve a 50% reduction by 2022; and our world leading battery-based energy storage joint venture with Siemens, Fluence, was awarded 286 megawatts of new projects bringing this total to 766 megawatts. Reflecting on our successful execution, improved visibility and increased confidence and our ability to deliver, we are extending our longer-term outlook by two years, and now expect 7% to 9% average annual growth in earnings and cash flow through 2022. As a result of our strong performance in 2018, combined with our improved outlook, we expect to hit the high-end of our prior guidance range through 2020. Gustavo will discuss our 2018 results and guidance in more detail after I provide an overview of our strategy. Turning now to Slide 4. Our core strategy continues to revolve around the three themes of; first, enhancing the resilience of our portfolio and lowering risk to deliver attractive returns; second, delivering on our backlog of long-term contracted projects to ensure profitable growth; and three, investing in cumulative technologies to maintain our competitive edge and market leading position. Today, I will review the progress we've made this year in support of these themes and how we have positioned ourselves well for the future. Turning to Slide 5, we are seeing the benefits of many initiatives that began several years ago to de-risk our portfolio. AES today is a very different company than it was in 2011, doing business in 28 countries around the world with significant commodity exposure. Since then we have focused our portfolio on roughly a dozen markets where we have a competitive advantage and we have reduced our overall exposure to foreign currencies, commodities and hydrology by 70%. In 2018 alone, we paid down $1 billion dollars in current debt, and we are on a path to attain investment grade ratings in 2020, supported not only by our financial metrics but also by the lower level of risk and higher quality of our portfolio. Our efforts to enhance the resilience of the portfolio have led us to focus increasingly on clean technologies. As you can see on Slide 6, we are significantly decreasing the carbon intensity of our portfolio. In November, we announced the carbon intensity reduction target of 70% by 2030 versus 2016 levels. Today, I am pleased to announce an interim carbon intensity reduction target of 50% by 2022. Our shift to renewables simply makes good business sense. It increases the longevity of our cash flows and allows us to attract a broader investor base. Another way we're decreasing the risk of our portfolio is by completing most of the large conventional projects under construction and focusing our future growth on renewable projects, which are less capital-intensive and considerably simpler to build. Turning now to our strong backlog of projects, beginning with our progress on those under construction on Slide 7. In 2018, we completed 1.3 gigawatts of new projects, including the Eagle Valley combined cycle gas plant and IP&L in Indiana, and the AES Col\u00f3n combined cycle gas plant and re-gasification terminal in Panama, and 254 megawatts of solar and energy storage, mostly in the U.S. We still have another 4.4 gigawatts currently under construction and expected to come online through 2021. Our OPGC2 to plant in India is in the commissioning phase and we expect it will be fully completed in May. Our south land repowering project in Southern California is approximately 80% complete, and the project is on track to come online in the first half of next year. And our Alto Maipo hydroelectric project in Chile is advancing as planned and is now three quarters complete with two third of the tunneling work done. The remaining projects under construction are made up of renewables across our portfolio. As you can see on Slide 9, this capacity is split equally between the U.S. and internationally. All of these projects are going well and they are expected to come online in the next 18 months. We are particularly pleased with the speed at which we've been able to transition these projects from development to construction. Since our last call in November, we have broken ground on 721 megawatts of solar, wind and energy storage. As can be seen on Slide 10, in 2018, we signed new PPAs for approximately 2 gigawatts of renewables, and we're on track to sign between 2 gigawatts and 3 gigawatts annually in the coming years. Turning to Slide 11, combining our capacity under construction with our long-term PPAs that are not yet under construction, yields our total backlog to 5.8 gigawatts. As we execute on our plan to sign 2 gigawatts to 3 gigawatts of new PPAs every year, we expect to bring a total of 12 gigawatts online by 2022. By then, we project that the U.S. will represent almost half of our earnings versus about one third today. As can be seen on Slide 12, our renewable investments are expected to produce close to high teen IRRs across all our market assuming conservative terminal values. We have some unique advantages that allow us to earn these attractive returns, which I'll discuss in the next few slides. Beginning on Slide 13, first, we have existing commercial relationships that we can leverage to drive new growth. For example, our green blend and extend strategy allows us to negotiate new long-term PPAs with existing long-term thermal customers. Through this win-win strategy, we preserve some value of our existing thermal capacity contracts, while replacing a portion of thermal energy with long-term contracted renewable energy. In exchange, our customers receive carbon free energy at less than the marginal cost of thermal power, while still benefiting from reliable capacity provided by thermal generation. In 2018 alone, we negotiated green blend and extend contracts for 576 megawatts in Chile and Mexico. A second advantage that we have for renewable growth is deep market intimacy. For example, AES Distributed Energy recently inaugurated the largest solar storage facility in the world, the island of Kauai. The deposit was made possible by AES's long history in Hawaii and willingness to work with local stakeholders to meet their needs and goals. The project which includes 100 megawatt hours of 5 hour duration energy storage will essentially serve as a source of base load power for the island and deliver roughly 11% of its power. We recently broke ground on a similar second project also on the Island of Hawaii with 14 megawatts of solar and 70 megawatt hours of 5 hour duration energy storage. Third, our work with partners provides us with an important competitive advantage. We bring in partners to achieve economies of scale, fine-tune our portfolio and improve our returns on invested capital. Our recent sell down of sPower is a good example where we agreed to sell 48% of our stake in sPower's operating portfolio, which along with operational improvements and refinancing have increased our returns to 13%. The sell down also provides us with funds to invest in sPower's 10 gigawatt development pipeline to earn similar attractive returns. Turning now to Slide 16. In addition to our growth in renewable, we continue to increase our LNG business, which is displacing heavy fuel oil and diesel with cheaper and cleaner natural gas. As you may know, in 2018, we inaugurated our AES Col\u00f3n combined cycle gas plant and LNG regasification facility in Panama, which will play a key role in supplying natural gas for the entire Central American region. Our LNG facilities in Panama and the Dominican Republic represent a total install capacity of 150 tera BTUs to serve local and regional markets. The majority of this capacity is now under contract and the remaining 55 tera BTUs are still available to drive future growth. As I mentioned on our last call, we are capitalizing on the expertise we have gained in the Dominican Republic and Panama by developing a similar LNG regasification facility and associated combined cycle power plant in Vietnam. Although, this long-term U.S. dollar denominated 450 tera BTU facility is in its early stages, we are making very good progress and it has a potential to contribute significantly to our longer-term growth for 2023. Turning to Slide 17. The third component of our core strategy is to invest in innovative technologies to maintain our competitive edge and market-leading position. As an example, in 2007, AES launched a small energy storage group that was the first of its kind. Today energy storage is beginning to revolutionize the sector and AES is at the forefront. Fluence, our JV with Siemens, was recently named the number one utility scale energy storage integrator in the world by Navigant Research for the third time in a row. In 2018, Fluence was awarded 286 megawatts of new projects and is now the largest global energy storage provider by capacity in the world with a total of 80 projects in 17 countries. Turning to Slide 18, we're also implementing a corporate wide digital transformation, including becoming a strategic investor in Simple Energy. Simple Energy provides a digital platform that allows our IP&L the DP&L utilities to accelerate energy efficiency and demand response program, all the while improving customer experience. Simple Energy's digital platform serves not only AES's utilities, but 40 other utilities in the U.S. with access to over 40 million end customers. Although, not in our guidance, we expect our new digital initiatives to materially benefit both our top and bottom line. We will provide more color as our digital strategy matures on future calls. Now, I'll turn the call over to Gustavo to discuss our financial results, capital allocation, 2019 guidance and longer-term expectations in more detail. Gustavo Pimenta : Thank you, Andr\u00e9s. Today, I will go over our 2018 results, including credit profile and capital allocation. I will conclude by addressing our guidance for this year and expectations through 2022. As Andr\u00e9s mentioned, we finished 2018 on a strong note, achieving the upper end of our expected ranges for all metrics and setting a solid foundation for growth through 2022. As shown on the Slide 20, adjusted EPS was $1.24, reflecting higher margins from our businesses, particularly in the U.S. and utilities and South America's strategic business units or SBUs, as well as debt pay down at the parent. These positive drivers were partially offset by asset sales in the Philippines and Kazakhstan. Turning to Slide 21, adjusted pretax contribution or PTC was $1.2 billion for the year, an increase of $160 million. I will cover our results in more detail over the next four slides, beginning on Slide 22. In the U.S. and utilities SBUs, higher PTC was primarily driven by DPL, which benefited from higher rates following the resolution of its rate case. Results also reflect high contributions from our U.S. solar business and an extended summer run at our Southland plant in California. Increased PTC at our South America SBU reflects higher contracted pricing in Colombia, as well as higher tariffs in Argentina following the 2017 results. Results also benefited from higher contracted sales and lower interest expense at AES Gener in Chile. Higher PTC at our Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, or MCC SBU reflects a full year of operations at the DPP combined cycle expansion and higher spot energy prices in the Dominican Republic. Results also reflect the commencement of operations at the AES Col\u00f3n CCGT and regasification facility and improving hydrology in Panama. Finally, in Eurasia, our results primarily reflect the sales of our businesses in the Philippines and Kazakhstan. Turning to our improving credit profile on Slide 26. Since we first established our goal of reaching investment grade in 2016, we have reduced the parent debt by $1.3 billion or 26%. This includes an additional $150 million repayment in December 2018, which is an acceleration of the debt reduction we had anticipated through 2020. As a result, we achieved a key investment grade financial metric of 3.95 times to parent leverage, one year ahead of plan, providing us additional confidence in our ability to attain investment grade ratings in 2020. We believe this improvement in our credit profile is helping us not only to reduce our cost of debt and improve our financial flexibility, but also to enhance our equity valuation. Over the next few years, we expect that our credit metrics to show further improvement through growth in our current free cash flow, as well as modest additional delivering. Now to our 2018 parent capital allocations on Slide 27. Sources on the left hand side reflect $1.9 billion of total discretionary cash generated in 2018, consistent with our prior expectations. This includes $689 million of parent free cash flow just above the high-end of our expected range. Uses on the right-hand side of the slide are also largely in line with our prior disclosures. The one notable exception is our $1.3 billion of cash allocated to parent debt reduction, which reflects the additional $150 million paid down in the fourth quarter. Now turning to our guidance on Slide 28. To-date, we are initiating guidance for 2019 adjusted EPS of $1.28 to $1.40. Growth this year will be largely driven by contributions from new projects and the cost savings. More specifically, we expected to benefit from the completion of most of our large thermal construction projects with expected commencement of operations at OPGC2 in the next few weeks and the first full-year of operations at AES Col\u00f3n in Panama; growth in renewable, including 1.4 gigawatts scheduled to reach commercial operations this year; a full-year of contributions from the cost savings implemented in 2018; lower currency and interest expense due to completed and continued debt reduction, and a slightly lower effective tax rate of 29% to 31%. This growth will be partially offset by announced business exit in the Philippines, the Netherlands and Oklahoma. To-date, we are also providing our outlook of 7% to 9% EPS and cash flow growth through 2022. We have extended this outlook by two years, which reflects improving confidence in our backlog and increased visibility of earnings and cash flow. One additional point regarding our longer-term outlook; the 7% to 9% growth rate, which is off a 2018 base is in line with hitting the high-end of our previous 8% to 10% growth of a 2017 base through 2020. Consistent with our prior expectations, growth in the outer years is expected to be driven by projects currently under construction, which is Southland, the allocation of parent cash to global renewables growth, and increasing LNG sales in MCEC. I would also note the couple of additional business related assumptions embedded in our longer-term outlook. First, regarding Maritza in Bulgaria. The plant continues to be dispatched in pace in a timely manner. Discussions related to our PPA are still in early stages and we are working to reach a mutually acceptable resolution. As discussed before, our outlook is resilient to any reasonably likely outcome. Second, we continue to see our U.S. utilities is well-positioned for future rate based investment in T&D infrastructure. IPL has grown it's rate base over the last few years. And going forward, there are these two opportunities for growth in the mid-single digits. At DPL where the focus has been on restructuring the business, we pursue growth in the high single-digits. To that end, since our last call, DPL has filed both its grid modernization plan and BMI extension. Together these filings aim to maintain DPLs financial integrity, while bringing its customers the substantial benefits associated with the robust modernizing electric grid. Our guidance assumes that BMI extended for two years from late 2020 through late 2022, allowing the company to meet its financial obligations, while repaying the ability to grow its asset base through its marketable investments. Turning to Slide 29, parent free cash flow is expected to be from $700 million to $750 million this year, and it is also expected to grow 7% to 9% per year through 2022. Now to 2019 current capital allocation on Slide 30. Beginning on the left-hand side, sources reflect $1.1 billion of total discretionary cash, including $725 million of current free cash flow. Sources also include $320 million in asset sales proceeds with 107 in proceeds to the current from announced sell-down of sPower's operating portfolio, and a placeholder for an additional $150 million this year. Now to the uses on the right-hand side, including the 5% dividend increase we announced in the December, we'll be returning $361 million to shareholders this year. We expect it to allocate another $150 million this year to parent debt, largely to strengthen our investment grade metrics, and we plan to invest over $400 million in our subsidiaries leaving about $100 million on unallocated cash. Finally, moving to our capital allocation from 2019 through 2022, beginning on the Slide 31. We expected our portfolio to generate $4 billion in discretionary cash, which is more than 35% of our current market cap. About 80% of this cash is expected to be generated from current free cash flow. The rest comes from our $2 billion asset sales target, $1.4 billion of which is completed or announced. Turning to the use of the discretionary cash on Slide 32. Roughly 40% of this cash will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Looking forward, subject to annual review by the Board, we expect that the dividend to grow 4% to 6% per year in line with the industry average. We expect to use $300 million for this production, including a portion to maintain credit neutrality as we pursue the final asset sales. We are planning to use $1.5 billion for our equity investments in our backlog and projected PPAs. Once completed, all of these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond. The remaining $670 million of unallocated cash will be used to create shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thank you, Gustavo. Before we take your questions, let me summarize today's call. 2018 was a very good year for AES as demonstrated by our strong financial results and excellent progress towards achieving our strategic goals. We are on track to attain investment grade rating in 2020. We are completing our conventional construction projects. We are signing long-term PPAs for renewables, including successfully implementing green blend and extend through our backlog. Going forward, we will invest our growing free cash flow in a robust growth pipeline, while maintaining the strength of our balance sheet and our competitive dividend. Accordingly, combining our annual growth and current dividend yield, we expect to deliver double digit total returns to our shareholders through 2022. Operator, we're ready to take questions. Q - Ali Agha : First question to start with Andr\u00e9s, just again coming back to the basic assumptions underlying your '18 to '22 growth, to be clear on some of the comments you've made with regards to Bulgaria. Are you assuming that you continue to own that project through the full-year period and that the current economics stay where they are. It wasn\u2019t quite clear what's baked into the assumption with Bulgaria, and then also related to that on the Ohio distribution rider. Can you give us some further thinking and your confidence level on why you think you will get the extension beyond 2020? Just in terms of any commentary or any conversations with the commission that would be helpful. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : On Bulgaria, Bulgaria is in our forecast. As we said, our guidance is robust to any reasonably likely outcome there. So we feel confident in our guidance. It does conclude Bulgaria. As been said, conversations are in the very early stages. We think we have a very strong case. And certainly the plant is necessary for Bulgaria. It provides a lot of jobs locally, especially if you include the mining sector. So, yes, it's included. But our guidance is robust to any reasonably likely outcome. Regarding DP&L and the rider, I mean, basically what I can tell you, is that this has to do with company achieving investment-grade. The company has plans for grid modernization, grid resilience. And we think those elements are necessary and likely to remain. So basically the outlook for DP&L in terms of improving the quality of new services is good and the monetization rider is part of that. Ali Agha : And then second question, just to clarify the fact that you're running at the higher end of your near term '17 through '20. Would you attribute that to faster than expected success in your renewable strategy? Or what's driving you to that higher end at least in the near term? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : I would say all of the above. I think we've been very successful on cost cuts. I think we've been very successful on the green blend and expense strategy. And as I mentioned in my speech, we're very pleased by how we've been able to transition projects from development into construction on the renewable side. So it's all of the above. Gustavo Pimenta : I'll still add, Ali, the LNG sale which is accelerating, so that's another important element of that guidance that we are providing. Ali Agha : And last question. I just wanted to be clear on the sources and uses that you've laid out as you fund this CapEx through 2022. Just to be very clear. You're not assuming or you don't see a need for external equity to support this program. The internal cash flow and asset sales should fund all your needs to support the backlog and the growth through 2022. Am I correct in that? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : You are correct. So this is an unambiguous yes. The program is such that between our internally generated cash flow, including some asset sales, we fully fund our program and pay the dividends and also some modest debt pay down as well. So this does not assume any additional equity. Operator : The next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So I just wanted to follow-up a little bit more on the backlog and the capital allocation commitment. Just want to be a little clear about this or perhaps quite clear, both '19 and through the '22 outlook. How are you thinking about the net income contribution from the renewables growth as it stands today? You've got $1.5 billion and broadly allocated and again I know that's not necessarily all for the renewables business. But how are you thinking about renewables' contribution specifically year-over-year into '19 and through '22 from the plan and/or what you've contracted today? However you want to characterize that. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Well, let me stand in big picture. Big picture is we have considerable capital tied-up in construction projects, which we will be cutting the ribbon from now through 2021. In many cases, we have contributed all of the capital that we need to contribute. So, most of our growth is coming from organic projects and just cutting the ribbon. So I want that to be perfectly clear. Second, you have to remember in our renewables program, half of this is outside the U.S. and the half that\u2019s in the U.S., about 40% is win. So the contribution, for example, of HLBV is so far negligible, and it's not as big for us as it is for other people going forward. So in terms of the growth, as I said, a big contributor to this is the organic growth coming from the projects we have completed. In addition to the megawatts that I've mentioned, for example, we have completed the storage tank in Panama, which is going to happen about the middle of this year. So we have additional projects coming online from there. So with that I can pass it off to Gustavo but I want to make absolutely unambiguous that we have very strong organic growth coming on. And given the distribution of our growth, you don't have things like HLBV outside of the U.S.? Gustavo Pimenta : So if you look at our 7% to 9% approximate 60% of that is just the materialization and reaching COD, especially the large thermal projects, Southland, OPGC, full year of follow-on and so on. The 40% is from the renewable space. Out of which half is internationally is in the U.S., so it\u2019s not a major contributor yet for earnings. And I think one way to see that is our proportional -- our current free cash flow is also growing at the similar rate 7% to 9% for the same period. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And just to make sure I understand this. So for '19, because I appreciate that HLBV nuance and just the timing in-service, renewable contribution is fairly limited to growth. But as you say 40% of the overall 7% to 9% roughly, call it may be little bit less than $150 million of net income growth, is coming from renewables by the end of the '22 period? Gustavo Pimenta : Yes, and that's global renewable. So as Andr\u00e9s mentioned, half of that 40%, call it 20%, is internationally, which doesn\u2019t have that affect. And the local one then you have 40%, which is win and then the rest is solar. So it's a subset of the 40% at the end. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And just want to clarify one more nuance detail here. That 40% for renewable, that's relative to what investment in renewables. What you've contracted thus far or what the cumulative plan entails? I just want to make sure we're specific there? Gustavo Pimenta : It's the cumulative, yes. What we have expected throughout the period. Operator : The next question will come from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie. Please go ahead. Angie Storozynski : So first on your credit metrics. Can give us a sense where credit agencies are now that you have reached the investment grade metrics? And also you are just showing that this one metric. Can you comment about FFO to debt or net debt-to-EBITDA what those metrics are? And again, mostly because I'm trying to gauge when we should expect upgrade to the current rating? Gustavo Pimenta : So our base case is to get the metric in 2020. So it continues to be the case. We just started our process with the agencies. They are supportive. They've seen all of the efforts that was done in terms of reducing the leverage. From an FFO to debt, we are closing '18 at 18.8%, 20% is above the threshold. So that is why you see in our capital allocation another $150 million. I think what is more important is that from a capital allocation standpoint, most of the heavy lifting has been done. So we've paid down close to $1 billion of debt last year. So what is remaining in the plan is it's a relatively small amount, but rate agencies will take their time. So we are still expecting the actual action on the rating to be taken early next year 2020. Angie Storozynski : Secondly, so in you press release you talk about this additional sell down of your stake in sPower. Is this -- I mean I remember that you guys mentioned that Tom is working on some systemic or structured relationships with a party that could take future ownership of operating assets. Is this what it is? Or are we still waiting for an announcement and it's still scheduled for roughly mid of this year? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : No, this is not part of that. And as we've said in the past, Tom will be working on the more systematic way of getting partnership money into our projects. And stay tuned, at the right time, we will explain this. But this is -- as I said, we've done $3 billion of partnership capital over the past five years. And so this is an extension of that. Angie Storozynski : And then my last question, I remember you made comment about your dividends, the competitive dividend. Once you actually pay down all the debt that is required to the people of the credit agencies. I mean should we expect that the dividend growth will be commensurate with the earnings growth? Gustavo Pimenta : I think again so stay tuned. We said that we would have competitive dividend growth. And so this is approved annually by the board. So stay tuned. But we're in that 4% to 6% ranges, which is the industry average. So we should expect this to be within the 4% to 6% range within the site, within the four year period, and really validated by the board. So 4% to 6% is what we should expect. Operator : The next question will come from Greg Gordon of Evercore. Greg Gordon : Just to circle back to couple of the original questions. You said that -- is your plan also resilient to potentially not getting the BMR extended by two years. So as we think about 7% to 9% growth rate, while you're assuming that you do get the extension if you were to not get the extension, which is still be inside of growth rate? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : What I'd say is look we have we think a very robust plan. It's taking any potential downside. We have a number of potential upside. So certainly, we could have faster growth, for example, of our LNG sales, which are very attractive because we basically made the capital investments. So there's certainly a potential market there for that. Second, as I mentioned in my speech, we really haven\u2019t incorporated all of the potential benefits from our digital transformation. So that has been a significant amount of cost cuts. I think we have a very good track record of over delivering on cost cuts. But it also has significant revenue potential. So as we don't like to talk about these things until we really have them in hand. So when I look at that, this is a robust plan given I think that any potential downsides or offset with potential upside and these potential upsides are quite concrete, we feel. So stay tuned. Greg Gordon : And there was no mention of the preexisting cost-cutting initiatives in this slide deck. I shouldn't presume that there's has been any change? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : No, there hasn\u2019t. And in fact we remain on track. Gustavo Pimenta : So the plan has been fully executed last year. So we are getting in '19 run rate savings of $100 million, which was with what we had disclosed it before, so in line with prior disclosures. Greg Gordon : And the $2 billion asset sell target is still in place, but you extended the overall guidance framework to '22. Does that imply that the asset, the pace of the asset sales is slowed or do you still expect to have the majority of those asset sales completed by 2020? Gustavo Pimenta : I'd say by 2020 we'll complete the $2 billion what we expect, that's part of this plan. Going forward, we will continue to fine-tune our portfolio. So there may be additional sales but as part of the portfolio. So they may not be wholly exiting, they may be like we did it as far selling down a portion and reinvesting that money and higher return. So that remains part of our modus operandi going forward. Greg Gordon : No, I get that, completely understood. I just wanted to make sure the pre-existing targets were still haven\u2019t slept and the answer to that is no they haven't\u2026 Gustavo Pimenta : No, pre-existing targets, not at all. We feel very confident about them. And we expect to execute on that. Greg Gordon : And then on the targets for the renewables growth, they are quite robust. And it's a little bit of a blend and extend in that and then in your prior guidance, you had targeted 3,000 megawatts for '19. Now you're targeting 2,500. But you're targeting and consistent execution over a longer period of time. And you have a higher end exit rate, exit number in terms of total aspirational growth in renewables. What should we look for over the course of this year to see that you're hitting your targets, because there was a bit of a deceleration in wins when we look at what you've executed in Q3 and Q4 of '18? Gustavo Pimenta : Greg, this has to do just with the timing of the signing of the PPAs. There has been no, from our point of view, no let's say feeling that we're going slower than we were previously. It's just a little bit of timing and making sure that we have these PPAs signed before we commence construction. So the way you can make sure that we're on track is just we will have the announcements of the growth, the milestones that we hit throughout the quarter. So again, green blend and extend has shown itself to be very robust, and we're actually doing very well there. And certainly our distributed LNG as the announcements we've had in Hawaii and other places, it is very robust. So, no, we really don't feel that we're decelerating. It's just a question of the timing, which these projects are going to come in. Operator : The next question will come from Christopher Turnure of JP Morgan. Christopher Turnure : I want to follow-up on some of the renewable financing comments that you've made so far. Just overall could you give us thoughts on how that effort is going? I don\u2019t know if Tom is on the call or not. But where you are seeing the lowest costs, both in the U.S. and globally? And then your slide on the IRRs for renewables. Does that assume that you are tax efficient or does that take into consideration any tax inefficiency that you have? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Let me see, so that\u2019s multiple questions. Let' see. So first, Tom is not on the call. And what is assumed in these numbers is that tax efficiency, and what is assumed is, for example, I'd say mainly in the U.S. where we actually sell down a portion once it reaches operations and optimize it for operational and financial efficiency. So that's I'd say basically it. I think in the rest of the world, what we're seeing especially for example in South America and in Mexico is really the green blend and extend project itself. Again, you don't have a HLBV, you don\u2019t have ITC, you don\u2019t have some of the other elements that you have in the state that make it, let's say, a little bit more complicated accounting and less transparent to see through. So I would say it's basically that. We will continue to do what we've done. So we think this is very credible. We've done this and we will going forward. And different markets are progressing at different speeds. We certainly see that the combination of solar energy storage is coming into being and that\u2019s an area where we have we think a real competitive advantage. Christopher Turnure : And then just going back to the IRR comment that you made. Does that mean that the numbers on that particular slide are hypothetical and your actual returns are lower than that? Or do those numbers take into consideration everything? Gustavo Pimenta : This is actual IRR, so cash-on-cash, so this is not ROE it's actually IRR. So that's cash-on-cash real return. Christopher Turnure : And then just to follow-up to I think one of the earlier balance sheet questions. You mentioned that a year from now roughly is when you're thinking agencies might come back to the table here and revisit your ratings. Could you give us any color on how your discussions on business risks are going within that overall discussion? Gustavo Pimenta : Yes, sure. That's I think one of the upside and one of the positive feedback that we get. I think we continue to be a diversified portfolio, which is important for them but more focused on markets with lower risk. So I think from that perspective, we get very good feedback from their agencies and it's an important component of our trajectory here. It's not only a question of the quality of our portfolio. So I did mention in my speech that, measurably our risks are down 70% over the last five years, to make very big something like Panama where we have 777 megawatts of hydro. In a dry year, we would be forced to buy in the market and therefore, energy would be high, energy to supply our contracts that are contracted. And now with Col\u00f3n in place and natural gas coming into Panama, we have such that particular risk by about 80%. So the quality of the portfolio is backing up the numbers. I think that\u2019s very, very important. In fact, what's underlying the subsidiaries our investment grade as well and we feel there's hydrology commodity FX risk is very much. So it's not just the metric itself, I think it's a quality of those metrics. Christopher Turnure : So it sounds like you're pretty much there in terms of the business mix and your improvement, you just need to maybe execute for a couple more quarters to get that recognized? Gustavo Pimenta : That\u2019s exactly right. Yes, we think there's a seasoning that those agencies will require, but we feel pretty good of path we are on. And we feel very good that our business mix continues to improve the quality of the portfolio. Operator : The next question will come from Gregg Orrill of UBS. Gregg Orrill : Regarding the 24% sell down and sPower, what's the impact there on returns or earnings of sPower, how are you thinking about that? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : I don\u2019t think we want to specifically discuss that amount. But obviously, once you have operating assets up and running under long-term contracts, there're other people who are willing to or interested in owning those assets for the long-term at less returns than you'd get when you are the originator, developer and constructor of those projects. Gustavo Pimenta : I think what I've been saying, Greg, when we bought its how we bought at high-single digits. So after the acquisition we secure the refinancing, the operational includes maintenance so on plus those sell downs we've brought this to 13%. That is just part of that value creation that we're able to conduct. Operator : The next question will come from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Steve Fleishman : Just on the Ohio DMR, could you just remind me how much earnings come from that? Gustavo Pimenta : Today we have $105 pretax, so $105 million per year\u2026 Steve Fleishman : And are you tying the two cases such that if you're not going to be getting that in the future, if they don\u2019t extend it, you are not going to be able to commit to grow the investment in the grid? Gustavo Pimenta : That's right. I mean, they two work together so we need -- we believe it's important to have the DMR for us to be able to continue the transformation of DPL including these markets with investments. Steve Fleishman : And the just on your -- you might have answered this. But just how would you characterize your returns on new renewable growth projects in U.S. relative to that 13% that you are now up to on sPower acquisition? Gustavo Pimenta : I think we have a different project in the U.S. We have project -- several AES distributed energy projects then we have sPower projects, we have C&I customers, we still have some deal in the works. We have deals where we're really combining energy storage in new. So there is a range depending on the particular niche, let' say, I would say that we're addressing. I would say to -- and again I would also say that you when we characterize these returns, this is just the project return that we're looking and not any leverage at corp or anything above. And we were very conservative I'd say about terminal value. But obviously in the plain-vanilla in the U.S., it does involve that we would flip portion of the operating assets to some long-term holder other than ourselves. So there is that combination. But we do have this mix, so it's not like a uniform product that we are selling across the states. Steve Fleishman : And then one last question just on -- I thought I saw somewhere that you might have won storage project with Arizona with APS. And I don\u2019t know -- I didn\u2019t see that in your -- could you talk about that, and it seem to be pretty sure? Gustavo Pimenta : It's a 100 megawatt four our energy storage, so it's 400 megawatts hours. This is quite frankly exactly the size of the one that we have on Alamitos that we're building today. And so as you put those two together, we have two projects of 100 megawatts to four hours each that would be 200 megawatts, 800 megawatts hours between the two projects. Steve Fleishman : But that's not in what you announced as of the year end, that would be additive? Gustavo Pimenta : That's correct, that's not in 2018 numbers. Operator : The next question will come from the Charles Fishman of Morningstar Research. Please go ahead. Charles Fishman : If I can just follow-up on Steve's question. So with Fluence, end of the year award and delivered 766, if I my math is right versus I think at the third quarter it was 701. So 65 megawatts were added during the fourth quarter. What specifically was that? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Fluence is a JV between us and Siemens. But Fluence own sales team is doing quite a lot. So they're in 17 countries with 80 projects. The projects vary from smaller projects. It can be 500 KV or a multiple of them, smaller units 500 KV one megawatt but the larger units as large as the 800 megawatt hours. So honestly I don't have off the top of my head, which of those projects are. But realized we're hitting everybody from C&I customers to the very largest utilities and everything in between. So it's a mix of product. And the large ones tend to be a bit lumpy, but we like very much of the smaller projects that come in. And we increased the number of countries around the world. One thing that\u2019s probably we at AES together with Mitsubishi inaugurated India's first energy storage project last week in Delhi and this together with Tata Power. And this project is I think very important for India, because it establishing how energy storage would work on that grid and getting the regulations in place. And as you know India has -- it is actually building out 200 gigawatts of renewables, probably 80s I think are in the bag. And they are going to need a whole lot of energy storage to be able to accommodate that much renewables on their grid. So there's a lot of interesting markets opening-up. Charles Fishman : And we'll see this number order and delivered jump when you report first quarter, because of APS? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : As I said, there will be lumpiness as these projects come in. Charles Fishman : And one other question Andr\u00e9s, I want to make sure I got this right. You said that by -- I believe you said that by 2022, 50% of your PTC coming from the SBUs will be U.S. generated. Was that correct? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : There is course, especially when you have renewables with shorter time frames that are rolling in terms of -- this will be rolling overtime we have to win some of those bids. But yes, given our current expectations is a little less than half will be U.S. and that's up from about a third today. So the proportion of our pretax contributions coming from the U.S. should rise overtime given our expectations for where that growth is coming from. Obviously, we have like Southland coming online. We have a number of projects in Hawaii. You mentioned the APS. So we've signings certainly in terms of megawatts, lot of big projects in the state. You also have the investments -- future investments in the DP&L as well. So we have great visibility into a strong pipeline of growth in the U.S. Operator : And this concludes the question-and-answer session. And I would now like to turn the conference back over to Ahmed Pasha for any closing remarks. Ahmed Pasha : Thank you everybody for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR teams will be available to answer any questions you may have. Thanks again and have a nice day. Bye-bye. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. And welcome to the AES Corporation's First Quarter 2019 Financial Review Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ahmed Pasha, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ahmed Pasha : Thank you, Brandon. Good morning everyone and welcome to our first quarter 2019 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning are Andr\u00e9s Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Gustavo Pimenta, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior management of our management team. With that, I will turn the call over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our first quarter 2019 financial review call. Since our last call we have made significant progress on a number of fronts. We continue to transform the company, growing our renewables and LNG businesses, simplifying and streamlining our portfolio, reducing costs, and improving our overall risk profile. Specifically we reported first quarter adjusted EPS of $0.28 and remain confident in our full year outlook.  We're on track to attain investment grade ratings in 2020. We signed long-term contracts for approximately 500 megawatts of renewable capacity increasing our backlog to 6.2 gigawatts. We signed a 12 year agreement to sell up to 18 TBTUs of LNG annually in the Caribbean beginning in 2020. Today we're announcing a target of $100 million of additional annual cost savings to be realized by 2022 as a result of our digital initiatives and we agreed to sell our businesses in Jordan and Northern Ireland for $211 million. Gustavo will discuss our financial results and capital allocation plan in more detail following my remarks.  Turning to slide 4, our core strategy continues to revolve around three themes; first, enhancing the resilience of our portfolio to deliver attractive returns. Second, increasing our backlog long-term contracted projects to ensure profitable growth. And third, investing in innovative technologies to maintain our competitive edge and market leading positions. Today I will review the progress we've made since our last call in support of these themes.  Turning to slide 5, we continue to take steps to derisk our portfolio and make it even more resilient. We remain on track to attain investment grade ratings by 2020 supported not only by our financial metrics but also by the lower level of risk and higher quality of our portfolio. We expect to achieve our carbon intensity reduction target of 50% by 2022 and 70% by 2030 reducing potential regulatory risks and attracting a broader investor base. One of the ways we are reducing our carbon intensity is through our green blend and extend strategy where we are negotiating new long-term renewable PPAs with existing long-term thermal customers. Through this win-win strategy we preserve the value of our existing contracts while extending our average contract life and earning a return on our incremental capital investments.  We're currently in advanced discussions for additional large green blend and extend contracts in Chile and Mexico. Separately we just initiated a similar conversations on green blend and extend with PURPA in Puerto Rico. Another way we're transforming our portfolio is by exiting certain businesses. For example in late April we announced the sale of more than 2 gigawatts of overwhelmingly thermal generation in Jordan and Northern Ireland. These sales decrease our merchant exposure, lower our carbon intensity, and reduce our presence to 13 countries. In line with our capital allocation framework we will primarily invest these proceeds in renewables in the Americas.  Turning to slide 6, as we've discussed previously we're focused on growing our business through long-term U.S. dollar denominated contracts with limited merchant commodity and hydrology exposure. One additional initiative that I would like to mention today is the expansion of our business with commercial and industrial customers. This approach further enhances our resilience by diversifying our customer base and providing greater protection from regulatory and macroeconomic factors in our markets.  Now turning to our backlog, our growth in renewables continues. As can be seen on slide 7 during the first quarter we signed new long-term PPAs for approximately 500 megawatts of renewables consistent with our expectations. Turning to slide 8 we now have a total backlog of 6.2 gigawatts and we expect to sign 2 to 3 gigawatts of new PPAs every year for a total of approximately 12 gigawatts of new capacity by 2022. By then we project the U.S. will represent almost half of our earnings versus about a third today.  Now to our projects under construction beginning on slide 9, of the 4.5 gigawatts currently under construction approximately 40% is now renewables. This percentage will grow as we bring online the large conventional thermal plants we contracted number of years ago while adding new wind, solar, and energy storage projects. As you can see on slide 10 the renewable projects under construction are split equally between the U.S. and internationally. All of these projects are expected to come online in the next 18 months. We are particularly pleased with the speed at which we have been able to transition these projects from development to construction. For example as you can see on slide 11 we received all necessary permits for sPower's 500 megawatt Highlander Solar Project in Virginia, the largest solar project in the mid-Atlantic. This project has long-term contracts with C%I customers such as Apple and Microsoft and we expect to begin construction this summer with completion targeted for 2020 and 2021.  Turning to slide 12 and our conventional projects under construction. Our OPGC 2 plant in India is in the testing phase and is running at full load. The plant is expected to be operational later this month and will deliver much needed power to the Indian grid. Our Southland Repowering project in Southern California is approximately 90% complete and the project is on track to come on line in the first half of next year. And our Alto Maipo hydroelectric project in Chile is advancing as planned and is now 78% complete with 72% of the tunneling work done.  Turning now to our LNG business on slide 13. You see the expansion of our LNG projects is complementary to our renewable businesses as it provides capacity while displacing heavy fuel oil and diesel with cheaper and cleaner natural gas. This business is based on long-term tolling agreements with no direct commodity risk. Another benefit of our LNG projects is that once they are built they can be scaled up at relatively low cost as most of the key infrastructure is already in place. We are focusing our LNG growth on two major markets; first is Vietnam where we are making very good progress towards the development of a landmark project with 450 TBTUs of LNG storage capacity and 2 gigawatts of associated combined cycle gas plants. We expect this project to significantly contribute to our growth beginning in 2023.  Second, in the Caribbean and Central America where we have a total of 150 TBTUs of LNG storage capacity in Panama and the Dominican Republic. Our guidance assume that we would contract some of the excess capacity available at these two terminals. In fact since our last call we signed a 12-year contract for up to 18 TBTUs of annual capacity. With this contract we have already locked in the terminal capacity payments that are assumed in our guidance through 2022. The remaining uncontracted capacity provides us with $0.03 of potential EPS upside relative to our guidance.  Turning to slide 14, the third component of our core strategy is to invest in innovative technologies to maintain our market leading position and realize commercial and operational efficiencies. As most of you know AES is at the forefront of battery based energy storage. Fluence, our energy storage joint venture is the leading provider of grid scale storage in the world with 81 projects in 18 countries totaling 776 megawatts deployed or awarded. Now let me say a few words on the recent thermal incident at our 2 megawatt energy storage facility we installed for Arizona Public Service which resulted in serious injuries for four first responders last month. Of course our top priority is the health, safety, and recovery of the first responders. Fortunately we understand from statements made by the hospital that all are expected to make a full recovery.  Regarding the event itself police immediately dispatched a team of technical and operational experts to support APS in the incident root cause investigation. APS and Fluence have committed to share what they can from the investigation especially insights that would be helpful to the entire industry and first responders in efforts to prevent similar incidents anywhere in the world. AES has been safely operating a fleet of battery based energy storage systems for over a decade and today has storage systems operating in multiple country, uses and environments. We continue to believe in the use of lithium ion batteries for energy storage and continue to see rapidly growing demand for this technology and its many applications.  Finally turning to slide 15 today we announced the launch of an additional $100 million annual cost savings program. Our savings target is based on our current digital initiatives which are expected to be fully implemented by 2022. Although we have significantly reduced costs over the last several years we're taking our efforts to the next level by applying new digital initiatives and analytics across our $33 million asset base. As most of our business is long-term contracted at fixed U.S. prices, much of the benefits from these digital initiatives will flow to our bottom line. Specifically the main activities include utilizing AI for predictive maintenance and outage prevents. Using technologies such as robotics and drones for solar and wind maintenance and inspection and implementing process automation in administrative and support functions.  On an annual basis we're targeting a 5% reduction in the total expense for these activities. Net of any cost we achieve so we feel very confident about our ability to achieve $100 million in annual run rate savings by 2022. Now I'll turn the call over to Gustavo to discuss our financial results and capital allocation in more detail. Gustavo Pimenta : Thank you Andr\u00e9s. Today I will go over our first quarter results, improving credit profile, and capital allocation. In the first quarter we made solid progress towards our full year guidance range of a $1.28 to a $1.40. As shown in slide 17 adjusted EPS was $0.28 primarily reflecting the benefits of improved efficiencies and lower parent interest expense resulting from about $1 billion in debt pay down. This improvement was offset by the impact of asset sales and shutdowns. With our first quarter results and 2.2 gigawatts coming online in the year to go we are on track to achieve our full year guidance.  Turning to slide 18 adjusted pre-tax contribution or PPC was $272 million for the quarter, a decrease of $16 million. I will cover our results in more detail over the next four slides beginning on slide 19. In the U.S. and utilities SBU relatively flat PPC reflects higher rates following the resolutions of rate cases late last year at DPL and IPL as well as lower expected asset return obligations at DPL. These impacts were partially offset by the exits of coal fired generation at DPL and Shady Point. Regarding DPLs DMR extension filing there is not much to report, would expect activity to increase as its position at the commission is complete and the new chairman is now in place. Accordingly we remain on track for an expected ruling in 2020 and we continue to feel confident about the merits of our case. At our South America SBU lower PPC was largely driven by Argentina where we saw lower dispatch at our plants. This generation profile was in line with our projections and was expected to impact the first quarter only. Relatively flat PPC at our Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean are MCAC SBU reflects an extended plant outage for maintenance and repairs at our Changuinola hydro plant in Panama. This was partially offset by the commencement of operations at the AEC Col\u00f3n CCGT last year and outage related insurance proceeds in the Dominican Republic.  Finally in Eurasia, lower results primarily reflect the sales of our businesses in the Philippines and the Netherlands as well as the shift our 300 megawatt of capacity at Ballylumford in Northern Ireland. In Bulgaria there have been no significant developments since our last call. Our plant continues to be reinforcing its criticality to the Bulgarian and we are being paid on time.  Turning to our improving credit profile on slide 23. Since we first established our goal of reaching investment grade in 2016 we have reduced apparent debt by $1.3 billion or 26%. We continue to have ongoing discussions with the rating agencies and remain confident in our ability to attain investment grade rating in 2020. We believe this improvement in our credit profile is helping us not only to reduce our cost of debt and improve our financial flexibility but also to enhance our equity valuation. Over the next few years we expect our credit metrics to show further improvement through growth in our parent free cash flow as well as modest additional delevering. While apparent credit improvement is a key focus of ours we are also constantly looking for opportunities to strengthen the capital structure of our subsidiaries. This is demonstrated by the $1.5 billion of liability and management transactions we have executed so far this year at three businesses alone Gener, Tiete and DPL. In all cases we're able to take advantage of good market conditions to extend maturities and lower interest rates. For instance at DPL we refinanced $400 million of the Holdco 2021 notes increasing the term by 8 years and reducing the interest rates by 290 basis points.  Now to 2019 parent capital allocation on slide 24, beginning on the left hand side source reflect $1.1 billion of total discretionary cash including 725 million of parent free cash flow. Sources also include $384 million in assets sale proceeds which is $16 million higher than our previous disclosure for 2019. Proceeds include approximately $170 million from the sell down of sPower's operating portfolio and $211 million from the sale of our businesses in Jordan and Northern Ireland announced a couple of weeks ago. Now to uses on the right hand side. Including the 5% dividend increase we announced in December we'll be returning $361 million to shareholders this year. We expected to allocate another $150 million this year to parent debt largely to strengthen our investment grade metrics and we plan to invest over 400 million in our subsidiaries leaving about 200 million of unallocated cash.  Finally moving to our capital allocations in 2019 through 2022 beginning on slide 25. We expected our portfolio to generate $4 billion in discretionary cash which is about 35% of our current market cap. About 80% of this cash is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow. The remaining 800 comes from asset sale proceeds about half of which has been announced or closed this year.  Turning to the uses of the discretionary cash on slide 26, roughly 40% of this cash will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Looking forward, subject to annual review by the board we expect the dividend to grow 4% to 6% per year in line with the industry average. We expected to use $300 million for debt reduction including a portion to maintain credit neutrality as we pursue the remaining planned asset sales. We are also planning to use $1.5 billion for our equity investments in our backlog and projects PPAs. Once completed all of these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond. The remaining $670 million of unallocated cash will be used in accordance with our capital allocation framework to achieve our financial objectives. With that I'll turn the call back over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thanks Gustavo. Before we take your questions let me summarize today's call. 2019 is off to a good start as demonstrated by our financial results and progress on our strategic goals. We remain on track to attain investment grade ratings in 2020. We are completing our large conventional construction projects. We are signing long-term U.S. dollar denominated PPAs for renewables. We are leveraging our position and experience to expand our LNG infrastructure business and we are targeting $100 million of additional annual cost savings further enhancing the resilience of our 7% to 9% average annual growth target. Accordingly we remain confident in our ability to deliver attractive double-digit total return to our shareholders. Operator we are now ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Ali Agha : Thank you. Good morning. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Good morning Ali. Ali Agha : Good morning. First question Andr\u00e9s, just to get a bigger and better sense on the timing around this incremental cost reduction, so you currently have an ongoing cost reduction program giving you benefits of 100 million in 2019 and in 2020. So when does this incremental 100 million actually kick in, does it kick-in in 2021 and you said the run rate of 100 million by 2022 how much can you specifically capture in 2021 and 2022 from this program? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : That's a great question. So first let me be very clear, this is additional to the programs that we have announced in the past and this is also net of any cost to achieve those savings. We feel very confident in achieving these savings because this is about 5% of expense on those categories and these initiatives are currently underway. So with that said it's also sort of growing over time because this is an annual run rate savings. So as you correctly point out, the larger benefits will be in 2021 and 2022. So you know by 2021 we should probably have about half of these savings and the full amount would be in the run rate of 2022. Ali Agha : Okay and then secondly the 101.5 billion that you've targeted as equity investment in new projects between now and 2022 how much of that is already in hand right now in terms of at least having the signed PPA if not construction and I know in the past you talked about potential investment by Tiete on a win company in Brazil where does that stand and is that part of this 1.5 billion? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : What this includes is that we are committed to, projects which are under construction and being completed includes all the renewables but it also includes a run rate in renewable, getting into new projects that hit that 2 to 3 gigawatts of annual capacity. So it will include a portion of those expected PPAs that we're signing as we on go because between signing and completion it is about 18 months so obviously some of the things that are in that number have not yet been signed. So it includes part of the run rate. Gustavo Pimenta : Gustavo here. If I can complement I would say probably 70% to 80% is somewhat in the pocket, so deals that we've signed but as Andr\u00e9s said there is a proportion yet to be allocated that's expected to be captured. So things like investments in subs would fall under that category. Ali Agha : Okay and the Tiete transaction? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : So Tiete they haven't announced yet how they're going to fund it so we can't comment on that. But if needed that would come from that $1.5 billion of projected PPAs that we have in the chart. Ali Agha : I see, last question, can you just remind us how much of the LNG capacity is not yet contracted and what's the timing when you think potentially you could contract and see that incremental $0.03 of earnings? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : You know as I said a lot of the infrastructure already exists. So it really depends on the timing of the additional investments. So you know we've completed what we said we would do by 2022. So basically we already have that. So I think basically we have let's see, we have probably about 30% still to go. So we have about 50 TBTUs so between the Caribbean and Central America and that just is a question of when we sign up more customers. So stay tuned, I think we are doing very well and quite frankly with relative prices today of U.S. based LNG and oil it is very attractive for customers to sign up. So we've completed what we said we would do and now we're actively pursuing those additional $0.03. Ali Agha : Understood, thank you. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thanks Ali. Operator : Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with BOA. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey good morning. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Good morning Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, congrats. Lots of updates this morning, so I just wanted to clarify a couple of things here if you can very quickly. First, on incremental cost savings how much of that is parent versus allocated at the subsidiary levels and then how much would you say this is incremental, what's the total amount especially of parent SG&A savings that we're talking about through 2022, just to make sure we're fine tuning things precisely here? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yeah, let me be clear here. So a portion of that savings will be obviously at the sub level but however this is what we expect to flow up to Corp. Okay, so this is basically we expect $100 million of savings to what hits Corp even though a lot of those savings will occur in subs but that means that obviously there will be additional savings which we'll share with our partners. So this is what actually hits AES. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And total cost savings I mean there were rather, is that SG&A kind of target just overall because I know that there was already some degree of cost savings reflected through 2022? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Obviously the SG&A a savings especially at Corp are relatively small. A lot of this is operational efficiencies, predictive maintenance, less outages, better planning. So we feel very confident because a lot of these are things which some other companies have done. So we're really leapfrogging here to put ourselves at the leading edge. As you know we hired a new Chief Information Digital Officer, Sanjeev Addala. He's working hand-in-hand with our Chief Operational Officer, Bernard Da Santos. So you know we feel very good about this and going forward we've identified where the savings would come from and it's also pretty leapfrogging and catching up with the leading edge of all of our other companies around the world. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent and then turning back to the U.S. side of the equation, you said I think about half of your earnings by 2022 versus a third today would be coming from the U.S., can you clarify especially in light of your latest procurement efforts how you are addressing ITC recognition for solar assets and how much will be tax credits when you think of that U.S. earnings contribution, I am just trying to make sure we're fine tuning things appropriately especially given the litany of different accounting approaches taken across the sector? Gustavo Pimenta : Sure. Julien, this is Gustavo. The 50% is mostly driven by the fact that 50% or even more of our free cash flow has been deployed in the U.S. It's more equity going to the U.S. and therefore you see that the proportion of the U.S. growing. We are growing the distribution business IPL, DPL as well so that that's the main driver. As we've mentioned in the last call from our perspective a lot of the renewables are outside the U.S. so the growth is not really from an ITC PPC recognition is not really a major driver for a 7% to 9%. And a lot of the growth is 7% to 9%. We do have a lot of deals already in the pocket like something coming online or PPC cost cutting things like that. So it's not a major driver in our case because as I said 50% is in the U.S. Even in the U.S. you have 40% wind which has a low impact. And I think what is more important our cash flow is also growing at 7% to 9% ratio which kind of reinforce the quality of the earnings. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Fair, and then lastly just if you can quickly clarify on Mexico, proper Chile, the blend and extend, what does that imply for your existing assets and just perhaps elaborate a little bit more on the opportunity side especially in Puerto Rico and Mexico given you guys haven't done much there historically? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Well, as we said it is sort of green, blend and extend, what does it essentially consist of. You have a long-term thermal contract where we really make our returns on the capacity payments and energy is a pass through. So we basically go to the client and say we will replace a portion of the energy being generated by the thermal plant with renewable energy if you sign a long-term PPA. So this is a win-win from both because we get a new contract for renewal and get a return on that and we still get our capacity payment. So part of this is that you have to relearn how to run our thermal plants at a lower margin to make space for renewable.  Now in the case of Mexico we have picked up which are thermal plants. Of course in Chile we have a number of thermal plants where we've already been applying this with our large commercial and industrial customers. And in Puerto Rico you may have seen that we are in discussions with PURPA to see how we could have some modifications to allow for green, blend and extend as well. So basically we are reacting to customers desires for more green energy. In many cases the cost of the energy is lower than the variable cost of running the thermal plant and we're lowering carbon footprints in line with what they desire. And very importantly we're keeping the capacity because you know when everybody talks about renewables that's great for energy but what about capacity, the ability to retain the lights on 24/7. So we really feel that there are two ways to do it, the green, blend and extend or energy storage. And I think we're well-positioned in both sides. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent, thank you. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Christopher Turnure with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Christopher Turnure : Good morning. I wanted to ask for more color on Alto Maipo, I think you said it was 78% complete as of now and the tunneling was around 72% complete. Could you maybe comment a little bit more on that particularly on the progress of tunneling since your last update? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yeah, I mean we continue to execute on our plan. I think it's going very well. I believe now we have six tunnel boring machines in operation and we remain on track for what we've said in the past of completing this project by starting in 2020. So I guess that's the only update that I can really say that we're -- since we did the restructuring where the contractor has a lot more say skin in the game and applied the learnings that we've had over the last couple of years we're executing as per the plan. Christopher Turnure : Okay, excellent. And then switching gears to Mexico, could you just kind of comment broadly on your existing assets there and the project where you've relatively recently signed a contract kind of how you're thinking about the political and regulatory environment given some of the headlines over the past three months? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Well, our strategy in Mexico has always been to sign a long-term dollar denominated contracts with investment grade off takers in the private sector. So we're relatively a little exposed let's say to some of the changes that they have announced for the CFE and others. So our projects continue, I think our clients are looking for green energy. In many case they're looking for the green, blend and extend. So those projects continue on track and we expect to be signing more sort of green, blend and extend projects in Mexico. Christopher Turnure : Okay, then with that no slowdown of future project potential? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Again we remain on track and we think our strategy was very resilient and robust because from day one it was a really long-term dollar denominated contracts with investment grade off takers. And many of them are exporters for example. So they really it's you know having a dollar denominated cost is not an issue for them and actually helps them sort of with their future forecasts? Christopher Turnure : Okay, great. Thanks Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Greg Gordon : Thanks guys, a couple of questions, good morning. It looks like some of the currency exposures not for 2019 which I know are quite small but for 2020 which are a bit larger have shifted if I look from the Q4 presentation to the Q1 presentations, can you just talk about how you or how you've -- how your commodity -- how your currency hedging has changed and if that's the case why? Gustavo Pimenta : No, it hasn't moved maturely Greg. Greg, this is Gustavo. It hasn\u2019t moved maturely. We continue to be mostly dollar denominated. And if anything and when there is a remaining exposure in some particular market we do pursue a hedge here at Corp to offset that. So it's not something that we are concerned with and no mature differences versus where we were before. Greg Gordon : Okay, great, it did look small so thank you. The second thing was with regard to the cadence of the expected backlog realization in the renewables which is slide 8. I think you're still basically assuming you over time achieving almost exactly the same amount. But I think some of the realizations have shifted from 2019 to 2020 to 2021, am I misreading that or if not can you just talk about how has it firmed up the backlog and what you're looking at? Gustavo Pimenta : Yeah Greg, Gustavo again. Yeah, you're right. I think the only major change from the prior disclosure has been Highlander which we got the approvals, it took a little bit longer than we initially forecasted. So we move at that, you're going to see in the appendix we move on that to 2020 and 2021. So initially it was part of that was in 2019. That's the only change. So the rest is in line. Greg Gordon : Okay, and I know -- and just to reconfirm you are assuming a favorable outcome in the DMR filing in your long-term guidance correct? Gustavo Pimenta : Yeah, we assume a continuation, we haven't disclosed the particular number there but we assume a continuation of our support. We believe it's needed. And yes it is in our projections. Greg Gordon : Okay, but given a) you have a guidance range and b) you've just basically added $0.10 of incremental earnings from cost savings and that if you were to not get the DMR and you were to risk adjust for not getting the DMR, are you still comfortable that you'd be in that guidance range? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : What it says again we're adding resilience to our forecasts. So the additional $100 million of cost savings realize that the DMR where it's really crucial was at DPL level. And it's crucial for DPL to undertake its modernization program. Greg Gordon : I completely agree with you, I am just -- I know it's an investor debate and that's why I ask. Thank you. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yeah. Okay. Thanks Greg. Operator : Our next question comes from Charles Fishman with Morningstar Research. Please go ahead. Charles Fishman : Thank you. Good morning. One of the savings in your waterfall chart slide 17 was effective tax rate for the recently ended quarter going down to 32%. I realize you don't give guidance on effect of tax rate but you can sort of back into it from the guidance you give on adjusted PPC and adjusted EPS. In the last couple of years it's been running around 30% on an annual basis, is the first quarter just normally run higher or is something changing with respect to what you're seeing on your effective tax rates because of the mix of earnings from different countries or is there any additional color you can provide? Gustavo Pimenta : This is Gustavo again. Yeah, that's right. It's mostly driven by the mix. We're not seeing any mature change versus what we had anticipated which is somewhat between 29% and 31% for the year. But yes on a quarter after quarter we should have and it's not uncommon to have similar activity and driven by the mix. But on a full year basis it should be normalized in the 29% to 31% should be the final number. Charles Fishman : Got it, thank you. That's the only question I had. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thanks Charles. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steve Fleishman : Yeah, hi, good morning. Just, could you just give us your thoughts on the political economic environment in Argentina and potential things we should be watching there for you? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Sure. Steve, as I have said in the past in Argentina I don't see it as anything sort of binary. So, really the question is, is there any degradation in the earnings. And we've seen a slight degradation of $0.01 to $0.02 from let's say where we were thinking maybe a year ago. So Argentina assets are excellent assets and it's a very robust business. Since I've been involved in the Argentine business since the year 2000 we've made money every year. We've paid dividends every year. We did have three years where we were unable to convert those dividends into dollars because there were currency restrictions in place. So to put it in perspective. So, first it is a very resilient business and depending on government policies there could be some degradation but it's not a binary issue I believe.  I think with the political situation in Argentina they're having elections in October and we'll see who wins, whether it's a continuation of the current president, could be Lavagna who's a Peronist or you could have Cristina Kirchner who is running on her own. And so we'll have to see. I don't think there'll be any immediate regardless of who wins, I don't think there will be any immediate outcome or changes in this sector that would require laws for it to change. I think that the -- as I said in the past when people got very worried about the exchange rate in Argentina I said look they had a terrible harvest, 30% lower but they're increasing, they're up. If they have normal harvests and with the increase in their natural gas exports, I think reaching exports of natural gas eliminating imports I think that side looks a lot stronger. So it's really a question of what -- how the change in the regulatory structure is. We've been there before and as I said it's not a binary issue. Overall we feel cautiously optimistic that things will continue more or less as they are today. Steve Fleishman : Okay, and then just on the battery side of that occurred, I know you're still investigating that in the light. But I'm just in some of the stories I read I think there were at least some that talked about there being fires in other parts of the world with batteries. And I don't know if you have examples of others and what might have caused those other ones just so we kind of have an idea of what it could be. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yeah, first what we had was a thermal event. We didn't really have a fire per say. And you're right there have been over the years, this is nothing new, over the years a number of thermal events or fires in lithium ion batteries in everything from cars to energy storage. So this is not totally new. So we have to investigate what was it that occurred in this event, exactly what was the root cause and make sure that we engineer or take all precautions to really minimize the likelihood of such an event in the past. Things are changing in terms of some of the technologies but you know we've had lithium ion batteries on a grid scale 10 to 40 megawatts operating for 10 years already without an incident. So we're investigating it, there's not much I can say at this point but as I mentioned we will share the crucial aspects of the finding to make sure that everybody takes whatever precautionary measures can be taken. So this is not -- there's not a repeat of this event. Steve Fleishman : Okay, thank you. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thank you Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from Gregg Orrill with UBS. Please go ahead. Gregg Orrill : Yeah. Thank you. You talked about some items in the quarter related to generation dispatch in Argentina and then there was some issues in Panama but you didn't modify your adjusted PPC guidance for those regions, can you talk about what you're thinking is? Gustavo Pimenta : Yeah. Hey Greg, Gustavo here. Yes, the impact in the quarter as we mentioned in my prepared remarks present in the case of Argentina and also in Panama with Changuinola were expected. So we had that in our plan already. So 1Q came really in line with our initial projections and expectations so there was no need for us to adjust going forward. And again while we are catching up towards the year end as I said also in my prepared remarks we are having 2.2 gigawatt coming online from today until December and that's going to be a major driver of earnings going forward. So that's why you see this variance quarter after quarter. Gregg Orrill : Okay, thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ahmed Pasha for any closing remarks. Ahmed Pasha : Thank you Brandon. Thanks everybody for joining us on today's call. As always the IR team will be available to answer any questions you may have. Thanks again and have a nice day. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. And welcome to the AES Corporation's Second Quarter 2019 Financial Review Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. Also note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ahmed Pasha. Please go ahead sir. Ahmed Pasha : Thank you, Nancy. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter 2019 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning are Andr\u00e9s Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Gustavo Pimenta, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior management of our management team. With that, I will turn the call over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thank you, Ahmed. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our second quarter 2019 financial review call. I am pleased to report that based on our year-to-day results and our expected growth in the second half of the year, we are on track to achieve our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance with the midpoint of $1.34 and our apparent free cash flow target with the midpoint of $725 million. We are also confident in our ability to deliver 7% to 9% average annual growth through 2022. Turning to slide four, since our last call, we have continued to make great progress on our three key strategic objectives. These are; first, becoming investment grade and enhancing the resilience of our portfolio. Second, positioning the company for sustained growth by increasing our backlog of contracted projects, and third, improving our competitiveness by deploying innovative technologies. Now allow me to provide some color on each one, starting with our first objective of becoming investment grade and enhancing the resilience of our portfolio on slide five. We have already achieved a key investment grade metric and we are on track to attain investment grade ratings in 2020. Our improved credit metrics reflect the growth of our free cash flow paying down 43% of our recourse debt and an almost 70% decrease in our exposure to foreign currencies, commodities and hydrology over the past eight years. A good example of this last point is bringing LNG to Panama with the commissioning of the AES Col\u00f3n Terminal and combined cycle power plant. This new facility has reduced our exposure to poor hydrology in Panama by 70% by providing far less expensive energy to supply our hydro PPAs in times of drought, such as occurred in 2014 and is occurring again this year. It is not only good for AES but it is expected to save Panama more than $400 million a year in imported fuel expenses. We are further enhancing the resilience of our portfolio by decreasing our carbon intensity. This year alone we have announced the sale of 2.4 gigawatts of thermal generation in Northern Ireland, Jordan and Oklahoma. As you can see on Slide six, as a result of our actions, we expect to reduce our carbon intensity by 50% from 2016 levels by 2022. By that date, we also expect that coal will represent less than 30% of our total generation by megawatt hour. Now to our second objective, positioning the company for sustainable growth by increasing our backlog of contracted projects, beginning on Slide seven. We now have a backlog of 6.8 gigawatts of mostly renewable projects. This number encompasses projects under construction or with sign PPAs, all of which are expected to be online by 2023. We are now on track to become one of the five largest renewable developers in the world outside of China. As we discussed on our last call, we expect to sign two to three gigawatts of renewables per year, split roughly 50/50 between wind and solar, and likewise, between the U.S. and international. So far this year, we have signed 1 gigawatt of renewable PPAs including about 500 megawatts since our last call. This new capacity includes 181 megawatts of renewable energy signed in Chile as part of our Green Blend and Extend strategy. Through this win-win approach, we preserve the value of our existing contracts, while replacing a portion of thermal energy with long term contracted renewables. In exchange, our customers receive carbon free energy at less than the marginal cost of thermal power, while still benefiting from reliable capacity provided by thermal generation. We expect to see meaningful progress on the Green Blend and Extend opportunity in the coming months. Now to our projects under construction, beginning on Slide eight. Of the 4.5 gigawatts currently under construction, 43% are renewables. This percentage will continue to grow as we complete the large conventional thermal plants we started a number of years ago, while adding new wind, solar and energy storage. We are particularly pleased with the speed at which we have been able to transition projects from development to construction. Now onto Slide nine, we are reaching key milestones on our conventional projects under construction. We have completed the construction of our OPGC 2 plant in India with one unit already on line and the second unit in the final commissioning phase. Our Southland repowering project in California continues to progress well, and is now approximately 95% complete. We recently achieved first fire and the project is on track to come on line in the first quarter of next year, ahead of our original schedule. I'm also pleased to announce that just yesterday the storage tank at our AES Col\u00f3n LNG re gasification facility in Panama came online, replacing the temporary floating storage unit we had been using. Turning to Slide 10, our Alto Maipo hydroelectric project in Chile is advancing as planned, and is now approximately 80% complete. As you may remember, tunneling is the most difficult aspect of construction, and we now have completed 36 miles with only five miles to go until initial COD. Additionally, we broke ground on a 10-megawatt energy storage project that will serve as the first virtual reservoir in the world. This innovative project is for our Alfalfal hydro plant which is part of the Alto Maipo complex. It will store five hours of energy during periods of low demand, and inject that energy into the grid during hours of peak demand, providing the run of the River plant with many of the same capabilities as a reservoir. We have the potential to increase a virtual reservoir by another 240 megawatts of five hour energy storage at the Alto Maipo complex. Turning to Slide 11. Another component of our contracted growth strategy is investing in LNG, which we see as complementary to our renewables business. Not only does LNG displace heavy fuel oil and diesel with less volatile cheaper and cleaner natural gas, but the investments are based on long term tolling agreements with no direct commodity risk. I have previously mentioned that once our LNG import terminals and re gasification facilities are built, they can be scaled up at a relatively low cost, as much of the key infrastructure is already in place. We are working on expanding our LNG storage capacity in the Dominican Republic by 50 tera BTUs. We have already signed or are in advanced negotiations for third tera BTUs of this additional capacity under long term contracts. This expansion will require minimal investment from AES and it's expected to be completed by 2022. Once fully contracted this expansion will provide $0.02 of incremental EPS. This is up and above the $0.03 of potential upside at our existing LNG facilities in the region we had already discussed. In Vietnam, we're making excellent progress toward the development of a landmark project with 450 tera BTUs of LNG storage and 2 gigawatts of combined cycle power plants. We expect to achieve this critical milestone this year, and once completed, this project will be an important contributor to our earnings growth beyond 2022. Now to our third strategic objective of deploying new technologies to maintain our market leading positions, beginning on Slide 12. We are complementing and enhancing our current businesses by incorporating digital capabilities and by growing in adjacent areas. As we discussed on our last call, by applying new digital initiatives and analytics across our $33 billion asset base, this is a primary driver of our $100 million annual cost savings initiative. We are on track to fully achieve these savings by 2022. One example of our investment in new technologies is our energy storage business. We are now the undisputed global leader in the sector, as both an owner of projects and through Fluence, the energy storage provider that we jointly own with Siemens. Fluence has now surpassed 1 gigawatt of projects either awarded or delivered, including more than 400 megawatts of projects awarded in the first half of 2019 alone. With the current backlog of nearly $700 million and a growing pipeline of activity, Fluence is cash positive, self-funding, and has the potential to rapidly increase in value as demand for energy storage accelerates. Now to Slide 13. Another example is our investment in Simple Energy, a company that provides utility customers a marketplace for energy efficiency products. There is great demand for digital solutions that enable energy users to be more efficient and Simple Energy has grown even faster than we anticipated. Since our last call, Simple Energy has merged with other companies to form a new company called, Uplight. Uplight is now the market leader in providing cloud based energy solutions in the United States serving 85 electric and gas utilities with more than 100 million customers. Through this transaction, the implied value of our equity and simple energy nearly doubled in a little over a year since our initial investment. In digital business, such as Uplift is capital light, largely self-funding and we expect Uplights annual revenue to grow significantly from its current base of over $100 million. Finally, turning to Slide 14. AES\u2019s success as a technology leader was recently recognized when we were awarded our industry's top honor, EEI's Edison award. We were honored for our innovation in advancing round the clock renewables at our Kaua\u2019i solar plus storage project which is already operational in Hawaii. We see renewables plus storage as an increasingly important for our sector, and AES is well-positioned to gain significant market share in this space. Now I'll turn the call over to Gustavo to discuss our financial results and capital allocation in more detail. Gustavo Pimenta : Thank you, Andr\u00e9s. Today, I\u2019ll go over our financial results, outlook for 2019 and capital allocation. Overall, we are very encouraged by our performance-to-date and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our strategic and financial objectives. As shown on slide 16, in the second quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.26 primarily reflecting higher contributions from the U.S. and a lower tax rates. This was partially offset by the impact of asset sales as well as planned outages in Panama and Northern Ireland. In the second half, we expected to post stronger results as we benefit from the plant in Panama returning to operations. Our continued cost savings initiatives and two gigawatts of new projects reaching COD. Turning to Slide 17, adjusted pre-tax contribution or PTC was $240 million for the quarter, a decrease of $15 million. I\u2019ll cover our results in more detail over the next four slides beginning on slide 18. In the U.S. & Utilities SBU, increased PTC reflects the resolution of regulated rate cases last year, contributions for new renewable projects and higher energy sales at Southland. These impacts were partially offset by the exits of coal-fired generation at the DPL and Shady Point. Regarding DPLs DMR extension filing there is not much to report, but we remain on track for an expected ruling in 2020, and continue to feel confident about the merits of our case. In Indiana, IPL recently filed a plan to transform its electric grid, while continued to meet the energy needs of its customers, with improved service reliability, efficiency and safety. The plan calls for $1.2 billion of CND [ph] investment over seven years, with a tracking mechanism recovering 80% of this cost between rate base. AES equity investment would be roughly $200 million. If approved, the plan would be a key component of the mid-single digit rate base growth we have discussed it in the past. A final ruling in the case is expected by early 2020. At our South America SBU, lower PTC was largely driven by lower generation and energy pricing in Colombia, as well as lower volumes in Chile. Lower PTC at our Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean are MCAC SBU reflects an extended plant outage for maintenance and repairs at our Changuinola hydro plant in Panama. Finally in Eurasia, lower results primarily planned outages achieved and the shutdown of 300 megawatt of capacity at Ballylumford in Northern Ireland. In mid-June we closed the sale of this businesses for total proceeds of $120 million. In Bulgaria, there have been no significant developments since our last call. Our plant continues to be dispatched reinforcing its criticality to the Bulgarian grid and we are being paid on time. Lastly, we recently took advantage of strong market demand for infrastructure projects in Vietnam to refinance $1.1 billion of project at [Indiscernible]. The issuance was four times oversubscribed and enabled us to lower our interest rate, while improving financial flexibility. This is just another example of our continued liability management effort across our portfolio, capitalizing on a low interest rate environment. Now to slide 22, to summarize our performance in the first half of the year, we earned adjusted EPS of $0.53 versus $0.52 last year. Relative to 2018, we expect strong growth in the second half of 2019, primarily driven by contributions for new businesses, continued cost savings initiatives, and the timing of our major outages, particularly in Panama and the Dominican Republic. As you may have seen in our press release, we are reaffirming the $1.34 midpoint of our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance. We are also nearing the range by $0.04 to $1.28 \u2013 from $1.28 to $1.40 to $1.30 to $1.38 given our confidence in the outlook for the second half of the year. I will also highlight that we -- we are reaffirming our 2019 parent free cash flow target of $700 million to $750 million. Turning to 2019 Parent Capital allocation on slide 23. Beginning on the left hand side, sources reflect $1.1 billion of total discretionary cash including $725 million of parent free cash flow. Sources also consider $369 million in assets sale proceeds, which include Northern Ireland, and this sPower\u2019s sell down, both of which have closed, as well as Jordan, which were expected to close by year end. Now to uses on the right hand side, including the 5% dividend increase we announced in December, we'll be returning $361 million to shareholders this year. We expect to allocate another $150 million to parent debt paydown largely to strengthen our investment grade metrics, and we plan to invest $450 million in our subsidiaries, leaving about $200 million of unallocated cash. Finally moving to our capital location from 2019 through 2022 beginning on Slide 24. We expect our portfolio to generate $4 billion in discretionary cash, which is about 35% of our current market cap. About 80% of this cash is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow. The remaining $800 million comes from asset sales proceeds, about half of which has been announced or closed this year. In addition to this, we are making very good progress on the third party capital initiative we have discussed previously, and expect the formal announcement later this year. As we have said before, the goal is to provide a more systematic and cost effective source of capital that would be incremental to the $4 billion I just mentioned. Turning to the uses of the discretionary cash on slide 25, roughly 40% of this cash will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Looking forward, subject to annual review by the board, we expect the dividend to grow 4% to 6% per year in line with the industry average. We plan to use $300 million for debt reduction, half of which we expected to complete in 2019. The other half will be used to maintain credit neutrality as we pursue the remaining planet asset sales. We are also expecting to use $1.5 billion for our equity investments in our backlog and projected PPAs, and an additional $200 million to fund T&D investments at IPL was completed all of these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond. The remaining $470 million of unallocated cash will be used in accordance with our capital allocation framework to achieve our financial objectives. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thanks, Gustavo. Before we take your questions, let me summarize today's call. In the first half of the year, we made very good progress on our strategic objectives and expect to accomplish significant milestones in the remainder of the year. We are enhancing the resilience of our portfolio, and we are on track to attain investment grade ratings in 2020. We are increasing our backlog of long term contracted projects. The sustained profitable growth, including advancing renewables and LNG infrastructure, and we are deploying innovative technologies to maintain our competitive edge and market leading positions. Accordingly, we are confident in our ability to achieve our 2019 guidance. We're also confident that we will deliver 7% to 9% growth in cash flow and adjusted earnings per share through 2022. Therefore, we believe AES offers a compelling investment thesis, yielding double-digit total returns that will serve our investors well for years to come. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from Angie Storozynski from Macquarie. Please go ahead. Angie Storozynski : Thank you. So first on Ohio, the DMR for DPL is still being challenged at the court. And secondly, given the successful challenge of percentages, DMR. Just wondering, if there is a way to either adjust the current rider that the DPL is collecting, and also have some improvements to the one that you were requesting to have extended so that it's not just susceptible to future legal challenges. Gustavo Pimenta : Hi Angie, Gustavo here. So just to provide a little bit of detail here. And so while it\u2019s been challenged in the court is not the legality of the DMR. So we have a very specific and narrow claim there. The discussion is around if the DMR should be included or not in the SEET test. So from our perspective and there are precedents in Ohio in which charge similar to the DMR should not be included in the seat best. So we feel -- we feel good about that. In any case, we don't think this is a binary outcome, right. So we have to run this through the SEET test at the end to see what is the final impact. And you know, our view is that decision will probably become coming towards year end. But again, it's not a challenging regarding the legality of the demand, that's a very important clarification. The extension is a separate discussion, right. So, we've got the initial three years under the assumption that would be very specific in terms of the uses of the proceeds. So we've done, we've used 100% of the proceeds for that pay down. We brought -- we brought the complex back to investment grade, and from our perspective, it is necessary to secure the extension for the complex to maintain the investment grade, in position DPL for grid modernization. You may recall we filed last year an investment on his smart grid and for us to continue with those investments. It's fundamental that we secured an extension. So we feel, we have a good case, but that will have to run its two process. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And moving on to your cash value of allocation. So just wanted to make sure that the $395 million of proceeds from asset sales is independent of this pending process, where you're trying to raise third party capital and on the latter, given the low and falling interest rate environment, if you could comment if that is actually somewhat beneficial to the process either you're seeing actually more demand for partial sell down of equity of your operating assets and future assets. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes, hi Angie, this is Andr\u00e9s. Yes, as we said this initiative is additional. It in no way affects the $395 million. It's progressing well, as Gustavo said. And you know stay tuned for developments in the latter half of the year. I would add that this is not like if we don't do this, we\u2019ve already raised $3 billion of partner capital at very good rates. So what we're trying to do here is, do it in a more systematic and predictable way. But in either case, we have additional upside from incorporating partners into our businesses. Angie Storozynski : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ali Agha from SunTrust. Please go ahead. AliAgha: Thank you. Good morning. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Good morning, Ali. AliAgha: Good morning, Andr\u00e9s. My first question I did want to come back to Ohio if I could. I hear the point you make that hey, you know the Supreme Court challenge for you is specific to the SEET test. Nevertheless, you know there is a Supreme Court decision in the state that you know basically went against the validity of the FE DMR. So there's a possibility that eventually something like that challenge happens to your DMR as well if it\u2019s not happening today. So can you just simply summarize for us why you think your DMR would be different and should be treated differently than the way FE\u2019s DMR is being treated? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes, I think, I mean it's very objective here. We've --that's not the discussion in our case, right. So discussion again in our case is regarding the SEET test and not the legalities, so that is not in this court today. AliAgha: I get that. I get that when I think of \u2026 Andr\u00e9s Gluski : I think the potential implications would be for potential discussion on the extension of the DMR, which I think it's a more fundamental discussion if the DMR should exist or not. And again, we do believe we have a very good case when we got the first, but very clearly if you read the outcome there, one of the discussion is if the proceeds are clearly defined in terms of the uses. In the case of DPL this was very clearly defined. We used 100% for that paydown, so a lot of the fundamentals that were discussed in the other case. From our perspective, our solid from a DPL standpoint and again we need that from our perspective to maintain the investment grade and position DPL for grid mode. Gustavo Pimenta : Yes Ali, I think what's very important is also for you know for Dayton to have a grid equal to the other grids in Ohio. It needs an investment grade company and that is all wrapped together in this request for an extension of the DMR. AliAgha: Okay, separately Andr\u00e9s can you also give us an update on what you're seeing in Puerto Rico right now with the political turmoil there any impact at all on your plant or your project out there? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes. Puerto Rico has been through you know removal of the governor and they are in the process of appointing a new governor. Look, whatever occurs will continue to be very important for Puerto Rico. We have the most reliable and by far the cheapest energy on the island. To replace our coal plant in Puerto Rico, by burning heavy fuel oil, which is what the other plants mainly burn, besides some gas would cost about an additional $300 million to $400 million a year in imported fuel bills. So Puerto would have to pay an additional $300 million to $400 million per year, which will be passed on to consumers. I think what's also very important is of the large plants. There are only two which are EPA compliant. Most of the plants in Puerto Rico because they're burning heavy fuel oil have excess emissions of sacs, so they're not EPA compliant. And for that reason the air in San Juan and Ponce, the two main cities is not compliant. So while there's been some you know noise of about our coal ash on the island, really this this plant is very necessary. You know we're working with the PREPA to see about green blend and extend as a way of reducing total emissions, you know emissions on the island. And we'll continue to work with them. So stay tuned. And you know this plant is important. It is producing the most reliable and the cheapest energy on the island. AliAgha: Okay. And last question Andr\u00e9s you know the 395 million of remaining asset sales. Is the goal there still to exit out of non-core assets as part of that process, or is that more driven by partial sell downs of existing assets to rake in recycled capital. Are you thinking about the remaining assets sale process? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Well we have a number of objectives. So clearly, we have an objective of reaching less than 30% of our total generation by megawatt hour coming from coal. So you know that's something that we will keep in mind. We'll also keep in mind you know those markets which we think are growing most quickly and of course we've also been I think very successful in improving our returns for example even on renewables, by incorporating partner. So there's a combination of factors. But yes, obviously, reducing our carbon footprint will be one consideration in our additional sell downs. AliAgha: Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Greg Gordon from Evercore. Please go ahead sir. Greg Gordon : Thanks guys. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Good morning, Greg. Greg Gordon : Sorry to beat a dead horse on the DMR. I already understood that the nuances of your legal situation. But can you just tell us even though you in all rights you need this money to fulfill the capital needs of the distribution utility in Ohio, and should get the approval. Is your 7% to 9% expected earnings growth rate resilient to a negative outcome in that case? Gustavo Pimenta : The answer is yes. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Just to compliment Greg, just to compliment, I think you may recall first Q we have announced the additional $100 million of potential cost savings from digital, which was not in the 7 to 9. So you see that now our forecast has really resilience to manage some of the negative outcome. Having said that, we expect it to get the DMR extension. Greg Gordon : Right. And then my second question was with regard to Vietnam. You talked about how you're pleased with the movement towards potential realization of commercial opportunity there. I think, you know some of your investors are a bit skittish as it pertains to really large bets on highly concentrated investments out in Asia. So if this does come to a become a really viable commercial opportunity, do you see bringing in partners? How would you like decide that investment vis a-vis your overall capital business for AES. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes. Well you know of course we have a portfolio view of our capital and we don't want excessive concentration in any one particular market outside of the U.S. So I would say that to look at what we did with our Mong Duong facility in Vietnam, where we have been very successful. We were paid on time, it's a dollar contract. We're viewed as the premier operator and developer and builder of projects in Vietnam. So in that case, we didn't have an over concentration of capital. So in the case of Vietnam, we may have Vietnamese partners from the get go. But you know we'll be conscious of that. But I think it's moving very well and as you know Vietnam is a place where it takes time to develop the projects, because you require government consensus from many entities. But you know we're well on our way. So we feel very confident about this project, and you know we'll obviously we'll be conscious about over concentration in one country. Greg Gordon : Great. My last question is with regard to Fluence, I think that there was an incident where the technology had some issues in Arizona several months ago. Was that an isolated event or have there been improvements or modifications to the design of your of your offering as a result of that? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes this occurred in a two megawatt facility in Arizona. We've been working with the battery manufacturer, and the utility in that case, really investigating all the root causes and looking at all our facilities. I would say that we've taken a real prudent steps based on that, realize that we're now coming out with our fifth generation of energy storage, which will be a cube and it has all the latest safety requirements. For example, the state of New York, which is it's 95 48 and in addition to that realized that you know we continue to see very strong demand for Fluence even the operator of the one unit that did have that incident, we continue to go forward. So looking at that, we think this is something that there was some earning, we're working again with the battery supplier to really look at what was the root cause. And we're incorporating all learnings and we will have what we have, you know quite frankly, you know the safeties and most up to date units out in in operation, and in construction. Greg Gordon : Thank you guys, have a great morning. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey good morning, Kim. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Good morning Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey. So I just wanted to follow up a little bit different from from other here. First, just with respect to Vietnam and then just what's the latest progress on an LNG contract in there? What should we be expecting going into the fourth quarter here, anything in particular? And then separately, you mentioned IPL. There have been some issues in Indiana around these RP processes of late. Can you comment about what kind of generation shifts are reflected in that 1.2 billion. Would that be potentially incremental? Are you thinking about anything? I know that some of the modeling scenarios that have been released by IPL have talked about this a little bit, so just that if you can't on those two big capital budgeting items here. And then separately as the second question, I'll just ask you now, can you comment a little bit on the PTC contributions and the year-over-year increases from the renewables segment and how you're thinking about that scaling through the course of the year so I'll leave it there? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Okay let's take this multifaceted question part by part. I think regarding Vietnam, as you know when President Trump visited Vietnam, there was a letter of intent signed for this project, and it was you know I'll take one of the marquee projects that the two countries had agreed to. So Energy Demand in Vietnam is growing around 10%. Quite frankly, Vietnam is one of the beneficiaries of some of the trade dispute between the U.S. and China. So expect demand to grow even faster. Vietnam does not have sufficient domestic LNG, doesn't even have sufficient coal, and so it's Vietnam is moving towards LNG and renewables as well. So this is a very necessary project. It's going to start supplying not only the new combined cycle gas plants, which are part of this initiative, but existing ones, which are running out of offshore gas as well. So I think it's very necessary. It's also a project, it's very important for both countries for the U.S. and for Vietnam. So that the next things as you know expect no further progress in terms of you know announcements is a between the two countries and us that this is going to be moving forward with. And you know what Vietnamese partners are involved. Vietnam is a country of consensus as I said. So it takes time. But they move and they move in a very steady but very certain fashion. So that's what I would say sort of stay tuned, and it will of course. We have to -- we are part of the Vietnamese government's master electricity plant and that will also involve you know how much LNG is imported. And you know the phasing in of the combined cycle plants. On the second, I will pass this to Gustavo, what I would say is a big part of the $1.2 billion at IPL is actually to \u2013 and so it\u2019s a smart grid infrastructure. So I'll pass it to Gustavo. Gustavo Pimenta : That's right. So Julien, Gustavo here. Yes. The 1.2 is all T&D. So you're the team is looking for opportunities on the generation side, but it's not in this number yet. So this is it's in the works. On your third question, regarding their renewable contribution in this quarter was not that material around the cent. And as we bring new projects on line towards your end, then we'll have an additional contribution. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Just to clarify quickly, just on the PTC contribution for renewables, should we expect a material tax credit benefit in 4Q here to be kind of a big year of your uptake. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Not material, but some contribution, but not material. Gustavo Pimenta : Yes, Julien, I -- just just remind you that remember that we were split 50/50 between solar and wind, and we split 50/50 between U.S. and international. So you know something like HLBV is not as important for us as it is for other people. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And just finally to read between the lines with IPL, we shouldn't expect anything too different from that 1.2 for the RFP process for the time being? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : The things we are still working on that one. So that this 1.2 was exclusively on T&D and we are looking for opportunities on the RFP and we'll come back to you as we as we get this. Put this to bed. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. All right. Stay tuned. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Charles Fishman from Morningstar. Please go ahead. Charles Fishman : Hi. Good morning. On Fluence, its certainly an emerging technology that we're still going down the cost curve. Andr\u00e9s, would you say that your margins are holding -- per megawatt or however you measure it as this technology progresses down the cost curve. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Look I would say that the sales margin you know certainly are holding their different margins for different businesses. You know obviously we're in 20 countries today. We're selling you know for example in the Philippines where you have many isolated positions. You have different applications such as community solar, you had where frankly SunFlex, which is slightly different project product than our advancing product. So you know the margins will differ depending on the market depending on the exact product. But basically, we see the cost curve coming down, because as we come up with our next generation of product here, it's going to be more productized, it's going to be more prefab and it's going to be less customized as we've learnt more about what is optimal for our customers in different situations, so more customization will be on the software and less will be on the hardware. So I would say expect margins to continue to improve. Not not actually go down even though you know we're seeing some you know in some cases you know people are bidding very low prices for the integration of energy storage. Basically to say that, they have an approved product up and operating in many of those cases we don't. We don't compete because you know we would do require margin from our projects. Charles Fishman : Sure. And then one last quick question. The virtual reservoir, Alto Maipo, how is that different from pump storage, and doesn't involve any of the Fluence technology? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Good question. It's absolutely Fluence technology. So basically it changes. It differs from pump storage, well pump storage you need a reservoir. You've got to put that water somewhere, and you know you have to build pipelines and you have to use electricity get it up there. And so, there's friction, just the physics of storing electrons is superior to that of storing molecules. So the virtual dam is basically the idea to combine a run of the river facility such as you know the whole Alto Maipo complex is about 750 megawatts. And then you have associated energy storage. Now if you have only five hour storage, what I would remind people that means it's five hours at 100% discharge. If you discharge it at 50% you actually have energy storage capabilities for 10 hours. So what this will allow is you know the run of the river is constant. And what we will do doing is injecting energy into the grid when the prices are best. That's basically it. And really providing capacity. I mean the one big issue with renewables is that they don't really provide you around the clock capacity. So this will provide us you know our run of the river does have actually run around the clock capacity, but this will allow us to inject that energy when it's most needed. So this is a very exciting technology and it will be I'm sure copied. And if we end up with a 250 megawatt five hour facility at the Alto Maipo complex, that makes the economics much more attractive. Charles Fishman : That is fascinating. I would think that in the U.S. with the hydro and all the hydro we have but the limited opportunity to expand that might be a potential market if you can drive the Fluence cost down. Is that correct? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes, that's absolutely correct. I mean, we actually are have people looking at the virtual Hydro in places like India, because realize that nowadays getting the environmental permits to construct a reservoir you know that often means forest clearance. That means relocating people, is very difficult. These you can install you know within 12 months. So you know really the only barrier is getting the regulations in place as many on getting the proper capacity payments for this to work in and of course it works best in situations where you have a big penetration of solar for example. So you have that really that duck curve that you can take advantage of. Charles Fishman : Okay. Thanks Andr\u00e9s. I can see why you're so excited about Fluence. Thank you. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : I do. Operator : This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Horn in Russia for any closing remarks. Ahmed Pasha : Thanks everybody for joining us on today's call. As always the IR team will be available to answer any questions you may have. Thanks again, and have a nice day. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation you may now disconnect. Enjoy the rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the AES Corporation's Third Quarter 2019 Financial Review Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ahmed Pasha, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ahmed Pasha : Thank you, Andrea. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2019 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning are Andr\u00e9s Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Gustavo Pimenta, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will turn the call over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2019 financial review call. Today, I will walk through the highlights of the quarter and how we are delivering on our commitments and successfully executing on our strategy. Gustavo will then follow with a detailed description of our third quarter and year-to-date financial results. Our adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.48, which is 37% higher than our results for the same quarter last year. On our prior call, we mentioned that much of our growth would be in the second half of the year, and our strong third quarter results are in line with our expectations. We are on track to deliver on our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance with the midpoint of $1.34, and our apparent free cash flow target with a midpoint of $725 million, and we are confident in our ability to deliver 7% to 9% average annual growth through 2022. I am pleased to report that we're making good progress on the strategy we laid out on our previous calls. Allow me to walk you through step-by-step. First, turning to Slide 4. Let us talk about our progress towards becoming investment-grade. As you may have seen in this morning's press release, we received an investment-grade rating for the first time in the AES' history. I'm very pleased to have achieved this milestone, reflects a multi-year transformation strategy to make our business simpler and more predictable. We not only significantly strengthened our balance sheet, but we have also materially reduced our exposure to risks such as hydrology, foreign currencies, and commodities. Moving to Slide 5, and our growth in renewables. This quarter, we signed over 900 megawatts of new renewable power purchase agreements, bringing our year-to-date total to 1.9 gigawatts. We are fully confident that we will consistently deliver 2 gigawatts to 3 gigawatts of new renewable capacity every year. As of today, our backlog of projects is 6 gigawatts, half of which are under construction and half have signed PPAs. As anticipated, about half of these projects are in the U.S. and half are international. We see ourselves as uniquely positioned in the renewable space to take advantage of synergies and economies of scale, while also benefiting from sufficient geographical diversity. Looking at this from another perspective on Slide 6, approximately 80% of our 6-gigawatt backlog or 4.8 gigawatts is renewables, split between hydro, solar, wind, and energy storage. We expect the majority of our backlog to be online by the end of 2022. Now on to specific large projects. On Slide 7, we can see that the 1.3 gigawatt Southland repowering project is virtually complete, and we are currently in the final commissioning stage. We're on track to begin commercial operations in early 2020. Turning to Slide 8. AES Gener is also making good progress on the Alto Maipo hydroelectric project. The project is 82% complete, including 37 miles of tunnel and both cabins are caverns for the powerhouses. Less than 4 miles of tunneling remain to finish Phase 1 by year-end 2020 at which time the construction of all 531 megawatts of capacity will be completed. In parallel, they are progressing well on the tunneling of Phase 2, which will provide additional water to the project. Let us now discuss the advances we are making on our LNG strategy and turn to Slide 9. Last month, we received approval from the Government of Vietnam to develop and build a 2.2-gigawatt combined cycle gas turbine project alongside our previously approved 480 tera BTU LNG regasification and storage terminal. This complex will have a 20-year U.S. dollar denominated contract with no commodity exposure. We expect to achieve financial close in 2021 and commercial operations in 2024. We see the expansion of our LNG infrastructure business as complementary to our renewables growth strategy by offering a clean, predictable, and low-cost fuel that provides capacity and flexibility to the system. We are focusing our LNG business on three markets, the Caribbean, Central America, and Southeast Asia. In all of these markets, there is rapidly growing demand for natural gas to supply new generation and to displace higher cost diesel fuel oil. A good example of how we are benefiting from this growing demand is the Dominican Republic. As shown on Slide, 10 this quarter we finalized a joint venture with other local generators. As a result of this JV, we will build a second LNG storage tank, expanding our capacity in the Dominican Republic by 80% or an additional 50 tera BTUs. We have already signed or in advanced negotiations for 30 tera BTU of this additional capacity under long-term U.S. dollar denominated contracts. This expansion will require minimal investment from AES, and we expect to break ground in the first quarter of 2020 with completion in late 2022. As we had previously mentioned, our LNG business is easily scalable, which allows us to increase our margin, while requiring relatively little investment from AES. While we are delivering on our commitments in our guidance periods, we\u2019re also making investments to maintain our leadership in new technologies, which will contribute to our earnings growth in future years. We are currently the global market leader in energy storage and the market leader for cloud-based energy efficiency solutions in the U.S. Turning to Slide 11. Today we're announcing a strategic alliance with Google to collaborate on innovation across our business line. We will be working together to find new solutions to accelerate the broad adoption of renewables and energy storage and to improve the experience of corporate customers. AES will collaborate with Google Cloud on energy management and opportunities to develop, own, and operate projects in targeted markets in the U.S. and Latin America that have the potential to help Google meet its clean energy objectives. In addition to providing the potential for additional revenues for AES, this alliance will put both of us on the front line of innovation in the industry allowing us to further reduce costs, optimize operations, and meet changing customer expectations. On Slide 12, we can see that our strategic investment in the leading U.S. cloud-based digital solutions provider in our sector, Uplight is progressing well. This is a business that is growing rapidly from a base of $100 million in annual revenue. It is cash and margin positive and will provide broad insights into customer behavior and energy efficiency. Our energy storage business Fluence, continues to be the global market leader, through Fluence our 50-50 joint venture with Siemens. We are able to capture the accelerated growth in demand for this technology. As you can see on Slide 13 in the first three quarters of 2019 alone, Fluence won contracts for 806 megawatts, compared to the third quarter of 2018 Fluence has tripled its backlog, which now stands at a record high of more than 1 gigawatt with a combined value roughly a 1 billion. Fluence is cash and variable margin positive and continuing to expand its capabilities in order to meet the scale requirements of the business. Our leading position in energy storage is providing us with a competitive advantage in other aspects of our business. We are seeing that nearly half of all solar projects in the U.S. include a storage component. Based on our scale and more than 10 years of experience in integrating energy storage we are very well positioned to capitalize on this growth opportunity. Now I'll turn the call over to Gustavo to discuss our financial results and capital allocation in more detail. Gustavo Pimenta : Thank you, Andr\u00e9s. Today our overall financial results outlook for 2019 and capital allocation. Overall, we are very encouraged by our performance to date and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our strategic and financial objectives. As shown on Slide 15, in the third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.48, primarily reflecting contributions from new businesses including AES Colon in renewables in the U.S. and a lower tax rate. The timing of outages, net of related insurance recovery also had a positive impact on the results in our MCAC region. In the third quarter of 2018 a freak lightning strike caused major damage at our Andr\u00e9s plant in the Dominican Republic forcing it offline with roughly $0.04 impact. In Panama our Changuinola plant has been on an extended plant outage for most of this year. While we have insurance to offset the large portion of this outages. The timing of recognition is not always evenly distributed throughout the year. On our second quarter call, we indicated that we expected a recovery in the second half related to this outages. And in fact the majority of this occurred in the third quarter. This was about $0.05, which effectively catches us up for the first half of the year. As seen on the Slide 16 on a year-to-date basis, the net impact of losses versus insurance recovery is slightly negative at $0.01. Importantly, our Andr\u00e9s facility is fully online in our Changuinola plant is on track to come back online in early 2020. Turning to Slide 17. Adjusted pretax contribution or PTC was $426 million for the quarter, an increase of $99 million or 30%. I will cover our results in more detail over the next four slides, beginning on Slide 18. In the U.S. and Utilities SBU increased PTC reflects contributions for new renewable projects as well as the resolution of regulated rate cases last year. These impacts were partially offset by the exit of 360 MW of coal-fired generation at Shady Point. Regarding DPLs DMR extension filing, we remain on track for an expected ruling in the first half of 2020 and continue to feel confident about the merits of our case. In Indiana, IPLs plan to modernize its electric grid which calls for $1.2 billion of T&D investment over seven years we go to hearing on November 14. Cost would be recovered through an 80% tracker mechanism between rate cases and AES equity investment would be roughly $200 million. If approved, the plan would be a key component of the mid-single digit rate base growth we have discussed in the past. A final ruling in the case is expected by early 2020. At our South America SBU, higher PTC was largely driven by improved margins at Guacolda and lower interest in Chile, as well as higher pricing in Colombia. I would like to take a moment now to discuss recent developments in Argentina. As you know, Argentina recently elected Alberto Fernandez, as the new President as expected. The policies of the incoming government are yet to be defined but we do not expect a meaningful impact on our outlook. Especially given the quality of our assets in the material improvement we have achieved in AES portfolio over the last several years. Right now current controls are in place and we will face restrictions incentive dividends out of Argentina. But as a result of our diversified portfolio, you'll be able to mitigate the impact and continue to deliver strong cash flow growth to our shareholders. Turning back to our quarterly results. As we discussed it earlier higher PTC at our MCC SBU reflects the outages in the Dominican Republic and Panama, net of related insurance recovery as well as the commencement of operations at AES Colon. Finally, in a ratio lower results primarily reflect a one-time transmission charge and lower capacity doing testing and commissioning at OPGC 2. Now to Slide 22. To summarize our performance in the first three quarters of the year we earned adjusted EPS of $1.02 versus $0.80 - $0.88 last year. In the fourth quarter, we expect the higher quarterly tax rate versus a 24% we saw last year. And an impact from the planet outage at our water run facility in the U.S. On a full year basis for 2019 we feel very confident and reaffirming our adjusted EPS guidance of $1.30 to $1.38. Further, based on our achievements to date and current outlook, we are also reaffirming our 7% to 9% average annual growth through 2022. Consistent with our prior proxy, we will provide specific guidance for 2020 on our fourth quarter call. Turning to 2019 Parent Capital allocation on Slide 23. Beginning on the left hand side sources reflect the $1.3 billion of total discretionary cash, which is largely consistent with our last call. Additionally, we are able to take advantage of available debt capacity at one of our subsidiaries spring $200 million in return of capital to the parent. The majority of our discretionary cash continues to come from the roughly $725 million of parent-free cash flow and $350 million of asset sale proceeds. Asset sales include Northern Ireland and the sPower sell down, both of which have closed, as well as Jordan, which is expected to close by year end. Now to the uses on the right hand side, including the 5% dividend increase we announced in December. We'll be returning $361 million to shareholders. We allocated $450 million to parent debt pay down versus our prior target of $150 million for this year to celebrate our credit improvement in reinforce our commitment to achieve investment grade ratings. As a result, we expect that to end the year at 3.5 times parent leverage and 22% FFO to that. Comfortably within the investment grade thresholds of four times and 20% respectively. To that end, as Andr\u00e9s mentioned, we are very pleased to see positive actions by the rating agencies included an investment grade rating from Fitch. We are also investing $450 million in our subsidiaries leaving about $50 million of unallocated cash. Finally, moving to our capital location from 2019 through 2022 beginning on Slide 24. We expect that our portfolio to generate $4.2 billion in discretionary cash, which is again consistent with our last call, plus the additional $200 million in return of capital, I just mentioned, more than 3/4 of our discretionary cash is expected to be generated from parent-free cash flow. The remaining $800 million comes from asset sale proceeds about half of which has been announced or closed this year. Turning to the use of discretionary cash on the Slide 25. Roughly 40% of this cash will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Looking forward, subject to annual review by the board, we expect the dividend to grow 4% to 6% per year, in line with the industry average. We have completed $450 million of parent debt prepayment this year, this is an increase versus our prior target of $300 million. We are also expecting to use $1.9 billion to invest in our backlog, new project at PPAs, T&D investments at IPL and the partial funding of our Vietnam LNG project. Once completed, all of these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond. The remaining $300 million of unallocated cash will be used it in accordance with our capital allocation framework to achieve our financial objectives. With that, I will turn the call back over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thanks Gustavo. Before we open the call to your questions, please allow me to summarize our key points. Our strong third quarter results demonstrate our successful execution, and we remain on track to meet our 2019 guidance and longer-term expectations. We are uniquely positioned to drive long-term shareholder value through strengthening our balance sheet and credit ratings, reducing our carbon intensity, growing our backlog of attractive renewable opportunities, and rapidly expanding our LNG infrastructure business. We are taking steps to consolidate our position as a technology leader, through technologies such as energy storage and cloud-based energy solutions and most recently, creating a strategic alliance with Google. We believe that our strategy and execution, position us well to offer double digit total returns to our shareholders. Operator, we're now ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So I - perhaps, can you elaborate a little bit in the context of the quarterly earnings here. How much is coming directly from renewables and perhaps to take that a step further, how do you think about the cadence of renewable contributions from here on out, obviously we're starting to see it pick up. How do you think about that rolling into the 4% to 6%, or I know not to get ahead of 20, but how do you think about that even year over year here? Gustavo Pimenta : Hi Julien, Gustavo. So, in the - particularly in the quarter, most of the growth is in the MCAC region as I mentioned in my remarks. So, the U.S. on the renewable space, probably, we have a $0.01 to $0.02 in the quarter no more than that. And so that's probably what it should be seen on an annual basis, maybe $0.04 to $0.05 growth because we are deploying around $300 million globally, most of that in the U.S. So that's what you will be seeing going forward. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And then perhaps more importantly here in the near term, you talked about some new LNG opportunities, a JV effort. Also from what I understand, you have some excess marketing volumes, if you will, in Panama, going into 2020 given the IMO regulations. How do you think about the timing to monetize some of those remaining volumes and also the earnings profile of your latest expansion on LNG, perhaps you can address it more holistically on LNG? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Sure. This is Andr\u00e9s. So I think we've done exactly what we had been sort of saying that we could do in the Dominican Republic. So basically, we filled up our 70 tera BTU tank there. So, basically it's at full capacity. By signing this joint venture with other local generators, we need additional capacity. So, we're going to build a second tank with 50 tera BTUs capacity and about 30 tera BTUs is that at - is either agreed to or in the process of that signing agreements for, so that's already quite taking up 60% of the new capacity of the tank. So, this in the Dominican Republic, I think we have really followed through on what we said was possible. In the case of Panama, we have an 80 tera BTU tank. Right now, that's at most about 30% used and so there is considerable capacity to put other generators on gas, and so Panama does have other natural gas projects. It also has a lot of diesel plants, not too far from our plant. So really, it's a question of how fast we can connect those. It also has the capacity for re-export just like we have in the Dominican Republic and also for CNG in terms of trucks and local - local industry. So, I think the point is that in the Dominican Republic we do have capacity now for once we complete this tank for another 20 tera BTUs. And we continue to have about 50 tera BTUs in Panama that are available. So, it's going to be a combination of as we did in the Dominican Republic, local demand, additional power plant. It's going to be additional industries and transportation. And I think, growing over time is the re-export. So, we are exporting natural gas from the Dominican Republic to for example, Guyana, Barbados, Haiti, and there are other possibilities as well, and obviously the Central American region has possibilities as well for the export of natural gas. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: But not ready to quantify earnings contributions or earnings growth in that segment? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : We think - the potential is maybe $0.05 to $0.04 by 2022. Yeah, in the MCAC. I mean this is not counting, of course what we could be doing in Vietnam. So this is we have - is the Vietnam project it would be another $300 plus million of equity going into the project, and we expect good returns on that as well. So, as you can see, that would be a big contributor to our earnings growth post 2024. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. The $0.04 to $0.05 is off of today is in terms of incremental growth through 2022? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : That's correct. That's the opportunity. So, you know in the past we had talked about $0.05 what we basically filled up some of that in the Dominican Republic. So, the additional tank puts us back in another sort of $0.04 to $0.05 of potential upside. Operator : Our next question comes from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Greg Gordon : Couple of questions, I think you just answered, probably answered one of them, you have $200 million allocated in your - on Slide 25 to Vietnam LNG and CCGT investment, but I was going to ask whether that's the total expected investment because the - I guess it comes online in '24 and you said you actually just said it would be $300 million to $400 million. Is that right? Gustavo Pimenta : Gustavo here, Greg. That's right. So that is in 2022, so we\u2019re probably going to reach financial close into 2021, spend half of the equity in 2022 which is this 200 that we see in the chart and then 2023 will draw additional $150 million to complement our investment. Greg Gordon : Yes, and I know you have disclosed contract terms, but you would expect to target like a mid-teens levered equity return on projects with this risk profile. Is that fair? Gustavo Pimenta : That's about right, yes. Greg Gordon : And can you give us a sense of what a strategic alliance, like the one you've announced with Google means in terms of your competitive advantage, signing commercial agreements with them and how that translates into confidence in the growth profile at the renewables business. It's just hard to not to be cynical, but it's hard to separate what's a PR announcement versus what has tangible backlog implications? Gustavo Pimenta : Yes, well, you know Greg, as you know that we've been, I think certainly not people to sort of chase shiny object. We really go to the fundamentals, what does this mean. Now this is a preliminary announcement it has many components to it and we will be providing color as things develop and things materialize. But realize first that we are sort of uniquely positioned to help Google meet its 24/7 renewable zero carbon energy across the globe. So we are uniquely positioned to do that. We recently won a bid in Chile for about 125 megawatt to do exactly that. So this is - that was the first stage concrete, there will be others we believe, and as I said, it will be in targeted U.S. and Latin American markets. Second is to realize that the biggest, the fastest growing sector of corporate demand is web services. So, I believe, Google has announced about 6 gigawatts of need across the globe. So this is, it's a big target, it's growing, and this is the fastest growing corporate sector, what they want is renewable energy around the clock. We are uniquely well positioned to deliver that. So again there will be follow-ons to the Chile deal we believe and stay tuned to that. In addition, there is some elements of energy management in these locations for us using our portfolio to provide carbon free around the clock energy. Then there is also, I would say on the - on our platform, the opportunity to optimize and continue to deliver cost, cost reductions. So we've been doing spending years quite frankly cleaning up data, because again, a lot of buzzwords that people throw out AI machine learning, it's only as good as the data you have. So we've been cleaning up the laborious and very hard task of having the right data in place. So we believe by combining our two capabilities. We've been the leader in new applications in our sector. We'll give us really a boost to the cost saving initiatives we have mentioned, it will also give us a boost in terms of delivering on what are continually changing customer expectations. So, we expect this alliance to make very concrete announcements into the future. So this is not just sort of a feel good PR announcement, it really is that the two of us combined, were leaders in certain areas such as energy storage, energy efficiency solutions in the U.S. So I think it makes a whole lot of sense this is sort of two plus two equals six. And this is really all of this will be basically upside to what we have and our numbers, and we're going to dedicate people and resources to make sure this is something very concrete. In terms of - what it would really make an impact on our earnings that's probably, I'd say, two or three years out, at a minimum, because and this is really sort of setting the groundwork, could even if you win new power purchase agreements you have to build on these are require additionality. So just to put that in context, I think it's very important, but it's not going to have an immediate impact cost. Greg Gordon : Last question for you on the Fluence JV obviously making good progress. It doesn't sound like right now, it's actually creating any concrete economic value in terms of cash distributions or earnings contributions to AES Corp, but when do we get to a tipping point where it's either potentially a significant cash flow earnings contributor or is there another way that we monetize this value for shareholders like could this be a standalone sort of public market IPO at some point if it really gets to critical mass. I mean, what are the different ways now that you're really making headway selling the product globally that you can monetize that value for shareholders? Gustavo Pimenta : Well, as you know, you hit the - I think the nail on the head, it's really how do we monetize that value. This is not - you know a regulated asset, it's a marginal contributor. We have to think about it differently. So we've created a market leader in the market that's growing at 100% per year. It's going to have a major impact on the future of our sector. So again, it's not a sort of a marginal investment, you have to think about all the value we're creating by this. As I - we mentioned, we are not, it is cash and variable margin positive but that money is going into the business to prepare it for really scaling up, I mean it grew a 100% last year. So you have to scale it up. So I think it's creating a lot of value for our shareholders directly in the business and some point it will probably make sense to really have a marker out there. So you guys can get a feeling for what it's worth, because we think we've created a lot of value in the business, there are various ways to do that, but I think a marker, would be very good to be able to put it into what's its value within the AES portfolio. But I have no doubt that this is going to be a major part of our business going forward. And I mean our sector going forward. And do realize that it is giving us a competitive advantage in winning renewable PPAs, because we know as much as anybody about how to integrate energy storage and some very exciting developments coming in the Fluence space. So stay tuned, in terms of products, in terms of new ideas. So for example, one in Chile, we making the world's first virtual reservoir or you can take a run of the river hydro, which is Las Lajas and really instead of having to dispatch the energy 24/7 you can quite frankly not dispatch it when energy prices are low, mostly due to solar and inject that energy when prices are much higher. So there's a lot of innovation going down it's very exciting. Operator : Our next question comes from Christopher Turnure of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Christopher Turnure : I just wanted to go through the quarter a little bit here in 2019 as a whole in terms of kind of nonrecurring items. So $0.48 for the third quarter, adjusted EPS, is it fair that the $0.05 of insurance proceeds there are nonrecurring? And with, I guess, plants back online in Panama now, anything else to think about for the fourth quarter or continuing into 2020 in relationship to that? Gustavo Pimenta : Chris, Gustavo here. No, not really, I think the $0.05 is recurring because it's a catch-up from the first half, we may recall in the second call - second quarter call, as we mentioned that our first half was slightly weaker versus our expectation due to those outages and we expected to recover a large portion of that impact in Q3, Q4 and that's what happened, so it's - it's really a catch-up from the first half, you should read this as a first half figure and not as - as a one-time. So that's what it is. Christopher Turnure : And then I think you said kind of net of the insurance, it would still be $0.01 negative for you for the Panama outage, at least, so that why the kind of your 2020 number - or there would be kind of no residual effects going to 2020, the net '19 number would be almost not impacted? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : That's correct. That's correct. Christopher Turnure : And any other kind of nonrecurring items helping or hurting Q3 in terms of having a meaningful effect? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Not really, I think the one that I pointed out in my remarks, was tax, it's relatively within the range on a year-to-date basis, but you may recall, last year we had unusual low tax rate. So that is one thing for us, that would probably it won't be happening in the Q4 of this year, but a part of that nothing - no one-time-ish. Christopher Turnure : And then just, I guess, a little bit longer term, when we look at what's occurred so far this year, after you introduced your kind of new long-term plan or rolled forward your long-term plan back in February. You've reached investment grade, maybe a little bit faster than the plan, interest rates have been kind of going in your favor and everyone's favor, some LNG success certainly has materialized maybe partly offset by the Ohio DMR situation. I'm just wondering kind of where the bigger maybe surprises versus your plan have occurred, if any, your long-term plan, that is? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes, Chris, I agree with everything except what you said about the DMR. We think that continue to feel good about the successful resolution of this, so we agree that we've had some upside. And I think quite frankly those things which are under control we've consistently I think over delivered whether it's paying down debt, reducing costs growing the LNG business are growing renewables. So, that's true, but we really don't see that the - I wouldn't put the DMR is - we continue to feel good about it and it remains on track. Christopher Turnure : So kind of rolling all that together, it sounds like you feel like you're executing on your plan and really not getting ahead of yourselves at all in terms of some of the positives that have occurred? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Again, we are executing on our plan and I think we've delivered some things ahead of schedule that is certainly true. I mean we have been talking about getting our sort of the investment grade stats this year and, but we upfronted that we paid down more debt. I think it's very important that we said we pay down $150 million of recourse debt, we paid down of $450 million. So we have been over-delivering. Operator : Our next question is from Ali Agha of SunTrust. Please go ahead. Ali Agha : Good morning, Andr\u00e9s, first question, I recall, I think it was maybe last quarter or two quarters back when you roll forward your growth aspirations and came up with the 7% to 9% growth rate for '18 through '22. At that time, you had also told us that the old growth rate, which was '17 through '20 and 8% to 10% that you would end up at the high end of that growth rate. I just want to confirm that that's still your conviction as we sit here today. Gustavo Pimenta : Yes. Gustavo, here. The short answer is yes. We will be providing color on February, but as I said in my remarks, we are reaffirming the 7% to 9% and to your question, yes, that's our expectation. Ali Agha : Second question, looking through your numbers year-to-date, you got about $124 million of distribution from Argentina to the Parent. Is that a good number on a run rate for the annual Argentine cash flow subsidiary distributions and how should we think about the capital controls that are currently in place or your prior experience perhaps in dealing with the leftist government in terms of what the cash flow implications and offsets could be going forward? Gustavo Pimenta : Okay. Yes. Regarding Argentina, no that's not a - the run rate, what we had said in the past, as you know that we had three years where we did not distribute dollar dividends from Argentina. And so there was a catch-up in recent years. Now having a portfolio like ours as Gustavo mentioned in his speech, we don't expect this to affect us and also in Argentina is one that is a little bit of up and downs. We've been there in good times, we've been there in bad times. We've always made money, even in 2002 we made money in Argentina that I think reflects the quality of our assets and the fact that they're very lowly levered. So this is not the sort of the run rate with current exchange controls in place, we don't expect to be paying material dividends out of Argentina, certainly next year. But we've always, you know it's again operated well there. We have put a big back-office there. And so that's one way of, quite frankly, if you will, dollarizing is by using our pesos in Argentina to get services which are worth dollars to us. So that helps offset to some of this. So to be clear, in Argentina, we've always made money, we've always been capable of paying dividends, just we haven't always been able to buy the dollar. So if you look historically, the average is more like $70 million or so, and it's been like 5% to 6% of subsidiary distributions over time. So, and this is quite frankly what I expect in Argentina, it's kind of up and downs. But it's, we've operated well there and I expect this getting sort of up and downs, but it's not something that's going to materially affect our forecast. Ali Agha : And then finally, Andr\u00e9s, another topic that in prior quarters, used to get more attention, but we're not hearing much about is but - Merits and Bulgaria. Can you just give us an update of everything that's going on there on the contract or what your expectations are looking forward? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Sure. Really we have nothing new to report on merits so that's why it wasn't part of our speech. We continue to be paid on time. The plant is being dispatched and now we're entering the winter season, which becomes even more important, they are up to date on their payments, the off-takers financial situation, NEK is strong. The country is growing strong, and it remains investment grade. So those things continue. And regarding the illegal state aid case in front of the European Commission, our advisors continue to talk. So we have no official case yet and they continue to talk. And so, as I - we said before, we have really nothing new to report, but the asset is doing well. Operator : Our next question comes from Charles Fishman of Morningstar. Please go ahead. Charles Fishman : On Andr\u00e9s on the Vietnam contract. Okay, the projects approved by Vietnam and you said you're in negotiations I guess for the long-term contracts, with the contracts be with the government or were you referring to contracts with LNG in quarters what contracts are those? Gustavo Pimenta : Charl, that's a good question. Basically look there are two projects both supporting each other. So, the first is the 480 tera BTU regasification and storage terminal. So to put that in context. Today, we have about 150 tera BTUs between Panama and the Dominican Republic, with the additional 50 tera BTUs that will go to about 200 tera BTUs. So this is a very large project. Now in this case, we have about 38% of the project and PetroVietnam has the remainder. So we have a partner in this project. So, where will the gas go? There is about 6 gigawatts I believe of gas five turbine in Vietnam. There had been using offshore gas, which is running out. So there will be immediately a demand for the LNG terminal. In addition to our 2.2 gigawatts of combined cycle gas plant, which would be using that gas. Now in the second project on the combined cycle gas turbine plants. The 2.2 gigawatts we own 100% of that. So when we talk about contracts or different contracts. So one would be of course of the contract between the LNG terminal and the generators, including ourselves. Then there is the off-take of the energy and capacity coming from the 2.2 gigawatts of new generation. And I realize we have a 1.3 gigawatt plant already in Vietnam, Mong Duong 2which has done very well performing, it is one of the best performers in the country, we built it on time and on budget. As a long-term dollar-based contract, it's been paying on time. So basically, it would be like a repeat of Longjiang-2 only burning gas this time. The other contracts for example between the supply of gas to this is Son My 2 is the name of the terminal that contracts have yet to be negotiated and obviously would be PetroVietnam and ourselves negotiating with U.S. gas suppliers. So those have yet been negotiated. But in general the - it's a very firm commitment by us and then by the Government of Vietnam to do this project. And so I'd say the one thing that distinguishes it from, say, the projects in Panama and the Dominican Republic, is that - the demand is there. So it's not a question of building a terminal storage facility where the anchor tenant plant that you build a 30% of it. In this case it's going to be use - the use is going to be much, much faster, getting to the 90% plus usage. Operator : Our next question comes from Gregg Orrill of UBS. Please go ahead. Gregg Orrill : Yes. Thank you. I was wondering if you could touch on the BHP contract, BHP buyout of a PPA in Chile and whether that was a driver for the return of capital increase that you reported in the quarter? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : So there are two part. The - responding to the second, absolutely no, nothing has occurred yet. This will take effect two years. So it hasn't affected our returns of ASN there at all at this point. The second was that you know BHP has a - let's say a mandate from Corp to go green. So they put out a bid for 6 terawatt hours of new energy and what came back was basically about may a bit more than half of it was existing hydros in Chile. The other ones are renewables. So this will replace our existing contract. No, our contracts, generally we make our money on the capacity payments, energy is a pass-through. So for our contract, they have to make us whole, if they're not going to use our capacity. So they have mentioned a number in their press release of a value of about $780 million. This has yet to be absolute - the exact number has yet to be negotiated. We think it's sort of around $800 million, but this is yet to be negotiated. But basically this shows, I think the strength of our contracts in Chile, you know lot of people are questioning the value of these contracts. And I think this shows that these contracts are very solid. So they will pay us for this future - the present value of that future capacity it was running through 2029. And there is still about - plant is about 20% contracted. And so this will be - it's a business decision by BHP and it's I think shows the strength of our contracts and the business in Chile. Gregg Orrill : Do you think that will impact your growth rate guidance? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : No, absolutely not. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ahmed Pasha for any closing remarks. Ahmed Pasha : We thank everybody for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Next week, we look forward to see - seeing many of you at the EEI conference in Orlando. Thanks again and have a nice day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ahmed Pasha, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ahmed Pasha : Thank you, Anita. Good morning, and welcome to our full year 2019 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Gustavo Pimenta, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will turn the call over to Andres. Andres? Andres Gluski : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our financial review call. Today, I will discuss our 2019 performance and our strategy to continue delivering attractive returns to our shareholders. I'll begin with some of the key highlights for this call on Slide 3. In 2019, we earned $1.36 of adjusted EPS, 10% higher than in 2018 and toward the top end of our range of $1.30 to $1.38. We're reaffirming our 7% to 9% average annual growth in adjusted EPS and Parent Free Cash flow through 2022. In 2019, after reducing our Parent Debt by half, we were upgraded to an investment grade rating for the first time in AES history. In 2019, we completed construction of 2.2 gigawatts of new projects. We also signed 2.8 gigawatts of renewable contracts, bringing our backlog to 6.1 gigawatts. This pace puts us on track to nearly triple our portfolio of renewables in operation to 22 gigawatts by the end of 2024 versus 2016. We achieved critical milestones in expanding our LNG infrastructure in the Dominican Republic, Panama and Vietnam. To accelerate a broader adoption of clean energy, we are delivering innovative energy solutions through our leading platforms, including Fluence, Uplight, and our strategic alliance with Google. Considering our success to-date in substantially lowering our carbon intensity, today, I'm announcing a target to reduce our coal fire generations to below 30% measured in megawatt hours by the end of this year. Furthermore, we expect to reduce it to less than 10% by 2030. Turning now to our strategy on slide 4, we spent the last several years positioning AES to lead the energy transition and cementing our place is a top renewables developer throughout the Western Hemisphere. Today, I will discuss the three core themes of our strategy. Investing in sustainable growth, offering innovative solutions and delivering superior results. Through our strong presence in key markets, we are well positioned to benefit from the global transition towards more sustainable energy. In these markets, we see growth in clean energy of 30 gigawatts per year. By capitalizing on our competitive position, and the dynamics favoring clean power generation, we have had great success in increasing our backlog of signed PPAs. Turning now to the backlog of projects beginning on slide 5. In 2019, we signed long-term PPAs for 2.8 gigawatts of which approximately half is wind, 40% is solar and 10% is energy storage. 40% of this capacity is in the U.S., and 60% is located internationally. Turning to slide 6, beginning with the U.S. Our sPower and AES distributed energy businesses maintain their momentum adding more than one gigawatt of new long-term contracted renewable projects to our backlog. The rate of growth from our distributed energy business is particularly impressive. In 2019, it signed 365 megawatts under long-term PPAs, three times more than in 2018. One of the reasons for this business\u2019 success is its deep knowledge of customers and specific markets, including Hawaii, and the Northeastern U.S. For example, in Hawaii, we delivered the world's largest solar plus storage project, and during the year, we were awarded an additional 205 megawatts of similar projects. As a reminder, our renewable investments are expected to produce low to high teen IRRs across our markets, assuming conservative terminal values. We have some unique advantages that allow us to earn these attractive returns such as our presence in growth markets and our 25 gigawatts of development pipeline, including land and interconnection rights, our ability to bring low cost capital to optimize AES\u2019s return on equity and our relationship with key customers, including those for whom we are implementing our green plant and extend product. Now to slide 7, as of the end of last year, our backlog of projects with signed PPAs was 6.1 gigawatt, half of which was under construction. Approximately 80% of the total or 4.8 gigawatts are renewable, split among hydro, solar, wind, and energy storage. In terms of the 3 gigawatts, that was under construction, I am pleased to announce that the 1.3 gigawatt Southland Repowering project achieved commercial operations on February 6. This project was completed ahead of time and slightly under budget, and it's helping support the reliability of the grid in Southern California. The remaining 1.7 gigawatts under construction are renewables and energy storage. The majority of these projects are expected to come online in 2020 and the remainder in 2021. In addition to our 6.1 gigawatt backlog, and the 2 to 3 gigawatts of annual renewable PPAs that we expect to sign, we see opportunities for attractive investments that are not currently included in our forecast, such as further rate base growth at DPL and IPL as well as more renewables and energy storage. Turning to slide 9, another example of how we're achieving sustainable growth is AES Gener, which is one of our most important businesses. AES Gener is transforming its portfolio by growing its wind and solar businesses and strengthening its balance sheet. Under its green blend and extend strategy, AES Gener negotiating new long-term renewable PPAs with existing customers, which preserve the value of its thermal contract and create incremental value with long-term contracted renewables. Customers receive carbon free energy at less than the marginal cost of thermal power, enabling them to meet their sustainability goals and affordable energy needs. In 2018, AES Gener announced that screen blend and extend strategy. And today I'm pleased to report that since then, it has executed 2.5 gigawatts of long-term renewable contracts, the majority of which were signed in the last 12 months. As a result, AES Gener has significantly diversified its generation mix, and has positioned itself to deliver attractive long-term growth. Specifically, these new contracts will more than double its renewable capacity and largely offset the roll off of legacy contracts in Chile to 2024. In Columbia, AES Gener is successfully expanding from a single hydro asset to a broader portfolio, which will include wind and solar. AES Gener will primarily serve its green blend and extend contracts through a combination of 1.6 gigawatts of new renewable capacity and its existing portfolio. We expect these new projects to deliver mid teen returns to AES. In addition to this new capacity, the Alto Maipo hydroelectric complex will be substantially completed by the end of this year and will help supply these new PPAs. Gustavo will discuss how AES Gener will fund the 1.6 gigawatts of new investment, including AESs participation. Now to slide 10, and the second theme of our strategy. In addition to growing our core infrastructure business, we're also developing new solutions to meet increasing customer demand for 24x7 renewable power and greater energy efficiency. Our focus is on solutions that are scalable and relatively capital light, which allow us to work with our customers to co create applications that meet their most critical energy needs. A key platform for us in this area is our energy storage business Fluence, which continues to be the global market leader. Through this partnership with Siemens, we are well positioned to benefit from the expected 15 to 20 gigawatts of annual growth in energy storage globally. Today, we're already seeing that nearly half of all solar projects in the US include a storage component. In 2019, Fluence won contracts for 961 megawatt and has tripled its backlog since 2018, to a record of 1.2 gigawatts, which equates to roughly a $1 billion in revenue. Fluence is cash and margin positive and it's continuing to expand capabilities, including modular prefab, and solar DC coupled products to address new market opportunities. Across all of our platforms, we've also been incorporating innovative applications. An example is a 10 megawatt 5 hour duration energy storage facility at AES Gener Alfalfal hydro plant in Chile. This groundbreaking project will serve as the first virtual reservoir in the world, providing the run of the river plan with capabilities similar to a traditional reservoir. AES Gener expects to inaugurate this project in March and it has the potential to increase this virtual reservoir by another 240 megawatts. Turning to slide 11, last quarter, we announced a strategic alliance with Google to collaborate on innovation across our business lines. We're actively working together to develop new solutions to accelerate a broader adoption renewables and energy storage and to improve the experience of corporate customers. This Alliance also encompasses energy management and opportunities to develop, own and operate projects in targeted markets to help Google meet its clean energy objectives. Now to slide 12. Our strategic investment in Uplight continues to grow rapidly. As a reminder, Uplight provides utilities with a suite of digital services, including an online marketplace. These solutions improve end customer experiences, while helping utilities balance energy demand and reduce service costs. This business now works with over 80 electric and gas utilities and reaches over 100 million households and businesses in the United States. Uplight has over $100 million in sales in 2019 with solid margin and continues to fund growth without additional equity needs. We see Applied very well positioned to benefit enormously from continued growth in cloud based digital solutions in all aspects of energy management. Finally, turning to slide 13. And the third theme of our strategy, superior results. As we invest in sustainable growth and offer innovative solutions to our customers, we are transforming our portfolio while achieving superior financial results. In late 2019, we received our first investment grade rating and expect that we will receive another investment grade rating this year. Additionally, through 2022, our portfolio is expected to generate $3.4 billion of discretionary cash, which we will invest to continue to deliver double digit total returns to our shareholders. This return includes our dividend which has grown by 30% over the last five years, and we expect it will continue to increase by 4% to 6% annually. Having the right energy mix is a key to our future success. This morning we announced a target to reduce our generation from coal to below 30% of our total volume by the end of this year. Furthermore, we expect to reduce generation from coal to less than 10% of our total by 2030. We are also committed to providing timely and accurate ESG data. We were the first U.S. investor own company in our sector to publish a climate scenario report consistent with the recommendations of the task force on climate related financial disclosures. Additionally, we can provide a substantial portion of the disclosures recommended by SASB and expect to provide virtually all of the remaining data by the end of this year. We're beginning to see the benefit of attracting a wider investor base that appreciates AES's growth in clean energy and innovation while maintaining consistent financial performance. Before I turn the call over to Gustavo, let me address the issue of Covid-19 or the coronavirus. As a long term contract generator, overwhelmingly in U.S. dollars and the U.S. utility business, we see limited impact from most likely scenarios from the coronavirus epidemic. Furthermore, as I have previously laid out, AES has a strong pipeline of contracted mostly renewable projects that ensure growth over the coming years. Although we may suffer some delivery delays, both our solar and energy storage businesses have largely secured their supplies of lithium-ion batteries and photovoltaic cells for this year. We will continue to closely monitor the situation and take proactive measures to ensure the resiliency of our business. With that, let me turn the call over to Gustavo to discuss financial results and capital allocation in more detail. Gustavo Pimenta : Thanks Andres. Today, I will cover our financial results, credit profile and capital location. I will conclude by addressing our guidance for this year and expectations through 2022. As Andres mentioned, we finished 2019 on a strong note, achieving the upper hand range of our adjusted EPS and setting a solid foundation for growth. As shown on slide 15, adjusted EPS was $1.36 primarily reflecting growth at our regulated utilities, contribution for new businesses including renewables and AES Colon, and a lower tax rate. These positive drivers will partially offset by the asset dispositions including 2.6 gigawatts of coal-fired generation. Turning to slide 16, adjusted Pretax Contribution or PTC was $1.2 billion for the year and increase of $55 million. I will cover our results in more detail over the next four slides begin on slide 17. The U.S. and utilities SBU increase PTC reflects regulated rate cases completed in 2018, as well as contributions for new renewables projects. These impacts were partially offset by the exit of coal-fired generation at Shady points and DPL. At our South America, SBU, lower PTC was largely driven by lower generation and asset sales, partially offset by better operating results at Guacolda and lower interest expense in Chile. Higher PTC at our MCAC SBU reflects the commencement of operations at AES Colon and better contracted prices in Panama, as well as insurance recover in the Dominican Republic and the Panama net of outage costs. Importantly, these facilities in the DR and Panama have resumed operations at full capacity. I would now like to discuss briefly the resilience of our portfolio. This was the worst hydrological year on record in Panama, but the financial impact was significantly lower than in years past, due to actions we have taken to improve our portfolio. The addition of AES Colon not only diversifies our fuel mix, but also lowers the hydraulic exposure and the spot price volatility of the entire system. This is just one example of how our capital allocation strategy has enabled us to lower our overall EPS risk from hydrology, foreign currency and commodities by 70% since 2011. Turning back to PTC in Eurasia, lower results primarily reflect asset sales in the United Kingdom, Philippines and Netherlands. Now to slide 21. Before moving on, I wanted to provide a couple of business updates starting with DPL in Ohio. As you may know, in November, the distribution modernization rider in DPL's electric security plan was removed and we reverted back to ESP1. The net impact of this decision reduces PTC by about $50 million annually. Roughly $25 million of this relates to costs that would have been recovered through a distribution investment rider. We expected to start collecting this again in 2022, after new distribution rates have been filed and approved. In addition, as part of the order to revert to ESP1, DPL needs to pass certain regulatory tests, including the significantly excessive earnings test seat in it. These tests are customary for regulated securities in Ohio and use it to assess regulated returns. We feel good about our ability to pass this test and maintain ESP1 rates. Above the overall tariff reduction last year was disappointing, AES continues to be fully committed to DPL and we look forward to resuming our discussions around market rate and other modernization investment opportunities. DPL has the lowest residential tariff in Ohio and we believe there continue to be significant opportunities to improve value to our customers. We are expected to have more details about DPL investment plan in the following quarters. Regarding Argentina, yesterday, the new administration announced anticipated reforms. As part of that all in price have been reduced by about 15% to 20% and regulated tariffs have been linked to Argentina pesos, with local inflation adjustments. This is in line with our expectations for the last year's election, and it is fully reflected in our guidance and expectations for 2022 and beyond. Importantly, we have also had some positive developments that work to offset the regulatory changes in Ohio and Argentina, highlighting once again the resilience of our portfolio. This includes the potential extension of our existing legacy regeneration at Southland, early efficient gains from our cost savings and digital initiatives and opportunistic re-financings leveraging a historical low interest rate environment. Regarding Southland approval is still pending by the state water board and local permitting authorities and is expected for the second half of this year. Now turning to our credit profile on slide 22, since 2011, we have reduced our current debt by $3.1 billion or 50%. At year end, parent leverage was 3.7x and FFO to debt was 21%, comfortably within the investment grade thresholds or 4x and 20% respectively. After having obtained our first investment grade rating in November, we continue to expect a second upgrade this year. Turning to our 2019 parent capital location on slide 23. Beginning on the left hand side sources reflects $1.4 billion of total discretionary cash. This is largely consistent with our previous call with the exception of the announcer Jordan sale, which we now expect to close in the first half of this year. Now to use on the right hand side. Roughly 60% of our discretionary cash was allocated to shareholder dividend and debt reduction and the remaining amount we invested in our subsidiaries, primarily in our renewables backlog. Turning to our guidance on the slide 24. Today, we are initiating guidance for 2020 adjusted EPS of $1.40 to $1.48. Growth this year will be driven by the completion of our 1.3 gigawatts Southland repowering which came online earlier this month, and a full year of operations at OPGC-2 in India. Continued growth and renewals including 1.5 gigawatt is scheduled to reach commercial operations this year. Efficiency gains from cost cutting and our digital initiatives and a lower interest expense due to refinancing benefits and completed debt production. This growth will be partially offset by the reversion to ESP1 at DPL in Ohio, reduce the tariffs in Argentina and a slightly higher tax rate. I will note that much of our growth will begin contributing later in the year, and our EPS is expected to be more weighted towards the second half. For instance, although Southland came online this month, it will be operating on a merchant basis until the PPA begins in June. Turning turns slide 25. Parent-free cash flow is expected to be from $725 million to $775 million this year, and is expected to grow 7% to 9% per year through 2022 of a 2018 base. Now to 2020 Parent Capital location on slide 26. Beginning on the left hand side sources reflects $1.3 billion of total discretionary cash, including roughly $750 million of parent-free cash flow. Sources also include $550 million in asset sale proceeds. Moving to the uses in the right hand side. Including the 5% dividend increase we announced it in December, will be returning $381 million to shareholders this year. We do not plan in addition of debt reduction beyond repayment of $180 million of temporary drawing on our revolver. Our credit metrics are very strong and we will continue to improve on the strength of our cash flow alone. And we plan to invest $750 million in our subsidiaries including our equity for the Southland repowering, our renewables backlog and the green blend and extended strategy at AES Gener. As Andres mentioned AES Gener has been successfully executing its de-carbonization strategy by securing 2.5 gigawatts of renewable energy contracts. This includes growth in Colombia; whereas AES Gener is diversifying away from the single hydro asset to include new wind and solar resources. These replicates what the AES has done in other markets such as Panama, where the addition of AES Colon diversifies our portfolio and materially enhanced developed our existing assets. As a result of its successful strategy execution, today AES Gener announced a $500 million equity issuance to help fund its $1.8 billion renewable growth program. And AES will be participating with our pro rata share of approximately $335 million. We believe this investment will create significant value to our shareholders and will allow us AES Gener to remain an important contributor for AES earnings and cash flow for years to come. Finally, moving to our capital location from 2020 through 2022, begin on slide 27. We expect our portfolio to generate $3.4 billion in discretionary cash. Three quarters of this is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow, with the remaining $900 million coming from asset sale proceeds. This reflects an increase in targeted asset sales of roughly $400 million since our last call, which is fully incorporated in our guidance for the year and in this 7% to 9% growth rate. Given the range of opportunities we have, we feel confident in achieving this additional sales target in the next few years. Turning to the use of this discretionary cash on the slide 28, roughly a third of this cash will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Looking forward, subject to annual review by the board, we continue to expect to increase the dividend by 4% to 6% per year in line with the industry average. We are also expected to use $1.6 billion to invest in our backlog, new project and PPAs, T&D investments at IPL and the partial funding of our Vietnam LNG project and the investment AES Gener acquisitions. Once completed, these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond. The remaining $400 million of unallocated cash is largely related towards 2022 and will be used it in accordance with our capital allocation framework to achieve our financial objectives. Based on the significant transformation we have achieved AES in the last several years. We now have a much stronger balance sheet and portfolio of assets. As such, we are well positioned to capitalize on our leadership in the global energy transition, while deliver very solid financial performance for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres. Andres Gluski : Thank you, Gustavo. Before we open the call to your questions, I will summarize the key points we have made this morning. Through actions we have taken over the last several years, we have greatly enhanced the resiliency of our portfolio. In 2019, this was reflected in our financial performance, as well as the investment grade rating we achieved. By adding 2.8 gigawatts of renewables to our backlog, we have cemented our position as a leader in the global transition to cleaner energy. By successfully executing on its green blend and extend strategy AES Gener sign 2.5 gigawatts of renewable contracts. These contracts will ensure strong earnings at AES Gener by largely offsetting the roll off of legacy contracts expiring through 2024. We are also accelerating a cleaner energy future by delivering innovative solutions through Fluence, Uplight and our strategic alliance with Google. We are targeting a reduction in coal generation to below 30% by the end of this year, and to less than 10% by 2030. Finally, we're reaffirming our 7% to 9% average annual growth in adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow through 2022, which along with our growing dividend will deliver double digit total returns to our shareholders. Operator, we're now ready to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith, with Bank of America. Please go ahead. JulienSmith: Hey, good morning, Team. Hey, howdy. So, if I can dig in a little bit on the latest capital raises in Gener as well as the uptick in renewable spending here and the equity involved. How do you think about the current outlook reconciling versus the long-term earnings growth rate, right? So you've seen a further uptick in the CapEx and renewables. Does that put you in a different place relative to that range? How do you think about your disclosed CapEx at this $8 billion mark relative to achieving your longer-term targets? And again, this is more of as you ramp up, how do you think about where you are within that range? And then maybe a sub point on that is, how should we think about that global renewables investment relative to the capital raises scenario, I suspect is a different number than the CapEx on that front. Andres Gluski : Okay, let me take sort of the big picture. Let's start with Gener. So in the case of AES Gener, the capital raise is to fund the very successful green blended extent, we've gotten 2.5 gigawatts of green blended extend PPAs, this is good for the existing assets, this is good for us because we get these long-term contracted renewables, average life is around 17 years. So that is what we're raising the capital for that because that's up and above, we did very well in doing that and Gener needs to raise the money. And it basically will largely offset the roll off of existing thermal contracts that Gener has through 2024. So that's one thing. So basically, the capital raise of Gener and our participation, we think it's a good investment; these are renewable contracts in dollars, inflation adjusted. And we want to fund that growth and really move Gener into the sustainable, long-term future. Regarding our other investments, so this basically keeps us on target that we have given before. So we're on target, we're successfully delivering on these renewables. And what we're seeing is our investments in some of the most or innovative fields, whether it be Fluence, whether it be Uplight, are going to help us achieve those renewable goals, and also achieve our financial targets. So it's all coming together very nicely. And what this really is allowing us to do is to meet our financial guidance and commitments, while at the same time decarbonizing even faster. So that really is I\u2019d say the big story. I think Gustavo will add something. Gustavo Pimenta : I would just add, Julien, I think one of the benefits of especially this investment in Gener is the post 2022 story, right. So, a lot of the investments that we are doing now will help, as we said in the call, sustain the earnings and cash flow that AES Gener has been providing to AES. So it's not within the 7% to 9%, it's going to be post that period, but it allows AES to continue to sustain growth post 2022. JulienSmith: Got it. So if I can clarify briefly the 330 is above and beyond what you have in your global renewables CapEx and equity. Right? GustavoPimenta: That's right. JulienSmith: And that's what your contributions, and again, the critical point that you're making is that it's - the investments in that 330 are targeted beyond the growth rate that you're currently talking about GustavoPimenta : That is exactly right. And we increase the asset sales, which is helping funding some of the investments. JulienSmith: Got it. And if I can say it even more succinctly, if I'm hearing you, right, you think that based on the broad assumptions that you're looking at, you can keep AES Gener earnings and cash flow largely intact after 2022 when some of those contracts roll off. GustavoPimenta: That is exactly. Gener will provide more detail in their call, but that is exactly the way we see. JulienSmith: Right. And that's with the existing set. Are you still needed to scale up Gener to get that level? GustavoPimenta: With existing. With this new contract and assuming the roll off of the legacy assets. The legacy - JulienSmith: You're already there? GustavoPimenta: Yes. Operator : The next question comes from Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Charles Fishman : Good morning. Slide 15 I look at - I'm sorry, I got the wrong - wait, I'm on the wrong slide deck. I apologize here. It's the slide that shows 2019 headwinds on EPS basis. There it is, Slide 15 on the slide deck, $0.12 headwind. What will be the - I'm looking at slide 45, which has the PTCs? It doesn't look like asset sales will be a big headwind in 2020. Am I correct on that? GustavoPimenta: Yes. And intention is that that's right. I think we continue to have some assets sales the plan. We've up at this and so I think what is important is might seven to nine, even with the increase in asset sales that represented. They are incorporated in those numbers. So the 2020 EPS already has whatever the dilution we have as a result of asset sales is incorporating that 7% to 9% growth. If I answered your question. Charles Fishman : Yes, no, I think you did. Okay. Second question is I think Andres, there's first call quite a while. I didn't hear Alto Maipo mentioned is no news good news that still goes operational this year. AndresGluski: Yes, yes. In this case, look, Alto Maipo is 90% completed. It has sort of two phases. So the first phase is we only have, I think less than a little bit more than three miles of tunneling left. So most of the tunneling on Phase 1 is done, and we expect it to be substantially completed by the end of this year. And so we're already putting in the electronics and machinery and so it's going forward well, so that's why we didn't talk about it. Because it's going forward. And again, it is part of this - let's say transformation at Gener towards much lower carbon intensity. Charles Fishman : So the tunnel boring machines were the cause of the problem initially, those are operating pretty well now, and we're over that. AndresGluski: Yes, a lot of them have actually finished their tasks and have been taken out. So I think we have two left. At one point, we had six, which is probably the most I think of any project in the world. So yes, I mean, there were issues with the rock quality, and more than anything else. So that's basically being overcome. What will continue in 2021 is what's called Volcan, which is basically just to bring additional water to the project but the project will have its full capacity of 531 megawatts, but what is very interesting also is this first virtual reservoir, which we have 10 megawatts up and running. And the regulation is in place five hour batteries. And that will allow us to dispatch this run of the river plant differently, take advantage of differences in daily pricing. And if this goes well, we could expand this from 10 megawatts to 240, which would be really substantial. So realize that the Alto Maipo is together with Alfalfal. So together, this is 750 megawatts of hydro, close to the load center of Chile in Santiago, so it really will be a terrific asset. Operator : Next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. SteveFleishman: Hi, good morning. Maybe just in thinking about some of the businesses like Fluence and Uplight and Google partnership. Can you - I'm not sure, I don't think you kind of can disclose like financial impacts from them yet, but I don't know when they can be material to the company. Can you maybe give some color on how we could see value from them kind of show up to the AES holder? AndresGluski: Sure. That's a great question. So let's take Fluence which is the most mature. In the case of Fluence, this is a market which is and a technology which is, really hitting, I would say, very rapid rates of growth, anybody you will talk to, will talk about, whether it's U.S. whether it's India. 10s of gigawatts of energy storage, which is needed to be able to operate, the greater numbers of renewables and the technology keeps improving, we're coming out with new products, we\u2019ll be launching them this year, which will help lower costs and for example, prefab modular et cetera. So that's very exciting. Now, getting to valuation, as I've said in the past, we would like and to really get a marker by having a capital raise at Fluence, so that you can see what was the value created. So as you know, we feel that, there's a lot of value is being created, we think it would be a unique asset in the market, there's nothing else similar to it. So we're working on that. Regarding Uplight, we first bought Simple Energy, and then we merged it with Uplight and the valuation that we got from Simple Energy in that merger was up about 100%, from what we paid in less than two years. So Uplight is again, doing many things for a lot of people in terms of being really a cloud based digital services provider for utilities, really the leader in the field, and it's also helping us, with our cost savings and quality improvement as well. So that when you probably longer term, I mean, we're already seeing the benefits in terms of our own operations and in terms of the things that we can offer. And you're right. And especially in the case of Google, there's not that much that we can disclose other than, this involves, as I said, energy management, providing them with energy, we have our first PPA in Chile, to provide them with renewable power. And what's very interesting to them is really our ability to provide 24x7 renewables. So, we're working on a number of fields with them. And in all of these is how we really get a competitive edge in renewables that combining that with our existing platforms and existing client relationships. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Ahmed Pasha, for any closing remarks. Ahmed Pasha : Thanks everybody for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Thanks and have a nice day. Operator : This conference has not concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Ahmed Pasha, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ahmed Pasha : Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2020 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements, which are discussed in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website along with the presentation.  Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Gustavo Pimenta, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will turn the call over to Andres. Andres? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter financial review call. Today, I will discuss the current state of our business and our strategic goals going forward. We are well positioned to withstand the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and are seeing the benefits of our multiyear effort to enhance the resilience of our business. The vast majority of our earnings come from long-term contracted generation, which provides significant protection from the downturn in electricity demand and prices. Furthermore, our liquidity position is strong. We have no major near-term debt amortizations, and we continue to improve our investment-grade metrics. Our construction projects are progressing on schedule without any supply chain disruptions, and we are on track to grow our renewables backlog and achieve our environmental goals.  The net effect of this is that despite seeing double-digit reductions in demand in some of our markets, we are lowering our earnings guidance for the year by only 5% to a range of $1.32 to $1.42. We are reaffirming our expectations for 2020 parent free cash flow and our longer-term growth projections for both adjusted EPS and current free cash flow. Gustavo will provide an overview of our first quarter financial results, our liquidity and our guidance in more detail.  Turning to Slide 4. Today, I will focus my discussion on the 3 core themes of resilience, sustainable growth and leadership in innovation. Beginning on Slide 5 with the resilience. These are certainly unprecedented times with a global pandemic and a sharp economic downturn, resulting from restrictions on travel, mobility and work. Fortunately, for AES, as you may recall from our last quarterly call, we were closely monitoring the spread of COVID-19 and taking steps to reduce its impact on our business.  We began to implement our plans for all nonessential personnel to work remotely by the first week of March, increased our stocks of fuel and PPE at our plants and work sites and built up cash liquidity at all levels of our portfolio. We also ensured that national and local governments recognize the critical importance of the service we provide and classified our operations as essential, facilitating the movement of personnel to our generation plants, utilities and construction sites.  As a result of all of these early actions, we have continued to deliver our services without any significant impact and have minimized contagion among our people and contractors. To date, only 10 AES people out of a population of 9,000 have tested positive for the virus. And more importantly, none have become seriously ill or hospitalized. Of these, 5 have been deemed recovered and virus-free.  Turning to Slide 6. Our resilience comes not just from our actions to address the crisis but from our fundamental business model. Across our portfolio, we have an average remaining contract life of 14 years. Approximately 70% of our business is long-term contracted generation with the vast majority in U.S. dollars or euros. Nearly all of our offtakers are investment grade, and our contracts are primarily for capacity with our revenue relatively unaffected by the actual energy produced. Thus, this part of our business is very resilient to a downturn in energy prices and demand.  We have an additional 15% of our business, which is generation with shorter-term contracts, which has some modest exposure to spot prices. The remaining 15% of our business is regulated utilities, principally in the U.S., and this is where we have been most impacted by the decrease in demand. We saw a net reduction of around 10% in April, mainly from commercial and industrial customers, and we expect lower demand to continue for several months before recovering by early next year.  We are taking measures to offset the reduction in 2020 earnings, primarily through cost savings that we are realizing from our digital initiatives. For example, investments we have made over the past two years have made it possible for much of our staff to work remotely, including many positions on the operational side. We expect some degree of remote work and the associated benefits to continue even in a post pandemic world. Through these and other initiatives, we expect to deliver additional cost savings of around $50 million this year, which Gustavo will cover in more detail.  Now let me turn to Slide 7 and our second theme, sustainable growth, which continues to be a key area of focus. Despite the current crisis, we remain on track with our current growth projections and ambitions to triple our renewables portfolio by 2024 versus 2016. Our backlog is now 5.3 gigawatts, of which 1.8 gigawatts are currently under construction. Turning to Slide 8. Construction includes the 531 megawatt hydro at Alto Maipo in Chile, which continues to progress according to our prior schedule. Phase 1 is now more than 93% complete. The turbines are in place and only 2.7 miles of tunneling out of a total of 46 remains to complete Phase 1 and start operations early next year. Of our more than 30 renewable projects under construction, only 2 small ones have been affected to date by the COVID-19 lockdown. Both are in upstate New York, where we had to temporarily stop work. Fortunately, as you may recall from our fourth quarter call, we took very early steps to ensure we had solar PV panels and our balance of plant in-country and at our construction sites as we foresaw potential supply chain bottlenecks in China and Korea. Turning to Slide 9. I am pleased to announce the start of commissioning of the world's most efficient solar project, Andes Solar in Chile, which at 37% has the world's highest capacity factor as a result of using bifacial PV panels and a high solar irradiation, combined with the low temperatures of the Atacama desert.  Building on our innovation in solar, we are bringing a new prefabricated PV design to our projects, starting with an initial 10 megawatts in Chile. We are finalizing a strategic partnership with a company that has a patented design that not only allows for construction to be completed in half the time but can also double the energy output per acre versus today's best-in-class project designs. We expect to expand this solar PV technology to many of our projects in the future to allow for faster construction, more efficient use of land and new C&I offerings.  Regarding new PPA signed, so far this year, we have added approximately 700 megawatts of new renewable PPAs to our backlog, mostly in Chile and the U.S. Thanks to our leadership in innovation, we continue to see mid-teen levered returns on our renewable projects at the stand-alone project level. We are on track to deliver between 2 and 3 gigawatts of new renewable PPAs this year and growth in demand for smaller projects in the U.S. remains especially strong. In Chile and Colombia, our green blend and extend strategy has resulted in 2.5 gigawatts of new PPAs and the construction of 1.6 gigawatts of new renewables.  Now on to Slide 10. In addition to wind and solar, our Energy Storage business also continues to grow rapidly, both through our own projects and through Fluence, our joint venture with Siemens, which sells energy storage systems to third parties. Both aspects of our business are benefiting from an acceleration in demand for battery based systems. Today, about half of our solar bids in the U.S. include an energy storage component. New markets and application also continue to emerge, such as Virginia's 3.1 gigawatt energy storage mandate and Germany's plan to add up to 6 gigawatts to support the transmission network.  Even in the midst of the current crisis, in early April, we signed a 15-year PPA for 100 megawatts of 4-hour duration energy storage in Southern California through sPower. I'm also very proud that we will soon be commissioning the world's first virtual reservoir at the Alfalfal hydro complex just outside Santiago, Chile. This virtual reservoir consists of 10 megawatts of 5-hour batteries, which allow for dispatching the run of the river hydro largely at night when solar power is not available and energy prices are higher. We will be increasing this virtual reservoir to 250 megawatts over the next couple of years, and there are several smaller virtual reservoir projects in late-stage development in the U.S.  Fluence currently has an all-time high of 1.3 gigawatts of energy storage systems under construction, which include some of the largest projects in the world. This year, we will be rolling out our sixth generation energy storage technology platform. It is both factory assembled and modular, and will improve reliability, increase the speed of execution and lower costs.  Through our growth in renewables and energy storage, we continue to make progress towards our ambitious environmental goals. As you can see on Slide 11, we remain committed to reducing our coal generation to less than 30% of our gigawatt hours by the end of this year, which will make us compliant with ESG standards set by Norges Bank, among other institutions. We expect to realize this target through the continued sale and decommissioning of coal plants, along with the execution of our extensive backlog of renewable projects.  Finally, turning to our leadership and innovation on Slide 12. We continue to move forward on a number of innovative solutions that we see as highly relevant for the long-term future of the industry. One example is Uplight, which, as a reminder, works with more than 80 electric and gas utilities in the U.S., reaching more than 100 million households and businesses, providing a suite of digital solutions. We expect revenue growth of 30% this year, fueled in part by utilities' desire to improve customers' experiences in a capital-efficient digital way. Another example of our innovation is our partnership with Google, which is progressing well. We continue to make headway on a number of initiatives that we will be in a position to announce in the near future.  Now I would like to pass the call to Gustavo Pimenta, our CFO, so he can provide more color on our results, debt profile and guidance. Gustavo Pimenta : Thank you, Andres. Today, I will cover our financial results, credit profile and capital allocation. I will conclude by addressing the impact of COVID-19 on our guidance for this year and expectations through 2022. In the first quarter, we made good progress on our key financial metrics. As shown on Slide 14, adjusted EPS was $0.29 versus $0.28 in Q1 2019, in line with our expectations. We benefited from higher contributions from the MCAC SBU, largely due to improved availability and hydrology in Panama as well as lower effective tax rate. These positive drivers were partially offset by the reversion to prior rates at DPL in Ohio and mild weather at our regulated utilities in the U.S.  Turning to Slide 15. Adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, was $250 million for the quarter, a decrease of $22 million versus the first quarter of 2019. I'll cover our results in more detail over the next four slides, beginning on Slide 16. In the U.S. and Utilities SBU, lower PTC reflects the reversion to ESP 1 rates at DPL as well as mild weather at both DPL and IPL. These impacts were partially offset by contributions from new renewable projects. At our South America SBU, higher PTC was largely driven by lower interest expense and realized FX gains in Chile, partially offset by a planned major outage at our hydro plant in Colombia as part of a larger project to extend its useful life. Higher PTC at our MCAC SBU reflects the return to operations at our Sanginel hydro plant in Panama, following an extended major outage in 2019, as well as improved availability at our Colon plant. We also benefited from improved hydrology in Panama following a very dry year in 2019. Finally, in Eurasia. Lower results primarily reflect the sale of our business in the United Kingdom. Before moving on, I want to provide an update on the DP&L in Ohio on Slide '20. As we discussed on our fourth quarter call, after reverting to previous ESP 1 rates, the DP&L was required to pass certain regulatory tasks, including the significantly excessive earnings test, or SEET. In April, DP&L began this process by filing an application with the commission. There is a comment period set for July and potential hearing, if needed, set for October. A final ruling is expected by early 2021. We feel good about our ability to best this test and maintain ESP 1 rates.  As we have said in the past, AES continues to be fully committed to the DP&L. We are now planning to invest approximately $900 million in its grid over the next 4 years, including base distribution, transmission and its market investments, which will lead to low double-digit rate base growth through 2023. To that end, AES plans to invest $300 million of new equity in the DP&L, half of it this year and the other half in 2021. These investments will allow DP&L to continue to provide safe and reliable service, while materially improving the experience we deliver to our customers and preserving very competitive rates.  Now turning to our credit profile on Slide '21. As we discussed on our fourth quarter call, between 2011 and 2019, we reduced our parent debt by $3.1 billion, which is about 50%. At year-end, our parent leverage was 3.7x and our FFO to debt was 21%, comfortably within the investment-grade threshold of 4x and 20%, respectively. Currently, we have $800 million of borrowings under the revolver, roughly half of which was drawn as precautionary measure to reinforce our cash position.  We expected to end the year with a 0 revolver balance and credit metrics that are even stronger than in 2019. We are also maintaining our regular dialogue with the rating agencies and continue to be on track to receive our second investment-grade rating. While the fundamental credit strength of AES remains unchanged, given the current macro environment, we believe the timing of this upgrade is now more likely to be closer to year-end.  Moving on to liquidity on Slide 22. In times of uncertainty, we recognize that cash is king. To that end, we are in the strongest financial position of our history. We have $3.3 billion in available liquidity, 2/3 of which is in cash. This is more than sufficient to meet any unforeseen needs over the remainder of the year.  Turning to our receivables on Slide 23, which have remained stable over the last few years. We have been monitoring our receivables very closely to ensure they are within the 45- to 60-day grace period allowed under our contracts. And so far, through April, they are in line. It is worthwhile to mention that in a few of our markets, governments have declared a payment moratorium for certain residential utility clients as the lockdown is in place. While we are mostly removed from this impact as a generator, this could create some additional working capital needs at certain businesses. To that end, we are working with multilateral organizations, such as the Inter-American Development Bank to create mechanism for securitizing receivables in these markets. Now turning to our refinancing needs in 2020 on Slide 24. As you may know, we have been proactively strengthening our debt maturity profile. In fact, just last year, we executed more than $5 billion in liability management across our portfolio. As a result, we have only $300 million of debt to be refinanced for the remainder of the year, most of which is at our U.S. utilities. We are pleased to see investor interest in the $407 million IPALCO refinanced we recently completed, with the deal being 5x oversubscribed, reducing our refinancing needs to just over $300 million for the remainder of the year.  Now to 2020 parent capital allocation on Slide 25. Beginning on the left-hand side, sources reflect $1.4 billion of total discretionary cash, which is largely consistent with our previous disclosure. Moving to uses on the right-hand side. Including the 5% dividend increase we announced in December, we'll be returning $381 million to shareholders this year. We do not plan any additional debt reduction beyond repayment of the temporary drawings on our revolver, which was $180 million at the end of 2019.  Our credit metrics are strong and will continue to improve on the strength of our cash flow alone. And we plan to invest $565 million in our subsidiaries, including our equity for the Southland repowering, our renewables backlog and the $150 million investment in grid modernization at DPL this year. This leave us with up to $452 million to be allocated. The amount is largely a function of the asset sales we plan to close this year. The use of this cash may include investment in AES Gener, Green Blend & Extend strategy, as we discussed on our last call. The timing of this investment is dependent on AES Gener's funding needs, so it may be later this year or early next year.  Next, moving to our capital allocation from 2020 through 2022, beginning on Slide 26. We continue to expect our portfolio to generate $3.4 billion in discretionary cash, 3/4 of this is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow, with the remaining $900 million coming from asset sale proceeds.  Turning to the uses of this discretionary cash on Slide 27. Roughly, 1/3 of this cash will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Looking forward, subject to annual review by the Board, we continue to expect to increase the dividend by 4% to 6% per year, in line with the industry average. We are also expecting to use $1.9 billion to invest in our backlog, new project and PPAs, T&D investments at IPL, the partial funding of our Vietnam LNG project and the investment in AES Gener, I just discussed. This $1.9 billion also includes the $300 million infrastructure investment in DP&L, which is incremental to our last call. Once completed, these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond. Finally, turning to our guidance and the impact of COVID-19 on Slide 28. As Andres mentioned, AES is well positioned to weather this storm due to the actions we have taken over the last several years to improve the resilience of our portfolio. So let me start first with the impact from commodities and FX.  Despite significant volatility in both markets, we are expecting an impact of only $0.03. This is because today, our business is mostly contracted and denominated in U.S. dollars, materially reducing our exposure. We are also forecasting a $0.02 impact due to a higher interest expense as a result of drawing on our revolving credit facilities to reinforce our liquidity. Like many other companies in our sector, we are also seeing an impact on demand, primarily at our regulated utilities, including IPL and DPL, where we do not currently benefit from the coupling protection. In April, we saw C&I demand decline in the mid-teens at both businesses, with a partial offset of about 6% from an increased residential demand, where we have better margins.  Internationally, demand has dropped 5% to 15% in our key markets. But again, in those markets, our model is mostly based on take-or-pay contracts or tolling agreements with limited exposure to demand. The impact from lower demand across our portfolio is expected to be $0.07 in 2020.  Although projecting future load, GDP recovery is very challenging in this unprecedented times, we are currently assuming demand will have an extended U-shaped recovery with a mid-teens average decline across our portfolio in the second quarter, high single digits in the third quarter and low single digits in the fourth quarter, not returning to precrisis levels until next year. As a reference, and assuming our current geographic mix, a 1% change in the year to go demand translates into an approximately $0.01 impact on our full year earnings.  We have also been working very hard on potential levers to offset this impact and are expecting an incremental cost savings in the year of about $0.05. As Andres mentioned, most of these savings are coming from our digital and laser-focused cost control initiatives. This includes reduced maintenance and lower fixed costs and G&A.  Turning to Slide 29. As a result, we are reducing the midpoint of our guidance by 5% or $0.07 with a new range of $1.32 to $1.42. On the parent free cash flow side, we are not seeing an impact versus our previously communicated goal of $725 million to $775 million as a result of the strength and diversification of our portfolio. We are also reaffirming our 7% to 9% average annual growth rate through 2022. Although it is disappointing to revise our adjusted EPS guidance for the year, the limited impact we are seeing in the midst of an unprecedented global crisis, illustrates the current strength of our portfolio and balance sheet.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thank you, Gustavo. Before we take your questions, let me summarize today's call. The fundamentals of our business remain strong, and our portfolio of largely long-term contracted generation is resilient in the current pandemic and related economic downturn. Therefore, we remain on track to achieve our strategic goals of greening our portfolio, leading in new technologies and attaining a second investment-grade rating. We have already taken steps this year to strengthen our liquidity and further reduce costs to mitigate the impact on earnings from decreases in our sales.  Although we expect a 5% reduction in this year's earnings, we are reaffirming our 2020 parent free cash flow and longer-term growth rates in earnings, cash and dividends. We expect to generate $3.4 billion of discretionary cash through 2022, which we will invest to continue to deliver double-digit returns to our shareholders. And finally, I would like to thank the people of AES, who through their discipline and hard work are ensuring safe, reliable and affordable energy in all of the markets we serve.  Operator, I now would like to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Ryan Greenwald with Bank of America. Unidentified Analyst : So maybe if we can just start with asset sales. It looks like Jordan through late last month. So if you kind of just talk about your commitment there and you're confidence to get out of the sales on those in here? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes. Look, our asset sales continue to progress. In the specific case of Jordan, I don't think is as binary as you described. So we remain confident of closing a number of sales this year, and there's continued interest in those assets, and we're making progress. I would add that we're really not depending this year for any asset sales to fund our growth. So we remain confident. We think that we'll close a number of sales. There's interest. And of course, we don't talk about them until they're actually completed. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Fair enough. And then I appreciate all the commentary around demand trends and sensitivities. But could you just allude a little more to any latitude you might have under a more severe protracted scenario? I know you kind of alluded to $50 million in additional savings already? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes. So first, I want to be clear that we're trying to be as transparent as possible. So as Gustavo described, what we're seeing is, quite frankly, continued reduction in demand, lower demand for the remainder of the year. So most severe in the second quarter. And then you have a single-digit -- high single-digit decline in the third quarter and lower single-digit decline in the fourth, and only recovering in the first quarter of next year. So that's our assumption. So that really would is consistent with a U-shaped recovery or even a double U-shaped recovery. If things are more severe, we are in a resilient case. And of course, we have more latitude on different levers that we can pull. I would add that because what we did very early on was increase our liquidity, we have about $0.02 of having that additional liquidity on hand. But I think that was the right thing to do given that there was a lot of uncertainty.  So we have a very good track record of cost controls and reductions. And I think that, again, we will react given to how we see the situation evolving. Now we did mention $0.05 this year, mostly from our digital initiatives. And I think that we have learned how to work remotely. And there are more digital tools that we can implement, and we expect to -- that these savings will continue into next year. So we have some continued additional upside because that's really not in next year's numbers. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. And then just lastly, the interest capitalization that you guys did at Alto Maipo, is that included in adjusted EPS? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : It is. It is included in the adjusted EPS. Unidentified Analyst : And what was kind of the thinking there? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : No, that's just an adjustment based on the history of the project. We've adjusted this year as the team refined the calculation. So it impacted Q1 this year. Operator : Out next question will come from Charles Fishman of Morningstar. Charles Fishman : Andres, you mentioned a 10% reduction in demand in April at the U.S. utilities, was that weather normalized? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes, that's weather normalized. Charles Fishman : Okay. And then earlier this week or it might have been late last week, there was an article in The Wall Street Journal about the impact of the pandemic in Brazil. And it was -- looked pretty severe. Are you noticing -- obviously, you got boots on the ground in there. Are you noticing anything? Is there any color you can add? You've got a significant interest in Tiete? You've got other solar projects in Brazil and maybe just expand that to Argentina as well. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Sure. So let's take maybe sort of the Latin American region. So first, the reaction there will be different, perhaps by country, but it's also somewhat different than the developed countries. So there's a number of things. First, in general, they were quite quick lock down. Brazil was an exception to that and Mexico. But in most countries, the lockdown was quite severe and quite early.  Second, they will be lifting these restrictions. But in general, the pandemic has been less severe in those countries than it has in the developed world. What we do know about the pandemic is that the, quite frankly, biggest drivers are age. And the second is obesity rates. So when you think of age, a lot of these countries have an average age of 30, which is very different from an average age of almost 50 in some of the developed countries. So the pandemic will have a different effect there.  So I'd say the main difference is how much fiscal stimulus can they apply to react to that. So what we're seeing is -- again, it varies by country, but some of the smaller countries have had pretty aggressive fiscal stimulus. And they have gone out and basically assured the liquidity in countries like Panama, for example, have assured the liquidity on hand. And then Gustav also mentioned that we have worked with the -- even though we're not in most cases, not directly affected because it's more at the distribution company level, but we've also been working with multilateral institutions to have windows to a discount accounts receivable. But the vast bulk of our clients are multinationals, investment-grade multinationals in these countries.  So taking a specific case of Brazil, I mean, as of yet, we have -- it's in one of those countries in the range that Gustavo talked about, between sort of 5% to 15% of our key countries. In Brazil, it's different very much state to state. Brazil is 1 of the countries where we don't have the long-term contracts. They tend to be shorter-term contracts. So there has been some effect there in Brazil, and it's also the 1 of the ones that we have in local currency. Brazil is obviously 1 that's been affected.  What is our feeling about it? I think, again, in general, these countries will open up. The effects of the pandemic will be somewhat different because of the demographics of it. Personally, I think that 1 of the things to watch is commodity prices. Because that will maybe even have a bigger effect than some of the shutdowns, given the large informal sectors that these countries have.  You mentioned Argentina. Argentina is doing very well on the shutdown in terms of its few cases, very controlled cases. And I would say that the main thing to watch in Argentina is debt refinancing or debt restructuring, let's say, that they're undergoing now. You will notice that our parent free cash flow is unchanged, but we have a decrease in earnings. One of the -- that's reflecting in part Argentina, where you've had significant devaluations. And you've had some degradation of our tariffs. But we weren't expecting to get any dividends out of it.  One of the other businesses affected was the P&L, for example, where we don't expect any dividend. So that's -- I just wanted to explain why our cash remains unchanged and we're seeing a decrease in dividend. So regarding Latin America, in general, I'm pleased by the reaction of a lot of countries. The populations have been very supportive of their governments in that respect. And given the different demographics, it will evolve differently. So I do expect them to start opening up. Depends on the country. But later on this month and certainly by June. And the -- again, the reaction of a younger population will be different. Charles Fishman : Okay. Andres, that's very helpful. Just 1 final question on DP&L. The $300 million incremental investment over the next couple of years. Is that dependent on the resolution of the earnings test or any other regulatory things you need to put in place before you make that investment announcement? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : So the first 150 -- the answer is no for the C test because we feel pretty good about it. Our average ROE filed is below 10% and our recommended threshold is around 16%. So we feel good about that one. But we are discussing an acceleration of our smart grid plan. Remember, we had filed for a smart grid plan 2 years ago, and we are now resuming that conversation. So we're expecting to have the approval to fund the second $150 million, and that's going to come as we get more clarity around this market approval. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our next Richard Rosen with Columbia [ph]. Unidentified Analyst : Yes. How is it that, that expectations for new renewable signings should be thought of and financing thereof? Should there be more issues in getting financing going forward? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Let me see if I understood the question. In terms of how we are proceeding with our renewables as we were before. We are getting project financing. We are seeing perhaps some areas be stronger than other areas. As I said, smaller projects in the states, we see demand particularly strong. At this point, about -- if you look at our renewables about 1 quarter is related to energy storage, and we see demand there very strong.  So I guess the question is, we basically see demand for like energy storage projects and renewables, especially for utilities is very strong. We have the green blend and extend angle in Latin America, and that remains strong for large, especially mining offtakers. Unidentified Analyst : Your goal has been, what, 2 to 3 gigawatts a year. Is that still a reasonable expectation? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes, absolutely. And if you look at our run rate for the first trimester, it was 700 megawatts. So that's, quite frankly, almost on the button of what we were doing last year. Unidentified Analyst : Well, the world changed between Q1 and Q2, which is why -- but you're keeping that expectation. That's really fantastic. Okay. That's it. And stay safe. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ahmed Pasha for any closing remarks. Please go ahead, sir. Ahmed Pasha : Thank you, everybody, for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Thank you, and stay safe. Bye-bye. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask question. Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ahmed Pasha, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations. Go ahead. Ahmed Pasha : Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to our second quarter 2020 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements, which are discussed in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website along with the presentation. Joining me this morning are Andr\u00e9s Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Gustavo Pimenta, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will turn the call over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our second quarter financial review call. Today, I will spend some time on three near-term priorities, achieving our 2020 guidance, attaining a second investment grade rating and decarbonizing our portfolio. We believe that progress in these three key areas will allow us to reach a larger investor base in the near-term. They will also advance our longer term strategic and financial objectives. After discussing these three themes, I will provide an update on our sustainable growth initiatives and our efforts to create a technological competitive edge. Last quarter I indicated that we were well-positioned to withstand the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic due to the resilience of our business model. I am pleased to report that our second quarter results demonstrate this resilience and keep us on track to achieve our full year guidance. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.25 in the second quarter in line with last year. This reflects the strength of our business model, which is based on long-term take or pay contracts with credit worthy customers. As a result, we are very confident that we will achieve our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance of $1.32 to $1.42 and our expected parent free cash flow of $725 million to $775 million. At the same time, we have continued to grow our free cash flow. We ended the second quarter with the apparent free cash flow to debt ratio of 24%, which is comfortably above the 20% threshold required for investment grade ratings. As a reminder, we have already received one investment grade rating from Fitch and remain optimistic that we will attain our second investment grade rating later this year. Turning to our aggressive carbonization goals on slide four. As we have said before, we are very focused on reducing our generation from coal to less than 30% of total generation to comply with Norges Bank Environmental Investment criteria. On this front, we have made great progress over the past two months, signing binding agreements to sell OPGC in India and Itabo in the Dominican Republic. These sales will reduce our generation from coal by 11 percentage points to 34%. We are working on a couple of additional transactions that combined with our growth in renewables will allow us to easily comply with Norges Bank criteria by next year. To further our reduction in coal exposure, AES Gener is negotiating with several of off-takers in Chile to delink PPAs from physical assets and be able to monetize the value of long-term totaling agreements. These transactions will demonstrate that the real value of the business is in this contracts and customers, while providing funding for AES Gener successful Green Blend & Extend Renewables Growth Strategy. Turning to slide five and sustainable growth. I am happy to announce that since our last call, we have been awarded or signed 852 megawatts of new renewable PPAs. This brings our year-to-date total to 1.5 gigawatts, including 346 megawatts of energy storage. As a result, our backlog of new renewables projects increased to 6.2 gigawatts, about half of this backlog is in the U.S. and the majority is expected to come online between 2021 and 2024. Therefore, we remain on track to continue to add 2 gigawatts to 3 gigawatts of new renewables per year by capitalizing on our business platforms and our growing technological expertise. In addition, to our 6.2 gigawatt backlog, we have a pipeline of 15 gigawatts of renewable projects under active development in the U.S. This considerable pipeline positions us very well for an acceleration in U.S. renewables growth if the federal policies change following the November elections. Turning to slide seven. We are also consolidating our position in existing renewable platforms. To that end, we recently acquired additional shares of AES Tiet\u00ea, increasing our ownership from 24% to 43%. We will finance this acquisition mostly through non-recourse debt in Brazil and it is accretive from day one. We plan to upgrade AES Tiet\u00ea\u2019s listing to Novo Mercado under Bovespa, where companies trade at significant premiums due to best-in-class governance. This move is expected to further unlock the value of AES Tiet\u00ea for the benefit of all of its shareholders. We continue to actively pursue new technologies to support our growth in renewables and innovative products that meet the changing needs of our customers. As you can see on slide eight, Fluence, our joint venture with Siemens that sells energy storage technology to third parties, continues to be the global market leader in this sector. This leadership is based on our track record of deploying more than 2 gigawatts of energy storage, presence in 22 countries and offering more than 40 digital applications to our customers. This year Fluence\u2019s revenue is expected to reach $500 million, an increase of 400% in relation to last year. We believe that energy storage will play a major role in the global transition to a low carbon economy. As a result, we expect Fluence\u2019s revenue to grow at 40% compounded annually to reach $3 billion by the end of 2025. Turning to slide nine. We are already experiencing this acceleration of growth in demand for energy storage. In June Fluence launched its sixth-generation product, which includes a modular and factory-assembled cube design that is safer, more reliable and lower cost. Fluence\u2019s new cube already has orders for more than 800 megawatts to be delivered over the next three years. As you may know, Fluence is currently running a private placement for a minority partner in order to capitalize this high growth business. We are encouraged by the strong interest we are seeing from potential investors and we expect to have concrete details to share with you before the end of the year. Together, AES and Fluence continue to pioneer new applications for lithium-ion based energy storage technology. One example is a virtual reservoir for run-of-the-river hydropower projects, utilizing energy storage that charges when power prices are low and discharges during peak hours. As shown on slide 10, at the Alfalfal hydro complex in Chile, we just commissioned the world\u2019s first such virtual reservoir with 10 megawatts or 50-megawatt hours of energy storage. We can further expand this facility to 250 megawatts or 1,250-megawatt hours over the next couple of years. Today, about half of all our renewable projects have an energy storage component. Now moving on to slide 11. We continue to pursue new technologies that have the potential to provide us with a competitive advantage in our markets. To that end, we recently acquired a 25% stake in 5B, a prefabricated solar solution company in Australia. With 5B\u2019s patented technology, solar projects can be built in a third of the time and in half the space. We believe that being able to double solar energy output from a given area will become increasingly important as solar penetration increases especially near urban or congested areas. In addition to 5B\u2019s potential pipeline of more than 10 gigawatts of third-party projects in Australia, we see an additional addressable market of 5 gigawatts across our developing pipeline. As part of this strategic agreement, we have exclusive rights to develop utility scale projects using 5B\u2019s technology in our key markets, including the U.S. We have already started the deployment of 2 megawatts in Panama and 10 megawatts in Chile. We aim to be the most competitive solar developer by using 5B to reduce time-to-build and increase energy density, while combining it with our robotic and digital solar initiatives. Turning to slide 12. In 2018, AES invested in Uplight to improve our customer experiences by a digital cloud-based technology. In addition, Uplight provides cloud-based services to third parties to improve energy efficiency and balance system demand. This fast growing business already reaches more than 100 million households and businesses in the U.S., and expects a 20% increase in annual revenue in 2020. Finally, regarding our partnership with Google, it is progressing well, and as you might have seen, we recently launched an RFP for 1-gigawatt of carbon free energy in PJM. We are working on several other significant initiatives with Google and we will share additional details as this firm up. In summary, our ongoing leading technology efforts aim to give us a competitive edge to deliver the products and services required by our customers in a rapidly evolving and growing market. Now, I would like to turn over the call to Gustavo Pimenta, our CFO, so he can provide more color on our results, debt profile and guidance. Gustavo Pimenta : Thank you, Andr\u00e9s. Today, I will cover three key topics, our resilient business model, our performance during the second quarter and our capital allocation plan. Let me start with our resilient business model on slide 14. As you can see 85% of our earnings are from Utilities and long-term contracted generation, with an average contract life of 14 years. This provides significant stability to earnings and cash flow. We have also reduced our exposure to volatility in foreign currency by growing the portion of our U.S. dollar earnings. As you can see on side 15, today 85% of our earnings are in U.S. dollars, as compared to approximately 60% a few years ago. For context through 2022, a 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar would reduce our annualized EPS by only 1.5% or $0.02. Looking at Latin America specifically, almost all of our businesses in that region are contracted, as you can see on slide 16. Nearly 60% of these businesses have no volumetric risk as a result of the take or pay nature of the contracts. The remaining capacity is mostly contracted with large industrials and export-oriented mining companies that continued to operate despite COVID-19 as they are deemed essential. We intentionally work with high quality off takers and business strategy is also contributing to the resilience of our business model. For example, as you can see on the slide 17, roughly two-third of our customers in Latin America have investment grade profiles. The remaining customers are largely backed by government and institutions. The result of this resilient contracting structure and customer base can be seen in our collections performance on the slide 18, with Q2 receivables and days sales outstanding remains very much in line with historical levels. Moving on to the impact of global lockdowns on our financial results on slide 19. As you may recall, we had anticipated an extended U-shaped recovery in managed demand across our markets. This assumed the second quarter would be the hardest hit with a demand drop about 10% to 12% at our U.S. Utility businesses, and between 7% and 15% internationally. The actual result was not as severe as anticipated, with volume at our U.S. Utilities dropped mid-single digits and demand in other markets declining in the range of low-single digits to low-double digits. As I have noted, our Generation businesses, we did not experience any material impact on earnings from lower demand. Our Utility business, where most of our volume exposure is experienced any back of about $0.02 on adjusted EPS for the quarter, better than our initial expectation of $0.03 to $0.04. Despite this encouraging results, we continue to assume an extended U-shaped recovery for guidance purpose, given the overall uncertainty around the macro environment. Now turning to our quarterly results on slide 20. Adjusted EPS was $0.25 for the quarter versus $0.26 last year. This reflects the lower demand at our regulated utilities as discussed and the regulatory changes that were implemented at DPL in Argentina in 2019. We are able to offset these headwinds through higher contributions from our South America and Eurasia SBUs, as well as our cost savings and deleveraging initiatives. Turning to slide 21. Adjusted pre-tax contribution or PTC was relatively flat at $238 million for the quarter, with a decrease of only $2 million versus the second quarter of 2019. I will cover our results in more detail over the next four slides beginning on slide 22. In the U.S. and Utilities SBUs lower PTC reflects the lower regulated tariff implemented in Q4 2019 due to the reversion to AES Gener rate at the DPL, as well as lower demand at Utilities due to the impact of COVID-19. Additionally at Southland, we have had lower capacity of revenues as a result of the retirement of some of our legacy units in 2019. At our South America SBU higher PTC was primarily driven by higher contributions from AES Gener, including better operating performance at our Guacolda plant and recovery of previously expensed payments from customers in Chile. Higher PTC at our MCCS will reflect improved availability at our Changuinola hydro plant in Panama, following extended major outage last year. We also benefited from improved hydrology in Panama following a very dry year in 2019. This was partially offset by outage-related insurance proceeds in the Dominican Republic last year. Finally in Eurasia, high results reflect improved operational performance in Vietnam and the impact of the sale of our loss making business in the United Kingdom. Now to slide 26 to summarize our performance in the first half of the year, we earned adjusted EPS of $0.54 versus $0.53 last year. We are reaffirming our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.32 to $1.42. Relative to the first half of 2020, performance in the second half of the year will benefit from contributions for our new businesses, including the 1.3-gigawatt Southland Repowering project for which the 20-year contract began in the second quarter and about 1-gigawatt of renewables coming online. Now turning to our credit profile on slide 27. As we discussed on our first quarter call, since 2011 we reduced our parent debt by approximately $3 billion or about 50%. At the end of the second quarter, our parent leverage was 3.5 times and our parent free cash flow to debt ratio was 24%, comfortably within the investment grade thresholds of 4 times and 20%, respectively. This highlights once more our credit strength and give us confidence in attaining our second investment grade rating later this year. Moving on to liquidity on slide 28. We have $3.5 billion in available liquidity, two-thirds of which is in cash. As you may recall from our prior call, we had taken a conservative approach to enhance our liquidity at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak by drawing in about $500 million of our revolvers. As a result of the strong collection we experienced in the quarter, we decided to pay back most of this facility, lowering the overall interest expense for our businesses. Next, I would like to provide an update on our refinancing on slide 29. As you know, we have been proactively strengthening our debt maturity profile. Since last year, we executed more than $7 billion in liability management across our portfolio. In the second quarter alone, by taking advantage of a low interest rate environment, we refinanced more than $2 billion of debt, significantly reducing our interest costs, while eliminating any mature refinancing needs at both AES Corp. and DPL for the next five years. Now to 2020 parent capital allocation on slide 3. We expected $1.4 billion of discretionary cash this year, which is largely consistent with our previous disclosure. Regarding asset sales, we have already announced agreement to sell 2-gigawatt of coal generation, achieving roughly half of our target for 2020. We are working on a few other transactions and feel good about the prospect of achieving our targeted asset sales of $550 million for this year. Moving to uses on the right-hand side, including the 5% dividend increase we announced in December, we expected to return $381 million to shareholders this year. We plan to invest $700 million in our subsidiaries, 90% of which is in the U.S., demonstrating our proactive actions to grow the portion of earnings coming from the U.S. to about half by 2022. These investments includes, funding our renewables backlog, the equity for the Southland Repowering and the investment in rate-based growth at our utilities. Regarding AES Gener, as Andr\u00e9s mentioned, we are in negotiations to delink the PPAs from the coal assets and monetize the value of some of its storing agreement. As a result, we now expect the capital increase in our contribution of equity to happen in 2021. This leaves us with up to $370 million to be allocated in 2020. Next, moving to our capital allocation from 2020 through 2022 beginning on slide 31. We continue to expect our portfolio to generate $3.4 billion in discretionary cash. Three quarters of this is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow, with the remaining $900 million coming from asset sale proceeds. Turning to the uses of the discretionary cash on slide 32, roughly one-third will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Subject to annual review by the Board, we continue to expect to increase the dividend by 4% to 6% per year, in line with the industry average. We are also expected to use $1.9 billion to invest in our backlog, new projected PPAs, T&D investments at IPL, the partial funding of our Vietnam LNG project and the investment in AES Gener. This $1.9 billion also includes the $300 million infrastructure investment in the P&L. Once completed, this project will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond. In summary, we are very encouraged by our solid financial performance today, despite being in the middle of an unprecedented global crisis. Our performance and position validate the actions we have taken over the last several years to materially improve the quality and resilience of our business model and we remain very confident in our ability to continue delivering on our strategic and financial objectives. With that, I will turn the call back over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thank you, Gustavo. Before we take your questions, let me close today\u2019s call by saying that we remain very confident in achieving our guidance for 2020 and growth rates through 2022, attaining a second investment grade rating before year end and realizing our decarbonization goals to meet Norges Bank\u2019s threshold by the end of the year. At the same time, we continue to make progress on the point innovative technologies that we believe will give us a competitive edge in today\u2019s rapidly evolving and growing market. With that, I would like to open up the call to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for the time. I appreciate it and congratulations on continued execution here. Perhaps just going back to the 2020 guidance and I know you guys just commented here in your prepared remarks about a little bit of your positioning, but I\u2019d like to dig a little bit further into that. So you are saying that you are a few pennies ahead relative to initial expectations for the utility after last quarter\u2019s update. You are saying your power outlook is not appreciably impacted from lower demand. Just help frame where you are within that \u201820 guidance range as a consequence of these updated assumption. And then, thirdly, I didn\u2019t see you comment specifically on how the asset sales and our expected asset sales impact -- and the potential dilution from those impacts where you are within that range, if that make sense? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yeah. Okay. Let\u2019s put this into two objects, the first half and Gustavo can take the second half. Look, we feel confident that we are going to hit our numbers. We feel very good. We have a lot of good things happening. We are still, I think, all of us in uncharted territories. This has to play out through the second half of the year. I think our business model has demonstrated its resilience. I think very importantly both earnings and cash, our accounts receivable are very much in line from where they were last year. So we feel good about it and we have a lot of positive things, but there is some uncertainty. So we -- what we are saying is, we feel very confident we will hit these numbers and the model is resilient and let\u2019s see what plays out in the second half of the year. With that, I will pass it over to Gustavo to talk a little bit about asset sales. Gustavo Pimenta : So, Julien, yes. Those asset sales there were already incorporated in our long-term forecast. So the associated dilution is already in the 7% to 9%, so no impact to our forecast. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Nor the impact that in perspective further so\u2026 Gustavo Pimenta : No. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : That\u2019s already assumed... Gustavo Pimenta : The additional was to reach the $500 million are also in this plan the 7% to 9% growth. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yeah. In other words they are assumed in our forecast. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And if I can ask you just a step further here, I mean, you guys made a further commitment in Brazil in recent weeks. Can you talk to your thought process about realizing the full value there, I mean, as per this unique situation in backdrop where you all are, I suppose your peer shareholders just receiving a premium bid and you all are stepping into to basically, say, we see greater value. So can value -- can you elaborate on where you see that value coming and maybe further next steps in realizing that? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Sure. Look we have a, I think, a very good track record in Brazil of creating values in our separate company, if you think of the sale of Fluence, sale of Eletropaulo, of the sale of our telecom Angamos. So what we are doing here is, we -- BNDS [ph] wanted to sell part of its shares. So by buying BNDS\u2019 shares we go from 24% ownership to around 43% ownership. This will allow us to list AES Gener on the novel Mercado. In the novel Mercado generally companies trade at a 10%, 20% premium versus where they trade on ordinary listing, say in Brazil you have your preferred shares, which actually don\u2019t have a vote and receive a 10% dividend, then you have normal ordinary shares, which have votes. So our shares and BNDS\u2019 shares are ordinary shares. So what we see here is an upgrade of the company, in terms of its market listing, in terms of who can invest in the company and we are able to go to novel Mercado, because now we own a much larger percentage of the company. So with one share one vote we still control this company. I say furthermore you might have seen there the Tiet\u00ea is actually the good platform for growth. It has now almost 4 gigawatts or 100% renewable energy and we have been able to do some very innovative things there. So in terms of our big strategy it makes sense as well. So it makes sense from me money point of view, because we are buying it accretive. We are --it\u2019s accretive at these prices. Second, I would say that, it\u2019s a platform for growth and fits into our overall strategy of reducing our carbon intensity -- the carbon intensity of our footprint. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Sorry. Last quick clarification, what\u2019s the contribution from renewables in aggregate in 2020 and beyond just getting this question consistently. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Look, right now including again renewables for hydro, it\u2019s about a third of our fleet. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: On earnings terms? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Earnings. Gustavo Pimenta : It\u2019s the same. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yeah. I think it\u2019s pretty much in line. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: All right. I won\u2019t press further. Thank you very much. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Sure. Operator : Our next question is from Angie Storozynski from Seaport Global. Go ahead. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Hello, Angie. Gustavo Pimenta : Angie. Operator : Angie? Our next question is from Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Go ahead. Stephen Byrd : Hey. Good morning. I hope you all are doing well. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Hey, Steve. Stephen Byrd : Great update on a lot of fronts. Just on the storage side of things obviously the size of this business and the growth is impressive. Could you just speak maybe generally to the capital needs for this business, strategically how you think about the growth of this business within AES and just it\u2019s just an unusual business given the incredibly rapid growth rate. I am just curious sort of strategically how are you thinking about this business? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Well, we started 12 years ago. So we have a long history of energy storage and we have really been an innovator in applications. So we have decided to sell it to third-party via by Fluence and we are very happy with the partnership with Siemens, because it allows us to sell it in 160 countries. So what we are seeing saying is that there\u2019s a very rapidly growing market. So Fluence itself we see a lot of new applications, not only the virtual reservoir, but I can see grid booster, which really reduces significant long-distance transmission expenses or investment. So that I think is the next front. So, I think, this is an area that\u2019s going to grow very quickly. So how does it fit into, yeah, well, first and of course, we are happy with the investments we have made in Fluence. I think time will show that that was a very good investment. But it\u2019s also good for us in the sense we are one of the big customers of Fluence. So today half of our product offerings have an energy storage component. So we have standalone storage, but we also have it integrated into solar as our award winning project out in Kovai. But we also have it in corporate, for example, wind. So when we talk about Green Blend & Extend and meeting customers\u2019 future needs, if customers want a 24x7, for example, renewables, energy storage plays a big component. Now I am a believer in lithium ion batteries for -- our batteries, let\u2019s say, electrical batteries because they don\u2019t have to be lithium ion for the next five years to 10 years for many of the applications. And the reason is that it\u2019s very -- as the batteries become more efficient, it become cheaper, you are basically going from electric to an elect -- in some cases a chemical back to electric and the losses are very low. There\u2019s been a lot of talk about hydrogen, for example. Hydrogen has advantages and it has much greater energy density. So we see much -- many more applications in transportation where the weight of batteries precludes long distance, say, big truck using batteries. So I think this is a very interesting area. But if you are talking about sort of combining renewables with storage or day-to-day applications, we really think that battery seems to be the killer app. Now we have put a toe in the water into hydrogen as well. We have actually run some tests on old coal plants in Chile, basically cracking the hydrogen using renewable energy in around $35 a megawatt hour and it still comes out quite expensive. We do see it could be -- we have also run some tests on diesel and it might be interesting for micro-grids. So, we do have a electrolyzer in Chile where we -- actually in Argentina, excuse me, where we actually produce hydrogen for our own needs at the San Nicolas plant. So we have a foot into this. We are looking into this. But I just mention this, because there\u2019s some people say, well, hydrogen will replace battery-based energy storage. And the reason we don\u2019t see that is, at least in the short-term, is because you are going from electric to produce a chemical -- a chemical reaction then you have to store it cryogenically then you have to transport it, then you basically have to burn it again. So if you look at the energy from the original electricity losses to electricity again, you are talking about at least half, whereas with the battery you are talking about a much smaller percentage. Now of course, batteries don\u2019t work for inter-seasonal differences. So, we are looking into it and we have some small experiments in some of our different units. And as I said, the one that looks more promising really are diesel units and we are certainly a believer of green hydrogen for transportation. Stephen Byrd : That\u2019s a great description of market potential of storage versus hydrogen. Thank you. And I wanted to shift over maybe just to your corporate relationships. Maybe we could just briefly touch on Google to make sure we just talk through the sort of the commercial relationship. I guess, there\u2019s sort of an element of near-term fees plus longer term margin potential. But then also just thinking more broadly and maybe more importantly just about the potential for other such corporate relationships given AES\u2019 global footprint and ability to help customers globally to decarbonize, if you could just talk to that opportunity broadly as well, please? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yeah. Thank you for that question. I mean, we are investing very heavily into the U.S., as Gustavo says about 90% of what we are investing but we do have this wonderful global footprint. So if a client has global needs, we can satisfy those. So when you talk about the relationship with Google, we are -- we do our supply them with renewable energy in Chile and we did have the RFP. We have the RFP out for 1 gigawatt of zero carbon energy in PJM. We are also, as I mentioned in my speech, looking at other possibilities with them. I really can\u2019t comment on them -- about them at this time. But it goes beyond just a single sort of RSP or a single PPA in one country, because we are doing I think a lot of innovative things like they are and so we have commonality of interests in some areas. But just like Google, I mean, of course, there are other companies that are also interested in our global footprint and having a, let\u2019s say, common high-tech approach to reducing carbon emissions among multiple countries and we can certainly supply that. Stephen Byrd : That\u2019s great. Thank you so much. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Charles Fishman from Morningstar. Go ahead. Charles Fishman : If I could firstly ask a housekeeping question on slide 18, while I guess, it\u2019s a little more a housekeeping. But your receivable balance is going lower. Now, first of all, I assume that\u2019s apples-to-apples, in other words you adjusted that from any businesses you divested between Q4 and Q2? Gustavo Pimenta : That\u2019s correct Charles. This is Gustavo. That\u2019s correct. Charles Fishman : Okay. I assume that, but just wanted to ask it now. And then, I guess, more of a big picture question, why do -- is there any particular reason you see your receivable balance going actually lower which is certainly great considering the environment, where among your -- there was nobody really appeared you guys, but other utilities, let\u2019s say, which I realize are different businesses, most of them have T-Mobile balances going in the other direction. Anything that you are doing differently or I -- you probably have more contracted type generation I realize that, but is there anything else going on? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yeah. No. I think you hit the nail on the head. It\u2019s -- 85% of our business is contracted generation and we have creditworthy off-takers. So there are situations, for example, where say a currency depreciates, but the -- what they are exporting is actually then more attractive because they have a portion of their cost whether it be mining or other such things that they are exporting. So in general, our clients are doing well, much better than the markets than they are in. So I think that\u2019s very important. But we are 85% contracted generation and that\u2019s the big difference. So if you actually see why we got it down initially and we correctly forecast it that we would have a drop in demand with the quarantines at our utilities, at our distribution businesses. So that\u2019s what\u2019s going on. But other than that our plans are critical. So in those cases where we are selling to the creator or selling to which is in many cases backed by the government, we are make sure that we get paid, because we are absolutely critical to the grid or the low cost generator in that market. So we are very well-positioned in this crisis. So we don\u2019t expect that to change certainly in the generation business given, say, the current outlook. Charles Fishman : Okay. And then, Andr\u00e9s, if I can ask you one strategic question with respect to Fluence. Why a minority partner at this point? What is the thinking behind that? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yeah. That\u2019s a great question. Because this is a rapidly growing business and we think it has a great future and it\u2019s coming up with new products. Part of it is that, both of us, Siemens and AES we would like to have a marker from a transaction. We are not going to sell down a very large stake we are talking around a 10% stake. So we think it would be just good to have to capitalize it, maybe 10% with an outside partner, and obviously, work towards a bigger sell down perhaps in two years, three years of an IPO, but ---- and then we will have to reassess strategically how we feel about this business. But we feel very good about that business. And as I said, I think that this is a market, which is growing very rapidly. Now something that people haven\u2019t talked about, I think, so much is, if you do have a change in federal policies in the U.S. to promote green or carbon free generation, we are very well-positioned, Fluence is very well-positioned. But specifically, AES, because we have a pipeline of 15 gigawatts of potential projects in the U.S. and those run the range from quite advanced to medium advanced. If we looked at just hypothetical projects it\u2019s a much bigger number. So we feel good that we have a pipeline that we could execute on and potentially double our rate of growth of renewable build in the U.S. should there be such a change. Charles Fishman : Okay. And the partner then very well could be financial rather than just somebody like yourself that\u2019s also selling the Fluence product? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : No. No. Charles Fishman : Correct? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yeah. No. No. Absolutely. Absolutely. Charles Fishman : Okay. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : So a lot of people are looking at just financials. We are looking at a good investment with an eye towards a potential IPO two years to three years from now? Charles Fishman : Got it. Okay. That\u2019s all I have. Thank you. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thank you, Charles. Operator : Our next question is from Angie Storozynski from Seaport Global. Go ahead. Angie Storozynski : Thank you. So sorry I missed my first presenter [ph]. So I have a number of questions. So first on Fluence, I mean, incredible results by the way. But on Fluence, so the attempts to monetize the business, which I don\u2019t think that you are being paid in the current stock price for Fluence among others. So is there any EPS contribution for Fluence in 2020 or even in 2022? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : No. No. I mean, this year it will -- it should be probably about 1 -- $0.01\u2026 Angie Storozynski : Okay. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : And the reason for that is even though it\u2019s like margin positive and we haven\u2019t been putting more money in as that is very rapid growth is because R&D you have to spend. So, for example, all the design work\u2026 Angie Storozynski : Yeah. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : \u2026 the production work of the next-generation of the sixth-generation, well, that is expense. So we have talked probably, I\u2019d say, around two years for it to turn positive in terms of EPF and what basically happens is the fastest growth, the more new profit you have to come out with, you delay that turning to positive. So it\u2019s a business. It could be positive if that was the objective but the objective is to create value. So we think of sales down, as you say, will give us a marker. So people say, well, how much does it worth, well, somebody just paid extra, like we did\u2026 Angie Storozynski : Yeah. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : \u2026 for example with the gas business in the Dominican Republic, people weren\u2019t giving us much value and we were able to show what it was worth to the third parties. Angie Storozynski : And the second question, so it\u2019s a two part question. So one, is there\u2019s like a rule of thumb that I can, say, for example, to 2021 you will have additional 2,000 megawatts of renewables in operation and granted it\u2019s probably going to be scattered throughout the year. But can I say for instance that 100 megawatts adds X in EPS? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Well, it will depend a little bit, because it depends what you are inaugurating, right, and where. So there\u2019s a difference between solar and wind, and there\u2019s a difference outside of the U.S. because of tax. So it\u2019s, there\u2019s no rule of thumb for just like 100 megawatts. I don\u2019t know Gustavo can comment. Gustavo Pimenta : No. What I will do is, we are putting on average $300 million, $350 million per year, right? So that\u2019s our \u2026 Angie Storozynski : Okay. Gustavo Pimenta : \u2026 equity in the project, we have been partners so and so. If you assume, call it, 12% return on average, you are going to come up with the EPS accretion that those deals are bringing to us. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yeah. Angie Storozynski : Awesome. Awesome. And now a bigger picture question, so I have been actually looking at it. So, as you become investment grade, I know you are already investment grade, by such, but you get those additional investment grade ratings, would you ever consider not a project finance but corporate level debt to fund the growth, I understand that there is the issue of finite life of the contract for the renewables, but I think that there is this growing conviction even among investors that the useful life of these assets is going to be longer than the duration of the original contract and under project financing you are in a sense the debt amortization, most the cash flows of the project and so the real equity attrition is only at the end of this contract. So in a sense you could help you help quite meaningfully from a cash flow perspective if you were started to rely on corporate level debt -- on corporate debt? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yeah. Let me soft of answer philosophically and then I will pass it to Gustavo. Look, philosophically we like doing project level debt, because it\u2019s an acid test. So since I have been CEO almost all of our major projects, I think, with the exception of Southland, we brought in a partner. And the reason was that bankers have first debt on the cash flow. So you have to convince somebody a third-party that you are going to operate this and that they think it\u2019s a good project as well. So given that philosophically we like using project level debt and so I don\u2019t see that changing for the time, there are advantages of certain roll ups. We can aggregate at the sublevel. Gener has debt, for example, Tiet\u00ea has debt, which would get some of those advantages. But we think that the discipline of having to project finance is good and having to bring in partners is good. So\u2026 Gustavo Pimenta : I think, Andr\u00e9s you covered well. I mean, it brings more discipline to the process. It also allows us to amortize the debt within the PPA timeframe, which we like. We don\u2019t want to count on post-PPA period to pay for debt quite frankly. So it\u2019s just more disciplined. I think the projects are more sustainable when we validate them at the project level, right, with the debt there and all the amortization within the PPA flow. Angie Storozynski : And just one follow-up if I can on Fluence, so we saw the results of the investigation by APS on the root cause of the storage system accident, and we also saw some response from LG and APS seems to suggest that their need to some changes in the configuration of those storage systems going forward. I haven\u2019t necessarily seen the response on Fluence. But is there any fundamental change and how you think those storage designs need to be adjusted and if there is any need to make adjustments to your already existing operating systems? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yeah. I think, look, that was a unit that was inaugurated in 2017. We are two generations away from that. The issue as we see it was with a series of LG Chem batteries, a specific series that we are produced in some factories. So we have operated for 12 years. This is the first, I will say, serious incident we have had. But really the best standards are, for example, UL 9045A and if you look at the best-in-class standards, the sixth-generation incorporates all these. So if you look at, for example, it doesn\u2019t require -- it\u2019s not contained, so it\u2019s actually outside. The modules are separated, so you don\u2019t have contagion. It has enhanced fire suppression systems on it. And in the worst case, should there be any type of thermal event since it\u2019s not enclosed the heat and the any gases would rise. So, definitely we feel that, we have taken all the lessons learned from this event. We have incorporated into the new design and really safety was one of our number one priority. So, again, we have 12 years of operating these and we -- this is the one really event that we have had. Now regarding those cases which weren\u2019t that many, I think, you can count on them one hand that all those units that had that series of battery in them. We immediately put out instructions of not to charge them like -- instructions you get on your Tesla car, not to charge them above 75% and we have taken corrective actions and we have given more information, more training for like local fire units, et cetera. So, yeah, we -- as you know, safety is number one value, super important for us. We have been very serious and very diligent, I think, about looking into this and supporting our clients and supporting our local fire departments on this. But I feel very good that the sixth-generation cube is the safest unit out there and incorporates all of the suggestions that are out there technically. Angie Storozynski : Perfect. Thank you very much. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thank you, Angie. Operator : Our next question is from Richard Sunderland from JP Morgan. Go ahead. Richard Sunderland : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions here. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Good morning, Richard. Richard Sunderland : Just starting off, with the opportunity around delinking PPAs, could you provide a little bit more color around that opportunity versus your current financing plan and you may be assumed asset sales as well. Is there an inter-player offset potentially with this new consideration or is it more of another tool in the tool bag down the road? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : We have always said that and there had a lot of tools to address its financing needs, because it\u2019s growing so fast, they have been so successful on Green Blend & Extend. We really can\u2019t comment on some of these transactions until they close. But there are several transactions where we are delinking the PPA, which in some cases was specific to a given asset. So like this power plant has this PPA, we are delinking them and allowing us greater flexibility in terms of how we satisfy their demand or requirements of the customers. So I really can\u2019t give you too much color on it other than saying that it will help us, it will help Gener with its financing plan. And so it\u2019s very likely that any capital contribution from us will be in 2021 instead of 2020 this year. So we tend to be very conservative, so we saw that these have been advancing. So prior to having these as advanced as they are today, we had talked about AES putting in the money this year. So that I think is the main change. So I\u2019d say stay tuned and we can give you more color as these transactions close. Richard Sunderland : Great. We will look forward to that. And then just a quick clean up question, the inclusion this quarter I believe it was recovery of expense payments from customers in Chile. Just -- was this in your plan specifically in the 2020 plan included in guidance? Gustavo Pimenta : Yeah. I mean this is at the AES Crop level, I mean this is above couple cents in this quarter when you normalized partnership adjustment and so on. It was included -- this is a good guy meaning cash and earnings from prior expenses, pass-through cost that we have with some particular clients and we are able to firm up those receivables back. Richard Sunderland : Yeah. But this was baked into the original guidance? Gustavo Pimenta : Yes. Richard Sunderland : Okay. Thank you very much. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thank you, Richard. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Ahmed Pasha for closing remarks. Ahmed Pasha : Thank you. Thanks everybody for joining us on today\u2019s call. As always, the IR will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Thanks. Thanks again and have a nice day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Ahmed Pasha, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ahmed Pasha : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2020 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements, which are discussed in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website along with the presentation. Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Gustavo Pimenta, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will turn the call over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter financial review call. Today, I will cover both our near-term priorities and the progress we have made on our larger strategic goals. On our last call, I outlined three top priorities : first, achieving our 2020 guidance; second, attaining a second investment-grade rating; and third, decarbonizing our portfolio. We see all three of these goals, both individually and collectively, as catalysts for attracting a wider investor base. Perhaps more importantly, we see all three as clear demonstrations of our ability to thrive in today's evolving landscape. Today, I am pleased to report that we're making great progress on all of these objectives and have several exciting developments to discuss. First, as Gustavo will review in his remarks, our portfolio continues to prove its resiliency in the face of COVID-19, and we're on-track to achieve our full year guidance. In fact, we expect to be at the top end of the ranges for both adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow. Turning to our goal of attaining a second investment-grade rating. I'm proud to say that we were upgraded by S&P earlier this week. This reflects the low level of risk inherent in our current business model. Two investment-grade ratings will help us reduce our overall cost of capital and enable us to attract a broader investor base. Following this milestone, we remain committed to further strengthening our balance sheet and increasing the percentage of our business in the U.S.  Now to our third priority of aggressive decarbonization on Slide 4. As you may recall, we set a near-term target to reduce our coal generation to below 30% of total generation by the end of this year, and to below 10% by 2030. I'm happy to report that with today's announced retirement of an additional 1.2 gigawatts, we have reduced our coal generation to 29% on a pro forma basis. 3/4 of these retirements are in the U.S. and the remainder are in Chile. Importantly, these retirements were already anticipated in our guidance, and we will achieve our decarbonization targets while delivering on our financial commitments. We see the transformation of our portfolio as an ongoing process, and we expect to announce additional coal retirements and asset sales in the near term. However, this milestone is significant and that it puts us in compliance with the environmental criteria of several large investors, including Norges Bank. In the longer term, we expect to produce net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Moving to our long-term strategy and the progress we've made to date. As we have discussed previously, our strategy revolves around three core themes : one, investing in sustainable growth; two, offering innovative solutions; and three, delivering superior results. Turning to Slide 5. We are well positioned to meet our strategic and financial objectives. So far this year, we have signed PPAs for 2.1 gigawatts of wind, solar and energy storage projects, which is the most we have signed in the first three quarters of any given year. On to Slide 6. We now have a backlog of 6.8 gigawatts, which is also the largest in our history. Approximately 1/3 is under construction, with the majority expected to come online through 2022. Almost half of this backlog is in the U.S., which we expect to grow as a proportion of our business going forward. Our backlog includes a mix of solar, wind, energy storage and our Alto Maipo hydro project in Chile. We continue to make good progress at Alto Maipo, where construction is more than 96% complete.  As you can see on Slide 7, renewables are now nearly 40% of our installed capacity. And this proportion will grow materially as we complete the 6.8 gigawatts in our 100% renewable backlog and sell and retire additional coal plants. In addition to our renewables backlog, we see significant growth opportunities at our 2 U.S. utilities. DP&L and IP&L. We are pleased with the recent developments at IP&L, where we reached a constructive settlement on various pending regulatory proceedings. Gustavo will provide additional details shortly, but this settlement is truly a milestone for DP&L and it grows its rate base and its network. Turning to Slide 8. I have previously discussed that our Green Blend and Extend, strategy, where we work with existing customers to convert the power sold from thermal to renewable generation while extending the contract life. This approach allows all parties to meet their financial and environmental objectives. Since our last call, we signed an additional 410 megawatts of solar capacity under a 17-year contract in Chile, bringing our total Green Blend and Extend, execution to more than 2 gigawatts. As a demonstration of the strength of our existing coal contracts, in August AES had handed reached an agreement with BHP for early termination, resulting in a payment of $720 million, which we will use in part to fund our renewables growth in Chile. While we only report on our projects with signed PPAS, as you can see on Slide 9, we have a robust development pipeline, which we believe is one of our key differentiators. We currently have a development pipeline of 25 gigawatts in key markets, of which 12 gigawatts are in the U.S. Over the past couple of months, we have been solidifying our pipeline by securing land and interconnection rights. We already have very capable solar and energy storage development teams, and we recently acquired a group of experienced wind developers. Expected renewables growth in the U.S. is currently 20 gigawatts per year. However, this rate could accelerate. We are very well positioned to take advantage of any increase in the rate of growth in demand for renewables. Furthermore, we also could benefit from an extension of ITC and PTC incentives for renewables as well as the potential for new incentives for stand-alone storage. Turning to Slide 10 and our LNG strategy. We see the expansion of our LNG infrastructure business as complementary to our renewables growth by offering a clean, predictable and low-cost fuel that provides capacity and flexibility to the system. We are focusing our LNG business in 3 markets : the Caribbean, Central America and Southeast Asia. In all of these markets, there is rapidly growing demand for natural gas to supply new generation and to displace coal and higher-cost fuel oils. As you may know, we're developing an efficient 2.2 gigawatt combined cycle gas facility and a 450 tera BTU LNG terminal in Vietnam. We have hit key milestones towards closing these projects, which will help meet Vietnam's rapidly growing electricity demand. Last week, we signed a term sheet for the LNG terminal in partnership with PV Gas, the state-owned gas utility. In parallel, we have seen strong interest from potential lenders to finance the majority of the capital costs.  In Central America and the Caribbean, we continue to lead the transition to cleaner natural gas. We currently have a total of 150 tera BTus of LNG storage capacity, and an additional 50 tera BTUs is under construction in the Dominican Republic. We now have contracted 60% of this storage capacity, and we're in advanced discussions for an additional 20%. This would bring our total contracted volume to 80% in 2023 and beyond. For context, 200 tera BTU LNG volume can serve approximately 3 gigawatts of natural gas generation. Moving on Slide 11. The second component of our strategy is offering innovative solutions. We see the energy needs of our clients, like Google, evolving to achieve the highest standards in clean energy. We are leading the transition through our unique integration of renewables with our scalable platforms of Fluence, 5B and Uplight. Our technological innovation gives us a key competitive advantage. An example is energy storage, where we have access to the latest technology in the sector and combine it with our unique industry insights to create transformative clean energy solutions. As a reminder, working closely with our customer, Kiuc in Hawaii, we were the first company to develop a true 24/7 solar and energy storage project, and we continue to advance new applications. In fact, we recently inaugurated the world's first virtual reservoir in Chile, which combines run of the river hydro with battery-based energy storage, allowing us to sell our energy when prices are highest. Turning to Slide 12. Fluence, our joint venture with Siemens that sells energy storage technology to third parties, continues to maintain its position as the market leader in the sector. This year, Fluence has been awarded 690 megawatts of contracts, increasing their awarded or delivered capacity to 2.4 gigawatts. Fluence's revenue is expected to reach $500 million this year, an increase of 400% compared to last year. While rapidly growing their backlog, Fluence continues to enhance their digital capabilities and to complement their suite of solutions. To that end, Fluence acquired AMS, the leading provider of AI-enabled bidding software for storage and generation assets. Through the AMS acquisition, Fluence now has ongoing contracts for digital bidding services for more than 2.4 gigawatts, and most of it additional to Fluence's fleet. The integration of this technology to Fluence's current offerings will help optimize the use of energy storage and to ensure the greatest value for their clients.  We're also looking to additional new products and innovation that could transform the sector, as shown on Slide 13. With our recent investment in 5B, a prefabricated solar solution company, solar projects can be built in 1/3 of the time and on half as much land. We believe that being able to double solar energy output from a given area will become a great differentiator as solar penetration increases, especially near urban and congested areas. In addition to 5B's potential pipeline of more than 10 gigawatts of third-party projects in Australia, we see an addressable market of 5 gigawatts across our own development pipeline. We aim to be the most competitive solar operator and developer by using 5B to reduce time to build and increase energy density in combination with our ongoing robotic and digital initiatives. One example of how we are integrating all of these technologies to improve customer outcomes is the Andes IIb project in Chile. This project consists of 180 megawatts of solar incorporates 10 megawatts of 5B's technology and includes 560 megawatt hours of energy storage, the largest in Latin America. Another example of our leading innovations is our Uplight platform, which is helping utilities improve energy efficiency and balance system demand. Both of these capabilities are increasingly relevant to Uplight's 100 million end users and 80 utility customers in the U.S. Finally, as I previously discussed, we continue to be on the forefront of new technologies. To that end, we have been running tests on hydrogen at several thermal plants in Latin America. We consider ourselves to be well positioned to be a leader to incorporate green hydrogen if and when it becomes economic sometime in the future. Turning now to the third component of our strategy, which Gustavo will spend more time on : delivering superior results. By investing in our development pipeline, we are earning attractive risk-adjusted returns. As you can see on Slide 14, in the U.S we're earning low double-digit returns, while internationally we're earning mid- to high-teen returns. Before concluding, I would like to note that last week, we launched a new brand with a new logo, as you can see on our slides. We have transformed AES into a leader in clean energy, and our new brand symbolizes our position at the forefront of the technological and commercial changes that are redefining our industry. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Gustavo Pimenta, our CFO, so he can provide more color on our results, debt profile and guidance. Gustavo Pimenta : Thank you, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover 3 key topics : our resilient business model, our performance during the third quarter, and our capital allocation plan.  Let me start with our resilient business model. Over the last decade, we have proactively transformed our portfolio. And now 85% of our earnings are from utilities and long-term contracted generation with an average contract life of 14 years, supported by creditworthy offtakers. At the same time, more than 80% of our earnings are now in dollars. This provides significant stability to earnings and cash flow. Turning to Slide 16. You can see how our portfolio has performed during these challenging times. As you know, a majority of our customers are large industrials and export-oriented mining companies that continue to operate despite COVID-19 as they are deemed essential. As a result, Q3 receivables and days sales outstanding remained stable and very much in line with historical levels. Moving on to Slide 17. The impact of the global lockdown on our financial results has been mostly limited to our utilities. Our generation businesses have been largely unaffected due to the take-or-pay nature of contracts and customers being deemed essential. As you may recall, in our first quarter call we had anticipated an extended U-shaped recovery in energy demand across our markets. Since then, demand performance has been better than our expectation. For Q3, our initial projection was for a demand drop of about 5% to 7% at our U.S. utilities. While the actual result was significantly less severe than anticipated, on a weather-normalized basis, the net combined volume at DPL and IPL is mostly flat. Demand at DPL was up 3% and largely driven by the higher load from residential customers, while demand at IPL was down 3% as the load from commercial and industrial customers has yet to reach pre-COVID levels. Accordingly, the total net impact of the lower demand on our utilities was only $0.01 on adjusted EPS for the quarter, better than our initial expectation of $0.02 to $0.03. Now turning to our quarterly results on Slide 18. Adjusted EPS was $0.42 for the quarter versus $0.48 last year. Our quarterly results reflect an $0.11 impact most related to last year's insurance recovery and outage that occurred this quarter at one of our facilities in Dominican Republic, which is already back in operations. Results also reflect the regulatory changes that were implemented at DP&L and in Argentina in Q4 2019. These headwinds were partially offset by higher contributions from the Southland repowering project, our Eurasia SBU, our cost savings and deleveraging initiatives as well as a lower tax rate.  Turning to Slide 19; adjusted pretax contribution or PTC was $331 million for the quarter, a decrease of $95 million versus the third quarter of 2019. I'll cover our results in more detail over the next 4 slides beginning on Slide 20. In the U.S. and utilities SBU, PTC remained relatively flat. The benefit from the commencement of PPAs at Southland Energy CCGTs was mostly offset by the reversion to ESP 1 rates at DPL in 2019 as well as lower demand at our utilities due to the impact of COVID-19. Before moving on, I would like to take a moment to update you on recent regulatory developments at DP&L on Slide 21. I'm very pleased to announce that we have reached a successful settlement with PUCO staff and key intervenors, resolving 4 open proceedings, significantly reducing regulatory uncertainty and allowing us to move forward with our smart grid investments. More specifically as a result of this settlement, DP&L committed to file a new ESP by October 1, 2023, and will continue to recover its approximately $80 million annual rate stabilization charge until the new ESP becomes effective. DP&L will make smart grid investments of $249 million over the next 4 years, to earn a return through the investment infrastructure rider. Resolution was reached on the 2 pending retroactive SEET tests related to 2018 and 2019. And DP&L passed the SEET and MFA regulatory tests filed earlier this year. Now turning back to our third quarter results on Slide 22. At our South America SBU, lower PTC was primarily driven by dry hydrology at the Chivor hydro plant in Colombia, resulting in lower generation and high energy purchases. Lower PTC at our MCAC [ph] SBU primarily reflects the outage-related impacts I discussed previously as well as the arbitration settlement at Changuinola this year. Finally, in the region, higher results reflect lower maintenance and outages as well as lower interest expense due to debt repayment in 2020. It also includes a favorable variance in India given the OPGC COD delay last year. Now to Slide 25. To summarize our performance in the first 3 quarters of the year, we earned adjusted EPS of $0.96 versus $1.02 last year. We are reaffirming our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.32 to $1.42. In fact, based on our strong year-to-date performance and outlook for the remainder of the year, we are now expecting to be at the top end of this range. Now turning to our credit profile on Slide 26. As we have discussed on our prior calls, since 2011 we reduced our parent debt by approximately $3 billion or about 50%. As Andr\u00e9s mentioned, we recently received our second investment-grade rating. We are very pleased that S&P has recognized the underlying quality and strength of our portfolio. As you can see on this slide, we have improved our ratings by 2 to 3 notches over the last 4 years. Strong credit metrics remain one of our top priorities, and we'll continue to take steps to maintain and further improve upon current levels. Now to 2020 parent capital allocation on Slide 27. We expect to have $1.5 billion of discretionary cash this year, which is roughly $100 million higher than our prior disclosure. Regarding asset sales, today we are very pleased to announce a sell-down of 35% of our interest in the Southland repowering projects for $424 million to Yulico, expanding from our successful partnership at SPower. This transaction demonstrates the substantial intrinsic value of our portfolio and how we benefit from our platform and long-term contracted assets. As you may recall, Southland has a 20-year contract and was commissioned early this year. This sell-down implies a total equity value of more than $1.2 billion. With this transaction, combined with our previously announced asset sales, we have exceeded our proceeds target for the year by approximately $100 million for a total of $650 million. Further, based on our year-to-date performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we now also expect parent free cash flow to come in at the top end of our range of $725 million to $775 million. Moving to the right-hand side, uses are largely unchanged from the last quarter, except the investments in our subsidiaries, which are roughly $200 million higher. The increase primarily reflects a temporary cash injection at Southland and higher investments in renewables. Approximately 90% of the $900 million of investments in subsidiaries are in the U.S., contributing to our goal of increasing the proportion of earnings from the U.S. to about half. Next, moving to our capital allocation from 2020 through 2022 beginning on Slide 28. We continue to expect our portfolio to generate $3.4 billion in discretionary cash. 3/4 of this is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow, with the remaining $900 million come from asset sale proceeds. Turning to the uses of this discretionary cash on Slide 29. Roughly 1/3 will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Subject to any review by the Board, we continue to expect it to increase the dividend by 4% to 6% per year, in line with the industry average. We also expected to use $1.9 billion to invest in our backlog, new projected PPAs, T&D investments at IPL, the partial funding of our Vietnam LNG project, and the investment in Gener. Once completed, these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thank you, Gustavo. Before we take your questions, let me summarize today's call. We have made great progress on our key objectives. Specifically, we secured a second investment-grade rating. We reduced our generation from coal to below 30%. We signed 2.1 gigawatts of new renewable contracts, increasing our backlog to a record 6.8 gigawatts. And we are growing our development pipeline and deploying new technologies, such as Fluence, 5B and Uplight. Finally, with our year-to-date financial performance, we now expect to be at the top end of our guidance ranges for both adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow. With that, I would like to open the call to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Richard Sunderland of JPMorgan. Richard Sunderland : Maybe starting -- just starting off with the Fluence process, could you update us on the latest timing and expectations around the sale of the minority interest? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Sure. The capital raise at Fluence is going very well. We have strong interest, and we expect to get it done by the end of this year. Richard Sunderland : So namely kind of no impacts from the elections or considerations around there specifically to the sale? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Not really. I mean this capital raise, people are looking at the long term. And certainly, lithium ion-based energy storage has a great future ahead of it. As the -- as I said in my remarks, it's growing very rapidly and it's the leader in the sector. So it really is a unique investment opportunity. So no, we've seen no impact whatsoever. Richard Sunderland : And has there been any shift in the kind of interest or type of parties evaluating Fluence? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : None whatsoever. Richard Sunderland : Got it. Great. And then just quick on the outage cited on the quarter. I know you said one of the facilities back in operations. Any color around the outage itself and I guess risks going forward? Gustavo Pimenta : No, it was -- this is Gustavo, Rich. No, it was an outage that we had in there in one of our facilities there. It's about $0.02 impact in the quarter, but the facility is back in operation already. Operator : Next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith, Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Congratulations on a -- a litany of developments here, it's hard to know where to start. At the outset here, how about this? So you've had a lot of success across your businesses here. When you think about the earnings trajectory of the renewables business altogether, how would you characterize that, right? Given the backlog, given the success year-to-date, given the capital available to deploy back into it, how in aggregate would you kind of describe its attribution or contribution to the EPS growth rate? And then relate it to Fluence as well, if you can. I know it's still small. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Okay. Let me start sort of big picture. Most of our business, most of our earnings is coming from the traditional businesses. So this is sort of an add-on, and we're retiring some of the thermal assets. So it's a transition. So it's going to be growing over time. We feel very good about the way it's sort of blending in. Something like Green Blend and Extend it's blending in to this growth. So we have a backlog of 7 gigawatts. It's a good mix of U.S. and outside, and it has good returns. And there's a variety of regulatory schemes under which they operate. So we feel good about it. It's going to be growing, and it's going to -- it's replacing some of the older thermal assets that we're retiring. Second part of your question regarding Fluence, well realize that as I've said in the past, the faster Fluence grows, to some extent it pushes off a little bit positive earnings. We're creating an enormous amount of value. But all R&D for example or all upgrading of our teams around the world, that's expensed. So when you're growing 400% this year, we expect a 40-plus growth rate going forward. We have a backlog of 1 gigawatt; so that's still up. So there's no -- right now, Fluence is a drag of around $0.02. So it will -- everything has a positive margin. We expect this to turn around, but it's a little bit of a function of how fast we grow. So ironically the more value we create and the faster we grow, that may take a little bit more time. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Now, if I can pivot this slightly more specifically to your guidance, when you think about this roll forward coming up with fourth quarter, and I know I'm kind of asking for guidance without getting it explicitly, how are you thinking about some of the major puts and to pick here? Because as best I see it, it seems like you resolved a number of these issues. And so I just want to make sure we're on the same page about this, whether it's DPL, whether it's related to Gener, or frankly whether it relates to your execution on backlog on renewables. But can you give us at least a sense for some of the bigger puts and takes here and/or other factors that you've mentioned? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes, you've mentioned most of the factors. I mean we have rapid renewable growth, Green Blend and Extend,. We have DP&L, IPL, growing their rate base. I think the one that you did not mention was the growth of LNG. So you realize that we are doing very well on contracting more really tolling of gas in the Dominican Republic. We're very -- actually we have the contracts there. We're very optimistic about doing more in Panama. And as I said in my speech, those will all contribute to our earnings at 23 and beyond. So most of the investment is made. So having said that, that's how we see it. So we feel optimistic. And that's why we've included the retirement of -- or part of that guidance. So we can't give you guidance before the fourth call. Gustavo, do you want to add something? Gustavo Pimenta : Yes. I would just add, Julien, in addition to what Andr\u00e9s just said, I think California, the extension of the legacy unit is another important driver, right? So -- And also the incremental cost cutting. Remember, we had talked about $100 million of cost-cutting through 2022, half of that through 2021. So those will be helpful, and eventually we'll be able to capture more post that period. And I think to your question on renewables, probably the best way to think about it is most of our free cash is going to renewables nowadays. So it's about $350 million to $400 million of investment in new renewables going forward. And you put low double-digit to mid-teen returns, and you see that this is going to be an important driver of earnings going forward. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And just -- sorry to clarify this. When you were speaking on LNG, can you elaborate briefly on Panama on the IMO piece of this in terms of bunkering and the upside potential? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Well, basically our current facility, especially the storage tank in Panama, is about 30% utilized. All the capital investment has been made. So to the extent that we can contract more gas passing through it, that goes straight to our bottom line. And so we feel good about the possibility of contracting more gas in Panama and increasing that utilization. In the case of the Dominican Republic, we had talked about this for many years, that actually we filled up the tank, to the extent that we're actually having to build a somewhat smaller but second tank there to meet all the demand. So realize this is contracted. It's tolling. We're not taking commodity risk. So our gas strategy in the Caribbean and Central America is playing out as planned. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: One more clarification, on Indiana, I didn't hear you say anything about PUCO and renewables. I know there's an RFP out there. Apologies, if I could. Gustavo Pimenta : Yes, there is an RFP as we speak, so the team is finalizing. And it's one of the opportunities that we have to sign up for more renewable growth there and rate base. So stay tuned, we'll be talking about that shortly. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Not yet in there. All right, great. Gustavo Pimenta : Not yet in there. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thanks, Julien. Operator : Next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Stephen Byrd : Congratulations on progress on a lot of fronts. I agree with Julien, it's kind of hard to know where to start. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thank you very much. Stephen Byrd : So I wanted to maybe start at a high level and just talk about your renewables business globally, and thinking about sort of how to realize the full value of the business. The business has become very large. It's one of the biggest backlogs globally. How do you think about ensuring that you realize the full value, given that it's housed within AES? And this has always been sort of a question in terms of highlighting the values of these businesses. And I think it's just really accentuated, given the trading levels of pure clean energy companies. Just curious how you're thinking about the long-term strategy there. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : That's a great question. We think about that a lot. So really what we see is that there is a true competitive advantage of combining our existing platforms with the new. And I say that because it's easy to talk about renewables, but really that's just energy. And what the market is demanding is capacity. So you're going to get that capacity in the short term from your existing traditional facilities and then with energy storage. So thinking about that, nobody is in a better position than us to do that because we really are the leader in the -- not only the amount of energy storage, but more important, I think the new applications, finding new ways to use this. So I feel very good about this sort of leading this transition in a very responsible way retiring our coal plants, selling coal plants, providing that capacity to some extent in other new markets in -- with gas. Because quite frankly not all markets are capable with today's technology of efficiently providing capacity. Even with batteries, it would be too expensive with renewables. So we're leading that transition to a lower-carbon future. But at the same time, I think we're uniquely integrating, be it energy storage, innovative renewables. I mean I think 5B, that technology will play a greater role in the future as you get greater really penetration of solar in some areas. And so being able to do it in a smaller space is very valuable. Being able to do it faster is very valuable. We're really doing some very interesting things on robotics. We're doing some very interesting things in digital, digital controls. And so Uplight is one aspect of it. But so is for example, the purchase of AMS by Fluent. So that's a little bit how I see it. So while it's true that there is a premium today for pure renewable plays, we think there'll be a premium tomorrow for those companies that truly satisfy what customers need. So it's not only energy. It's energy plus capacity. And we will lead the way into providing capacity, energy and customer-facing solutions into the future. So it's a very interesting transition, even though it's a little bit complicated story. Stephen Byrd : Those are good points about capacity and integration. I take those points. Maybe shifting over to the corporate customer side. The Google arrangement makes a lot of sense. I was just curious your latest thoughts in terms of additional appetite from other corporate or potential corporate customers to do something along those lines, given AES' global platform? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : That's a great question. So we have a, say, arrangement with Google. We're exploring several fronts. As you know, we do have an RFP out for a gigawatt and PJM. We will, we believe, making announcements into the future in terms of how we will be working together, as I said, several fronts. But this is not something that will not exclude other clients, potential clients. So as we find ways to provide the capacity people need and the low carbon that people need, plus a digital overlay. That is certainly something that we believe will be attractive to a lot of clients. So Green Blend and Extend, for example was an interesting solution for a lot of the big mining companies that wanted to lower their carbon footprint and have cheaper energy. And again, that can transition over time to net 0 solution, but it's going to take some time to get there. Stephen Byrd : Understood. So it sounds like while there's a lot of opportunities, it's going to take some time to really to get traction with a lot of corporate customers, to the point where this is a more meaningful part of your overall business mix. Is that fair? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : No. I would say that -- I guess what I'm saying is that I expect to do more with corporate customers. What I'm saying is that depending on what the situation is. It may take longer or less long. It depends, on the market they're in, depends on the availability of renewables in that market, and it depends exactly what the customer wants. I mean what we're really working with is sort of co-creating with clients and co-creating what they want. And I think again we're also uniquely positioned to do that, not only because of the various technologies we're involved in, but also, quite frankly our modus operandi with the client. So, if you think of something like KIUC in the first sort of 24/7 renewables, load-following renewable solution in Hawaii, that was codeveloped with them. So the same way we like we're working with Google, we are working with other people. What we've done in Chile, we've also worked with the client. So I hope that answers your question. So no, I don't see this way off in the future. I see there's a certain relatively short term and growing over time as the clients become more clear exactly what they want, and some of the technologies get cheaper. Stephen Byrd : Sorry, I misunderstood. Great. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Next question is from Charles Fishman of Morningstar. Charles Fishman : Andr\u00e9s, the PPAs awarded and signed year-to-date, Slide 53, a big win for Gener on solar. You picked up another project to that power solar. Why if I compare this exhibit to the 2Q exhibit, AES distributed energy actually went lower on solar [ph]? is that you lost the projects just moved it around to a different subsidiary? Or what -- you don't agree with that? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes. Sorry, are you looking at, what, the Annex Page 53? Charles Fishman : Yes. Slide 53 has the AES DE, distributed energy, right, I believe? Yes. And you could see that, okay, you got solar 91 megawatts you signed year-to-date, storage 97. But then if I go back to 2Q, I see AEs Distributed Energy [indiscernible], both of those quite a bit higher. Ahmed Pasha : Yes. Charles, this is Ahmed. I think Charles, some of these projects that we show in the backlog, they are only either in construction or we have signed -- if the project is completed, then that goes back to operations. That's no longer part of our backlog. Charles Fishman : Okay. So this is something -- they were projects that went in operation in the quarter that you moved off this line. Ahmed Pasha : Yes. Charles Fishman : Okay. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Once it's in operation, it's no longer backlog. Ahmed Pasha : Yes. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : It's been fulfilled. Ahmed Pasha : Backlog, the way we define backlog is either is in construction. Or we have signed the PPA, but it's not yet in construction. But if it is completed, it gets out. Charles Fishman : Even though it was signed this year [indiscernible] operation, you take it off this list. Ahmed Pasha : Yes. Charles Fishman : Okay, got it. Now another question previously asked on Indiana IPL, if I could maybe push a little harder on that. We've recently seen two other utilities in Indiana really go all in on solar. And yes quite frankly, AEs has more solar experience than both those other utilities combined plus some. Do you have the opportunity at IPL to retire from coal or old gas plants that we should expect some movement like that? It seems like the Indiana Commission is very receptive to that direction. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes. Well, we have an RFP for 1.2 gigawatts of renewable, so stay tuned for the results of that. And in those numbers that I gave in this call of 1.2 gigawatts of retirement, there's some of the older coal plants in Indiana. So as a regulated, we have to get approval for this transition. But you're right, we have a whole lot of experience on that, and that's what we're going to do. Charles Fishman : Okay, that's helpful. Thank you; that's all I had. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thank you, Charles. Operator : Next question is from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steven Fleishman : Hi, good morning. Just wanted to clarify on the coal getting below the 30% announcement. Was there something that didn't get done in terms of an asset sale or something? Because the -- I think these shutdowns were already planned for a while and they're not happening until '21 or '23. So I guess I'm just trying to figure out how that fits into meeting it by the end of '20? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes. No. Thanks for the question. No look, what we have in there in our pro forma are sales that we already have a signed contract with, or a plant that we've already programmed to retire. Now that does not exclude additional sales. Now we're not behind on any additional sales or additional shutdowns. And as we said, we expect more in the near term. So we're saying it's 29 already in the third quarter. We had said we would do it by the end of the year. So stay tuned. We think we'll be comfortably below the 30% threshold. And remember, that's megawatt hours. It's actual generation. So actually capacity, we're already at about 26% and will be -- continue to decline. So honestly we haven't missed any of our internal milestones. Steven Fleishman : Okay. I'm sorry, Andr\u00e9s, I need to clarify this. But these plants we've known they are going to be shut down for a while. It's not like new, I think, and they're not actually being shut down by the end of 2020. So I'm confused... Ahmed Pasha : No. I think -- Steve, Ahmed here. Most of these plants I think we got approvals, like Hawaii they just passed the law. We've got the regulatory approval in Hawaii. Then also [indiscernible] as well; so I think these are all the developments that we just announced. So these are not some things that got improved... Steven Fleishman : Indiana too; because I thought... Ahmed Pasha : Which one, Indiana? It's about 500 megawatts. I think this also got approval. We just made that filing, I think it's about a month ago or so. So Steve... Steven Fleishman : Okay. And in terms of meeting the target, it doesn't matter if they don't shut by the end of 2020 or you don't sell by then, as long as you're shutting a few years from now? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes. I mean we've been in discussions with ESG investors like Norges Bank. And it really was like, \"Show me a path how you're going to get there in the near term.\" So really this is reflecting what they've asked us to do. We're going to overperform, I assure you of that. And we've been somewhat cautious in terms of our announcements. Because as Ahmed said, what we've shown this time is what we've actually gotten approvals to do. These aren't just, \"Gee, I wish -- I'm going to shut this down.\" Well, can you really shut it down? And you need to have the approval of the regulator of the network operator. So that's where we're at. So honestly this is exactly what we discussed with people like Norges Bank, exactly what they asked us to do. And if anything, we're upfront about it. Now, it is pro forma because in some cases, you -- the retirement, they still need it for, say, another year in some cases. But stay tuned. We'll -- I assure you that we will... Steven Fleishman : You announced that Petersburg retirement a couple like years ago or we've had that... Andr\u00e9s Gluski : No, no, we did not. Steven Fleishman : I guess that's helpful. it was the -- Andr\u00e9s Gluski : And I think the punchline is, Steve, just to be clear, we have not seen any delays in the transactions we are working on as far as the sell-downs are concerned on the coal side. So I think we still continue to see the interest. So I don't think there's you need to read anything between the lines. Steven Fleishman : Okay, that's helpful. And then just the -- on the DPL settlement, the path there, it looks like you -- your -- it allows you now to invest the money and get the rate base growth from that. That's going and keep -- and also keep the current of the old ESP rate. And then I guess at the end of the period, the old ESP rate goes away, but you can then keep growing the rate base from thereon. Can you -- is there any way you can kind of extend this old ESP rate that's still in through 23? Gustavo Pimenta : I think the -- our expectation is that October 23, we'll file ESP for. It will probably take 12 to 18 months to get approval, and then we're going to get into a new ESP without the RSC. But the plan is we will build up the rate base in the meantime, so we can continue to post growth post that period. Steven Fleishman : Yes. Okay, great. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Next question comes from Chopra, Evercore ISI. Unidentified Analyst : I have one clarification and then just one big picture question. Just going back to - maybe, Gustavo, maybe this is for you. But just going back to Slide 28 here when we sort of look at the cash generation, and you have about $250 million left of the $900 million, $650 million announced. I just want to be clear, the Fluence transaction, any proceeds there are not on this slide, correct? Gustavo Pimenta : Not on this slide. It's all going to be kept at Fluence. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And it will be kept just at Fluence. I mean there's not user proceeds in terms of with your other businesses. Gustavo Pimenta : No, none. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then maybe just big picture, obviously this year you've executed strongly. But 7% to 9%, can you just high level talk about what gets you to 9% versus what gets you to 7%? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : I would say that the difference will have to be in terms of the projects that we have, how fast for example we fill up the gas tanks at Panama and the DR. It will have to be a little bit in terms of demand growth at our utilities and probably execution of our renewable projects. I'd say those are the 3 drivers. As Gustavo said, we have cost cuts inherent. We have lower financing costs as well. So all those are pluses. So I'd say the ones that are outside of our control, to some extent a little bit would be the demand growth in the utilities, and a little bit the timing of filling up the tolling capacity in Central America and Carribbean. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Helpful, guys. Maybe just one quick one Just as you think long term, Andr\u00e9s, I mean you have a pretty good competitive advantage here with storage and with renewables. Just how do you think about balancing, growing internationally, versus sort of your renewable portfolio internationally, versus being 50% earnings from the U.S., that's your long-term target? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : That's a great question. Look, our objective is to be an investment-grade company, continue to strengthen our balance sheet and the mix of our businesses. We move very strongly towards investment-grade, dollar long-term contracted business. And that's why we've been so resilient this year in an uncertain environment. I think we've proven that. And we've improved our credit rating in the midst of COVID. I think that says a lot for the strength of our business. We think the optimal mix, also given market conditions probably, is about half U.S. and half outside. And we think that's optimal. We have big corporate opportunities in the U.S. It's a strong market for us. We also think that we have good corporate demand internationally and somewhat unique to us. And we do get higher returns in general internationally. So we think a sort of 50-50 split would be ideal. It's not we can orient it in one direction or the other. Part of it will have to do where our clients demand and where we have competitive advantages. But we think we're developing really global competitive advantages. So it's not only international. We have them here in the U.S.. Unidentified Analyst : That's great. Great quarter. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thank you Operator : That concludes our answer -- question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Ahmed Pasha for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Ahmed Pasha : Thanks, everybody, for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Next week, we look forward to seeing many of you at the EEI Conference. Thanks again, and have a great day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] As a further reminder, today's event is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ahmed Pasha, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Ahmed Pasha : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements, which are discussed in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can also be found on our website along with the presentation. Joining me this morning are Andr\u00e9s Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Gustavo Pimenta, our Chief Financial Officer. With that, I will turn the call over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial review call. This morning, I will provide an update on our major financial and strategic accomplishments, which position us well for the future. Some of you may recall that last year, I set out three short-term catalysts for our stock : hitting our numbers, getting a second investment-grade rating, and becoming Norges Bank coal generation compliant. In 2020, we delivered on all three metrics and set ourselves up for continued progress. First, let me talk about hitting our numbers. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.44, which was above our guidance range of $1.32 to $1.42. Our parent free cash flow came in at $777 million, which also exceeded the top end of our range of $725 million to $775 million. Second, in November, S&P upgraded us to an investment grade rating of BBB-, joining Fitch, which had upgraded us in 2019. Third, by selling a retiring coal plant and building new renewables, we will reduce the percentage of megawatt hours being produced by coal plants to 25% on a pro forma basis, which is comfortably below Norges Bank threshold of 30%. All of these results reflect the resilience of our business model, which is anchored on long-term dollar denominated contracts with investment grade off-takers and U.S. regulated utilities. In addition to these achievements, in 2020 we continue to advance our leadership in innovation and new green technologies. We signed 3 gigawatts of long-term contracts for renewables, which is also at the top end of our range of guidance of 2 gigawatts to 3 gigawatts. As you can see on Slide 4, these 3 gigawatts of new renewable PPAs are mostly in the U.S. and South America. In the U.S., we have merged our two development companies AES Distributed Energy and sPower into one entity, AES Clean Energy, to better take advantage of synergies and economies of scale. In South America, our renewables growth was fueled in part by the continued success of our Green Blend and Extend negotiations, which combined new renewables with existing long-term conventional capacity contracts. With the addition of these 3 gigawatts of new PPAs, our current backlog of projects reached 6.9 gigawatt as shown on Slide 5. About half of the total solar and most of the remainder is wind and energy storage; 100% of our backlog is renewable. We expect to bring almost 4 gigawatts of this backlog online in 2021, one of the largest capacity additions in AES' history. Finally, turning to Slide 6. Fluence, our joint venture with Siemens to provide energy storage systems, maintained its global leadership position and signed 785 MW of new capacity. Its revenues grew 400% versus the prior year and they acquired AMS' leading AI-enabled bidding software business. A capital raise was also announced with the Qatar Investment Authority, which will provide funds to further accelerate the development of its digital product offerings and the deployment of its systems around the world. As you can see, we are very well positioned to continue our solid renewables growth, aggressive decarbonization and deployment of leading technology innovations. The electricity sector is changing rapidly and we will be providing a comprehensive view of AES' long-term plans and opportunities in this new environment, next Wednesday, March 3 at our Investor Day. Now let me turn the call over to Gustavo, who will provide more color on our financial results for 2020 and guidance for 2021. Gustavo Pimenta : Thank you, Andr\u00e9s, and good morning everyone. Today, I'll cover the following key topics : our financial performance during the fourth quarter and full year 2020, our capital allocation initiatives in 2020, and our 2021 guidance. As Andr\u00e9s mentioned, our results for 2020 highlighted the resilience of our business model. We delivered a strong financial performance while navigating challenging macro conditions, including the impacts of lower demand due to COVID-19 and a record dry hydrology in Colombia. We finished the year on a strong note, setting a solid foundation for continued growth. Turning to Slide 8. Full year adjusted EPS of $1.44 exceeded the top end of our guidance range and was at the midpoint of our regional pre-COVID guidance range. As I noted, the key negative impacts on our results were from lower demand and adverse hydrology. Our generation business, which accounts for more than 80% of our earnings, is largely insulated from demand fluctuations. However, as we have discussed in the past, our U.S. utilities did experience a reduction in demand due to the economic impact of the pandemic. Although there has been a gradual recovery in demand in the second half of 2020, the impact on a full year basis was approximately $0.04. Regarding hydrology, we experienced average hydrology in most of our markets, except in Colombia, where it was one of the worst hydrological years on record. The total impact of hydrology on our full year results was approximately $0.05 in South America, primarily in Colombia. We expected the hydrological conditions to be normal in Colombia in 2021, in line with the long-term historical average and have already observed this trend in the year-to-date. Despite the headwinds from these two areas, we are able to deliver on our full year guidance as a result of higher contributions from new businesses and improved operating performance in South America. We also benefited from our cost savings initiatives, interest expense savings, resulting from $7 billion of refinancings across the portfolio and a lower adjusted tax rate. Turning to Slide 9. Adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, was $1.2 billion for the year, an increase of $7 million versus 2019. I will cover our results in more detail over the next four slides, beginning with the U.S. and Utilities SBU on Slide 10. As you may have seen yesterday, we have rebranded our U.S. Utilities, DP&L and IPL, to align with the new AES brand. So now on, these businesses will be known as AES Ohio and AES Indiana, respectively. In 2020, lower PTC at our U.S. and Utilities SBU reflects the impact of the reversion to ESP1 rates at AES Ohio in 2019 and lower demand at our utilities due to the impact of COVID-19 and milder weather. These impacts were partially offset by the benefit from the commencement of PPAs at the Southland Energy CCGTs as well as the contributions from new renewable projects. Higher PTC at our South America SBU was largely driven by higher contributions from AES Gener and a favorable revision of regulatory charge at AES Tiete in Brazil. These impacts were partially offset by drier hydrology and a planned major outage at the Chivor hydro plant in Colombia and the regulatory changes in Argentina in 2019. Lower PTC at our MCAC SBU primarily reflects the impact from insurance recovery in prior year as well as outages incurred in 2020 in Dominican Republic, partially offset by improved availability in hydrology in Panama. Finally, in Eurasia, higher results reflect lower interest expense due to the debt repayment in 2020 in Bulgaria, partially offset by the impact of businesses sold in the United Kingdom in 2019. Now turning to our credit profile on Slide 14. Our significantly reduced parent debt and growing free cash flow enabled us to improve our credit metrics by 400 basis points since 2018. At the end of 2020, our parent free cash flow to net debt ratio was 23%, well above the 20% threshold required for an investment-grade rating. Strong credit metrics remain one of our top priorities, and we continue to take steps to maintain and further improve upon current levels. Furthermore, we took advantage last year of a low interest rate environment and refinanced approximately $7 billion of debt across our portfolio, extending maturities and capturing annualized interest savings of $90 million. Now to our 2020 parent capital allocation on Slide 15. Beginning on the left-hand side, sources reflect $1.3 billion of total discretionary cash. Asset sales of $530 million reflect the net proceeds from the sale of OPGC and the sell-down of 35% of our interest in the Southland Repowering projects. Parent free cash flow of $777 million exceeded the top end of our expectation. Moving to uses on the right-hand side. Roughly, 1/3 of our discretionary cash was allocated to shareholder dividend and debt repayment. We invested $812 million in our subsidiaries, primarily in our renewables backlog, Southland repowering and AES Ohio. Approximately 90% of the total investments in subsidiaries were in the U.S., contributing to our goal of increasing the proportion of earnings from the U.S. to about half. Turning to our guidance on Slide 16. Today, we are initiating guidance for 2021 adjusted EPS of $1.50 to $1.58, in line with our average annual growth target of 7% to 9%. Parent free cash flow for 2021 is expected to be $775 million to $825 million, which is based on 7% growth from the midpoint of our 2020 expectation of $750 million. Key drivers of our expected growth in adjusted EPS in 2021 include : a full year of operations of our 1.3 gigawatt Southland Repowering project, which came online in mid-2020; continued growth in renewables, including 4 gigawatts expected to reach commercial operation this year; efficiency gains from cost savings in our digital initiatives; and an interest savings due to refinancing benefits and completed that reduction. We look forward to discussing our long-term growth rates and drivers with you all at our Investor Day next week. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thank you, Gustavo. Before we take your questions, let me summarize today's call. Thanks to the extraordinary dedication of our people and the resilience of our business model, we've met or exceeded all of our strategic and financial goals in 2020. We are very well positioned to capitalize on significant growth opportunities arising from the rapid transformation of our sector. As always, our primary focus is to continue to deliver superior returns to shareholders. We look forward to discussing our strategy and longer-term financial outlook with you at our Investor Day next Wednesday, March 3. With that, I would like to open up the call to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global. Agnieszka Storozynski : So two quick questions, one on your of 21 guidance, what effective tax rate is embedded in that guidance and is this an indication that you are actually expecting lower effective tax going forward? Gustavo Pimenta : So Angie, Gustavo. No, I think we are - I mean, we had a - this year, 2020 was particularly lower, around 23%. For 2021, we're expecting to go back to our original expectation on the mid-20s to high 20s. Agnieszka Storozynski : And then one of the points, a drag, year-on-year drag on your '21 guidance is some GSF adjustment in Brazil. Could you explain? Gustavo Pimenta : Yes. So we had this positive gain there, but we also had especially in Colombia, some negative, call it, one-timer hit. So we had a life extension project there that was about $0.05 to $0.06 negative. So when you look at both businesses, they pretty much net each other out. So I wouldn't expect any drag from the hydro businesses in 2021. Agnieszka Storozynski : Okay. And I know that you're going to be talking about strategy and longer-term growth plans only next week, but do you have any sense when Moody's could review your rating? Gustavo Pimenta : Look, they came earlier this year and with a positive update on their credit view for AES, basically lowering the overall FFO to debt on a consolidated basis to 14% versus 16%. We are seeing us there, very close to these ratios. So we are positive. I think they will - we expect them to make a move hopefully this year. We'll see what is exactly the move that they make. But the ratios are there, and we think we're in a positive moment with them. Agnieszka Storozynski : And then again, I know the Analyst Day is next week, but can you comment if you see yourself issuing equity any time soon, like, say, over the next 5 years? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes. Hi. Angie, this is Andr\u00e9s. Look, that's one of the tools available to us. And it depends, we'll see the growth rates we have. We have a lot of opportunities. So that's one of the tools in our kit. Operator : The next question comes from Richard Sunderland with JPMorgan. Richard Sunderland : Just want to start off maybe on the events in Texas last week. What do you see as the role for storage in the state going forward? And how might AES benefit from the deployment of storage locally? Gustavo Pimenta : Sure. Look, storage can be used to make a more resilient grid definitely. And so I think that storage, the potential for growth in storage is enormous. What particularly happened in Texas, of course, was that you don't have capacity payments. So you didn't have really an incentive to winterize a lot of the existing plants into fossil plants and also, quite frankly, the wind turbines. Interestingly, solar performed very well. So I think the follow-on is, yes, people are going to be concerned about more resilient networks and storage can play a part, transmission, it can also play a part locally. So I do think that this will cast more light, more attention on energy storage as part of a more resilient grid. Richard Sunderland : So do you see kind of a different opportunity for solar than for solar plus storage or just storage in general going forward as a result of the events? Or do you think it's more markets dying issues and kind of other specific factors that may be due to change? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Well, my own personal opinion is that when you have a market where you don't remunerate capacity, I think is one of the key sources. Having said that, and of course, energy storage has many uses. It's not only solar plus storage, wind plus storage, stand-alone storage, but also to make improved transmission with existing lines, so you don't have to upgrade the whole line. So all of these, attention to the robustness of the grid and the network, is a positive for future sales of energy storage. Richard Sunderland : And then just one specifically on the '21 guidance here. Any way to frame assumptions around asset sales, coal sales baked into '21 guidance versus what has been announced last year into this year? Gustavo Pimenta : Yes, this is Gustavo. So all of the announced asset sales and retirements are incorporated. Effectively, we have India that closed late last year, so it's in here. We've said Vietnam, which was the other large one, would probably close between the end of this year, early next year. So it doesn't hit 2021. But effectively, all of the announced asset sales and retirements are incorporated in this 2021 guidance. Richard Sunderland : And are there placeholders for incremental sales as well? Gustavo Pimenta : I mean, if they happen, they'll probably close later. So specifically for 2021, wouldn't make any difference here. Operator : The next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Stephen Byrd : I wanted to explore your corporate partnership with Google and just get your overall views on the degree of interest you're seeing from other companies to partner with AES, given AES' global reach in renewables and storage capabilities to help those corporates to achieve zero emissions. Is that an area you're encouraged by? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Very much so, very much so. We've talked in the past about our relationship and partnership with Google, that continues to progress. But we're also seeing interest from other similar players, about - 24x7 renewables. So definitely, we're encouraged by this. And the fact that we have presence in other markets is an additional plus, not immediately, but down the road. Stephen Byrd : Okay. So it sounds like something in the long term you're excited about, but nothing near term, but something we could see over time. Okay. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : No, I wouldn't say so long term. Stephen Byrd : Okay. That's great. And then I guess just stepping back, maybe building a little bit on Angie's question on financing. You have a really great growth outlook in many different asset classes. And I was just curious, just at a high level as you think about just innovative financing approaches, financing tools out there, there certainly - strikes me, there's a lot of folks who love to provide capital to high-quality clean energy and storage projects. Are you seeing anything sort of new in terms of innovation? And as AES gets bigger and bigger in renewables, just different approaches to financing all of this growth? Gustavo Pimenta : Well, it's a great question. Over the past, let's say, 8 years or so, we've sold about $6 billion of assets. And we have churned that money, right? And that's provided impetus for a lot of our new growth. We've also done partnerships. So those continue to - we'll continue to do asset sales, and we continue to do partnerships. So you're right. We're seeing a lot of interest in people co-investing with us in different shapes or forms. So this is very positive. I think we have a good reputation as a partner, who really looks at all shareholders in these joint ventures. So you're absolutely right, we're seeing a lot of new things. As you know, in the past, I'd say the one thing that did not come to fruition really was the effort that Tom led for about a year. Honestly, without COVID, it would have come to fruition, which was quite innovative. But as I always said back then, this was extra. We didn't need it to finance our growth. That was just a plus. So we're seeing, again, a lot of people who are interested in partnering with us and are different technology plays. Operator : Today's next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin Smith : Congratulations, again. Perhaps, just to kick it off here on '21, and I'm going to try to hold back ahead of next week, obviously. But can you talk about the renewables contribution here in earnings as well as Fluence? How are you thinking about those two pieces? And especially, as you try to refine your expectations and given the success on renewable backlog here, I get renewables are not necessarily homogenous. But how do you think about renewable earnings contributions here? And I know this is getting a little bit ahead of next week, but can you speak to it especially in the context of '21, for both Fluence and renewables? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes. Let me start it, and then I'll pass it over to Gustavo. So look, next year is very interesting just from a cutting ribbon point of view. We have 4 gigawatts that's coming online. So that represents PPAs, which were signed in the past. And this is one of the highest additions to our fleet in our history in a single year. So that we feel very good about. So the second thing is, as you correctly pointed out, our renewables come in different flavors. So about half is outside the U.S. and about half is solar, and about half is - there is some hydro coming online but there is mostly wind, some energy storage. Regarding Fluence, I would say that Fluence will not be a contributor to earnings next year because it's in a very rapid growth phase. What we see is a big increase, an acceleration in demand for energy storage as more uses are seen. And there were some questions about - prior on this call about grid stability. And then yes, it can play an important role in that. So we see growth accelerating in Fluence. And basically, as a result of that, it's harder to hit that break-even. But I would say that in terms of - it's just a little bit postponed in time because you're gearing up. Now we came out with the new cube stack. We also bought the AI-enabled bidding platform from AMS and that's a very interesting addition. And we've had sales of AMS bidding engine, actually not using Fluence's hardware. So generally, I would say that this kind of software platforms have less capital-intensive than building the cube stack itself. So that will help us turn profitability sooner. But there's this trade-off between very rapid growth and starting to break-even. But we feel very good about the company. So I'll pass it now to Gustavo to talk a little bit about the breakdown of our earnings. Now I realize a lot of these things are somewhat tied together because you have like Green Blend and Extend. So you basically have a capacity contract with a fossil plant plus renewables being added on to that. So with that, I'll pass it on to Gustavo. Gustavo Pimenta : Thanks, Andr\u00e9s. So Julien, I would say that 2021 is mostly driven by new additions. So remember, we had just half of the year for Southland, so we're going to have a full year of Southland, that's about $0.04. And then renewables altogether - we are bringing 4 gigawatts online, as Andr\u00e9s said. Renewables altogether is about $0.05. So the delta 2021 is mostly driven by those additions. And then you have some items that offset each other. So there was a drag on tax. Tax was particularly lower. But we have recovered, for example, in the demand side from the Utilities, we're expecting some recovery there. We have the cost cuttings also that will offset some of the drag from tax. So if you clean all of that, I would say mostly of the growth of - primarily the growth is coming from the new additions, being Southland full year and $0.05 from renewables. Julien Dumoulin Smith : Excellent. If I can ask you the obvious question here. Your target for annual development, I suppose, is 2 to 3 gigs, [technical difficulty] 4 gigawatts next year. Obvious question is, how do you think about that long-term target? And then related, given your comment on continued drag on Fluence, why hold on to a business that continues to drag your primary valuation metric in light of accelerating and improving outlook? Gustavo Pimenta : Sure. Let's see. Let me take the first question, which was about the renewables growth. So we have 2 years where we've basically been about 3 gigawatts. Now when we talk about that, that's PPA signed. So those will be brought online normally in a period within 24 months, probably the average is about 18 months. So there's a lag there. So we have had two very strong years. So 4 gigawatts are going to come online, that means they're actually coming online. So the goal is sign PPAs. The second is - which are actually going to start contributing to your earnings. So we see continued acceleration, let's say, in the renewables business. So we feel very comfortable. It's no longer sort of 2 to 3, it's more a 3-plus going forward. And this could - we'll be talking about this on Wednesday, I don't want to get too ahead of us. Now regarding Fluence, and really we do have a number of unicorns that we've done. It started with Athimos in Brazil, which was the telecom fiber optic rings, that we had distributed energy, Fluence is one. And we have another - some more potential ones that we're developing. So I would say that we're creating a lot of, lot of value with Fluence in two different ways. First, half of our renewable PPAs that we're signing have an energy storage component. So right there, it makes us competitive, really understanding how to use energy storage and how to be very creative. I mean, what we did in Hawaii, as you know, we won a prize for that. We have other projects coming on in Hawaii. We have the world's first virtual reservoir. We have a number of new uses. So AES is part of that engine of growth affluence because we are creating many new applications and that is helping Fluence. And then we're getting it through the valuation of Fluence itself. So if you look at the valuation of Fluence, I expect it to do very well. We started with the Qatari Investment Authority. Qatar is a particularly excellent partner at this stage for its investments in other technologies, from batteries to potential clients like NABROS in the Middle East. So this is kind of somewhere between the financial and a strategic investor here. So no, I don't think the time is now to get rid of Fluence in any way. I think we're in it for the long term. I think there are opportunities in the future that we will evaluate. But, no, we're very pleased with it. And I think we're just starting to see the real inflection point here for energy storage. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Charles Fishman : Good morning. Andr\u00e9s, I know you were targeting Alto Maipo for commercial operation by end of the year, did you make it? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : It will be this year. We were targeting this year, 2021 - maybe originally. But I'd say over the last year or so, we've been targeting 2021. It's coming along very well, and we are very close to completing all the tunneling work, and we've already done a lot of work in terms of putting in the turbines in the machine room. So Alto Maipo is proceeding nicely, and it will come online this year. And as you know, you basically complete construction, then you got to fill up all the various tunnels with water before you start producing. But we're very pleased with construction at Alto Maipo. Charles Fishman : Okay. And then on dividend policy, I'm just looking back over the last 6 years, it looks like you've been pretty consistent on the dividend being 50% of the parent free cash flow. Is that still the first metric the Board looks at? Is that still the primary tool they're going to use or metric they're going to use for determining the dividend going forward? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : We really look to see if we have a dividend that we think is competitive for our investors. So what we're targeting going forward is a growth between 4% to 6% in our dividend. I think if you go in the past 5 years, we probably had the fastest-growing dividend of - or 7 years, we've had the fastest-growing dividend of anybody, really, if you take the longer time frame. So we're happy with our growth that we've been forecasting as 7% to 9% in the past, and we'll continue to grow our dividend 4% to 6%, which we think is competitive in our sector. Charles Fishman : So the fact that it's been about 50% of free cash flow is just - I won't say coincidental, but it's just secondary importance? Gustavo Pimenta : That's correct. We're not targeting a payout of our free cash flow in that sense. So that's really not the target. It's really to make sure that we have an attractive dividend payment for our shareholders. Operator : At this time, we are showing no further questions in the queue and this concludes our question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to Ahmed Pasha for any closing remarks. Ahmed Pasha : Thanks. Thanks, everybody, for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any questions you may have. Next week, we look forward to speaking with you again at our Virtual Investor Day. Thank you, and have a nice day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I now like to turn the conference over to Ahmed Pasha, Chief Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you and over to you. Ahmed Pasha : Thank you, Operator. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter 2021 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements, which are discussed in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can also be found on our website along with the presentation. Joining me this morning are Andr\u00e9s Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Gustavo Pimenta, our Chief Financial Officer and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will turn the call over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter financial review call. Our first quarter results put us on track to achieve our 2021 guidance and 7% to 9% average annual growth through 2025. Gustavo will provide more color on our financial results later in the call. As we spoke about on our Investor Day in early March, we see a great opportunity for growth. Given the momentum is changes in our sector. And we are very well positioned to capitalize on the shift to low carbon sources of energy. Over the past five years we have transformed our company to be a leader in renewable and we have invested in innovative technologies that will give us a competitive advantage for many years to come. Although it has been less than two months since our Investor Day we had a number of significant achievements to announce, including a landmark deal with Google which I will describe in more detail later. A strategic collaboration to develop new battery technologies between Fluence and Northvolt the leading European supplier of sustainable battery systems and a significant increase in LNG sales in Central America and the Caribbean to support those economies in the transition away from heavy fuels. First let me lay out our strategic priorities for 2021 and the substantial progress that we have made year-to-date for the achieving those objectives.  Turning to Slide, our five key goals for the year are one signed contracts for 4 gigawatts of renewables. Two, launch the 24-7 product for carbon free energy on an hourly basis. Three, further unlock the value of our technology platforms. Four, continue to improve our ESG positioning through the transformation of our portfolio. And five, monetize excess LNG capacity in Central America and the Caribbean.  Turning to Slide 5 last year, we set and exceeded a goal of signing 2 to 3 gigawatts of PPAs for renewables and energy storage. This year we are increasing that goal by 60% to a target of 4 gigawatts. Today. I am pleased to report that year-to-date, we've already signed 1.1 gigawatt including a landmark deal with moving.  As you can see on Slide 6, we have a backlog of 6.9 gigawatts of renewables consisting of projects already under construction or under signed power purchase agreements or PPAs. This equates to 20% growth in our total installed capacity and a 60% increase in our renewables capacity.  Turning to Slide 7. We continue to increase our pipeline of projects to support our growth and now have a global pipeline of more than 30 gigawatts of renewable projects. What we, half of which is the United States. With increasing demand from corporate customers and a much more favorable policy environment, we expect the need for renewables to grow dramatically and we're taking steps to ensure a continued competitive advantage. Moving to Slide 8. Our second key goal for this year is to launch the first 24-7 energy product that matches a customer's load with carbon free energy on an hourly basis. To that end, earlier this week, we announced a landmark first of its kind agreement to supply Google's Virginia-based data centers with 24-7 carbon free energy source from a portfolio of 500 megawatts of renewables. Under this innovative structure AES will become the sole supplier of the datacenters energy needs. Ensuring that the energy supplied will meet carbon free targets when measured on an hourly basis for the next 10 years.  The carbon free energy will come from an optimized portfolio of wind, solar, hydro and battery storage resources. This agreement has a new standard in carbon free energy for commercial and industrial customers who signed 23 gigawatts of PPAs in 2020. As we discussed at our Investor Day we almost 300 companies that make up the RE 100 will need more than 100 gigawatts of new renewables by 2030. This transaction with Google demonstrate that a higher sustainability standard is possible. And we expect a substantial portion of customers to pursue 24-7 carbon free objectives. Based on our leadership position, we are well placed to serve this growing market. And in fact, we've already seen significant interest from a number of large clients. Turning to Slide 9, our third key goal is to further unlock the value of our technology platforms. One of these platforms is Uplight and energy efficiency, software company that works directly with utility and has access to more than a 100 million households and businesses in the US. Uplight is at the forefront of the shift to low-carbon and digital solutions on the cloud. In March, we announced a capital raise with a consortium led by Schneider Electric valuing Uplight at 1.5 billion. Now to Slide 10. We are seeing increasing value in many of our other technology platforms as well. Fluence our joint venture with Siemens are a global leader in energy storage, which is a key component of the energy transition. This dynamic industry is expected to grow 40% annually and Fluence is well positioned to capitalize on this immense opportunity through its distinct competitive advantages including its AI enabled leading engine.  Turning to Slide 11, as you may have seen last month Fluence announced a multi-year agreement with Northvolt the leading European battery developer and manufacturer for assured supply and to co-develop next-generation battery technology. This is an example of Fluence is continued innovation, which has been validated by the consistent rank as the number one utility scale energy storage technology company, according to guide house insight. Similarly, we see the rapid progress of our prefab solution 5B as you can see on Slide 12. This technology double the energy density and cuts construction time by 2/3. We now have 5G projects in Australia, Panama and Chile. We will be, including 5G technology in our business in Puerto Rico. Or it's proven resilience to Category 4 hurricane winds will provide greater energy security. Proving out the unique value proposition of 5G could significantly speed up the adoption of solar in cyclone prone areas. Lastly, we continue to work towards the approval of the first large-scale green hydrogen based ammonia plant in the Western Hemisphere in Chile.  Moving to Slide 13 we have undergone one of the most dramatic transformations in our sector. Over the past five years, we have announced the retirement or sale of 10.7 gigawatts of coal or 70% of our coal capacity one of the largest reductions in our sector. We recognize that we have more work to do and have set a goal of reducing our generation from coal to less than 10% of total generation by 2025 furthermore, we expect to achieve net zero emissions from electricity by 2040 one of the most ambitious goals of any power company. As we achieve decarbonization targets and continuing our near-term growth in renewables. We anticipate being included in additional ESG oriented indices.  Finally, turning to Slide 14 we see natural gas as a transition fuel that can lower emissions and reduce overall energy costs as markets work for the future with more renewable power. Last month, we reached an agreement to provide terminal services for an additional 34 tera BTUs of LNG throughput under a 20-year take-or-pay contract. This will bring our total contracted terminal capacity in Panama and the Dominican Republic to almost 80%. There are 45 tera BTUs of available capacity remaining. We expect to sign in the next couple of years. Our LNG business is focused on providing environmentally responsible LNG or Green LNG as soon as feasible which ensures the lowest levels of the missions throughout the entire supply chain.  Now I would like to turn the call over to Gustavo Pimenta, our CFO. Gustavo Pimenta : Thanks Andr\u00e9s and good morning everyone. As Andr\u00e9s mentioned, we are off to a good start this year having already achieved significant milestones towards the strategic and financial objectives that we discussed on our Investor Day. We are also encouraged by the continued economic recovery across our markets with demand in line with pre-COVID levels.  Turning to our financial results for the quarter. As you can see on Slide 16 adjusted pre-tax contribution or B2C was $247 million for the quarter which was very much in line with our expectations and similar to last year's performance. I'll discuss the key drivers of our first quarter results and outlook for the year in the following slides. Turning to Slide 17 adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.28 versus $0.29 last year. With adjusted PTC essentially flat. The $0.01 decrease in adjusted EPS was the result of a slightly higher effective tax rate this quarter. In the US and utilities, the Strategic Business Units or SBU, PTC was down $27 million driven primarily by a lower contribution from our legacy units at Southland and higher spend in our clean energy business as we accelerate our development pipeline given the growing market opportunities. There is impacts were partially offset by the benefits from the commencement of PPAs at the Southland energy combined cycle gas turbines or CCGTs. At our South America SBU, B2C was down $31 million mostly driven by lower contributions from AES Andes [ph] formerly known as AES Hamer [ph], due to higher interest expense and lower equity earnings from the Guacolda plant in Chile. These impacts were partially offset by higher generation at the Chivor or hydro plant in Colombia. Lower PTC at our Mexico Central America and the Caribbean or MCC, as we primarily reflects outages at two facilities in Domenic Republic and Mexico with both already back online since April. Results also reflect the expiration of the 72 megawatt barge PPA in Panama. Finally in Eurasia higher PTC reflects improved operational performance and lower interest expense in our Bulgaria businesses. Now to Slide 22. With our first quarter results, we are on track to achieve our full-year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.50 to $1.58 . Our expected 2021 quarterly earnings profile is consistent with the average of the last five years. Our typical quarterly earnings is more back-end weighted with roughly 40% of the earnings occurred in the first half of the year and the remaining in the second half. Growth in the year to go will be primarily driven by contributions from new businesses including a full years of operations of the Southland repowering project, 2.3 gigawatt of projects in our backlog coming online during the next nine months. Reduced interest expense, the benefits from cost savings and the Med normalization to pre-COVID levels. We are also reaffirming our expected 7% to 9% average annual growth target through 2025. Now turning to our credit profile on Slide 23, as discussed at our Investor Day, strong credit metrics remain one of our top priorities. In the last four years we obtained two to three notches of upgrades from the three credit rating agencies, including investment grade rating from Fitch and S&P. This action validates the strength of our business model and our commitment to improving our credit metrics. We expect the positive momentum in these metrics to continue enabling the strategic BBB flat credit metrics by 2025. Now to our 2021 parent capital allocation plan on the Slide 24. Consistent with the discussion at our Investor Day sources reflect approximately $2 billion of total discretionary cash including $800 million of parent-free cash flow and $100 million of proceeds from the sale of the table [ph] in the Dominican Republic which just closed in April. Sources also include the successful issuance of the $1 billion of equity units in March. Eliminating the need for any additional equity raise to fund our current growth plan through June, 25. Now to uses on the right hand side we'll be returning $350 million to shareholders this year. This consists of our common share dividend, including the 5% increase we announced in December and the coupon of the equity units. And we plan to invest approximately $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion in our subsidiaries, as we capitalize on attractive growth opportunities. Approximately 60% of investments are in global renewable, reflecting our success in renewables origination during 2020 and our expectations for 2021. About 25% of the investments are in our US utilities to fund rate base growth with a continued focus on grid and fleet modernization. In the first quarter, we invested approximately $450 million in renewables, which is roughly 1/3 of our expected investment for the year.  In summary, 85% of our investments are going into the US utilities and global renewables helping us to achieve our goal of increasing the proportion of earnings from the US to more than half and from carbon for businesses to about 2/3 by 2025. The remaining 50% of our investments will go towards green LNG and other innovative opportunities that support and accelerate the energy transition. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thank you, Gustavo. Before we take your questions let me summarize today's call. As I have noted we have made great progress on our 2021 and long-term strategic goals and we are reaffirming our 2021 guidance and expectations through 2025. We see a tremendous opportunity for growth and further increasing our technological leadership as the industry transition unfolds. From advancing our renewables to unlocking the value of our new technology businesses we have a competitive advantage that will continue to benefit our customers and investors.  With that I would like to open up the call to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Richard Sunderland from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Richard Sunderland : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to start off on the North agreement and what it could be the Fluence and maybe the energy storage market more broadly and kind of curious on the development front itself is this more sort of iterative development work or further up the installment curve? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes, that's a great question. This is really a landmark agreement as we move to essentially have strategic relationships with battery manufacturers. So Northvolt is building a new plant in Sweden. And in Poland and we will have one train of the plant in Poland producing batteries for us. So as this market expands and as you have a real growth in demand this assures battery supply for one of our markets. And also I would say Europe, Middle East, Africa and in addition, we will not only have supply of batteries and again dedicated train to us, but we will also be working with Northvolt. So you have the new developments in battery. So in terms as battery technology develops as you have better chemistry, as we say fine-tune our cube stacked design. We will have joint development of additional improve batteries on multiple fronts. So this is a, I think, a very interesting development of getting a little bit more involved, that's a one-step prior to just being the integrator and providing the control softwares. Richard Sunderland : Got it, thank you for the color. And then, separately, thinking about this Google deal, you would have the ability to replicate that with other C&I customers, I know you mentioned some interest already. And I guess curious alongside that's some aspects around the agreement itself, whether you -- this is about having the right assets and the right location to procure or, you know, about the energy kind of management angle as well. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Or, you know, it's both in a sense, so let me take the second part first, explain a little bit what the product is. So the product really -- that the key point is that we're netting on an hourly basis, a, you know, carbon-free energy. So, this is -- you know, most contracts. Prior to this, virtually all, are really netting, you know, to be on a yearly basis could be, et cetera. So you have an excess purchases of renewables during certain hours, but you're actually using non-renewables during other hours, obviously, when you don't have the production of the renewables. This is actually saying, \"You know, on an hourly basis, the energy that I'm getting is carbon free.\" So you ask -- you know the right question it's not just a question of, you know, having overbuild solar or overbuilt wind, it's really how do you manage these different sources of energy, you know, not only to ensure that it's carbon free, but to minimize the cost? So you know, when are you buying -- When are you using wind? When are you using solar? And the real key to make this happen is adding hydro -- small hydros and adding, of course, battery storage? So it's really how do you optimize multiple uses of -- multiple sources of renewable energy to provide the lowest cost guaranteed carbon-free energy netted on an hourly basis? So behind this offer, there's a lot of math, a lot of algorithms, a lot of risk management. And we think that, you know, this is a deal that with Google itself, you know, we had a $1 billion -- I sorry, one gigawatts agreement to the first 500 and we expect it to grow as demand in these data center grows. But, of course, there are other corporate clients that are interested in this. And you know, we've seen interest from. So as people, I would say up their environmental goals, and saying, well, we're going to be net zero carbon emissions on a global scale, and really having an hourly netting.  This is really the only product on the market. So, of course, those companies that have the highest environmental standards are interested in this product. So it's a -- we think, a very interesting development, and one that we expect to replicate with multiple clients. Richard Sunderland : Great. Thank you for the time today. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Durgesh Chopra : Hey. Good morning, team. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just -- I wanted to start with the 0.21 target. You know, Analyst Day, you guys were targeting three to four gigawatts of PPAs this year. And now it sort of seems like it's 4 [ph]. I just want to make sure I'm understanding that correctly. Is that just because you had a strong start? And now you're expecting 4 instead of 24 [ph] at the Analyst Day? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : But, yes, I mean, we did three in 2019 and 2020. We're seeing a strong start, you know, not only inside PPAs, but the deals we have in progress. So we feel sufficiently confident to say that, you know, we expect to be at the upper end of our initial guidance range of 3 or 4 [ph]. So we expect to be and four gigawatts of new renewable PPAs signed in 2021. Durgesh Chopra : That's perfect. Thank you for clarifying that, Andr\u00e9s. Maybe this -- can I get your thoughts on competition. And there's, obviously, there's all a lot of us, sort of domestic players in the market. You're seeing a lot of international competition. Maybe just any thoughts as you sort of compete with these PPAs, what's the competition like and sort of, you know, what's your competitive advantage? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : All -- we do see, you know, a lot of competition out there in the market. Our strategy has been to offer more value to our clients. So we don't want to just compete for commoditized, you know, thus, far, renewable PPAs. So we have several competitive advantages. And, of course, with our knowledge of energy storage, you know, we have been really a leader in the new applications for energy storage, not only through influence in terms of the new design, but you know, A.I., bidding -- enabled bidding engines, and how do we combine them? So, the Google deal is a perfect example of how we brought together multiple energy sources -- renewable energy sources, and provided a unique product to a very demanding client. So that's our angle. Our angle is really you know, how we bring these things together? How we create more value for the client? And I think very importantly, is that we co-create with our clients.  So this was a joint project with Google that, you know, reflects more than a year's work. It's just like what we did in Kauai, what was really sort of the first sort of 24/7 solar energy storage product offering. We co-developed it with the Kauai Island utility cooperative. So that's our unique angle. So again, we see more deals like this Google deal, and more ways of working with clients to provide more value, and just not a commoditized product. So, the other advantage we have is, we started working on our pipeline. So we have a pipeline of 30 gigawatts, globally. We have a pipeline of more than 15 gigawatts in the U.S. And, you know, pipeline is not an equally defined term across all players. What we mean a pipeline, these are projects that we can execute on. So we have a land bank, we've been buying land, we've been buying land rights, we've been getting interconnection rights, looking really at the overlay of like best solar irradiation, best interconnections with the grid. And in addition, you know, best wind sites. So you know, we feel very good. I mean, putting something together like we did for Google in Virginia, it's something that we can replicate in other markets, where we have big presence, whether it be New York, whether it be California, that we don't think other people can present. So I think we're very well situated. And we also have some other angles that people don't have, that are very new. One I'll mention is 5B, 5B allows us to double the energy density. So think about that if you need to locate 100 megawatts of energy, we can do it in a space, other people can do it in 15, we can build it in a third of the time.  Now 5B, you know, the MAVERICK product is still early in its stage of development. We still have to massify to drive down costs and prove it out. But it has unique characteristics, not only the ones I've mentioned, but in Australia, it has been tested in actual life situations, like category four hurricane winds. And that's something that conventional solar cannot do. So we feel very optimistic of offering this suite of technologies, and also a unique way of bringing them together and also a unique way of working with clients. Durgesh Chopra : That's great. Thank you for that color, Andr\u00e9s. Lots of exciting talk. I'll jump back in the queue. Thanks for the time. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the mind of Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Stephen Byrd : Hey, good morning. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Good morning, Steve. Stephen Byrd : Wanted to talk through supply chain stresses. We regularly get questions just throughout the whole renewables value chain about, you know, shortages, cost increases, et cetera, and I respect that sort of the Northvolt agreement is one example of many ways that you've, you know, ensure availability. But, I guess, broadly put across, you know, solar, across the balance of system class stores, et cetera. Are you seeing any stresses on supply chain for you all any impacts from that broadly? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : No, that's a great question. And as you know, we've been, I think, always very concerned about this. You know, when we talk to, you know, beginning of last year, about COVID at the time, and we said look, you know, we were concerned about supply from Asia, and you know, the possible effects of COVID on the supply chain, even here in the States. So, you know, we've been on top of this. But right now we're not seeing any real supply constraints, whether it be on batteries, whether it be on solar panels, whether we see on wind turbines. However, if you look at the growth plans that are reflected in, for example, the Biden's renewable energy agenda. And you see what utilities are talking about, they're seeing a dramatic increase in demand. And we think that that could be a problem in the future. So we're getting out ahead of this. And, you know, I think, you know, it's not only the physical supplies that, you know, we're talking about. But it could be things like land, for example, you know, how many megawatts of readily available land is there to meet this great need. So right now, we're not seeing it safe. But we're on top of it. And that's what we're making the kind of strategic agreements like Northvolt. You know, expect more, I would say because that, we think, is a key element. And we expect this market to grow very rapidly. And we think you have to be thinking about that now, at all angles, whether it be people, you know, land interconnections? I don't see -- and I think we've spoken about it in the past, you know, energy storage, playing a role in eliminating transmission constraints. So that's an exciting new area that needs to be developed. And really, isn't that. So getting to your answer, we're not seeing it today. We're on top of it. I do expect there to be a pinch if sometime in the future, when I don't know, you know, going to be 12 months could be 18 months. But we're preparing for that possibility. Stephen Byrd : That's really helpful. And maybe shifting gears to 5B, you know, you've spoken about this before. You laid it out again today. And I'm just curious, your latest thoughts in terms of as you think about the growth of a 5B, whether that this is going to be is there a potential given just how beneficial this approach is that this is something that's similar to other technologies you develop that you can broadly monetize, broadly market and sell? Or is this something more for your own purposes over time? How like -- how broad could this be? And is this another candidate that could be monetized over time? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : You know I love the question. So you know, we've had -- my counting four unicorns, you know, small companies, in fact with more than $1 billion valuation. I think our secret sauce has been to buy small companies. And then some of them we bought for, you know, $20 million, $30 million, initial investment, and now are worth more than $1 billion. And what's the secret sauce? The secret sauce really is -- one, we give them a platform for massive expansion; two, we work with them to create new applications. So we're not just a client, it's like we are co-developing and creating new uses for this technology. So we allow it to grow fast, we allow it to grow new areas. But equally important, we're able to keep the entrepreneurial spirit of these businesses. So in other words, even though we're a big company, we make a real effort not to smother them, you know, and let them run as much as possible on their own. Now, we made a philosophical decision years ago, that just to use it on our own platform, while that gives us a temporary advantage limits the growth of this new technology. And, quite frankly, a lot of this has to do with massive buying them to really drive down costs. You know, energy storage is a lot cheaper today, because we massified it. You know, we're in 29 countries, we have 5.6 gigawatts in 29 countries that we either built, or we're providing control systems, you know, bidding platforms. So, that's -- you know, that's quite large and allows us to learn from that. So with 5B, it's the same. You know, we will have certain kind of exclusivity in certain markets. But, no, this will be available to the broader market overtime. So what we're doing with 5B is again, massive, buying it, proving it out. And then eventually, we will, it will be available to other players as well. So for example, today in Australia, other people are using 5B technology.  And I see it very similar to you know, our prior ventures, whether it be fluids, whether it be distributed energy that we have, whether it be up like [ph] that, you know, our philosophy is not just keep it to ourselves, just keep it to our own platform, but expand it more broadly. So, it's interesting; we make money but we make money for our shareholders in two ways. One is our platforms, which we are shifting from fossil fuels to renewables and there you can value us on cash flow, earnings per share et cetera. But at the same time we're creating value in these new technology companies, and those have a different valuation and the different value creation and that's why, selling to third parties is so important to maximize the value of them. Now the fact is that having the link between AES and these startups is key because as I said we mutually beneficial to create value. We help them grow. They help us to really be a leading-edge technology provider. If we didn't have the knowledge of batteries that we have, we wouldn't have done the budget deal. So there are two ways that we're creating value here with these new companies. Stephen Byrd : Really helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : The next question is from the line of David Peters from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. David Peters : Hey, good morning guys. I was just curious on the strategic alliance with Google, are you guys still working on similar agreements and locations beyond Virginia. I guess I'm just wondering how far you expect kind of the scope of that particular dealer Alliance to reach? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : What I can say is really that we had an initial agreement, which we had talked about that we really the sort of RFP for one gigawatt that has, I would say developed if you willing to the deal that we have announced. We expect to expansion of that energy provided over time as their needs grow and again, we have this unique product that we will offer to then and other clients at this stage in time. So that's all I really can say at this stage of the game. David Peters : Okay. And then maybe just on some of the other products you have in the works. Is there been any updates on the hydrogen study in Chile or we're in Vietnam, the LNG and CCGT projects, I guess since Investor Day. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Look regarding first the green hydrogen really green ammonia project in Chile. We continue to work with our partner on the feasibility study. So where it goes on and as I said, we'll probably have news before the end of the year one way or the other. So it's really a matter of, can we get the cost down to be competitive with grey or blue hydrogen products. So I'm optimistic, we're working hard, stay tuned. Regarding Vietnam. It's the same thing. We continue to work towards a new LNG terminal, which would be 450 or so Terra BTUs. So, more than double what we have between Panama and the Dominican Republic, and there is an associated 0.2 gig watts of combined cycle gas plants. So not that progress continues on that were part of the government's plan realize at this facility will avoid the construction of many, many coal plants, and I also mentioned that we will be as soon as feasible moving towards, providing green hydrogen, which basically means that it certified that it doesn't, it has less a certain amount of leakage from production to delivery, and we think that's very important to really reap the climate advantages of natural gas versus say other heavy fossil fuels. David Peters : Great, thank you for your time. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Charles Fishman from Morningstar. Please go ahead. Charles Fishman : Good morning, Andreas. I wanted to follow up on that Vietnam questions first of all recent strength then crude oil prices help you in the development of that project in Vietnam. I would think. I appreciate there is some coal plants there but it is in a lot of the competition, or at least that you'd be replacing residual fuel for power generation in that region. And yes the strength of the crude oil price help in that? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Our RLNG business is really tolling in Central America and the Caribbean. So we get a tolling fee. We're not taking direct commodity risk now of course the bigger the spread between Henry Hub and world oil prices especially WTI, the more tolling will do at the margins in a lot of these take-or-pay agreements. So what we've announced is take or pay. So we're not so directly affect but all things being equal, a bigger spread between natural gas and oil is favorable, will do at the margin, some more. In Vietnam this is a project which is very much needed because they had been relying on offshore gas and that's running out, so this will, it has an immediate demand unlike say Dominican Republic and Panama, where we had to develop to demand [ph]. So you have to bring in gas to feed the existing combined cycles. So I really don't see it as much as directly as oil price gas play. Again at the margin, you could have more industries converter more transportation convert to compressed natural gas or other forms, but not really. These were tolling agreements and in Vietnam, the demand is there, it doesn't have to be created but again, as [indiscernible]. Charles Fishman : As I recall, the Vietnam project doesn't enter into the 7.9% through 2025 that's really 25 events and beyond correct? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : That's correct? Charles Fishman : Okay, thank you. That's all I have. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like turn the conference back to Ahmed Pasha for closing comments. Please go ahead. Ahmed Pasha : Thank you everybody for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Thanks again and have a great day. Operator : Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect. Thank you.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ahmed Pasha, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ahmed Pasha : Thank you, Operator. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter 2021 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements, which are discussed in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can also be found on our website along with the presentation. Joining me this morning are Andr\u00e9s Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Gustavo Pimenta, our Chief Financial Officer and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will turn the call over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our second quarter financial review call. Today I will discuss our progress today on a number of key strategic objectives. Before turning the call over to our CFO, Gustavo Pimenta, to discuss our financial results in more detail. We had an excellent second quarter with a 24% increase in adjusted EPS from the second quarter of 2020. And a record 1.8 gigawatts of renewables under long-term contracts added to our backlog, bringing our total to 8.5 gigawatts. We remain on track to achieve 7% to 9% average annual growth in adjusted EPS and parent-free cash flow through 2025. I will give more color on our accomplishments while covering the following three themes shown on slide four. One, the growth and transformation of our U.S. utilities; two, our rapidly growing renewables business; and three, our strategic advantage from innovation. As you may recall, during our Investor Day in March, we outlined our plan to invest $2.3 billion to transform our two U.S. utilities, AES Ohio and AES Indiana. During the second quarter, we concluded key outstanding regulatory proceedings at both of our U.S. utilities, clearing the path for investment in the latest technologies, which will enable us to deliver a higher level of service and reduce carbon emissions. At the core of our efforts is a focus and deep understanding of the digital tools that vastly improve customer experience and enable the integration and orchestration of diverse and distributed renewable resources. Starting with AES Ohio on Slide five, where we expect to nearly double the rate base by growing 12% annually to 2025. Recently, we made a substantial headway on outstanding regulatory filings. First, the Commission approved as Ohio stipulation allowing predictable cash flows at investment in Smart Grid initiatives over the next four years. And second, AES Ohio also received approval for the FERC regulated formulary allowing recovery of transmission investments. Now moving on to AES Indiana on Slide six, where we're investing 1.5 billion over the next five years as part of our grid modernization program and our transition to more renewables-based generation. We recently received regulatory approval for our 195-megawatt Hardy Hills solar project. And we announced an agreement to acquire the Petersburg solar project, which includes 250 megawatts of solar and 100 megawatt hours of energy storage. We expect to grow the rate base at AES Indiana by more than 7% annually. With many of the key regulatory approvals behind us, we're now positioned to execute on our utility modernization and decarbonization programs, which have been years in the making. Now turning to the second theme of renewables growth on Slide seven, last year was a record-breaking year of renewable contracts for us with over three gigawatts sign. So far this year, we have already signed almost three gigawatts of contracts for wind, solar and energy storage, nearly double the amount at the same time last year. More than 90% of the new contracts are in the U.S. And we are well on our way towards achieving or exceeding our target of four gigawatts for 2021. At the same time, more than 80% are with C&I customers, negotiated on a bilateral basis. Our new projects will yield after tax returns at the project level, in line with our low teens average for the U.S. and mid to high teens internationally. Our progress so far this year, includes our recent agreement to acquire 612 megawatts of operating wind assets in New York, as shown on Slide eight. New York State's supportive renewables policies, combined with the scarcity of wind projects in the northeast, provides us with several pathways for long-term attractive cash flows to support repowering by 2025. This wind acquisition complements our solar and energy storage pipeline, providing us with another resource to offer diversified and differentiated products to our consumers. Turning to Slide nine, we're particularly pleased with our ability to advance new plant energy products. This year, we announced the world's first ever large scale 24/7 carbon free energy netted on an hourly basis, supplying Google's Virginia data centers. We see this concept of real-time renewable generation, as opposed to the purchase of offsetting renewable credits as the new highest standard in clean energy. We have since replicated similar structures with other large-scale customers, helping them to achieve their sustainability targets, while supporting our renewables growth goals, or a total of 1.5 gigawatts of these clean energy products signed or awarded thus far this year. We see these innovative carbon free energy products as examples of our unique advantages, both in our technical and commercial abilities, as well as our culture working together with customers to understand their specific needs. Turning to Slide 10, with nearly three gigawatts of renewables and energy storage project added this year, we now have a backlog of 8.5 gigawatts, including 2.5 gigawatts currently under construction. We expect to bring 1.4 gigawatts online during the remainder of 2021. The strength of our U.S. renewables growth in the rapidly expanding market will support achieving our goal of having 50% of our earnings from renewables and utilities and 50% of our earnings from the U.S. by 2025. We also continue to aggressively grow our pipeline of early mid and late stage development projects to support future growth. As you can see, on Slide 11, we now have a pipeline of 37 gigawatts among the largest in the world. More than 60% of this pipeline is in the U.S., including eight gigawatts in the hottest market in the country, California. Now to decarbonization on Slide 12. Last month, AES Andes announced a 1.1 gigawatts of coal-fired generation would be voluntarily retired as soon as January 2025. And will be replaced with 2.3 gigawatts of newly contracted renewables. Since 2017, we have announced the sale or retirement of almost 12 gigawatts of coal-fired generation, which is among the largest programs of any American company. I'm pleased to report that these exits along with our substantial renewable additions, [indiscernible] generation from coal to approximately 20% of total generation on a pro forma basis, an additional reduction of five percentage points since last quarter. I would like to address two key concerns that we're hearing from investors related to growth in renewables. Inflationary pressures and supply chain bottlenecks. As one of the largest global renewable developers with a strong reputation, we have a long history of successfully negotiating strategic supply agreements, resulting in preferential access and pricing. Furthermore, we lock in the hardware prices, when we sign the PPA, sheltering us from future price fluctuations, with 90% of the equipment needed for 8.5 gigawatts backlog already secured, we feel very comfortable in our ability to execute on our strong pipeline over the short and medium-term. Now turning to Slide 13, and a third theme of innovation. As our entire sector continues to rapidly evolve, we increasingly find that there is a competitive advantage for those who are able to effectively incorporate new technologies and business models. For example, we have benefited significantly from our energy storage business, which we started over 10 years ago, and which now is one of the largest in the industry. There are important synergies between our core businesses and technology ventures. For example, this year, about half of our renewable energy PPAs include an energy storage component. Last month, once again, we were awarded the highest honor in the power and utility sector, the Edison award from the Edison Electric Institute. For our work, developing energy storage, as a cost effective alternative to new gas peaking plants. Specifically, the award was for the AES Alamitos Battery Energy Storage System, consisting of 400 megawatt hours of energy storage, it can supply power to 10s of 1000s of homes in milliseconds. This is our seventh Edison award overall. And third U.S. Edison award over the last decade, I would like to note that we have won many more Edison awards than any other company in recent years. Turning to Slide 14, we also continue to build on our prior success in creating technology [unit growth] [ph]. For example, we have previously mentioned our strategic investment in 5B, a prefabricated solar solution company that has patented technology, allowing solar projects to be built in a third of the time and on half as much land while being resistant to hurricane force winds. We continue to grow 5Bs footprint across several markets, including the U.S., Puerto Rico, Chile and Panama. And they're now expanding into India, where we are working with domestic partners to establish local manufacturing. We hope India will enable 5B to reach a much greater scale much more quickly, which combined with our leading work in robotics construction, will help us lower all in solar costs, as we advance on the learning curve. Turning to Slide 15. Similarly, we continue to benefit from our investment in Uplight, which provides cloud-based energy efficiency solutions to more than 110 million households and businesses through its numerous utility customers, including AES Ohio and AES Indiana. In July, we closed the previously announced transaction with Schneider Electric, and a group of investors that valued Uplight at $1.5 billion. In conclusion, we're very pleased with our progress to-date, across all of our key strategic initiatives. Not only are we well positioned to achieve all of our financial goals but we are on track to hit our transformational targets of more than 50% of our earnings from renewables and utilities and more than 50% from the U.S., while having less than 10% of our generation from coal by 2025. I will now turn the call over to Gustavo Pimenta, our CFO. Gustavo Pimenta : Thank you, Andr\u00e9s and good morning everyone. As Andr\u00e9s mentioned, we are making excellent progress this year. Having already achieved significant milestones on our strategic and financial objectives. We are pleased to see the continued economic recovery across our markets driven by the reopening of local economies. In Latin America, many of our clients continue to benefit from records steel, copper and soybean prices, resulting in a significant improvement in electricity demand across our businesses. This also reflect in our day sales outstanding, which remain at a historically low levels. Turning to our financial results for the second quarter on Slide 17. Adjusted EPS was up 24% to $0.31, primarily reflecting execution on our growth plan, demand recovery at our U.S. utilities and parent interest savings. This positive drivers were partially offset by lower contributions from Chile and Brazil, and a slightly higher adjusted tax rate. Turning to Slide 18, adjusted pre-tax contribution or PTC was $303 million for the quarter, an increase of $65 million versus the second quarter of 2020. I will discuss the key drivers of our second quarter results in more detail beginning on Slide 19. In the U.S. and utilities strategic business units or SBU, PTC was up $71 million, driven primarily by the demand recovery that our utilities, higher contributions for about one gigawatts of new renewable assets and the commencement of power purchase agreements or PPAs at Southland Energy in California. Turning to Slide 20, we are very encouraged to see material recovery consistent demand at our U.S. utilities. For Q2 on a weather normalized basis, demand at AES Ohio is up 9% and demand at AES Indiana is up 4%. The net combined volume in Ohio and Indiana is largely back to 2019 pre-COVID levels. This recovery is mainly driven by higher load from commercial and industrial customers this year as a result of the reopening of local businesses. Separately in California, our 2.3 gigawatts Southland legacy units are well positioned to contribute to the state's pressing energy needs and its transition to a more sustainable carbon free future. In fact, the State Water Board is considering the California Energy Agency's recommendation for our 876-megawatt Redondo Beach facility to be extended for two years through 2023 to align with our remaining legacy units. This proposed expansion would be an upside to expectations for 2025. Now turning back to our quarterly results on Slide 21, at our South America SBU, lower PTC was mostly driven by recovery of expenses from customers in Chile in 2020. Lower equity earnings from workorder also in Chile and drier hydrology in Brazil. These impacts were partially offset by higher generation of the Chivor hydro plant in Colombia. Higher PTC at our Mexico, Central America and Caribbean or MCC SBU primarily reflects better hydrology in Panama, which was partially offset by the sale of Itabo in the Dominican Republic. Finally in Eurasia, PTC remained relatively flat. The impact from the sale of OPGC in India was largely offset by lower interest expense in Bulgaria. Turning to Slide 24, with our first half results, we are on track to achieve our full year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance of $1.50 to $1.58. As we have discussed in the past, our typical quarterly earnings profile was more back hand weighted with roughly 40% of earnings occurring in the first half of the year. But also in the year to go, we will be primarily driven by 1.4 gigawatts of new renewables assets coming online in the remainder of the year, continued demand recovery across all markets, reduced interest expense and cost savings benefits. We are also reaffirming our expected 7% to 9% average annual growth targets through 2025. Now turning to our credit profile on Slide 25, strong credit metrics remain one of our top priorities. In the last four years, we obtained two to three notches of upgrades from the three credit rating agencies, including investment grade ratings from Fitch and S&P. We are also very encouraged by the recent change in outlook to positive on our BA1 one rating at Moody's. These actions validate the strength of our business model and our commitment to improving our credit metrics. We expected positive momentum in these metrics to continue enabling us to reach BBB ratios by 2025. Now to our 2021 parent capital allocation plan on Slide 26, consistent with our private disclosures, sources shown on the left-hand side of the slide reflect approximately $2 billion of total discretionary cash. This includes $800 million of parent free cash flow, $100 million of proceeds received from the sale of the Itabo in the Dominican Republic and the successful issuance of the $1 billion of equity units in March. Now to uses on the right-hand side, we'll be returning $450 million to shareholders this year, consistent of our common share dividends and the coupon of the equity units. And we plan to invest approximately 1.4 billion to $1.5 billion in our subsidiaries, as we capitalize on attractive opportunities for growth. Approximately 60% of these investments are in global renewables, reflecting our success in originations during 2020 and our expectations for 2021. And about 25% of these investments are in our U.S. utilities to fund rate base growth with a continued focus on grid and fleet modernization. In the first half of the year, we invested approximately $700 million primarily in renewables, which is roughly 50% of our expected investments for the year. In summary, we are making significant progress on executing on the strategic and financial objectives, we laid out in our Investor Day in March positioning AES as the leader in the energy transition, while delivering superior returns to our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thank you, Gustavo. In summary, the world has decided to seriously tackle climate change. And this is driving unprecedented and accelerating growth in demand for renewables and energy efficiency applications and services. In relative terms, I don't believe anyone is better positioned than AES to capitalize on this once in a lifetime transformation of our sector. We have a proven track record of success, we have the most innovative new products and an 8.5 gigawatt backlog and the 37-gigawatt pipeline projects. All in all, we're enthusiastic about our future. And we will feel confident about delivering on our 7% to 9% average annual growth rate. Our core contracted generation and utility businesses have shown great resilience in the face of global and regional effects of COVID. Beyond our robust growth rates in earnings and cash flow from our core businesses, we are creating very significant value for our shareholders through our technology joint ventures. There has never been a better time for AES. With that, I would like to open up the call for questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Julien Dumoulin Smith from Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin Smith : Congratulations on developments year-to-date. I am very curious on the latest on the battery business and some of the strategic angles you're thinking about here. Can you talk about what's evolved around Fluence given the latest comments here? And then also at the same time, can you comment a little bit on the storage availability, I know you all have been making or taking some preemptive actions to ensure continued supply availability. But if you can comment on the latest backdrop would very much appreciated. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Sure. Well, good morning, Julien. There's not too much I can comment other than the statement in our press release. In the past, I've talked about it that ensuring supply was very important to us and we have mentioned the strategic arrangement with Northvolt for European supply. So as I said in the call today, overall we feel very good about being able to have access to the equipment we need for our growth program, but I really can't comment much more on Fluence at this time. Ahmed Pasha : Julien, are you there? Operator : Julien, your line is still open. The next question comes from Angie Storozynski from Evercore ISI. Angie Storozynski : So I'm just wondering, what is the reason for this acceleration in the renewable power generation that we're seeing year-to-date? Is it just because you're increasingly focused on C&I customers? Hence the higher than expected backlog year-to-date? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Hi, Angie. That's a great question. I would say yes, as you can see, where we're focusing a lot on C&I. We have come up with innovative products, like the around the clock, carbon free energy. So as we mentioned in my speech, we have 1.5 gigawatts of new contracts just coming from similar products, to the one that we had announced with Google. So certainly, that is a big driver. The other thing of course, is we have a good pipeline of potential projects. So we're just finding that we're working very well with our clients, we have many repeat clients in terms of signing on new deals. So this second quarter was particularly strong in the U.S. And we see that as the most rapidly growing market. We're very well placed. So we feel good about it, we feel good about the product offerings that we have -- we feel good about our customer relations, and we feel good about our supply chain. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And secondly, I mean, it seems like you guys are starting to do projects, which I mean, you don't typically pursue like repowering of the wind farms in New York State, or the acquisition of renewable assets in Indiana from NextEra. I mean, is it just because, those are opportunistic deals that offer highest returns and those are not that traditional ground mount solar installations that you would physically pursue? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Look, we're focused on satisfying our customers' needs, in this particular case, yes, Indiana. So if there was a better project in MISO that we need to put together to meet our transition towards more renewables. We will take it. So in many of our deals, we use a lot of required additionality. So we're building most of them. But there's no problem with acquiring somebody else's project to get the optimal mix from a risk. And also, I'd say production capability. So first, that's something that's inherent in our product offering. So we're really trying to solve the client's need. It's much less about sort of RFPs and busbar PPAs, that's what we're going after. In the case of New York, look, look, we don't have a lot of wind assets of ourselves. Other people have done a lot of wind assets repowering. We think this is an idea that the time has come with the technology. So we're doing some repowering on our old wind farms. But we saw this is a great opportunity in New York to repower. And again, this comes back to the idea that we want a mix of assets; wind, solar, energy storage, in some cases, even small hydro's to be able to deliver those sort of round the clock renewables. So think of it that way that, we're solving for what the customer wants. And we'll put the package of sources, whether we build them or we buy somebody else's project to satisfy that. Angie Storozynski : Yes, very good. Again, an incredible start of the year. Thank you. Operator : And the next question comes from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI. Durgesh Chopra : Andr\u00e9s, I appreciate you can't say much about points, but maybe I'm just kind of curious on the timing of the announcement here. So QIA sort of made their investment late last year. Are you seeing more growth opportunity, just walk us through some of your thought process and why now versus wait a couple of years, just anything along those lines? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Honestly, I can't comment much on it. What I can refer you to what I've said in the past. And with QIA, I would say it's just not a financial investor. It's a strategic investment, which has investments in other very important companies, which can help this business. So I'll have to limit my comments to that, and I'm sorry. Durgesh Chopra : Okay. We'll leave that. Maybe just shifting gears to Chile. The last time, I remember there were some legislations on early retirements, you guys have kind of retired your coal plants. Can you talk about your exposure there as a percentage of the company as a whole, post the announcement of these coal retirements? And do you see any risks to margins and cash flow there in July? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Look, overall, Chile is maybe like 15%. Remember that's AES Andes includes Colombia and includes 100%, renewable hydro in Colombia. AES Andes has done a remarkable transformation in terms of being a primarily coal -- contracted coal generator into by 2025, having very little coal. And a lot of green blend and extent, so this really gave us an in, was the ability to modify those contracts. So that a large proportion, if not, the majority of the energy would come from new contracted renewables, and you keep the coal for capacity. So this is, again, quite a remarkable transformation. So the last thing I would say is, regarding the potential legislation that's been -- I think, it's really, Chile is a serious country, they're really looking at how the grid can maintain its reliability with the retirement of these coal plants. So what we said is, look, we are willing to retire these plants, as soon as 2025 is really to give the grid operator the opportunity to have -- to ensure a reliable grid, we can shut them down sooner from our perspective. So I don't see, everything that we're doing is in our forecast, I'll pass it to Gustavo to make some more comments. Gustavo Pimenta : Yes. I guess I think the one thing that I would add is, after they announced retirement, the latest one that we've done, we are left with just two facilities for green blend and extend and retirement. So it's about 800 megawatt left and everything else has been announced. We've been able to implement green blend and an extent. So it's a substantially smaller share of where we were in there a couple years ago. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. Sounds like a small portion of EBITDA cashflow, earnings, whatever comes from [July] [ph] post these retirements. Okay, thanks, guys. Great execution in the backlog and congratulations on getting [indiscernible] on the Board here. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Biju Perincheril with Susquehanna. Biju Perincheril : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Andr\u00e9s, you touched on some of the supply chain concerns, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about, how you might be impacted from the Hoshin, WRO, and maybe some of the steps you're taking to mitigate that impact? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes, great question. Look, some of you, who follow us for a while, we're always very paranoid about our supply chain. That's why I think it was January of '20 -- February of 2020. We were talking about supply chain issues with COVID and how we're going to get ahead of it. So here, we've also been on top of this, they're obviously in the past year, there were supply chain issues with, imports, what was going to be the tariff on panels from China. And then, what was going to be the tariff, for example, on aluminum. So, could you manufacture locally? So we've been on top of this issue. So today, I'd say all of our solar panels coming into the states are not coming in from China, they're coming in from Malaysia. We do buy some U.S. panels as well, which are non-polysilicon. We're also working with top-notch -- only top-notch panel manufacturers, first tier and getting certificate so that none of the polysilicon comes from Hoshin, they could be associated in any way with forced labor. So that's where we are. This is a developing story. In the past what we've been able to do with the tariffs for example is to move panels that were coming to the stage, for example to Chile, and vice versa, to optimize the supply chain, so which quite frankly worked out very well. So if you look at what we're doing. We are certainly in solar, one of the top five, I would say in the country, in terms of new solar development. So we're very well positioned. We're on top of that. We have longstanding agreements and our suppliers are doing everything possible. I think I could add that in the future, we're going to -- we're making sure that the polysilicon would come from alternative sources like Germany or Korea. So that's in the works. But this does take a transition. So we're on top of that. And stay tuned, because, while we feel very good about our certification and all the rest it's a question of where does that polysilicon arrive? Can you prove it? So again, we are having as extensive affidavits from our suppliers as anybody on this matter. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ahmed Pasha for any closing. Ahmed Pasha : Thanks everybody, for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any follow up questions you may have. Thanks and have a nice day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, and welcome to AES Corporation third quarter 2021, final review. My name is Juan, and I will be coordinating your call today. [Operator Instructions] I will now hand over to your host, Ahmed Pasha, Global Treasurer, Vice President of Investor Relations to begin with. Ahmed, please go ahead. Ahmed Pasha : Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to our Third Quarter 2021 Financial Review Call. Our press release, presentation, and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements, which are discussed in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website, along with the presentation. Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Coughlin, our Chief Financial Officer, and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will turn the call over to Andres. Andres. Andres Gluski : Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our third quarter financial review call. Before discussing our progress since our last call, I want to introduce our new Chief Financial Officer, Steve Coughlin. Steve has been with AES for 14 years and has served in a variety of roles, including as CEO of Fluence, and most recently, as head of both Strategy and Financial Planning. I am happy to report that we're making excellent progress on our strategic and financial goals. And remain on track to deliver on our 7% to 9% annualized growth in adjusted EPS and parent-free cash flow through 2025. We had a strong third quarter with adjusted EPS of $0.5 and 19% increase versus the same quarter last year. We expect to deliver on our full-year guidance, even with a $0.07 non-cash impact from an updated accounting interpretation related to the equity units of a convert we issued earlier this year. Steve will provide more details shortly. Today I will discuss both the growth in our core business, as well as the strategy and evolution of our innovation business, called AES Next. We see ourselves as the leading integrator of new technologies. The two parts of our portfolio are mutually beneficial to one another and enabled us to deliver greater total returns to our shareholders. More specifically, and as we have proven, our core business platforms provide the optimal environment for exponentially growing technology startups. At the same time, our AES Next businesses provide us with unique capabilities that enable us to offer customers the differentiated products they seek to achieve their sustainability goals. Turning to slide 4, I will provide you with an update on our core business, including our growth in renewable, and an update on the overall macroeconomic environment. Beginning with renewables : we continue to see great momentum in demand overall. As we speak, we have senior members of our team attending a COP26 Climate Conference in Glasgow, meeting with governments, organizations, and potential customers. Since our last call in August, we have signed an additional 1.1 gigawatts of renewable PPAs, bringing our year-to-date total to 4 gigawatts. Additionally, we are in very advanced discussions for another 850 megawatts of wind, solar, and energy storage. Based on our current progress, we now expect to sign at least 5 gigawatts this year, versus our prior expectations of 4 gigawatts. This represents the largest addition in our history, and 66% more than in 2020. With our pipeline of 38 gigawatts of potential projects, including ten gigawatts that are ready to bid in the U.S. we are well-positioned to capitalize on this substantial opportunity. Our success is a result of our strategy of working with our clients on long-term contracts that provide customized solutions for their specific energy and sustainability goals. As such, almost 90% of our new business has been from bilateral negotiating contracts with corporate customers. This allowed us to compete on what we do best. Providing differentiated, innovative solutions. One example of our work with major technology companies to provide competitively priced renewable energy netted on an hour-by-hour basis. As we announced earlier this week, we signed a 15-year agreement to provide around the clock renewable energy to power Microsoft's data centers in Virginia. Year-to-date, we have signed almost two gigawatts of similarly structured contracts with a number of tech companies, integrating a mix of renewable sources and energy storage. Outside the U.S., we have a similar strategy of focusing on bilateral sales with corporate customers, which has enabled us to sign long-term U.S. dollar-denominated contracts with investment-grade customers. For example, in Brazil, we see demand for more than 25 gigawatts of renewables, providing a significant opportunity to earn mid to high-teen returns in U.S. dollars. While at the same time, diversifying our Brazilian portfolio of mostly hydro generation. To that end, for the first time ever in Brazil, we are in very advanced negotiations to sign a 300-megawatt U.S. dollar-denominated contract with a large multinational corporation for 15 years. Turning to Slide 5, our backlog of 9.2 gigawatts, is the largest ever, with 60% in the U.S. These projects represent one of the main drivers for our growth through 2025, and beyond. With this pace of growth, we are laser-focused on ensuring that we have adequate and reliable supply chains. For several years, we have anticipated a boom in renewable development that could potentially lead to inadequate panel supply, and as such, we took preemptive measures to ensure supply chain flexibility. Despite current challenges in the market, we have non-Chinese panels secured for the majority of our backlog, which is expected to come online through 2024. We have benefited from a number of strategic relationships with various suppliers and a clear advantage stemming from our scale and visibility of our pipeline. More generally, we continue to proactively manage potential macroeconomic headwinds. Including inflation and commodity prices. As part of our efforts to de -risk our portfolio over the past decade, we have taken a systematic approach to risk management. In fact, in places where we use fuel it is mostly a pass-through, and therefore we have limited exposure to changes in commodity prices. Furthermore, more than 80% of our adjusted pre -tax contribution is in U.S. dollars, insulating us from fluctuations in foreign currencies. We not only remain committed to achieving our long-term adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow targets, but we also continue to improve our credit metrics, are on track to achieve triple-B ratings from all agencies by 2025. Now to slide 6, we continue to benefit from a virtual cycle with our corporate customers, in which our ability to provide innovative solutions leads to more opportunities for collaboration and more projects. For example, this quarter we announced a partnership with Google, to provide our utility customers cost savings and energy efficiency features. As well as opportunities to accelerate their own clean energy goals through Nest Thermostats. Moving to Slide 7, through AES Next, we integrate new technologies to bring innovation to the industry and work with existing and new customers. AES Next operates as a separate unit within AES, where we develop and incubate new businesses, including a combination of strategic investments and internally developed businesses, representing approximately $50 million of growth capital annually. As I mentioned, the combination of AES Next and our core business, creates the optimal environment for growth, whereby we can better create solutions for customers by utilizing our industry insights and operating platforms. One example of this mutually beneficial arrangement is in the combinations of renewables plus storage. We first combined solar and storage in 2018 in Hawaii. And today, nearly half of our renewable PPAs have an energy storage component. Another example is 5B, a prefabricated solar solution Company that has patented technology, allowing projects to be built in a third of the time, and on half as much land while being resistant to hurricane force winds. We see 5B technology as a source of current and future competitive advantage for years. Allowing us to build more projects in places where there is a land scarcity, constraints around height or soil disruption, or hurricane risk. Likewise, 5G benefits greatly from the ability to grow rapidly on our platform. And we are currently developing projects in the U.S., Puerto Rico, Chile, Panama, and India. I am highlighting the AES Next portion of our business because it is increasingly clear that AES essentially has 2 distinct business models that add value to our shareholders in very different ways. With our core business, we continue to measure our success through growth in adjusted EPS and parent-free cash flow, as well PPA signed. With AES Next, these businesses contribute value creation through their extremely rapid growth in valuation, with the potential for future monetization. Nonetheless, they are a drag on AES earnings during their ramp up phase. In 2021, this drag on earnings is expected to be approximately $0.06 per share. We assume these losses from AES Next in our 2021 guidance, and our 7% to 9% annualized growth rate, through 2025. Turning to slide eight, as you know, last week Fluence, our energy storage joint venture with Seasons, which began as a small business within AES, became a publicly listed Company with the current valuation of around 6 billion. Similarly, early this year, another AES Next business offline received evaluation in a private transaction of 1.5 billion. The value of our interest in these two businesses is now at least $2.5 billion or $3 per share compared to the book value of our investments of approximately a $150 million. In my view, this massive shareholder value creation more than justifies the temporary negative impact to earnings. In summary, our strategy of being the leading integrator of new technologies on our platform has yielded great results. And we have several other innovations in development under AES Next. As they mature, we will continue to take actions to accelerate our growth and so their value. With that, I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Steve Coughlin. Steve Coughlin : Thank you, Andres and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to participate in my first earnings call as CFO of AES. I have been at AES for 14 years, and feel very fortunate to work at a Company that is transforming the electric sector so profoundly along so many talented people in finance and throughout the Company. With our strategic and financial progress to date, AES is well-positioned to continue leading this transformation. In my previous role, I led corporate strategy and financial planning, where we developed our plan to get to greater than 50% renewable, at least 50% of our business in the U.S., and to reduce our coal share to less than 10% by 2025. All while growing the Company 7% to 9%. We are committed to those goals, and I look forward to continue executing toward them. Before I dive into our financial performance, I want to discuss the adjustment to our accounting that we made this quarter relating to the treatment of the $1 billion in equity units we issued in the first quarter this year. Our prior guidance assume that the underlying shares would not be included in our Fully diluted share count until 2024 upon settlement of the equity units. This approach was in line with industry practice, and supported by our interpretation of the accounting literature, and our external auditors. However, we're now subject to an updated interpretation of these instruments and we are adjusting to include these shares in our fully diluted EPS calculations.  This adjustment results in an annual impact of roughly $0.07 this year and $0.09 in 2022 and 2023 using a full-year of an additional 40 million shares. It's important to keep in mind that this adjustment has no cash impact, and has absolutely no impact on our business or longer-term growth rates, as we had included the underlying shares in our projections for 2024, and beyond. Prior to this adjustment, we had expected to be in the upper half of our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range, but we now expect to be at the low-end of the range. Now, I'd like to cover two important topics. Our performance during the third quarter and our capital allocation plan. Turning to slide 11, you can see the strong performance of our portfolio in this quarter. Adjusted EPS was $0.50 for the quarter versus $0.42 for the comparable quarter last year. This 19% increase was primarily driven by improvements at our operating businesses, new renewables, and parent interest savings. These positive drivers were partially offset by lower contributions from South America, largely due to unscheduled outages in Chile. Third quarter results also reflect an approximate $0.03 quarter-to-date impact from the higher share count due to the inclusion of $40 million additional weighted average shares relating to the equity units as I just mentioned. Turning to Slide 12, adjusted pre -tax contribution, or PTC, was $428 million for the quarter, an increase of $97 million versus third quarter of 2020. I'll cover our results by strategic business unit over the next 4 slides, beginning on Slide 13. In the U.S. in utilities SBU, PTC increased $69 million as a result of our continued progress in growing our U.S. footprint. The improvement was largely driven by higher contributions from Southland, which benefited from higher contracted prices, new renewables coming online at AES Clean Energy, and higher availability at AES Puerto Rico. In California, our 2.3-gigawatts Southland Legacy portfolio demonstrated its critical importance by continuing to meet the State's pressing energy needs. And it transitioned to a more sustainable carbon-free future. In fact, as you may have heard, last month the State Water Resources Control Board unanimously approved an extension of our 876 megawatt Redondo Beach facility for two years through 2023 to align with our remaining legacy units. If the demand supply situation remains tight, some of our Legacy portfolio could be available to meet California 's energy needs beyond 2023 if State energy official determine a need. Although we have not assumed this in our guidance. As you can see on Slide 14, at our South America SBU, lower PTC was primarily driven by unscheduled outages in Chile, due to a blade defect impacting 6 turbines across our fleet that has now largely been resolved. Our third quarter results were also driven by lower hydrology in Brazil. Before moving to MCAC, I would like to provide an update on the 531 megawatt Alto Maipo hydro project, owned by a subsidiary of AES Andes in Chile. Construction continues to go well, and generation is expected to begin in December of this year, with full commercial operation of the plant expected in the first half of 2022, in line with our expectations. Alto Maipo is in discussions with its non-recourse lenders to restructure its debt to achieve a more sustainable and flexible capital structure for the long term. AES Andy's has honored its equity commitments to Alto Alto Maipo and will not be assuming any additional equity obligations. We expect this restructuring to be completed in 2022. And AF Andy's already assumed zero cash flow from Alto Maipo. So we don't see the restructuring impacting our guidance. Now, turning back to our third-quarter results on slide 15, the higher PTC at our MCAC SBU primarily reflects higher LNG sales in Dominican Republic and demand recovery in Panama. And finally, in Eurasia, as shown on Slide 16, higher results reflect improved operating performance in Bulgaria. Now to Slide 17. To summarize our performance in the first 3 quarters of the year, we earned adjusted EPS of $1.07 versus $0.96 last year. As I mentioned earlier, in terms of our full-year guidance, we are incorporating the $0.07 per share non-cash impact from the adjustment for the equity units issued earlier this year. Prior to this adjustment, we had expected to be in the upper half of our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range. But we now expect to come in at the lower end of the range of $1.50 to $1.58. It's important to note that this adjustment does not affect our longer-term growth expectations, and has no impact on our cash flow. With 3/4 of the year behind us, our year-to-go results will benefit from contributions for new renewables, continued demand recovery across our markets, reduced interest expense, and our cost savings programs. These positive drivers are offset by the impacts of the higher share count and the dilution from AES Next, as Andres discussed earlier. Now, turning to our 2021 parent capital allocation on Slide 18, Beginning on the left hand of the slide, and consistent with our prior disclosure, we expect approximately $2 billion of discretionary cash this year. We remain confident in our parent-free cash flow target midpoint of $800 million, and the $100 million from the sale of Itabo. And we received the $1 billion of proceeds from the equity units issued in March. Moving over to the right-hand side, the uses are largely on the strength -- unchanged from the last quarter, with $450 million in returns to our shareholders this year, consisting of our common share dividend and a coupon on the equity units. We also continue to expect almost $1.5 billion of investment in our subsidiaries, with about 60% going towards renewables globally. Our investment program continue to be heavily weighted to the U.S. with approximately 70% targeted for our U.S. businesses. The increased focus on U.S. investments will contribute to our goal of growing the proportion of earnings from the U.S. to at least 1/2 of our base. Finally, as I ramp up in my new role, I've had the chance to speak with many of our internal and external stakeholders. It's clear that AES continues to successfully execute on our strategy, and we've remained resilient in the face of volatile macroeconomic conditions. Continuing to drive the successful execution and delivering on our financial goals is my top priority. I look forward to getting input from more of our investors and analysts, and providing the information you need to understand the great future ahead for AES. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres. Andres Gluski : Thank you, Steve. In summary, we have had a strong third quarter with both our core business and AES Next doing well. We're increasing our target for science renewable PPAs from 4 gigawatts to 5 gigawatts, and Fluence successfully completed its $6 billion IPO. We remain committed to delivering on our strategic and financial goals, including our 7% to 9% annualized growth rate in earnings and cash flow, and will continue to create greater shareholder value by being the leading integrator of new technologies. With that, I would like to open up the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Greg Chamberlain from JP Morgan. Please reach out, your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to start with the equity units change here. We look to offset any of the $0.09 impacts to '22 or '23, and just thinking about the incremental positives after the Analyst Day this year, such as the higher renewable signings and the Redondo extension. How do you see all of that shaking out with the latest change here? Andres Gluski : Well, as you know we have a work portfolio, and so we have pluses and minus. Overall it's a portfolio that had shown it's great resilience over the last two years. So right now we're not ready to give guidance for next year. But we're committed to the 7% to 9% growth rates in earnings and free cash flow. So we'll be getting back to you on that. But as you correctly point out, there are positives. And then we have the drag of the additional shares. And we will be working with that. I'd say overall, we feel we're in an excellent position. We had a very strong quarter and year-to-date. One of the things I'd like to highlight is, that we had a design malfunction in our steam turbines in Chile. And this required them to undergo maintenance at 50,000 hours, instead of 100,000 hours. And this happened during the worst drought in Chile's history. We were short energy when energy prices were high. But nonetheless, if it weren't for the accounting, we would have been well within the mid or upper region of our earnings. So this is the way that our portfolio works. I don't know, Steve, you want to add something? Steve Coughlin : Sure, no -- thanks, Andres. And thanks for the question. As I said in my script, this is recalculation, so it's just a different denominator on the capital, on the equity units that we raised earlier this year. It's purely just math, frankly. And looking ahead, we do see we have many levers, as Andres said. so we're fully committed to the 7% to 9%. These shares were already incorporated as of 2024, so it has no impact on that longer-term growth rate. And then, looking ahead, we have a number of value accretive opportunities in the portfolio. So we're in the midst of our planning process at this point and we'll give 2022 guidance in February. But we feel very confident in the overall growth rate and there's definitely things that we can do to stay within -- stay within that range going forward. Unidentified Analyst : Understood. Thank you for the color there. And then maybe just switching gears to the C&I side of the progress shown with the Microsoft deal. Curious if you could speak a little bit to the 2 gigawatts you cited at similarly structured solutions signed year-to-date, how that compares to initial expectations. And then just broadly, any near term limitations to your ability to further rollout this around the clock product to just how you think about scalability there overall. Thank you. Andres Gluski : Sure. I think we're rolling it out very well. We have said, from the beginning when we did the first Google one, that this was a product that was -- there was a lot of interest from other large corporate customers. We feel good that this is not the last deal we'll do. I think, the key here is the ability to provide around the clock, and so this is 100% renewable for 15 years. So the product keeps getting more sophisticate. Now, to do that, you need to be able to model all possible situations in a given area of service, integrating also batteries and different forms of renewable power. So we've been very flexible on that. We're very excited about that, and we see additional opportunities going forward. I think as we mentioned, 90% of the deals we have signed, in the last year-to-date, have been with corporate customers. And so we really see this type of structured project -- product really being a competitive advantage for us. So stay tuned. We think there's a -- something that we've been talking about. We're really seeing it come to fruition. Unidentified Analyst : Understood. Thank you for the time today. Thank you. The next question comes from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI. Please, Durgesh, your line is now open. Durgesh Chopra : Hey, good morning, Andres and Steve. Welcome and I look forward to working with you. A couple of questions from my end. First, just, Andres you made that comment, that majority of the backlog to 2024 is now secured. Can I just ask you to clarify when you say that, that means wind, solar, storage, everything? Andres Gluski : No, we were basically talking about solar panels, but we also have the balance of plan. So we feel very secured about it. But the one that's been, let's say, more in the press and more top of mind for everybody, has been solar panels. We very early on, started switching buying from Chinese panels to buying panels made in Malaysia, Vietnam, and in the future, Cambodia. And we've also, I think, been leaders in getting our suppliers to certify that there's no, let's say, poly silicon coming from Western China in the -- that could be questionable in terms of the labor practices. So we feel very comfortable. We have the supplies. We have flexibility. And we're also buying a number of U.S. panels made in the U.S. so -- without polysilicone by the by the way. So altogether we feel very comfortable that we have enough to meet our backlog to 2024, and that includes the balance of the plant, and that includes a batteries. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. I mean, I guess in the last quarter, Andres, you'd mentioned something around maybe 90% of the equipment needed for your then-stated backlog of like, I think it was 8.5 gigawatts. Are you in that similar percentage wise for this updated 9.2 gigawatt number? Andres Gluski : Yes. Durgesh Chopra : Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then just, obviously, great execution 5-gigawatts year-to-date. You have a target of 3 to 4, going to 5 up to 2025, right? Like 5-gigawatts a year to 2025. So as you have this momentum, can you talk about your margins, profitability, cash returns of your seen cost pressures? Andres Gluski : Sure, great question. Look, we are achieving -- targeting and achieving low teen returns in the U.S. And we are targeting and achieving mid to higher teens outside of the U.S. Those are the -- those are really our hurdle rates that we are achieving, we feel very good about that. Now, realizing that there's a lag between signing a PPA and commissioning the project, so this year, we'll commission north of 1.5 gigawatts, maybe as high as 2. Next year, we should be somewhere between 3.5 and 4 gigawatts. This momentum will continue. We see -- it's not just the number of megawatts, we have to make sure that we're earning, on average, the right returns. Durgesh Chopra : Perfect. Thanks for the time, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Peters from [Indiscernible]. Please, David, go ahead. David Peters : Hey, good morning, guys. Andres Gluski : Good morning. David Peters : Back to the different accounting treatment for the equity units, you guys made the point to mention that it was consistent with other peers and the auditors had signed off. I'm wondering what specifically changed that you are now subject to this new interpretation? Steve Coughlin : Yes. This is Steve. I'm happy to describe it in a little more detail. We issued the $1 billion equity units back in March. And as I said, it was -- the treatment that we use was very well vetted by our accountants, by our external auditors, and to external advisors. at that point, we were using a treasury stock method for the treatment, so it didn't show up in the shared account. So there's a number of companies that have used similar instruments, and in consultation with our auditors, SEC had done a review of the treatment of these types of instruments, and has informed our auditors that they see a different interpretation. So, although we haven't had direct communications with the SEC, we felt it was most prudent that we go ahead and update the interpretation. So we're really just taking the prudent course of action here. This conversion was already assumed in the 2024 share count, so it's just an interim impact to the calculation. There's no new transaction here. It's just this recalculation of the shares. Ultimately, that's the source of it and we're trying to be as prudent as we can in terms of the treatment. David Peters : Great. I appreciate the detail there. Another question I had, switching gears, and appreciate the slide in the deck that you -- showing the value you've created through Fluence and Uplight, and, I guess, now that Fluence is public, would be a little bit more curious to hear about Uplight in terms of how you think about the value of that Company today versus when you got the value mark and going forward? Particularly because, I think, I just saw that Uplight completed an acquisition recently? Andres Gluski : Thanks for the question. Look, we see Uplight,in the terms of its maturity, two to three years behind Fluence. But we're very happy with the progress that up Uplight has made and very happy with what we've done with AES Next. Because, if you look at our capital contribution and today's valuation, that's a 20-X. So that's -- some of this has been in -- even though we were working for example, on batteries for a long time, but really in terms of having a business, it's been roughly about three years -- 3, 4 years. This has created a lot a lot of value for our shareholders. And it's very interesting because there's two sides of the business. The AES Next is really a value play, especially during this rapid growth phase because you have to expense a lot of your investments really. But at the same time, they are helping us grow. When you talk about the structured products that we're selling to corporations, having AES Next and the know-how from there, has been extremely helpful. As I said, stay tuned, we have others in the works. The most mature probably is 5B. We think 5B has a lot of potential because of what it offers. It offers speed of build, it offers less use of land, and hurricane resistant is very important. Hurricane wind resistant is very important. So we're very happy with the progress there and very happy about the relationship between the AES core business and AES Next. David Peters : Great. And then just last one quickly, just a point of clarification. You said AES Next was roughly at the $0.06 drag today. But as we get out into the outer years of your plan, I guess '24 and '25, are you expecting it to be contributing at that point or would it still be a drag? Steve Coughlin : Yeah. No. No, we are. So I mean, I think there's a near-term dilution around of a similar level, say for 2022 and then that gradually reduces. And so by 2024, '25, we're expecting positive contributions and then significant acceleration in the positive contribution from that point. David Peters : Great. Thank you guys. Andres Gluski : Thank you Operator : Thank you David. The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Please Julien. Your line is now open. Julien Dumoulin Smith : Hey, good morning team. Congratulations on everything. Well done. To come back to this AES Next -- again, kudos there. As you guys think about the drag here, you talked about '21 having $0.06 drag. Through the '25 period here, how are you thinking about the cadence of that drag to evolve here? By the timing of '25, what is that reflected in your expectations here? And then, maybe, I'll throw in another nuanced EPS questions. When you're -- when you're thinking about the converts here, obviously you were able to offset that and be at the top end of '21. What does that say about by the time you get to 25, considering that the converts admittedly would've been sort of effectively fully diluted by then in terms of where you stand within your range as well. Again, give us a backdrop of all your successes, be it origination or otherwise. Andres Gluski : Sure. Steve and I will answer this one. Let me take the second one, so it's definitely within our 25 numbers, because it was assumed that they would convert until the stat was the share count. So what is different is that we have a higher share count, '21, '22, and '23. That is the only difference in these calculations regarding AES Next, the one that's producing the largest drag is Fluence, quite frankly in Fluence, as it matures. And it's made all these investments in new designs, in gearing up to be able to meet that supply, in terms of guaranteeing supply of batteries around the world. And as sales increase, this will, I would say, gradually turn positive. And Steve, you want to mention -- Steve Coughlin : Obviously, as Andres said, I lead Fluence for its first 2.5 years, so I'm very familiar with the Company and its trajectory. And look the opportunity for Fluence has gotten massive, more massive than even we predicted when I started there. Going out and raising this capital was clearly targeted to go big and go much bigger. And so this, in some ways, what it does is it increases the near-term dilution deliberately because we're investing to accelerate the scale of the Company. And we know that it can be successful if we accelerate. But it's also then significantly increasing the upside when you get out into 24-25 period. Putting this capital to work is going to be near-term dilutive, but it's tremendously value accretive. And we've already seen some recognition of that in where it is today. And we think it's only going to go significantly upward from here. In our numbers, it turns positive, and it turns significantly positive by 2025. Julien Dumoulin Smith : And that significantly positive, is reflected in that 25 number today? Want to understand how much of the earnings [Indiscernible] Steve Coughlin : Yeah. Yeah. It is reflected, and I would say, it comes -- from the level of dilution today, it's going to flip flop to being at least that level positive by that point. Julien Dumoulin Smith : And we say at least that level positive that is AES Next in entirety, right? Not just look. Steve Coughlin : Yeah, I think Fluence will be at that point. Uplight will have grown too, but I would expect Fluence would likely be a few ahead be the largest driver, but I would say at least $0.06 positive from Next, by 2025. Julien Dumoulin Smith : Right. Okay. Got it. Excellent. Thank you for the clarity there. And then if I can just -- more strategic question here also against your backdrop of 25 numbers. California extension, you've only reflected this new numbers through -- you haven't reflected this through 2025. That seems like a further upside whether it's Redondo or the entirety of the Legacy portfolio. And then ultimately you -- just when you think about the portfolio all together at this possible transition, again, kudos on transition, how are you thinking about some of the lingering assets and especially some of the renewed interest across the marketplace city for instance LNG? Steve Coughlin : I will take the Southland question and then I'll turn it over to Andres, but that's correct, Julien. The Southland extension is -- the Redondo extension provide some upside. We had the Alamitos Huntington Beach, through 2023. We have the recent decision that's now upside for Redondo beach. But at this point, everything is just through 2023, and not beyond that. So the extent, there's an opportunity beyond that that would be upside to our guidance. And in addition, this year in the third quarter, we've seen in the numbers, we had the margin favorability from the hedges. There -- those legacy assets are quite valuable and we see the potential for further Q3 value recognition in our assets, which would also be upside into the guidance going forward. Andres Gluski : Julien, regarding the LNG. We have a very strong position in the Gulf of Mexico, between the Dominican Republic and Panama. We have basically been contracting much more in terms of the Dominican Republic filling up the second tank, and the Panama filling up the first tank. So we see LNG as a necessary transition fuel. And I think what we're seeing a little bit in Europe and a little bit in China. It's very important to manage this transition. So while we were coming up with new technologies, making it possible to put more renewables on the grid, make renewable cheaper, make them more efficient and satisfy more what customers want. We see that in some -- many places, LNG natural gas is the necessary transition fuel. These two will work together. And as we said, we are on our way to filling up our full capacity of the two locations of the three tanks. Julien Dumoulin Smith : Got it. So it sounds like literally and perhaps figuratively, you haven't quite filled the tank on the incremental contribution from LNG or California when it comes to '25 yet, but there's more go. Andres Gluski : Yes. That's right. That's right. There's still more potential. Quite frankly, that's the most profitable thing we can do, is to fill up an existing tank. Julien Dumoulin Smith : Yeah. Actually guys. Thank you. Best of luck. Andres Gluski : Thank you Julien. Steve Coughlin : Thanks, Julien. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Stephen Byrd, from Morgan Stanley. Please Stephen, your line is now open. Stephen Byrd : Thanks very much and congrats on a very constructive update here. Andres Gluski : Thank you, Steve, and -- go ahead. Stephen Byrd : Yes, Sir. I wanted to explore the Google Nest agreement and talk a little bit more about the magnitude if you could, and repeatability of that approach? it looks like a great solution where you can bring a lot of your skills to bear, to provide some value, but I'm struggling thinking about how to try to assess the magnitude of the opportunity here. Andres Gluski : Well, this is through Uplight. And Uplight has been -- I believe the biggest seller of Nest in the U.S. because it reaches around 100 million final consumers in the U.S. So the idea is to continue to add on that platform more things, and improve customers experience, and customers capabilities of improving their energy efficiency use. Now, of course, Uplight works through large utilities. That's really how it goes. I think, there is a lot of opportunity there. I agree with that. And what Uplight has been doing is acquiring additional capabilities by some of these acquisitions, adding onto that platform. It's really using that platform, using that entry, into final consumers to provide additional value-add services. Stephen Byrd : Understood. And is there a way to think about that value in terms of the per customer value, or some other metric, in terms of the benefit that utilities would receive from the kinds of services you provide here? Andres Gluski : I don't have that available right now. I think the way to think about it, is this is the value of the total Uplight platform. And as you know, we partnered with Schneider Electric to have more capabilities, with more acquisitions. and we're working very closely with our utility customers. So I think the way this value will be reflected and captured, is through the value of Uplight. And as I said, I think it's 2-3 years behind Fluence in terms of its evolution. Stephen Byrd : Okay. Very clear. And then just last question for me, just on LNG. You've been making great progress, you just described on Julien 's question, you're moving towards filling up a number of these resources. I was thinking once they're essentially filled to the capacity that you've targeted, they're fairly mature assets at that point and there might be a more logical owner with a fairly low discount rate at that point once they're mature. Are these good monetization assets when they're mature? The reasons you kind of see further option value essentially around these assets longer-term? Andres Gluski : I think, 2 things : As you know, we are growing very rapidly in renewables. We have plans to sell down coal. So we will continue to manage this portfolio to optimize its value for our shareholders, and we'll see how that develops. Right now, our focus is really on filling up the gas tanks. Stephen Byrd : Okay. Understood. Thank you very much. Andres Gluski : Thanks, Steve. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We currently have no further questions. I would like to hand over to Ahmed Pasha for any final remarks. Ahmed Pasha : Thank you. Thanks everybody for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Next week, we look forward to seeing many of you at the EEI Conference. Thanks again. And have a nice day. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you so much for joining. You may now disconnect your lines and have a great rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, and welcome to today's AES Corporation Q4 2021 Financial Review. My name is Bailey, and I will be the moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to pass the conference over to Ahmed Pasha, Global Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations. Ahmed, please go ahead. Ahmed Pasha : Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements, which are discussed in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website along with the presentation. Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Coughlin, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will turn the call over to Andres. Andres? Andres Gluski : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial review call. Today, I will cover our full year results and discuss our strategy and areas of focus for this year. Before discussing our 2021 results and future plans, I want to state that we do not see any significant impact on our portfolio from the outbreak of hostility in the Ukraine. Nonetheless, our thoughts and prayers go out to the Ukrainian people and government, and we hope for a speedy return to peace. Now turning our focus back to our business. Today marks an important and exciting milestone for AES with the announcement of our intention to fully exit coal by year-end 2025. This accelerated goal is a result of our success in growing our renewables portfolio. And our backlog gives us the confidence to take this step. As a leader in the global energy transition, we are committed to the goals of the Paris Agreement in achieving a net-zero economy. We will work with our stakeholders to ensure a smooth transition while meeting our regulatory obligations. Our exit from coal will be modestly dilutive, but we feel comfortable with our growth trajectory. And accordingly, we are reaffirming our annualized growth target of 7% to 9% in earnings and cash flow through 2025. Now moving on to our 2021 results and accomplishments. First, I am pleased to report our financial results, including adjusted earnings per share of $1.52, which was in line with our expectations. Our 2021 parent free cash flow of $839 million exceeded our expected range of $775 million to $825 million. Second, we signed contracts for 5 gigawatts of new renewable projects, significantly above our target of 3 to 4 gigawatts that we set last year. In fact, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, AES signed more renewable deals with corporate customers in 2021 than anyone else in the world. Included in these deals were two groundbreaking arrangements to provide renewable energy on an hour-by-hour basis, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week signed with Google and Microsoft. Third, Fluence successfully completed their IPO in November and have no foreseeable need for external funding to achieve their strategic and financial objectives. Furthermore, Fluence has made progress towards mitigating the supply chain challenges they have faced, which I shall discuss shortly. Finally, safety is our most important value. I am very proud to report that our safety performance in 2021 was the best in our 40-year history, with no major incidents recorded among roughly 25,000 AES people, contractors and construction workers. Today, I will be discussing two things : first, executing today; and second, investing for the future. Beginning with executing today on Slide 4. Even as we are transitioning to a carbon-free future, we are laser-focused on delivering on our commitments. Our business model has proven itself to be resilient and enables us to deliver predictable results. For example, 85% of our adjusted PTC is from long-term contracted generation and utilities and 88% is in U.S. dollars, with the remaining 12% split between euros and various Latin American currencies. Similarly, we're largely insulated from macroeconomic headwinds, such as rising inflation and interest rates. As shown on Slide 5, 83% of our revenue is from businesses that have indexation clauses or are hedged to limit the impact from inflation. At the same time, almost 90% of our interest rate exposure is fixed or hedged, protecting us from the impact of rising interest rates. Next, turning to Slide 6. In January, we completed a tender to acquire the publicly-traded shares of AES Andes, bringing our ownership from 67% to 99% today. This was motivated by our conviction in the underlying strength of the business, which is highly contracted, predominantly in U.S. dollars and transitioning to low-carbon generation. This transaction is immediately earnings and cash flow accretive. Moving to Slide 7. We now have a backlog of 9.2 gigawatts, including the 5 gigawatts we signed in 2021. About 3/4 of the 5 gigawatts is in the U.S., with the vast majority signed with C&I customers and to grow the rate base at our AES Indiana utility. We have secured supply arrangements for the bulk of our current backlog. In 2021, we successfully added 2.1 gigawatts to our portfolio without any material delays or cost overrun. This execution demonstrates the robust nature of our supply chain and the strength of our relationships with our suppliers. For example, we secured Samsung battery for many of our new energy storage facilities to alleviate some of the supply chain challenges faced by Fluence. Being able to switch to different battery suppliers shows the inherent flexibility of their Gen 6 product. As we look towards our 2.3 gigawatts of new projects coming online in 2022, two-third of which is in the U.S., we do not expect any significant delays or supply chain disruptions. We remain confident in our ability to complete our projects under construction on time and on budget. Moving to our second theme, investing for the future on Slide 8. Our actions today ensure that we will be able to take full advantage of the unprecedented transformation of our sector. One clear example is the 5 gigawatts of new PPAs that we signed last year, an increase of 65% from 2020. For full year '22, we expect to sign 4.5 to 5.5 gigawatts of new renewables under long-term contracts. We are seeing strong demand for renewables. And so far this year, we have already signed more than 600 megawatts of new contracts. We expect our portfolio of operating renewable assets to more than double from approximately 13 gigawatts to 26 gigawatts by 2026. Despite any current headwinds for our sector, such as delays in legislation and supply chain issues, we see very strong demand for low-carbon energy, especially for tailored products, such as our 24/7 renewable offering. That is why we have been investing in growing our pipeline of future projects to ensure that we're able to meet our customers' growing demand for AES services. As you can see on Slide 9, we now have a development pipeline of 59 gigawatts, which we believe is the second largest among U.S. renewable developers. Our pipeline includes almost 10 gigawatts in the U.S. that are ready to bid. This robust pipeline provides us with the projects we need to deliver on our backlog and to continue to build on our competitive position in the U.S. As a result, we're accelerating our goal of increasing the proportion of earnings coming from our U.S. businesses to 50% by two years from 2025 to 2023. We are also investing for the future by growing the rate base at our U.S. utilities by 9% annually, while delivering safe, reliable and affordable services to our customers. As you can see on Slide 10, AES Indiana is executing on the approved plan to retire two coal units, which we will replace with nearly 500 megawatts of new renewable generation. We have already started our next integrated resource plan process, which could include additional retirement or fuel conversions for the remaining 1 gigawatt of coal generation. At AES Ohio, we're executing on our smart grid and transmission investment programs approved in 2021. AES Ohio is also in the midst of a distribution rate case and recently completed the hearing. AES Ohio's base distribution rates have been the lowest in the state for the past five years. In fact, as of the end of 2021, AES Ohio's rates were 16% lower than the next lowest utility in the state and even with the requested rate increase, would remain the lowest. Turning to Slide 11. Another way we're investing for the future is by developing and incubating new products and businesses' platforms through AES Next. Our investment in AES Next help our core businesses be more innovative and competitive and drive value for our customers and shareholders. Turning to Slide 12. The most mature initiative under AES Next today is Fluence, the leading energy storage technology company. In 2021, Fluence completed their IPO with $1 billion in capital raised to invest in developing their products and supply chain as well as their digital platform. As of December 31, Fluence had 4.2 gigawatts of energy storage products deployed and contracted and a signed backlog of $1.9 billion. Additionally, Fluence's digital platform, Fluence IQ, now has 6 gigawatts contracted, of which more than 80% is with third-party customers. Over the past several months, Fluence has been dealing with short-term challenges stemming from COVID-19-related supply chain issues. Their management team has taken proactive actions to address these challenges, including diversifying battery suppliers, signing and shipping agreements and building out their in-house supply chain team. Overall, demand for energy storage remains robust, and Fluence is well positioned as a market leader. We see significant opportunity for them to continue to grow and remain confident that they will execute on their long-term plan, which will deliver value to their shareholders. AES Next is also working to develop and incubate other technologies that help accelerate the deployment of renewables, as shown on Slide 13. One example is our investment in 5B, which has a prefabricated solar solution called MAVERICK, that is hurricane wind-resistant and allows projects to be built in 1/3 of the time and on 1/2 as much land. This innovative product is currently being rolled out in Australia, Chile, the Dominican Republic, India, Panama and the U.S. Turning to Slide 14. We're one of a small number of company in our sector with targets that are fully aligned with the Paris Agreement according to the Transition Pathway Initiative. We already have a goal to have net-zero emissions from electricity by 2040. And as I mentioned earlier, we're excited to announce our intent to exit coal completely by the end of 2025, subject to receiving necessary approvals. We expect to achieve this objective through a combination of retirement, fuel conversions and asset sales. In summary, we have consolidated our position as a leader of innovation in the industry and accelerated the decarbonization of our portfolio, while delivering attractive returns to our shareholders. With that, I now turn the call over to our CFO, Steve Coughlin. Steve Coughlin : Thank you, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover the following key topics : our financial performance during 2021, our parent capital allocation and our 2022 guidance and expectations through 2025. As Andres mentioned, our results for 2021 show our continued progress in leading the energy transition, while achieving our financial goals. We delivered strong financial results even while absorbing the previously discussed impact from the share count adjustment related to the equity units issued last year. Overall, the strong growth of our core energy business, which includes generation and utilities, gives us confidence that we will continue to achieve our earnings and cash flow target. Turning to Slide 16. Full year 2021 adjusted EPS was $1.52, $0.08 higher than 2020. 2020 adjusted EPS of $1.44 included $0.03 of dilution from AES Next, implying that our core business generated adjusted EPS of $1.47. In 2021, our core business grew by $0.21 to $1.68, primarily as a result of higher contributions from new renewables businesses, improved operations at both U.S. generation and MCAC and lower parent interest. Our 2021 results of $1.52 include the $0.07 impact due to a higher share count as a result of the accounting adjustment for the equity unit and the dilution from AES Next where we are investing in expanding our high-growth technology businesses. The impact from ASX Next was $0.03 higher than our prior expectation due to the nonrecurring COVID-related supply chain issues at Fluence. Going forward, we plan to manage the AES Next portfolio such that these businesses will yield a neutral to positive contribution to AES' earnings by 2024. Turning to Slide 17. Adjusted pretax contribution or PTC was $1.4 billion for the year, an increase of $171 million and 14% growth over 2020. I'll cover our results in more detail over the next 4 slides, beginning with the U.S. and Utilities SBU on Slide 18. Our increased investments in the U.S. show PTC growth of $155 million, a 31% increase over 2020. As of year-end 2021, the U.S. represented 41% of our adjusted PTC, up from 34% in 2020. About half of this growth was driven by new businesses at AES Clean Energy that came online in 2021. And the rest of the increase was from our legacy Southland units, which remained a key contributor to the stability of the California grid during the peak summer season and delivered solid growth from increased dispatch and attractive market prices. We continue to see the potential for some of our legacy Southland units to support the energy transition in California for several years to come. Lower PTC at our South America SBU was primarily driven by regulatory adjustments and recovery of expenses from customers that were recorded in 2020. Hydrology was not a major driver as we benefited from the increased diversity of our generation portfolio and favorable hydrological conditions in Colombia offset drier conditions in Brazil. Higher PTC at our MCAC SBU reflects higher LNG sales in both Panama and the Dominican Republic as we benefited from higher contract levels at our LNG terminals. We now have roughly 80% of our LNG capacity contracted, leaving approximately $20 million to $30 million of potential annual upside to our longer-term expectations. Finally, in Eurasia, higher PTC was primarily driven by higher contributions from Bulgaria due to improved operating performance at Maritza and increased revenue at our wind farm, which benefited from favorable market prices. Now let's turn to review of how we allocated our capital in 2021 on Slide 22. Beginning on the left-hand side, sources reflect $2.3 billion of total discretionary cash. And I'm pleased to report that this includes parent free cash flow of $839 million, which exceeded the top end of our guidance expectations. The remaining sources are largely in line with our prior disclosures except the $295 million in temporary drawings under our revolver, which we utilized to fund our accelerating growth in clean energy. Moving to the uses on the right-hand side. We allocated $450 million of our discretionary cash to our dividend. We invested nearly $1.8 billion in our subsidiaries, of which approximately two-third was in the U.S. As Andres mentioned, we expect the relative share of our allocation for the U.S. to continue to grow. And I'm glad to report that we now expect to reach our goal of 50% of our earnings coming from the U.S. in 2023, two years earlier than our previous target in 2025. Now turning to our credit profile on Slide 23. As a result of the successful execution of our strategy over the last few years, our balance sheet continues to be in a much stronger position. We significantly reduced debt while growing our parent free cash flow. At the end of 2021, our parent free cash flow to net debt ratio was approximately 23%, which is well above the 20% threshold required for an investment-grade rating. We expect this ratio to continue to improve over time putting us in BBB territory by 2025. We are in active discussions with Moody's and remain optimistic that we will be upgraded this year. Turning to our guidance and expectations beginning on Slide 24. We are reaffirming our annualized growth target of 7% to 9% in both adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow through 2025 off a base year of 2020. Today, we are initiating guidance for 2022 adjusted EPS of $1.55 to $1.65. Key drivers of our expected growth include the approximate $0.09 benefit from our higher ownership of AES Andes, which we increased to 99%, as Andres mentioned earlier. This transaction is immediately significantly accretive on both an earnings and cash flow basis. And with a simplified shareholder base, AES Andes will be able to more efficiently execute on its substantial renewables pipeline. Our adjusted - our 2022 adjusted EPS will also benefit from continued growth in renewables and higher contributions from existing operations, adding $0.10. This growth is expected to be partially offset by $0.11 of impacts from the higher adjusted tax rate, a full year of a higher share count due to the accounting adjustment for the equity units issued in 2021 and assumed dilution from planned asset sales. Our target for this year has increased to reflect our efforts to further decarbonize and fully exit coal by the end of 2025. I would also note that we previously expected the pending distribution rate case at DPL to be resolved earlier in the year. However, we now expect resolution later this year and, therefore, have assumed only a small contribution in 2022. Turning to Slide 25. Parent free cash flow for 2022 is expected to be $860 million to $910 million, in line with our annualized growth target of 7% to 9%. Now turning to our 2022 parent capital allocation plan on Slide 26. Beginning with approximately $1.5 billion of sources on the left-hand side, in addition to parent free cash flow, we expect to generate $500 million to $700 million in asset sale proceeds. Roughly half of this is from already announced sales in Vietnam and Jordan, and the remaining portion is expected to come from additional asset sales that have not yet been announced. Recycling of capital is an integral part of our capital allocation framework. And as we have done in the past, we will deploy asset sale proceeds to achieve our strategic objectives and maximize shareholder value. Now to the uses on the right-hand side. We expect to allocate $494 million to our shareholder dividend, which reflects our announced 5% increase. We are also projecting investments of roughly $1 billion in our subsidiaries for growth, of which about 3/4 will be allocated to the U.S. to renewables and utilities. Finally, turning to our 4-year capital allocation plan through 2025 beginning on Slide 27. Our financial strategy is centered around maintaining a strong investment-grade rated balance sheet, while investing in our growth to achieve our strategic and financial objectives. Our total growth investments for 2022 through 2025 have increased to $3.8 billion. We expect to continue to increase our dividend 4% to 6% annually, in line with our prior guidance. As you can see on Slide 28, we plan to fund this $6 billion with 60% parent free cash flow and the remaining 40% will be from asset sale proceeds and future parent debt issuances. Relative to our prior plan, you may notice that we have increased asset sale proceeds by $500 million and future parent debt by $300 million, which will be utilized to fund our future growth and repay drawings on our revolver that funded the higher growth from 2021. In summary, we accelerated AES growth in 2021 and executed on our financial and strategic commitments. Going forward, we will continue to deliver on our strategy, including executing on asset sales to decarbonize and exit coal, maintaining the strength of our balance sheet and allocating capital to maximize per share value for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres. Andres Gluski : Thank you, Steve. As you can see, we're not only delivering on our commitments, but accelerating our transformation. Our near-term actions will enable us to achieve our three goals for creating additional shareholder value : first, attaining an investment-grade rating from Moody's in 2022; second, increasing the proportion of earnings from the U.S. to 50% by 2023; and third, exiting coal generation by the end of 2025. With that, I'd like to open up the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] So our first question today comes from Angie Storozynski from Seaport. Angie, please go ahead. Your line is now open. Angie Storozynski : So my first question, and I see your disclosures on sensitivities, but I'm just wondering if you could describe the impact of the higher power price environment that we're seeing pretty much everywhere in the world on your both existing assets and growth prospects. I mean any sort of increased economic dispatch and how - and the appeal of renewables and how those are embedded in your '22 guidance and long-term growth. Andres Gluski : Angie, thank you. Basically, as you know, we're highly contracted. But what we're seeing in terms of higher prices for oil-based generation in many of our markets that favors us because we're much more hydro renewables and even coal. In places like where we have a big plant in Europe and Bulgaria, our plant is now very much cheaper than the other generations in the country. So we're seeing improved prospects for a lot of our generation because we are not a big generator using international price gas. Most of our gas units are running on Henry Hub or almost all. So we're basically competing against those very high prices. So even though we're highly contracted, there's always some margin, so that's positive. It's also positive on the renewable front and on the innovative front because I think people are seeing that renewables in an environment where gas prices can be more volatile is favorable. So in the net-net, overall, it's positive for us in the short run and certainly even more so in the long run because, as I said, we're highly contracted. Angie Storozynski : Okay. Just one follow-up. How about the LNG business? Is there any near-term or longer-term impact? Andres Gluski : Well, we're contracted now in Panama and the Dominican Republic. Basically, it had Henry Hub, Henry Hub plus, of course. So it's favorable to us in that prospect. Now when those contracts burn off in a couple of years, then we have to see when the recontracting levels will be. And hopefully, there will be more supply of gas at that point in time. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And just one other question. So you show the impact - the drag on earnings from asset sales. If you could comment a little bit, does that include any of those accelerated coal plant shutdowns or sales? Again, I'm just trying to reconcile the earnings impact with the transactions already announced. Andres Gluski : Go, Steve. Steve Coughlin : Yes. Angie, this is Steve. So yes, I mean, we are - consistent with the announcement to exit coal, we are increasing our total asset sale plan to $1 billion and then have increased the sales target this year to $500 million to $700 million. So yes, it does reflect in part the announcement that we made today. We had prior announcements in the past about Vietnam and Jordan. So that's a portion of it. But the additional portion reflects the updated strategy to accelerate our exit. Andres Gluski : Just to be clear, it's fully reflected. So some of it has been included in the past. It reflects 100% of the additional. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And my last question on Ohio, a delay in resolution of your rate case. Is there - I mean, is there something that we should be concerned about? Or is this just that the process takes longer? Ahmed Pasha : Sure. Angie, this is Ahmed. I think no, I don't think there's - it's a process because previously, we were hoping to settle. And now we are going through - because we could not reach this settlement, although the staff had recommended a reasonable increase in response to our request. And one of the intervenors OCC subsequently argued that the rate freeze should remain intact. And now we are going through the litigation process. But we think our request is fair. And is driven by the costs which are out of our control. And frankly, primarily to deliver the more reliable and economic power to our customers. So we think we will get through this by mid this year with the approval from the commission. So net-net, our rates are the lowest in the state and will remain lowest with this requested increase. So we feel pretty good that commission will approve our request by mid- to late '22. Andres Gluski : So in summary, it's just a timing issue. Ahmed Pasha : Yes. Steve Coughlin : Yes. It's the timing. And in fact, the PUCO staff did support an increase as part of the process already. Ahmed Pasha : Yes, they did recommend. Operator : The next question today comes from Rich Sunderland from JPMorgan. Rich, please go ahead. Your line is now open. RichSunderland: Maybe starting on 2022 guidance. Could you walk from the outlook a year ago at the Investor Day to now in terms of AES Next, the rate case and other factors separate from the equity units issue you called out in terms of changes from the 7% to 9% growth rate versus the growth embedded in the current guidance? Steve Coughlin : Yes. Sure. This is Steve. So really, the two primary drivers - well, a couple. So our growth is faster. So we've accelerated our renewables growth. Now that's been offset by the additional share count, of course, which we talked about last year. Now again, we took advantage of the value opportunity with Andes. So we've largely offset the share price - share count dilution with our acquisition of the additional shares in Andes. So really, what's been changed on a net basis is more on the asset sale program, which we just talked about and how we are accelerating our decarbonization and our exit of coal. And then the other real driver is the - is what we also just talked about, which is the DPL rates, which we previously assumed would be in effect early this year and now are assuming late this year. So those are really the two primary drivers. And then there is an uptick in the tax rate from the past. At this point, we're guiding to 26% to 28% on the tax rate. So that's a piece of the story as well. RichSunderland: Understood. So then just kind of walking forward in terms of regaining the 7% to 9% trajectory in the second half of the plan, I guess you called out the rate cases and timing factor. Could you just speak a little bit more to how you see the growth coming to kind of regain the 7% to 9% earnings trajectory? Andres Gluski : Sure. This is Andres. I'll give a sort of high level. Look, we have a backlog of 9.2 gigawatts of projects. This year, we'll be commissioning 2.3 gigawatts. So obviously, in a steady state, these two have to be about equal. And so what you're going to have is a real pickup in commissionings '23, '24 going forward. So we feel very confident about that because those are already signed projects. We already have the sites, and it's a question of executing on building them. The other one is that we expect AES Next, as Steve mentioned, is going to be neutral to positive by 2024. So that's a driver as well. So the drivers are our growth, which is part of our backlog, what we're talking about. And then we're also talking about the other things you mentioned, DPL rate case in IPL. Again, when we build all the wind and rate base that as well, you have the smart grid and DPL. So our growth projections are based on things that we have in the bag. RichSunderland: Understood. And just one more for me. The unannounced asset sales, the incremental portion versus the prior plan, is that solely related to the coal exit? Or is there anything else you're looking at maybe LNG or elsewhere? Andres Gluski : Look, we tend not to talk about exact assets that we're going to sell. As you know, we've been always turning capital. We've made a major transformation of our portfolio. I can think back, we peaked at probably 22,000 megawatts of coal. We're down to 7. We have basically sales for three of those, so we're down to 4. So yes, part of it is selling those coal assets, but also the continual churn that we have. So it might include other assets. We don't like to comment on them. But we will be hitting our 50% U.S., 50% renewables on an accelerated basis. And those sales help us achieve those goals. Operator : The next question today comes from Insoo Kim from Goldman Sachs. Insoo, please go ahead. Your line is now open. Insoo Kim : My first question, going back to that 9.2 gigawatts of backlog, it seems unchanged from the amount you've set out in the third quarter earnings. Just wondering if there's any read-through in the current inflationary environment, at least just for this year with any resistance or unwillingness for additional contracts to be signed for now. Andres Gluski : That's a good question. No, we're not seeing that at all. We're seeing strong demand. I mean, of course, if the backlog remains constant. Yes, we commissioned quite a lot of projects between the third quarter and now. So already this year, we have 600 megawatts of new PPAs signed in the - under AES Clean Energy. We're seeing strong demand, especially for our tailored projects. So no, I don't think there's - what we're seeing in the market is, again, especially for differentiated products, there's a lot of demand. It's a matter of being able to have all the projects, let's say, in pipeline to be able to meet that demand, meet the structured product that they want. I would say that, yes, PPA prices are going up to reflect the increase in prices. But as you know, we've handled the supply constraints. First, I would say the importing of solar panels from China, PV panels from China, that we were able to first move out of China. And then second, we're diversifying the source of our polysilicon away from China as well. And so we're not seeing that as a constraint. As we said, we have an inventory, everything that we need to fulfill certainly this year's construction and also already assigned a lot of the backlog. So we feel we're in a good position. Steve Coughlin : I would just also add on the number specifically. So as you've said, as Andres alluded to, there are subtractions coming from that backlog. So as we're completing construction, completing acquisitions, so it's about 1.5 gigawatts that we actually pulled out of the backlog because of completion. So net, there's significant additions going into. Insoo Kim : Okay. That's both good color there. And maybe, Andres, just a broader question for you. I think three key points that you guys made on this call, the accelerated collection plan, the U.S. earnings being 50% earlier and then the IG plan. Those are all definitely good strategies. But I guess when we think about the investor base and how over the past few years the structure of growing EPS and having consistent dividend, all of that to mirror kind of a utility-like structure, I think it served you well as you've consistently executed at least over the past few years. Just wondering that when you think about strategy and the cost benefit of the actions you're taking on the asset sales and whatnot, maybe having a near-term dilutive impact, I just wonder - just wondering your strategy on that going forward and whether that's worth taking the hit now versus kind of trying to make a more consistent or a predictable growth profile. Andres Gluski : Well, that's a great question. Look, we are laser-focused on delivering on our commitments. So we haven't changed our growth profile. Maybe to some extent, a little bit back-end loaded because of the dilution that we're putting in for earlier sales. However, I think this strategy has served us well. We've gone from a 2,200 megawatts of coal to completely exit by the end of 2025. And we think that's what a lot of new investors will like. So we think we'll have the triple investment-grade. We have a growing dividend. We are continually derisking as we get out. We are more concentrated in the U.S. and more concentrated on renewables. So we think this will be a company that will attract new additional shareholders and continue to serve our existing shareholders as well. Operator : Our next question today comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Julien, please go ahead. Your line is now open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Perfect. So just a couple of follow-up items here, if I can. So when you talk about asset sales, but more specifically driving to a neutral to positive outcome for AES Next, I mean, how does one do that? Are further divestments and sell-downs of your stakes part of how you manage those earnings? Or is this really about managing it organically to make sure that whether it's Fluence or other pieces of the business, they ultimately all cohesively drive an inflection in earnings contribution here in that '24 time frame? I just want to clarify that. Andres Gluski : Yes. No, that is organic. We expect the business to turn around. A lot of what have occurred this year is onetime related to COVID, both on the supply chain. And that, of course, includes shipping as well. So we expect the business to turn around. As they said on their call, they expect to be at a gross margin run rate by the fourth quarter. And so we will hold them accountable for that and - through the board, and we continue to innovate together. So both the big companies are Fluence and Uplight, and we expect them both to execute on their plans, and that is inorganic. Again, what we're mentioning is that we always have many levers to pull. So what we're saying is by 2024, this will be positive or - neutral at worst and hopefully positive. Steve Coughlin : Yes. And I would just add, Julien, if you think about the state of these businesses, they're investing in their product development and in their market expansion, the Digital IQ for Fluence, for example. So you'd expect them to be bottom line losses at this point of their life cycle. And as Andres said, they have a plan to get back to the gross margin targets by the fourth quarter. And then with the added volume, as that grows and the top line has been very successful, as the volume and the margin grows, then the bottom line of that business will overcome its R&D and G&A costs and get to a positive place. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And if I can come back to one of the underlying points. Obviously, you have a long-term earnings trajectory and growth in '22 is a little bit slower than that trajectory would otherwise indicate. So If you will, there's got to be a pickup at some point here. You've talked about some of the timing-related issues specifically in '22. How do you think about that sort of inflection in that catch-up period? Is there a bigger step-up in, say, '23 or '24? Just curious about the sort of the profile against that average CAGR number you threw out there? Andres Gluski : Of course, we can't guide to '23, '24 specifically. But obviously, if you look at the number of PPAs we have signed, which will come online in '23, '24, that's the big driver behind that. If you also look at the rate cases we have in the utilities in the U.S., that's a big driver of that as well. So that's a pickup. I mean, realize that for '22, we're also making up for the change in how it is accounting, the accounting issue that we had for the share count. So actually, we are more than delivering on what we had set out, say, two years ago. So we're making up a $0.09 hit for this year based solely on how you account for the number of shares. Steve Coughlin : Yes. And I think in addition to that, the opportunity to take advantage of the value in AES Andes and increasing the shares, that was significantly earnings and cash accretive immediately and will continue to be. So that's a big help to us, too. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: In fact, if I may, and again, I know you don't want to provide longer-term guidance, but given what you just said a moment ago and you offset some of the '22 impacts that are somewhat technical here. I mean to what extent could we expect an extension or acceleration, if you will, implicitly, given what your success is on renewables, the ability to drive that cash up against your 7% to 9% in the later years? And what that means for sort of an exit rate trajectory subsequent to - in '25 and beyond? Do you get what I'm saying? If the plan is that sort of way what does that mean about the longer term? Andres Gluski : Well, again, we're very optimistic about the longer term. We feel we're in the right place in the market. We have differentiated products. We have - are growing very fast in renewables. We're in the right markets. And we have upside potential from projects like in green hydrogen. We have a number of projects that we're progressing there. I think something that will give us additional juice is the pass of the climate plus plan, which will clarify what are the various subsidies or, if you want, tax percentages, tax - ITC, PTC, et cetera. So once that's clarified, that could give us upside. And then also, as Steve mentioned in his speech, a greater use of our facilities in Southern California, longer - and extension of it, which looks technically possible. So there certainly are upsides from that. What we're doing is saying, based on the situation that we're in today, this is our plan. Ahmed Pasha : The only thing I would - Julien, I would add, this is Ahmed, is that back in March last year at our Investor Day, we had already assumed significant dilution because we said our goal is to go below 10% coal by '25. So our growth rate already had embedded at that time decent dilution. We showed that roughly $0.30 at that time. So I think now we are saying we are down to 0. So I think we - and the factors that we've discussed today, the positive things that go in our favor, like increased share in AES Andes, accelerated growth in renewables, things like that will help us offset that. So we don't expect any hockey stick, if you wish, type profile if that's - that was your question. Steve Coughlin : And the share count change was baked in, Julien, to '24 and '25. So that's relative to the near-term guidance that's having a disproportionate effect on '22 and '23. But as of '24, those shares were assumed to be converted anyway, so they're already baked in. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. Clearly. But again, you give me no reason to be less confident here. Operator : The next question today comes from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI. Durgesh, please go ahead. Your line is now open. Durgesh Chopra : I want to go back to the renewal backlog. And I think Steve, you said, I mean, the projects that were completed and taken out and then a few new adds. But there's a fair bit of gas in that 9.2 gigawatt number. Can you elaborate what - those are gas-fired plants? Or those are LNG projects? What does that comprise of? Steve Coughlin : Yes. So we do have - so we have the project that we acquired in Panama in those numbers, the Gatun project is included. Otherwise, it's renewables. Andres Gluski : And just to state, we own 25% of the gas project in Panama. So actually, we own higher percentages of the renewables. Steve Coughlin : Yes. Yes, the whole amount is reflected here. But yes, from an economic standpoint, we have more of the renewables. Durgesh Chopra : Okay. And maybe I could just follow up with Ahmed on that. Okay. And then just can you talk about sort of how should we think about the financial impacts if any of the community energy acquisition, I mean, in terms of financing costs and things like that on 2022 guidance and future earnings projections? Andres Gluski : Yes. The community - look, we've grown our AES Clean Energy very quickly. We've merged our sPower with Distributed Energy. And then we've also acquired Community Energy. Now Community Energy comes with a pipeline of 10 gigawatts and 70 seasoned professionals. So it was very important at this time of rapid growth to have, first, the people, and second, the pipeline. So that's going to help our growth. Now in terms of their projects, when those will be offered to our customers and come online, they didn't - no backlog is coming from Community Energy. But certainly, we think that we can get better financing terms and better costs for equipment and improve execution. So that's upside from that. So I don't know if that answers your question. But basically, they're now part of that unit. And what they've done is help us accelerate that growth. Operator : The next question today comes from Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Stephen, please go ahead. Your line is now open. Stephen Byrd : I wanted to first just talk about Chile and just wondered if you could expand a bit on the dialogue you've had with the Chilean government in terms of helping the nation to decarbonize and pursuing green ammonia and just a little bit more color on the nature of that dialogue. Andres Gluski : Sure. Well, let's see, we know the new President, Boric, through the Council of Americas. We know about him. I would say that it's very much aligned with our plans because he wants to continue to decarbonize the mining sector. That would fit in well with our project to supply the mining sector with hydrogen fuel for their large machinery. Also, it fits in very well with our planned shutdowns of our coal plants and the replacement for - with our pipeline of renewables. So I think we're very much aligned with that plan. And I think he wants to increase and accelerate the carbon tax. So we don't see - our contracts have pass-throughs for the higher carbon tax in most cases. And our renewables would benefit from it. So we felt there was a tremendous opportunity at AES Andes. And we're rolling a lot of new technology out in Chile in terms of batteries, in terms of the MAVERICK product for 5B. We have, we believe, the most efficient solar farm in the world. It's close to 38% in Chile. So we have a lot of good things happening in Chile, which weren't reflected in the market price. And in terms of the government, our plans are very much aligned with what they want to achieve. Stephen Byrd : Very good. And then just another topic I've been getting some questions on is just El Salvador and the state of the economy. I guess I've been seeing that there's been fairly good economic growth in El Salvador. It's an important country for you. There is some concern though about the linkage with Bitcoin and just sort of the overall sort of growth and stability potential there. Wonder if you could just expand a little bit on what you're seeing in El Salvador and sort of the outlook there for your business there. Andres Gluski : Look, our business in El Salvador has been very stable. The dollar is the currency of the country. So Bitcoin is not going to replace it. And certainly, with the volatility that Bitcoin has, it's not feasible. They did do one financing in Bitcoin that I'm aware of. So I don't see a change there. The biggest export of El Salvador is people, especially if you live in the D.C. area. So it's remittances that drive the economy. So a big factor there is that the U.S. economy is doing well. So I'd say the thing to watch in El Salvador is we always have to be on top of collections. And those are doing very well. So I know there's some noise, there's some political noise, and there have been some announcements like Bitcoin. But we don't see anything that would substantially affect our business. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The next question today comes from Gregg Orrill from UBS. Gregg, please go ahead. Your line is now open. Gregg Orrill : I'm sorry if you covered this, but what was the last 10% on - that relates to the exit of coal by '25? What steps would get you there? Steve Coughlin : Yes. So that was our previously stated goal. So we're just above 20%, around 20% this year. And so our previously stated goal was to get below 10% by 2025. And that is through a combination of asset sales, retirements, fuel conversion. So what we've talked about today is really just a full exit by the end of 2025. So that's really the difference there. Gregg Orrill : Can you be any more specific plant-wise? Andres Gluski : Gregg, what I'd put it this way is, again, in the big - if you look over time, I mean, we've gone from 22 to 7. We've already signed about - of that 7, about half of it is already basically sold. And we have to just close the sales. So you're left with a number of plants. And there's a combination of replacements, let's say, for renewables. There's fuel conversions where we can start running those plants on gas. And those few cases where we - that does not work, then there's obviously the possibility of asset sales. So just like we've been doing, we're just accelerating that and saying, look, rather than have 10% linger on for a couple of years, let's just go ahead and bite the bullet and say we're out of coal by end of '25. Operator : There are no additional questions registered at this time. So I'll hand the call back to Ahmed Pasha for closing remarks. Ahmed, please go ahead. Ahmed Pasha : Thanks, everyone, for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any questions you may have. Thank you, and have a great day.

[Operator Instructions] I now have the pleasure of handing the conference over to our host, Susan Harcourt, Vice President of Investor Relations with AES. Susan, please go ahead. Susan Harcourt : Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2022 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements, which are discussed in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website along with the presentation. Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Coughlin, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will turn the call over to Andres. Andres Gluski : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2022 financial review call. I am very happy to report that we have attained an investment-grade rating for Moody's. We are now investment-grade rated by all 3 major agencies, which is an important milestone for our company, and reflects a decade worth of work to transform our business. We're also reaffirming our 2022 guidance and annualized growth of 7% to 9% through 2025. Our business model continues to demonstrate its resilience and predictability even in the face of market volatility. Steve will cover our expectations for the remainder of the year in more detail, including the seasonality of our earnings profile. Today, I will discuss our 2022 construction program and the Department of Commerce's investigation into solar panel imports, the diverse drivers of our growth, including signed renewable energy PPAs and our U.S. utility, AES Next influence, and our strategic outlook for the sector. Beginning with our 2022 construction program on Slide 4. We are laser-focused on ensuring timely completion of projects. As we see our ability to execute on our commitments as a key source of competitive advantage. This year, we expect to complete more than 2 gigawatts of new renewables, including over 800 megawatts of solar in the U.S. In late March, the U.S. Department of Commerce launched an investigation into solar imports from 4 Southeast Asian countries, which collectively supply approximately 80% of solar panels for the U.S. market. The Department of Commerce is expected to make a preliminary determination on this case by no later than August. The resulting uncertainty around tariff levels has led to a drop in imports and project delays across the industry. However, due to our supply chain strategy, all of the panels for our 830 megawatts of projects to be completed in 2022 in the U.S. are already in country, and we do not anticipate any delays to those projects. I'd also note that 1/3 of our 2022 renewable projects are international and the remaining 683 megawatts in the U.S. are wind and energy storage. Moving to the diverse drivers of future growth, beginning on Slide 5. Our strategy is to provide differentiated products that allow us to work with our customers on a bilateral basis. As a result, last year, we signed a total of 5 gigawatts of PPAs for renewable energy, including more contracts with C&I customers than anyone else in the world. For full year 2022, we continue to expect to sign 4.5 to 5.5 gigawatts of renewables under long-term contracts with a roughly 50-50 split between the U.S. and international markets. We do expect PPA signings in the U.S. to be more weighted towards the second half of the year. So far this year, we have signed or been awarded 1.1 gigawatts, bringing our backlog to 10.3 gigawatts. Despite current headwinds for the sector, such as delays in U.S. climate legislation, and the supply chain issues we just discussed, we continue to see very strong demand for low-carbon energy and especially for structured products, such as our 24/7 renewable offering. In fact, as you may have seen earlier this week, we announced 2 key agreements for our structured products. First, the expansion of our partnership with Microsoft into California, the third market where we will supply renewable energy to match the load at their data centers; and second, our agreement with Amazon, under which we will provide 675 megawatts of renewable energy to their operations in California, including AWS' data centers. With these agreements, we are helping both companies achieve their ambitious sustainability goals. As you can see on Slide 6, we believe our development pipeline of 59 gigawatts is the second largest among U.S. renewables developers. This robust pipeline provides us with the projects we need to deliver on our backlog and continue to build on our competitive position in the market. Now turning to our regulated U.S. utility platforms, beginning on Slide 7. These businesses represent one of the key contributors to our overall 7% to 9% annual growth in earnings and cash flow as well as advancing our objective of increasing the proportion of earnings from the U.S. to 50%. In both markets, we have the lowest residential rates in the entire state which provides a runway for growth and investment while keeping affordable rates for our customers. Moving to Slide 8. In Indiana, we're benefiting from incentives to modernize the transmission and distribution network and transitioning to greener generation. Through 2025, we will be investing $2.7 billion, which we will recover through already approved rate mechanisms. Additionally, we expect to finalize our next integrated resource plan by this fall, allowing us to further transform AES Indiana's generation fuel mix. In Ohio, we're capitalizing on formula rate-based investments in the transmission network. At the same time, we are implementing our Smart Grid investment program, which is recovered through an existing rate mechanism. We also have a distribution rate case pending before the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio. Later this month, we will be presenting oral arguments directly to the commission and a favorable outcome, in this case, will bolster our ability to make the new investments needed to further strengthen AES Ohio's network. Turning to Slide 9. Through 2025, we expect to invest $4 billion to modernize our U.S. utilities. These investments translate to average annual rate base growth of 9% through 2025, which is at the high end of growth projections for U.S. utilities. We expect the earnings from these core businesses to grow in line with the rate base. Turning to Slide 10 for an update on AES Next. We are developing and incubating new products and business platforms through AES Next. Our investments in AES next help our businesses to be more innovative and competitive and drive value for our customers and shareholders. We are proud that earlier this year, Fast Company named AES is one of the 10 most innovative energy companies in the world and the only large publicly-traded company to be included on that list. Turning to Slide 11. The most mature initiative under AES Next today is Fluence, which as of December 31, had 4.2 gigawatts of energy storage products deployed and contracted and a signed backlog of $1.9 billion. Additionally, Fluence's digital platform, Fluence IQ, recently acquired Nispera, and now has a combined 15 gigawatts contracted or under management, of which more than 80% is with third-party customers. Over the past several months, Fluence has been dealing with short-term challenges mostly stemming from COVID-19 related supply chain issues. Their management team has taken proactive steps to address these challenges, including diversifying battery suppliers signing new shipping agreements, building out their in-house supply chain team and regionalizing their manufacturing. Overall, demand for energy storage remains very robust, and Fluence is well capitalized and positioned to grow as a market leader. We see a pathway for them to improve their margins and grow as the global energy transition continues to progress. Finally, turning to our strategic outlook for the sector, beginning on Slide 12. Our goal is to be the leader in providing low carbon energy solutions while delivering annualized earnings and cash flow growth of 7% to 9% through 2025. Today, there is an unprecedented transformation of our sector underway with governments, utilities and companies working to shift to low carbon sources of power. For example, just looking at the public commitment of the RE100, a group of over 350 large corporations who have committed to 100% renewable energy. We expect our annual demand to more than double to almost 400 terawatt hours of renewable energy by 2030. Facing this immense opportunity, we\u2019re taking steps to ensure our continued competitive advantage in this once in a generation information of our sector. As you can see on Slide 13, this transformation is reflected in our own portfolio as we expect renewables to represent more than 3 quarters of our installed capacity by the end of 2025. During that same time period, we expect our renewables business to nearly triple from 13 gigawatts to approximately 38 gigawatts and our capacity from coal to go from 7 gigawatts to zero. With that, I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Stephen Coughlin. Steve Coughlin : Thank you, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our first quarter results 2022 parent capital allocation and 2022 guidance. Beginning on Slide 15, as Andres highlighted, I'm very pleased to share that Moody's recently completed a thorough review of our consolidated debt and cash flow across our businesses and upgraded AES to investment grade. This conclusion further validates our year's long effort to reduce risk and strengthen our balance sheet and will yield further benefits as we grow our business and attract new investors to AES. As an investment-grade rated company, we will continue to lead the renewable sector while growing our U.S. utility asset base and our long-term contracted generation portfolio. Turning to Slide 16 and the resiliency of our business model. Today, 85% of our adjusted PTC is from long-term contracted generation and utilities. We are largely insulated from the current macroeconomic volatility affecting commodity prices, inflation, interest rates and foreign currencies, with the vast majority of our portfolio benefiting from contractual indexation, fuel pass-through or hedging programs that limit our exposure. Combined, these macroeconomic factors had an impact of less than $2 million on our adjusted PTC in the first quarter. For the full year, we currently expect a net positive contribution from these macroeconomic factors as a result of higher natural gas prices and higher power prices in some of our markets. Now turning to our financial results for the quarter, beginning on Slide 17. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.21 versus $0.28 last year. Our core business segments grew by $0.04 over the first quarter of 2021. These positive contributions were offset by several negative drivers we had already anticipated in our 2022 guidance. First, higher losses at AES Next, primarily resulting from COVID-related supply chain issues at Fluence in the fourth quarter of 2021. As a reminder, we report Fluence's results on a 1 quarter lag. So the Fluence results relate to their December quarter end, which was disclosed in February and included in AES' full year guidance on our last call. Second, the higher share count as a result of the accounting adjustment we made for our equity units. Third, a higher quarterly effective tax rate than our overall expectation for the full year due to timing. And finally, nonrecurring gains on interest rate hedges recorded last year, which skewed the quarter over prior year quarter comparison. Turning to Slide 18. Adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, was $207 million for the quarter, which was $40 million lower than 2021, consistent with the drivers I just discussed. I'll cover the performance of our strategic business units or SBUs in more detail over the next 4 slides. In the U.S. and utility strategic business unit, or SBU, higher PTC was driven primarily by earnings from new renewables coming online and higher contributions from Southland, partially offset by higher spend at AES Clean Energy due to an accelerated growth plan. Higher PTC at our South America SBU was mostly driven by our increased ownership of AES Andy's and higher contracted revenue in Colombia. Lower PTC at our Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, or MCAC SBU primarily reflects the sale of Tablo in the Dominican Republic in 2021 and lower availability at our generation facilities in Mexico. Finally, in Eurasia, higher PTC reflects higher revenue at our Mandan facility in Vietnam and higher power prices at our wind plant in Bulgaria, driven by commodity price increases. Now to Slide 23. We are on track to achieve our full year 2022 adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.55 to $1.65. Our typical quarterly earnings profile is more heavily weighted towards Q3 and Q4, with about 2/3 of our earnings occurring in the second half of the year. We continue to expect a similar profile this year as we grow more in the U.S. where earnings are higher in the second half of the year based on solar generation profiles, utility demand seasonality and the commissioning of more new projects in the third and fourth quarters. Growth in the year to go will be primarily driven by contributions from new businesses, including over 2 gigawatts of projects in our backlog coming online over the next 9 months, as well as further accretion from our increased ownership of ASMs. We are also reaffirming our expected 7% to 9% average annual growth target through 2025, based on our expected growth in renewables and U.S. utilities as well as the recycling of our capital into additional investment opportunities we see across our global portfolio. Now to our 2022 parent capital allocation plan on Slide 24. Sources reflect approximately $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion of total discretionary cash, including $900 million of parent free cash flow and $500 million to $700 million of proceeds from asset sales. On the right-hand side, you can see our planned use of capital. We will return nearly $500 million to shareholders this year. This consists of our common share dividend, including the 5% increase we announced in December and the coupon on the equity units. We plan to invest approximately $900 million to $1.1 billion in our subsidiaries as we capitalize on attractive opportunities for growth. Nearly half of these investments are in renewables, reflecting our success in securing long-term contracts during 2021 and our expectations for 2022. About 25% of these investments are in our U.S. utilities, to fund rate base growth with a continued focus on grid and fleet modernization. In summary, close to 3/4 of our investments this year are going to renewables growth in our U.S. utilities businesses helping us to achieve our goal of increasing the proportion of earnings from the U.S. to more than half by 2023. In fact, we have made great progress on our growth investments so far this year with approximately $650 million already invested primarily in renewables and to increase our ownership in AES Andres. We will continue to allocate our capital in line with our strategy to lead the renewable sector, further anchor AES in the U.S. market and to decarbonize our portfolio. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres. Andres Gluski : Thank you, Steve. In summary, our core business continues to perform well. We have attained investment-grade ratings from all 3 major agencies. We are reaffirming our 2022 guidance and annualized growth through 2025. We continue to deliver on our commitments, including our 2022 construction projects, which we expect to commission on time even with the ongoing Department of Commerce investigation into solar panel imports. We are energized by the immense opportunity for growth in our business and remain committed to maintaining our competitive advantage. With that, I would like to open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs. Insoo Kim : First question on the solar -- the U.S. solar investigation. Good to see that the '22 projects are on time and on schedule. Just for 2023 exposure, could you give a little bit more clarity on the amount of capacity that maybe has been contracted and need to be delivered? And what type of timing delays, if any, that we could expect for next year? And then just related to that, if there are delays to that, that were embedded in your growth for '23, how much flexibility do you have to move around other items to still hit your growth. Andres Gluski : Let me start with a little background on the commerce case. So this case is an investigation by commerce into allegations of 1 U.S. manufacturer that panels and sells imported from 4 countries in Southeast Asia are circumventing existing antidumping and countervailing duties on solar panels and cells coming from China. So we think there are strong legal grounds for commerce to make a preliminary determination before August that will signal to the market that the allegations are unfounded and will be conclusively dismissed without new tariffs. One of the legal requirements for determining that circumvention occurred is that the activity in Southeast Asian countries must be considered minor or insignificant. However, the solar panel and cell suppliers operating in these countries have invested billions of dollars in technologically sophisticated manufacturing, assembly and processing facilities so that their activities do not appear to be minor or insignificant. Additionally, the critical step of creating solar cells occurs in these countries and not in China and involves the conversion of the wafer into a cell. Commerce itself as previously ruled that this step determines the country of origin for solar imports. For these reasons, we think that there are strong grounds for commerce to make an expedited determination. It's also important to note that there's broad industry opposition to this investigation, including from many U.S. manufacturers because they rely on solar cells from Southeast Asia in order to manufacture solar modules here in the U.S. Currently, the U.S. manufacturing industry can only need about 20% of U.S. demand and their capacity to increase supply is negatively impacted by this investigation. This further supports the decision by commerce to dismiss the circumvention plane underground that a finding of circumvention would not be appropriate due to harmful impacts. So we'll continue to advocate a rapid resolution of this case. Now getting specifically to your question, I think what we were able to do this year shows to our supply chain management strategy. And many of you will recall that for 3 years, I've been arguing that this huge wave of renewable demand was coming and that there were going to be shortages of everything, from developers, to land, to interconnections. And now, we've had, I'd say, an additional issue with this commerce -- before commerce for solar pounds. So we've been not ahead of this. Now what will determine what will happen in '23 to us. And again, I think we're in the best shape of anybody in the industry, will be if there's an early resolution or if there is a determination they take the worst case. There's comes out and they say that there is a convention and there's going to be a tariff of X. Okay. Well, then people can put cash deposits at that point. Now I think this would have a very deleterious effect for the whole solar industry in the U.S. I think we would be in better shape because we're primarily selling to corporates who have more flexibility than people say utilities with RFPs who are much more regulated. So given that, I'd say, look, right now, we don't know. I mean worst case, and we continue to negotiate with our clients, with advances. We're not signing them yet because we're waiting for this final determination. But this is not going to stop us. And in terms of the construction, it depends how the case comes and the sort of shipping backlogs and the rest. It could potentially affect the second half of '23 but we'll have to see. So we're doing everything possible to minimize this. And I think the proof of the pudding is in the eating. I think we're one of the few solar U.S. developers who did not have to postpone or cancel any projects this year. Insoo Kim : That's good color. And maybe just the second part of my question was just if maybe the -- not the worst case, but a nonconstructive case comes down and the delays are more significant for the whole industry. Just your portfolio of global projects, whether it's wind or storage or whatnot, ARPU diverse, how much flexibility do you have to pull different levers to still achieve that growth? Andres Gluski : Well, that's a great point. If you think of our backlog of 10.3 gigawatts, only about 1/3 is U.S. solar. So the rest is either international or wind or other technology. So again, I think that what will happen, well, it -- we are at a diverse portfolio. And so we will try to make it up elsewhere. But again, we think that they're very strong ground to this miss case, honestly, it doesn't make a lot of legal sense, honestly. A prior similar case was dismissed because they didn't have let's say, nobody was standing up in front of it. Now you have 1 small U.S. manufacturer. And I think the grounds of this being insignificant or not material, the value-add added in Southeast Asian countries is almost laughable quite frankly. So it is just rent seeking, I think, from a few small U.S. players. What is dramatic is it's had such an effect on the industry. Now again, fortunately, we've been very concerned about shortages for 3 years. And you'll also recall that even with COVID that first appeared in February of 2020, we talked about a potential effects on supply chain. So again, stay tuned. I don't think there's anybody in better shape than us. And as you point out, we are diverse in terms of technologies and also in terms of geographies. Insoo Kim : Okay. That makes sense. My second question quickly. The Slide 43, the sensitivity slide to different moving commodities or currencies or whatnot, it\u2019s always helpful. Us. Just the update there. I think with stuff like Henry Hub gas prices being almost $8 to $9 right now, just looking at your sensitivity of the year-to-go assumptions. If these commodity prices do remain elevated and with no other changes, it seems like there could be a more meaningful EPS impact for 2022, but that assumes no other changes, whether it\u2019s power prices or whatnot. Can you just walk through at this point with the various commodity price or power price environment? How do you see that net for the balance of the year as it stands today? Steve Coughlin : Yes, it\u2019s Steve. So just as a reminder, that page, those sensitivities are in isolation. So when you see the gas price sensitivity, it\u2019s not \u2013 doesn\u2019t include any corresponding power price increase, which we would actually expect to happen in most cases. So on balance, the environment, we\u2019re really on the net positive side as I said in my comments. In particular, in Bulgaria, we have our wind portfolio there, which has done very well, and I expect we\u2019ll do very well for the rest of this year. It does have some market exposure and with power prices in excess of 200, it\u2019s done very well. And then the other thing I would point to is our LNG business in MCAC. So we have long-term contracted gas that\u2019s been contracted for some time. So in fact, there are some upsides that we\u2019re working \u2013 have worked through and we\u2019ll continue to work through to take advantage of some of the high gas price opportunities to benefit our LNG business. So I think there\u2019s upside there as well. Southland has been another upside we see the Q3 hedging program, another success. We expect more success this year was $0.05 of energy margin upside last year. So on balance, we\u2019re actually in quite good shape. Most of our contracts are inflation indexed around the world. I think it\u2019s like 83%. Those that are not are really U.S. renewable contracts where we\u2019ve locked in our cost upfront, and that was baked into the overall cost of the \u2013 our pricing in PPA. So really, AES has transformed a lot. And actually, we\u2019re in quite good shape in this environment. Andres Gluski : I would say, too, we\u2019re on the right side of history on this one. I mean, because where we have fuel, it\u2019s mostly a pass-through. And we\u2019re mostly competing with fossil fuels with either hydro, with renewables. So \u2013 and I would say the biggest winner of what\u2019s happened is really Bulgaria because in Bulgaria, we\u2019ve just signed an MOU with the government of Bulgaria where they recognize the validity of the PPA. And they also \u2013 we\u2019re working together on decarbonizing the Maritza project, whether it be \u2013 we\u2019re looking at different alternatives, whether it carbon capture and sequestration, biofuels or conversion to gas and at the same time, stepping up investments in energy. Again, I really can\u2019t think of any case where this is impacting us negatively. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Sunderland with JPMorgan. Richard Sunderland : And maybe just wanted to touch on the 2023 solar outlook a little bit more. Could you speak to a little bit more around the risks there beyond just the earnings delays? Is it really just so much as the timing of the earnings come in? Are there any contractual obligations around energy procurement or elsewhere that you need to fulfill with those contracts? Andres Gluski : Yes. No, I'm not aware of any, quite frankly. I think that I don't think it would be demand destruction. It would be a delay in some cases of commissioning them. But no, we would obviously have -- our contracts would not hold us to having to supply energy if there is a major disruption in the solar panel market. But again, we think that's the -- not the most likely scenario, but if it were to occur, we wouldn't be suffering LDs because of not fulfilling contracts. Richard Sunderland : Got it. Very helpful. And then thinking about the announcements around these recent structured deals, could you speak to a little bit of the capacity, overall appetite there? And then I guess just to be clear on the Amazon front, are those new projects or reflected in the 2021 signings? Andres Gluski : Yes. First, most of these are reflected in 2021 projects. But what I would say is we're seeing a tremendous demand for our structured project. And we have been talking about this year, we weren't able to release some of the names prior to that until the client was ready. But we can do more projects. I think the real issue is to have the projects in the right market ready. So it's -- stay tuned. More is coming. But I think what we like very much is it shows like a repeat buying. So with microcells, for example, we've done projects in PJM. We did a project in Chile, and now we big clients. So if you think of the large data center clients, we have big contracts with 3 of them. And we're very big. The demand is there. It's a question of how fast we can bring the projects online. Steve Coughlin : Yes. And I would just add, this customer, Richard, we have the flexibility to pivot to some other markets. We've done Microsoft, we've done Google in Chile. And so the Amazon announcement is what we've been able to announce. This is something I wanted to talk about for some time, but there's more to come. And we've built the pipeline significantly. We're up pipeline, and that's in large part because we're playing forward the demand coming from our commercial industrial customers in aggregating the pipeline where we know that they're going to need us to supply their load. Andres Gluski : Yes. I think an important point -- a good part of this pipeline is in California, and it's quite ready. And that we started acquiring land and interconnection rights about 3 years ago. We really got a little bit ahead of this wave that we see now. So the demand is there. It's a question of bringing all the projects online. Now realize that these are versions of 24/7 or round the clock renewables. So it's not only a question of having the availability to build new megawatts, it's all guaranteed netted on an hourly basis, renewable energy. Richard Sunderland : That's very helpful color. And I just wanted to follow up real quick on the sort of contracting backdrop. You talked a little bit about more risk weighted into the U.S. signings, obviously, the DSC overshadowing all of these. So can you give us a little bit more color on what you're seeing in terms of discussions to get it active, but you just point to then start finalizing. Any more information would be helpful there. Andres Gluski : Yes, right. You can characterize this, right. We are in discussions, and there are more contracts with clients and that I'd say a factor is having some clarity in August, what it would be because you have to make cash deposits and have greater flexibility and speed than, say, regulated clients. So let's see what happens. But again, I think it's just going to be more cars, this would slow us down. And it would basically make renewables in the U.S. more expensive. So if you want onshore manufacturing, what do you need? You need cheap and clean energy. It's a vital factor. And again, we are in the best shape, I think, of anybody in the sector. So its effects will be much greater outside of AES. Steve Coughlin : Yes. And I would just add, the last year, 80% of the contracts were done in bilateral commercial industrial PPAs, so bilateral negotiations. So the customers that we're working with are very much aware of this issue. We're moving forward with all the details that we can move forward on, and this piece is open, and it's very frustrating, and it's not a good thing. But these are customers that have made very strong and vocal commitments to their decarbonization, and we suspect they're going to want to continue to find the path to get there. And since we're in a bilateral relationship, I think we're going to work through that. Andres Gluski : And I would add look, we're all in favor of onshoring. But what you need is certainty and you need a time line. So you need to know what tariffs will be applied in what way. And -- but you also have to say how far down the supply chain they're going to go. And the further down the supply chain, you're going to go, the more time you need to move the supply chain. And so for example, right now, most of -- most of the solar panels we're buying from Southeast Asia. Actually, the polysilicon is going to be coming from Germany. So it's not even coming from China. So this is basically rent-seeking by a small number of -- or actually 1 firm in this case. And in significant firm I may add. I don't think it's delivering 1% of the supply in the U.S. So it really is quite agree to the whole situation. Operator : Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore. Durgesh Chopra : Steve, maybe this one is in sort of your house. I was just going to ask you, as it relates to the 2022 EPS guidance, Steve, can you remind us what are you modeling for Fluence in that -- embedded in that guidance? And then obviously, Fluence had some challenges with COVID-19 as Andr\u00e9s articulated in his prepared remarks. If that continues throughout the year, what kind of flexibility do you have to kind of make that up in other areas of the business? Steve Coughlin : Yes. So thanks for the question. Look, to Fluence had a difficult their first quarter, which, as I had in my remarks, for their fiscal '22, our fiscal year runs October to September, and we report them on a 1 quarter lag. So what they reported in December is just hitting this quarter that we're now reporting. So we already had anticipated an updated forecast for Fluence when we gave our guidance, and that's largely -- that's about what I can say on it. Unfortunately, Fluence. I can't say much more. My hands are tied here. They're a public company, they'll be releasing earnings next week. But what I can say is I feel very comfortable given that I have the latest expectations for Fluence in our numbers. We've already absorbed their first quarter, and we reported that here.  So look, they've had a lot of issues that they've talked about. I think they're working through those. Some of them are quite temporary in nature, and they've already worked through both shiny new shipping contracts, diversifying their battery supply, they're regionalizing their manufacturing around the world. So I think it's going to take some time as they've said to work through some of these challenges. But we're very confident. The long term is strong. They're -- the entire market has continued to be very strong. The demand is still there. I think they had kind of the perfect storm of some issues coming together here with supply chain batteries, shipping, et cetera. But in our guidance, we have the latest forecast, and it's not it's knocking us off our guidance range. Andres Gluski : What I would add is that the company is well capitalized and see strong demand. And what you're seeing is increase in battery supply outside of China. So you just saw the announcement by the U.S. government that they would have incentives for battery manufacturer in the U.S. Point has an agreement with North Volt for production of batteries in Poland. So I think what you're going to see is the main constraint, which has been access to batteries will start to be addressed. Now it's not going to be immediate, but by next year, you start seeing more capacity come online. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. That's very comprehensive. In terms of just going back to the backlog of additions, right? I mean you started the year strong, roughly over 1 gig versus the 4.5 to 5.5 gig target. Sounds like you're confident that you're going to hit that in 2022, but as we think about '23 in light of the solar investigation, in light of the commentary around potential delays. Do you go back? Like, I mean what's -- so the current plan, I think the long term, the 7% to 9% EPS growth is predicated on, correct me if I'm wrong, 3 to 4 gigawatts a year. Is that sort of -- do you expect to sort of hit that in 2023, maybe the low end? Or what's the thinking there as we think about 2023 this year? Andres Gluski : So you're talking about signing new PPAs? Are you talking about commissioning of projects? Durgesh Chopra : The new PPAs, Andr\u00e9s, the target. Andres Gluski : The PPAs. Okay. Look, in the first quarter, we did 1.1 gigawatts. So we are on target for our 4.5 to 5.5 gigawatts for the year. As I mentioned, due to this Commerce case, some of the signing of PPAs in solar in the U.S. will be more heavily weighted towards the second half of the year because people will wait until this resolution and come to a conclusion. Do I think that this will knock us off our growth trajectory? No? The answer is no. And because -- if anything, it might move things around from 1 quarter to the next. But we're seeing very strong demand for our products. And this will -- the RE100, for example, they're not going to render their sustainability goals. So they're going to go forward with this. So I think that -- I feel confident of it. Kind of cause some delays in signing of PPAs. Yes, we're saying that. But I think that we'll have a catch-up. So it might make things a little bit lumpier than they would be otherwise, which is not ideal. But that's the hand we've been built. Durgesh Chopra : Understood. It sounds like the long-term trajectory intact; you may have some lumpiness in the near term. But you feel confident long term in hitting all of our targets? Andres Gluski : Exactly, exactly. Operator : Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So I want to sort of quantify things a little bit more if we can. Obviously, we talked about these commodity sensitivities a little bit earlier. Can we talk about the longer-dated commodity sensitivities and trying to quantify it based on what's implied in your slides? And it looks as if -- again, these commodities are flying around, but it could be north of $0.10 positive versus what you guys -- your last guidance. I mean, is that directionally, correct? I mean can you try to quantify that a little bit in the affirm it? And then related to the extent to which that is true directionally, what does that mean in terms of your appetite to potentially expedite the exit from Bulgaria, for instance. I just want to try to get at that a little bit more and/or absorb some of these other impacts, be it solar or affluent and still be within your range or higher within your range. Steve Coughlin : Sure. Julien. So you're right. I mean, and you're looking through the page on the commodities and seeing that there's actually upside here, as I described. So Bulgaria, where the power prices are high, we're really seeing significant upside there, both in the near term as well as in the value of the Maritza plant, which is under contract, but that PPA is well in the money for the government of the people in Bulgaria, plus we have the upside in the wind plant. In our LNG business, in our gas businesses in Central America and the Caribbean, we have long-term gas contracts that have been set well before this commodities environment. So we have some flexibility in how we manage our cargoes, we have customers or plants that have dual fuel capability. And so we're able to perhaps work in swapping to liquid fuels and redirecting cargoes into Europe, for example, with our partners. So this is a really important part of our portfolio, one that we don't tend to talk a lot about, but it is in this environment, important diversification of our portfolio. So we see both with power prices as well as the upside in our position in natural gas, given our long-term contracts. But yes, directionally, you are correct. I wouldn't venture to say whether it's $0.10 or exactly at this point. But some of that relies on discrete transactions that we will do and have done and will do to take advantage of that upside in LNG. Andres Gluski : Yes. And talking about Bulgaria, what I would say is, look, -- in the past, the PPA had been questioned before the sort of anticompetitive -- say, legal state really was the case before the European Commission. So what we're seeing is that -- to some extent, we're getting past that. This is a confirmation of the PPA. So it's a very attractive asset. Maritza is a very attractive asset through the end of its contract period and beyond, it's actually doing what -- the reason it was built was to make Bulgaria independent of Russian gas. That's why it was built and it uses local coal. So it's not affected by international prices. So it's very much in the money for our clients. So the asset is much more valuable today than it was, say, 6 months ago. And we've also agreed to help the Bulgarian government look at energy storage and other alternatives to wean, say, Maritza away from just running on coal. So stay tuned to that. But I'd say this has been the big winner from this horrible situation in Europe. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Fair enough. And then I just want to try to quantify versus some of the qualitative comments earlier around the AD CVD risk on '23. I just -- again, it sounds as if specifically, you're reaffirming the origination ranges going into next year, your confidence is there. Is there any -- I mean, when you try to quantify any of these risks, any way to do so around solar here? Just any quantum of origination risk? Any quantum of impact and higher costs, et cetera. I just want to make sure we're crystal clear on this all. Andres Gluski : Yes. Look, what I would say is the following. Look, we are continuing to negotiate with our clients. This has pushed off the final signing of a number of additional PPAs because there's uncertainty about the tariff. So that's sort of the remaining item to complete these PPAs. Now its effect will depend on -- will August provide enough clarity and it should. You should have an indication of how much the tariff would be, how much you would have to put in sort of cash deposits, even though it might be finalized later. But typically, those move up and down that drastically. So we think we could work with that. However, I mean, the issue -- to me, the biggest issue is whether the suppliers continue to run these factories in Southeast Asia. Do you have a decrease in global supply of solar panels. So that's a little bit more of the issue. So there are a lot of things there. But rest assured that we're doing everything possible and using our sort of global footprint to try to be able to give certainty to some of the suppliers that they will be able to continue to be running. So stay tuned, but we hope that by August or actually sooner because the case is so weak, it should be dismissed, and it's amazing that it's gotten this far. But if there's there should be some clarity or has to be some clarity by August, and then we'll let you know, and we'll continue to work with all the suppliers to ensure that we get those panels to the states on time to complete 2023 projects. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. All right. Fair enough. And then just the last one [indiscernible]. Fluence, obviously, it's a trailing impact, et cetera, the lockup expired of late. It seems it's still strategic to you from an origination perspective and your sales efforts, right, regardless of the results? Andres Gluski : Yes, I'm optimistic about Fluence in the long run or it will say medium term because these -- it's very difficult to launch a new product when you get hit by COVID shutdowns in China. There were -- some of the battery suppliers had issues, let's face it. And that caused a shortage in the market as well. So there were tremendous shipping issues that they had to face. But look, it's a well-capitalized firm. The product is good. Digital is expanding well. They'll talk about these things. And for us, it has helped us really create a market for energy storage, solar plus energy storage. Our 24/7 relies on energy storage. If a version of the climate plus bill gets passed, and there's clarity around green hydrogen that will require a lot of energy story. So yes, it is a strategic relationship. And we hope to grow together for years to come. Operator : Our next question comes from Agnieszka Storozynski with Seaport. Agnieszka Storozynski : So my first question is about the time line of your coal plant retirements. We seem to be in this new gas price environment, basically everywhere in the world. We haven't yet heard many companies change the time line, but there is money to be made on continued operations of some of these assets. So that's one. And then the second question, a little bit more longer dated, I guess, is that so far, when you see the reasons why C&I customers signed renewable power PPAs, they mentioned decarbonization as the main driver. We haven't yet heard much about economic renewables, and it's probably the inflation and equipment prices doesn't help. But are you expecting the second wave of demand from C&I customers as we are in this higher power price environment probably for years to come? Andres Gluski : Yes, those are great questions. Look, first on the first one, we have to reach our goal by 2025. So it's a question of trying to sell these assets or shut them down at times that are most appropriate. So the shutdowns, it's talking a lot with the local system operator or the Ministry of Energy. So those I don't see being affected by what's happening now. On top of the sales, you're right, many of these plants are more valuable in certain locations, again, Maritza being the prime example. And some of these shutdowns may be somewhat delayed because they must run in terms of availability of natural gas. But it doesn't change our goal of getting rid of all coal plants by 2025. The second question is I'm really glad you asked it because the companies are committed to their decarbonization goals. They're not just going to abandon them because of the case before commerce or because of slightly higher prices of let's say, everything from wind turbines or solar panels to batteries due to what's happening on the mineral side, commodity side. But what people aren't talking about is that the increase in cost of renewables is much, much less than the increase in the price of fossil fuels, all of them, whether it be coal, gas or diesel. So actually, renewables are more competitive today than ever. And in almost all cases, I can say that the energy from renewables is the cheapest energy. It's just a matter of degree, how much cheaper is it even with the increase in the cost of construction. So I'd say that the main issue is not energy, it's capacity. How to keep the lights on 24/7. And you really have 2 choices. One is to continue to run your legacy assets, whether they be gas or coal and combine it with renewables. That's what we did in Chile, the sort of Green integra or Green blend and extend or energy start. And as people go, let's say, further on this journey of decarbonization, that's why there's going to be such strong demand for energy storage, lithium ion-based energy storage. So really, to me, it's a question of supply. Can you get enough batteries to meet this? And the more batteries that become available, then you'll be able to retire fossil plants sooner. So that's, I'd say, the main thing. So you're right. But on the cost equation, renewables are more competitive than ever than before this crisis. Agnieszka Storozynski : Yes, because it is pretty amazing to see that large commercial industrial customers are comfortable locking in, for example, in PJM power prices as far as high as $50 in 2026, 2027 when they could purchase renewables for like 45%, 46%. I mean that is just one thing that I don't fully grasp and I'm hopeful that, that just means that there is no growth to come for you guys. Andres Gluski : There is going to be more growth. I mean, maybe in some of these cases, it's just that -- do they have confidence the projects are there because it's -- can you deliver those projects. And in this sector, there have been a lot of projects delayed or canceled, not by us due to different kinds of supply shortages. So that might be it. It might be that they're going for certainty. So what we feel differentiates us, and we're very conscious of is that we have been delivering on our projects. Operator : Our next question comes from Gregg Orrill with UBS. Gregg Orrill : I was wondering if you could comment on what got Moody's to investment grade. Anything you wanted to highlight there? Andres Gluski : Look, this has been -- I'll pass this over to Steve because he did most of the work. But what I would just add, this has been a decade. So if you look at any of our statistics in terms of our exposure to commodities, if you look at the fact that we're almost, what, 88%, I think, in dollars, 85% contracted I guess, almost 90% hedged. I mean, all the indicators are very strong. So our cash flow has been really strong for a long time, but I'll pass it off to Steve. Steve Coughlin : Thanks, Andr\u00e9s, and thanks for the question, Gregg. I was hoping someone would bring you up. We're very proud of the Moody's achievement. So look, this is the third of of 3. And so it really fully solidifies our investment-grade status as AES, something that the team set out to do a long time ago. I can't -- I've only been in my job for 6 months, so I can't really claim too much credit for it. So it really goes to that John and the team. And so look, Moody's takes a different approach where they're looking at our consolidated debt, including all the nonrecourse debt and all the cash flow from our businesses, our subs. So they really did a very deep review and they looked at also the overall risk profile of our businesses. So our commercial structure, our long-term contracts, dollar-denominated, our growth in our utilities -- and so it's been a combination of the strengthening of the balance sheet, the increases in our cash flow and that business mix, so -- and we've actually been in Moody's territory for 4 quarters straight -- well into Moody's territory. So this was becoming really, really obvious that it was something that AES deserved, and we're very proud of it and look at -- we felt really good about our transformation. And I think this is just another validation point of that transformation. As I said, they did a really thorough review. Andres Gluski : Yes. And I would highlight what Steve said that Moody's methodology is different. So it takes into account not only the nonrecourse debt, but the recourse debt. So in our case, it's about I guess, $3.5 billion of recourse? Steve Coughlin : Yes, yes. Andres Gluski : $14.3 million of nonrecourse. Steve Coughlin : Yes, exactly. Yes. I mean I think I said on request the recourse debt that's different here. They really look deeply into the whole organization. Andres Gluski : So this tells you that all our subs that they have confidence in the cash flow coming from ourselves and most of our subs are investment-grade rating. So it's a great confirmation. It was a decade in the making, but the team did a fantastic job in the last year to get this across the finish line. Steve Coughlin : Yes. And the other thing I would just point out is I think it's a bright line for some investors. So having this third one, having 3 all locked in. I think we'll likely see some new investors be attracted to the company now. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Levine with Citi. Ryan Levine : Given your favorable view of the DOC outcome and balance sheet strength, are you looking to be more acquisitive and new in development, third-party solar projects in solar? Andres Gluski : Look, what we are seeing is that clients are coming to us and asking us, can we do projects that other people have walked away from, quite frankly. So that -- now what we're mostly interested in the states, these 24/7. So really, it has to do -- does it fit into where we're trying to combine assets to be able to deliver 24/7. But it does open up some opportunities. So I think, again, on the Department of Commerce case, we just feel that the legal case of the length of here is very, very weak. And we think that -- furthermore, if you look at the objectives of decarbonization of onshoring, this actually moves us in the wrong direction. So yes, what I would put it is that we continue to see opportunities to acquire some projects if they help us meet our clients' demands. Ryan Levine : I appreciate the color. And then I guess one follow-up from earlier. Are you going to break out the Bulgarian win contribution for the quarter? Steve Coughlin : We did not break that out for the quarter, probably best as we talk about the full year. But it -- we expect it will be a few cents for the full year. Operator : Our next question comes from David Peters with Wolfe Research. David Peters : Just curious, Andr\u00e9s, I think in your prepared remarks, you said you expect backlog addition this year to be roughly 50-50 U.S. and international. Is that the mix you guys expected heading into this year? Or are you leveraging your geographic diversity, some given the uncertainty here in the U.S. in the near term? And should we maybe think of that as a lever you can sort of pull in '23 to the extent there are delays with U.S. projects? Andres Gluski : Well, I mean, for '23, these will be projects that are already signed in terms of commissioning. Now in terms of signings, yes, obviously, we can -- we have a diverse portfolio, and we can adjust correspondingly. So I don't think it would affect 2023 per se. Now the sort of 50-50 mix, again, that's sort of legacy. And Again, what we hope, again, with the resolution. Steve Coughlin : Of this case is that the proportion of U.S. would increase. Yes. And I would just add, it's also coming from our utility rate base growth, so 9% rate base growth in utilities is helping achieve that. And then a lot of what we're doing -- well, really, almost everything we're doing even internationally is in a similar strategy with commercial industrial customers, some of them the same customers in the U.S. powering data centers in our core markets overseas. So we'd expect to have a similar if it's a different flag, but it would still be a long-term contract, and in many cases, U.S. dollar-denominated contracts. Andres Gluski : That's a very important point. I mean what we're really emphasizing abroad is long-term renewable contracts in dollars. So if you're supplying, say, Microsoft in Chile, it really isn't a different risk from Microsoft in California. So again, our business is already over 80% in dollars, and that will only grow. David Peters : And then just last one. In California, just in light of solar delays this year and next and maybe storage that's attached that, too. Potentially have an extension of the Ablecon being discussed. I'm just curious your guys' most recent thoughts on the likelihood of your OTC units itself and is getting extended at the end of '23. Steve Coughlin : Without jinxing ourselves very, we think it's very likely. So these -- the environment there is not such that they want to do long-term extensions all at once, but we've extended through 2023. And we have -- it's an upside to our guidance, but we do think there's a very good chance that those plants will get extended into several years following. So it may be year by year, maybe 2 years at a time. But we think that portfolio is very important, some of the disruption. This is a bit of an offset to some of the current disruption in the solar supply chain. And that comes both from a capacity revenue perspective as well as the opportunity for the Q3 peak demand energy hedging that we've done. So it's quite -- it can be quite material. Operator : That concludes today's Q&A portion of the call. I will now pass the conference back over to Susan Harcourt for any closing remarks. Susan Harcourt : We thank everybody for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Thank you, and have a nice day. Operator : That concludes today's AES first quarter 2022 financial review conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

My name is Irene, and I will be coordinating this event. [Operator Instructions] I would like to turn the conference over to our host Susan Harcourt, Vice President of Investor Relations. Susan, please go ahead. Susan Harcourt : Thank you operator. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter 2022 financial review call. Our press release presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements, which are discussed in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website along with the presentation. Joining me this morning are Andr\u00e9s Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Coughlin, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will turn the call over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our second quarter 2022 financial review call. As you have seen from our earnings release, we reported second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.34, which was in line with our expectations and consistent with our historical quarterly earnings profile. Our CFO, Steve Coughlin will discuss our financial results in more detail. Based on our year-to-date results and outlook for the second half of the year, we are reaffirming our 2022 guidance and our expectation for annualized growth in adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow of 7% to 9% through 2025. I would also note that our guidance and expectations do not include any benefit from proposed US climate legislation, which we see as a meaningful source of potential upside as it would drive additional demand for renewables and energy storage and accelerate the development of green hydrogen projects in the US. This morning I will discuss our strategy in the context of two broad themes. First, our resilience to macroeconomic volatility including high inflation, high commodity prices, fluctuations in foreign currency and ongoing supply chain constraints; and second, continued strong demand for renewables, particularly from corporate and industrial customers. With this backdrop in mind, I will discuss the robustness of our business and also review our disciplined approach to growth, both of which provide us with full confidence in our ability to hit our financial and strategic goals this year and beyond. Beginning with our resilience on slide 4. As a result of the transformation of our portfolio over the last 10 years, our financial results this quarter were insulated from the impacts of rising inflation, depreciating US dollar and volatile commodity prices. We do not expect any of these factors to have any impact on our full year results. As I have discussed on previous calls, 85% of our adjusted pretax contribution is derived from long-term contracts for generation and our regulated utilities. For the 15% of our earnings that is not derived from long-term contracts or utilities, such as our legacy Southland business in California or the 10% that is not denominated in US dollars, we have largely hedged both exposures. In some cases our strong contractual arrangements have allowed for additional upside. Throughout 2022, we have signed agreements to redirect excess LNG from Panama to international customers. The benefits of these agreements will accrue through the remainder of the year and we have the potential to sign similar agreements next year depending on market conditions. Turning to construction and supply chains on Slide 5. Our strategic sourcing and ability to execute on our commitments our key competitive advantages and we expect to complete all of the projects in our 10.5 gigawatt backlog with no cancellations or significant changes. We take a proactive approach to working with our suppliers and as a result, we had all of the solar panels required for our 2022 projects in country earlier this year. More recently, we worked to quickly resume imports following the Biden Administration's June executive order and none of our suppliers' panels have been stopped by customs this year. We also took decisive steps to further decrease solar panel supply risk by creating a more robust US supply chain. In June, we launched the US Solar Buyer Consortium along with three other solar developers to significantly drive the expansion of domestic solar manufacturing. Collectively, we committed to purchasing more than $6 billion of solar panels for manufacturers that can supply up to seven gigawatts of solar modules per year made in the USA starting from 2024. Therefore, despite industry-wide supply chain challenges, we do not anticipate any major delays to our US renewables backlog of 5.9 gigawatts. I would note that only two projects have been shifted from 2022 to 2023 and these were moved as a result of changes requested by customers with no impact on our guidance and expectations for this year or next. In addition, we recently broke ground on the largest utility scale solar plus storage project in the state of Hawaii. Across the states, we have more renewable projects under development and/or under construction than anyone else. As you can see on Slide 6, we anticipate completing 1.8 gigawatts of new renewables globally this year, 4.6 gigawatts next year for a total of 6.4 gigawatts by the end of 2023. Turning to Slide 7. Looking to our future growth. We continue to see strong demand for renewables from our key customer groups. Despite increases in the cost of renewables resulting from inflation and supply chain constraints, a far greater increase in the cost of fossil fuels has made renewable energy even more price competitive. As a result, demand from corporate customers has never been higher. So far this year, we have signed or been awarded 1.6 gigawatts of long-term renewable PPAs, the majority of which have been negotiated on a bilateral basis. For full year 2022, we continue to expect to reach a total of 4.5 gigawatts to 5.5 gigawatts. As shown on Slide 8, we now have a backlog of 10.5 gigawatts all of which is expected to come online through 2025. Turning to Slide 9. I'd like to note that we currently have 13.7 gigawatts of renewables and operations. So this backlog of projects in construction or with signed PPAs represent more than 75% growth in our installed renewable capacity over the next four years. Including additional PPAs, we expect to sign by 2025, our portfolio will grow to almost 50 gigawatts of which 77% will be renewables. We also expect to have completely exited coal at that time. As we scale up in renewables, we continue to complement our portfolio with innovative businesses and solutions which require the best talent in order to deliver on our commitments. Earlier this week, Fast Company recognized AES in their top 10 rankings of best workplaces for Innovators and as the winner in the category of best workplaces for Early Career Innovator. We are very proud of receiving this recognition and our innovative teams and their many accomplishments. Additionally, although we don't have any specific announcements to make today, we continue to make good progress on our two large green hydrogen projects in the US and Chile. These projects include the integration of electrolyzers and renewable and have the potential to provide significant new sources of growth. I will provide additional updates in the coming months. In the meantime, we launched a 2.5-megawatt pilot project in Chile. This project will be a hydrogen fueling station and will produce up to one metric ton of green hydrogen per day.  Finally turning to Slide 10. Growth opportunities at our US utilities represent one of the key drivers of our overall 7% to 9% annual growth in earnings and cash flow. This growth also advances our objective of increasing the proportion of our earnings from the US to 50%. As a reminder in both Indiana and Ohio, we have the lowest residential rates in each state, providing a great runway for growth and investment, while keeping rates affordable for our customers. Through 2025, we expect to invest a total of $4 billion in new renewables, generation, transmission, modernization and smart grid at our US utilities. These investments will improve our customers' experience and translate to average annual rate base growth of 9% which is at the high-end of growth projection for US utility.  We expect the earnings from these core businesses to grow inline with the rate base. At AES Ohio, we are currently awaiting the commission's decision on our distribution rate case. As a reminder, we see significant opportunity to invest to improve reliability and strengthen AES Ohio's balance sheet, while remaining cost competitive.  With that I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Steve Coughlin. Steve Coughlin : Thank you, Andr\u00e9s and good morning, everyone. Today I will discuss our second quarter results 2022 parent capital allocation and 2022 guidance. Turning to our financial results for the quarter beginning on Slide 12. I'm pleased to share that we had a good second quarter in line with our expectations which keeps us well on track for our full year guidance.  Adjusted EPS was $0.34 versus $0.31 last year, driven by growth in our core business segments higher margins primarily at AES Andes and a lower adjusted tax rate. These positive contributions were partially offset by the higher share count as a result of the accounting adjustment we made for our equity units, higher parent interest expense related to growth funding and onetime outages at select thermal businesses. These outages were primarily driven by turbine manufacturer component defects and the plants impacted are now all back online. There are two additional points I would like to highlight from the second quarter. First, we successfully closed several nonrecourse subsidiary financing, extending tenures at very attractive rates and expanding facilities that support our renewables growth. And second, our collections and days sales outstanding in all of our businesses remain strong reflecting our predominantly investment-grade rated customer base. Turning to side 13. Adjusted pre-tax contribution or PTC was $304 million for the quarter, which was relatively flat year-over-year consistent with the drivers I just discussed. I'll cover the performance of our strategic business units or SBUs in more detail over the next four slides beginning on slide 14. In the US in Utilities SBU, lower PTC was driven primarily by outages at Southland and AES Indiana as well as lower contributions from AES Clean Energy due to increased investment in renewables development. Contributions from new clean energy project commissionings will be more skewed to the second half of the year. Higher PTC at our South America SBU was mostly driven by higher contributions from AES Andes resulting from our increased ownership as well as higher margins, but partially offset by the outages I previously mentioned. Higher PTC at our Mexico Central America and Caribbean or MCAC SBU, primarily reflects favorable market conditions caused by better hydrology in Panama. As Andr\u00e9s discussed the reduced need for thermal generation in Panama has allowed us to sell our excess LNG on the international market at higher prices, which will serve as a positive driver in the remainder of the year. Finally in Eurasia, while our business performance has been very strong the lower PTC reflects higher interest expense coming from additional non-recourse debt at one of our Eurasia Holdco. Now to slide 18. We are on track to achieve our full year 2022 adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.55 to $1.65. Our typical quarterly earnings profile is more heavily weighted toward Q3 and Q4 with about two-thirds of our earnings occurring in the second half of the year. We continue to expect a similar profile this year as we grow more in the US where earnings are higher in the second half based on solar generation profiles, utility demand seasonality, the commissioning of more new projects in the third and fourth quarters and higher demand at Southland and the peak cooling months in Southern California. Growth in the year to go will be primarily driven by contributions from new businesses including 1.4 gigawatts of projects in our backlog coming online over the next six months as well as further accretion from our increased ownership of AES Andes, higher LNG revenues and growth at our US utilities. We are also reaffirming our expected 7% to 9% average annual growth target through 2025 based on our expected growth in renewables energy storage and US utilities. Our guidance also assumes the recycling of capital from many of our thermal businesses into those three growth areas across our portfolio. Now to our 2022 parent capital allocation plan on slide 19. Sources reflect approximately $1.6 billion of total discretionary cash including $900 million of parent free cash flow. Due to timing uncertainty around our planned asset sales, we are now expecting to achieve the lower end of our $500 million to $700 million asset sales target within the year with the remaining sales expected to close in 2023. To fund our strong growth expectations until the asset sales are completed, we plan to issue approximately $200 million of new parent debt which was already included in the long-term capital allocation plan we laid out earlier this year. On the right-hand side, you can see our planned use of capital. We will return nearly $500 million to shareholders this year. This consists of our common share dividend including the 5% increase we announced last December and a coupon on the equity units. We plan to invest approximately $1.1 billion in our subsidiaries as we capitalize on attractive opportunities for growth. About half of these investments are in renewables reflecting our success in securing new long-term contracts during 2021 and our expectations for 2022. Nearly one-quarter of these investments are in our US utilities to fund rate base growth with a continued focus on grid and fleet modernization. In summary, nearly three-quarters of our investments this year are going to grow AES' renewables businesses in our US utilities, reflecting our commitment to continue executing on AES' portfolio transformation. We have made great progress on our growth investments so far this year and remain on track with our annual investment targets. We will continue to allocate our capital in line with our strategy to lead in renewables, grow our utilities by 9% annually and to recycle capital out of thermal assets to decarbonize our portfolio. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thank you Steve. In summary, our actions and strategy have put us in a strong position to achieve this year's guidance and a 7% to 9% annualized growth through 2025. Once again, our portfolio of businesses is proving its resilience to any macroeconomic volatility in the US or internationally. We have signed or been awarded 1.6 gigawatts of new renewable PPAs year-to-date and we're targeting 4.5 gigawatts to 5.5 gigawatts this year. Our backlog has reached 10.5 gigawatts and our construction schedule has not been affected by supply chain issues. To further derisk our supply chain, we have led a consortium to buy up to seven gigawatts of US made solar panels annually starting in 2024. Finally, we see significant upside to our growth including green hydrogen in the US, should the proposed Inflation Reduction Act be approved. With that, I would like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Insoo Kim from Goldman Sachs. Insoo, your line is open. Insoo Kim : Thank you. First question starting off with the IRA bill. Thank you for the comments on potential upside and all that stuff. I guess, are you inferring that if this bill does pass as proposed that you could potentially see upside to your 7% to 9% EPS growth over the next few years on a CAGR basis? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes. Good morning Insoo. Look what we're saying is that there is a number of very good opportunities, which would be certainly made more likely by the IRA bill. And one of them for example is green hydrogen in the US. We'd also expect greater demand from utilities and corporate customers as well. So it's generally. So rather than say we're going to exceed that it certainly would push us towards the higher end if these come true. So that's how I would think about it. Insoo Kim : Okay. And you think at that higher end there's enough visibility of that if the component of the bill has passed? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes. I mean, I think there will be discrete projects potentially in green hydrogen. And also you would see it in the number of renewables that we signed in the US. Insoo Kim : Got it. My second question on that consortium for domestic panel manufacturing on solar. How should we think about what that does for the projects that get those panels domestically from a cost perspective, and just any changes to the return profile for those projects that we should be considering? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Well, this starts in 2024. I would say that the major component is the security of supply. As we've seen this just this week, having a domestic manufacturing is very beneficial. You'll also see that Fluence came out with an announcement that they're going to manufacture their modules in Utah, here in the States. So, I'd say, look, it's large enough that it should be cost competitive and so this would be incorporated and we have to see what is the market clearing prices here in the US for solar projects. Now as we talked about in the past, most of our projects in the US are bilateral, negotiated with corporate clients. We're not just adding a generic clean kilowatt hours, we're you're also adding other features and more value for our customers. So, I think this will help us be more cost competitive. I think that -- but, the most important factor is that it will insulate us from any sort of trade restrictions in the future on the imports of solar panels from Asia. So that is the -- I think the main benefit. Insoo Kim : Understood. Thank you so much. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Operator : Thank you, Insoo. Our next question comes from David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley. David, you may ask your question. David Arcaro : Hi. Good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. I was wondering on the pace of PPA signings here. What's the pace we should expect through the rest of the year? We've seen, I guess, a bit of a slowdown in the second quarter with the uncertainty around the tariff. But what's your confidence level right now in still achieving that 4.5 gigawatt to 5.5 gigawatt level by the end of the year? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes. Good morning, David. Great questions. As I had said on the prior call that we expected this to be more weighted towards the second half of the year, because of uncertainties that we continue to negotiate it with key clients, but there was a certain amount of price uncertainty that we had to have cleared and that has occurred. So, just as we speak right now, we expect to sign a another 500 megawatts roughly today and that would bring us up to 2.1 gigawatts. So, as of -- again, we expect sort of breaking news. We expect them to be signing as we speak. And if that occurs then we would be at 2.1 gigawatts, which is close to the half of the bottom range, but we do expect activity to pick up in the second half. So, we feel confident that we'll be in the range of 4.5 gigawatts to 5.5 gigawatts. These are lumpy. So, you noticed that this -- it's not like we're signing them in 50-megawatt increments. It had this occurred on day earlier, the information on the press release and our disclosure would have been different. So, we expect to sign this morning. And with that, we'd be at 2.1 gigawatts. David Arcaro : Got it. Okay. No, that's great to hear. It sounds like active dialogue going on obviously. And then, I just -- I wanted to touch on foreign exchange. We've seen some sizable moves in the foreign exchange rates. But are you seeing -- or any way you could quantify the potential kind of drag there is some impact on future years? And if efforts are kind of underway to look for offsets and to manage that any downside exposure there? Steve Coughlin : Yes, hey, this is Steve. So we are -- I think you're asking for the longer term, but we are very well hedged through 2023, even a little bit beyond. So actually -- we actually see some net upside frankly this year based on our hedge positions. The other thing to keep in mind is that, we're -- about 90% of our business is US dollar denominated. So where we're exposed is a limited set of businesses, its Argentina, its Brazil and Colombia. So it's basically a fairly small exposure. I think, in fact, in Brazil we've seen the real appreciate this year, so we've had some favorability there. So I would say, really, it's just we have to keep our eye on Argentina. We have ways to mitigate that. We have expenses in the country; have local debt in the country. So it's manageable within the guidance is how I would look at it. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes. I would add also that, part of that is Bulgaria. Steve Coughlin : Yes. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Which is euros. Steve Coughlin : Yes. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : So if you look at between dollars and euros, you're probably getting to about 95%. So we're very much in strong currency. This is, again, a decade of work and with the great job that the finance team has done in shaping our portfolio, but also making sure that the new contracts we sign are primarily in dollars. David Arcaro : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks so much. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, David. Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore. Durgesh, your line is open. Durgesh Chopra : Hey, good morning, Steve and Andr\u00e9s. Breaking news in the 500 megawatts. Can you -- is that what, with one customer? Congrats, by the way. Is that with one customer or is that multiple customers? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : That is one transaction. That is one transaction. Durgesh Chopra : Excellent. Congrats on that. Okay. So I wanted to kind of dig in a little bit on the alternative minimum tax and how do you think that impacts you and your business. I mean, I think, the last time we talked about it, the headwind was offset by credits. Maybe just talk to that. And then, Andr\u00e9s, I'd love to get your views on this transferability concept that is introduced in the bill. How do you think that works? Steve Coughlin : Okay. So I'll take on the tax side, I guess. So, look, it is still somewhat early. The situation is still fluid and moving around. But based on what we know at this point, we don't see any material impact from the 15% global min tax in the near term. So we'll continue to look into the details and monitor it and we'll make a final assessment once the bill is finalized. If anything, it would be several years into the future and I would expect that we would have offsets and planning activities by that time. So basically, this is like a -- it's a parallel methodology. We already are subject to the GILTI tax regime. This is just another way of calculating to ensure you reach a minimum. Again, I don't expect and our taxing doesn't expect it to impact us over the next few years. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes. Regarding your question on transferability, this is being able to sell tax credits to third parties. We don't see like a major impact, but we see it as an additional tool in our cash management practices. So that's favorable. Steve Coughlin : Yes. I mean, it could impact the way tax equity partnerships are structured, could make it simpler perhaps. So we've got to see what all the rules are around the transferability first. But if anything it looks that it may make the financing structure simpler to manage and account for. Durgesh Chopra : Got it, okay. I appreciate it certainly. So thank you for the discussion. Maybe just a really quick follow-up, Steve when you say several years out on the alternative minimum tax is that because of your U.S. businesses are not of that $1 billion threshold. Is that why it is, or when you say several years out, what does that mean? Steve Coughlin : Yeah. So there is a $1 billion test as you referred to. So I don't expect that we would meet that. And there's like a three-year I think averaging of that. I don't expect we would meet that for several years to come. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. Thanks for the time guys. Steve Coughlin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Sunderland from JPMorgan. Richard, your line is open. Richard Sunderland : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the time today. Starting with the 2H walk, I see $0.08 from new renewables. I'm curious is that pretty locked in given your commentary around only two projects shifting into 2023? I guess, similarly on that front, the $0.08 of LNG utilities and other, can you break that down to the component uses and relative line of sight to the U.S. utilities portion you've given Ohio remains outstanding? Steve Coughlin : Yeah. So the $0.08 of renewables, yeah, I feel very good about both of these buckets frankly. So the renewables is both the growth in new projects as well as we do have some higher generation out of our hydro portfolio. As you recall last year was a poor hydro year. So that's in that bucket as well. And then, on the utilities and LNG side, as Andr\u00e9s mentioned, we've had -- we've been really on the right side of things with the commodities this year. So LNG international prices are quite high. We have LNG position of course in our MCAC unit, specifically in Panama where we've had quite a wet year we've been able to not use that gas in Panama and redirect those cargoes and sell them on the international market. So there -- while that's not in the year-to-date, it is a year to go favorability. So that's a little over half I would say of that $0.08. We've got some additional utility growth baked in for the second half of the year. Those are the two primary components of that $0.08. And frankly, I see potential for even more upside. So that's -- and then, I think you asked about Ohio as well. So with Ohio where, -- as Andr\u00e9s said in his comments, we don't yet have a decision. It's not something that we had a material contribution assumed from the new rates this year. So certainly we look forward to a decision continue to expect a constructive outcome. But it's not going to be a driver one way or the other for this year. Richard Sunderland : Understood, I appreciate the color there. And they're thinking broadly about the U.S. green hydrogen opportunity. How do you think this, ties in with the existing renewables platform? How could it expand I guess both the demand for new renewables and timing with some of the more complex structured products opportunities you capitalized on in the past two years? Steve Coughlin : Well, as we said in the past we are looking at partnerships with producers of hydrogen to actually get more integrated in the whole production chain. So, what's very interesting is that the problem of producing cheap green hydrogen is very much like supplying 24/7 100% green energy or carbon-free energy to data centers. So, we think we have a leg up here. So, we're working on this. If the legislation passes then it's very likely to move forward. So, that's what we've been waiting for. In the meantime in Chile we have a different project which obviously does not depend on this. And that would be much more to supply the local market. And we have done a very good job of decarbonizing the Chilean system and the mining sector in particular. So, we feel good about both of these and these would be significant projects. So, they would accelerate the growth of renewables because of the additional demand. Richard Sunderland : Understood. Very helpful. Just one final cleanup for me. The Southland outage what led to that and any inflation impact there? Steve Coughlin : Yes. So it was actually Southland and also it was the same root cause at Indiana. So, there are veins on the turbine compressor unit I understand. So, don't go to go into too much detail but they -- there's a failure of component related to manufacturing defect. And so those units both have replacements in Eagle Valley in Indiana and our Southland the New Southland combined cycles in the gas turbine. So, those have been replaced. They are both back online at this point. Richard Sunderland : Understood. Thank you for the time today. Steve Coughlin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski from Seaport. Angie, your line is open. Angie Storozynski : Thank you. So, I wanted to go back to the Ohio rate case. I understand that it has no impact on the timing of the those decision on 2022, but it will have on 2023. I mean by all accounts it sounds like you will have to file an ESP. So, it might take time right to the final of the resolution? So, there should be an impact in 2023. And so in that context I mean can you -- I mean you mentioned that there is additional optionality around the LNG cargoes that could impact 2023. So, is it fair to assume that any impact by the shifting of the LNG cargoes also in 2023? Steve Coughlin : I mean it certainly could be. We're not necessarily attributing one as an offset to the other Angie. So, the issue -- the staff had already come out and supported a rate increase. The issue at hand was whether because we've historically had this rate stability charge in place. It's been in place for about 20 years now whether the rate any new rates could be implemented while that charge is still in place. And so that's I think the fundamental issue on being evaluated by the commissioners. If in fact the rates are frozen, we'll move quickly to file a new ESP, and that will have new riders associated with it. And so it would be more of a delay than anything. So at that point, the current rate stability charge would stay in place, we would file a new ESP and we would then \u2013 and that the new rates would be implemented once that ESP has been approved. So that would take into the middle of next year to some delay. We're still optimistic based on our belief of the \u2013 our legal position here that the rate freeze is not necessary or not \u2013 should not be required that the outcome will be in our favor on that. But regardless, we see a path to what we included in our guidance just could be a delay, if we have to go down the path of the rate freeze, as I described to get that ESP filed. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : And Angie, maybe to describe a little bit the opportunity in Panama. We have hydro, but we also have the LNG re-gasification terminal being at Henry Hub prices. Of course, Henry Hub prices plus transportation liquefaction re-gasification. But nonetheless, it's kind of a one-sided bet, because we have enough cash to fulfill our contracts, but we had the opportunity, if there is a lot of water a lot of water in the reservoirs to not burn, and therefore ship those cargoes to international customers at obviously the international rates. So there's a very interesting arbitrage opportunity there. So it's a one-sided bet. If it stops raining, or if the reservoir levels fall then we'll just consume the gas and fulfill our contracts. Angie Storozynski : And how sort of, are you going to know that? So in a sense, I mean, it's hard to predict hydro conditions, but I mean, is it a bit like a rainy season by some months? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yeah. So look, it's been raining a lot. So the rainy season has started. The reservoirs are full and that's why we're able to make these sell gas to international customers and get that arbitrage. What I'm referring to more really would be 2023 do these conditions persist, or does say 2023 start off being a very dry year. So for 2022, we're locked in. It's really a question of will this opportunity repeat in 2023. Angie Storozynski : Okay. Okay. So moving on to the other inflation bill, so I understand, the comments you made about green hydrogen and energy storage. But when you actually listen to smaller developers they are also talking about maybe installing \u2013 adding solar PV to existing sites of conventional power assets, retrofitting existing assets with storage facilities. I mean, some changes in repowering of wind farms. I mean, there are some I would say secondary benefits from that bill, which could also benefit your portfolio. I guess it depends on the age of your contracts, and how heavy they are in the money. But could you talk about again benefits or additional benefits that this bill could add to your existing portfolio? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yeah. Well, of course, I think it helps repowering and add-ons. What we have to see is that, we already have contracts in these places. And so the question is, do we negotiate an additional contract from that location based on \u2013 we've done repowering already we're starting to \u2013 we've been repowering units in California at Mountain View, and also we plan to do some in Maryland at Laurel Mountain. So this helps those to happen, and you're right. It does -- one does have to look at what you have existing and what additional opportunities there, but since we are on the renewable side pretty much fully contracted then the question would be that additional energy do you -- is there an adder that you could add to the same client to keep it simple, or what are the opportunities there? But you're right, this is an upside that's smaller so we haven't talked that much about it. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And lastly, I mean, we saw these media reports about Vietnam and offshore wind. I mean, I don't think that I've ever imagined yet and offshore winds in the same sentence. So could you talk about that opportunity? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Sure. You noticed it was in our press release. First, so I'd say, look this is a -- we're in Vietnam. We're helping the Vietnamese come up with a plan to decarbonize their grid. So we do have the LNG terminal project there. And we are -- have been talking about bringing in energy storage and other renewables. So, to eliminate the need for additional coal plants. So at this point, I'd say, this was more sort of an exploratory issue. We will be very disciplined and committed to all the goals that we've given 50% US, 50% renewables. Now whenever we get into a new technology, we'd obviously have to partner with somebody. So we haven't done any offshore wind, because it didn't make sense economically. The markets we're in like the US, there's still plenty of land and it just really wasn't cost competitive. But we have nothing, let's say, against the technology itself. But of course, we would have to partner with somebody who has a long experience. And so we're not going to get into a new technology in a large scale on our own at this time. And so this was -- again, this is not an announcement from us and what we guarantee is we're going to stick to the exact goals that we have given you. Angie Storozynski : Great. Thank you. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Angie. Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Julien, your line is open. Paul Zimbardo : Hi. Good morning. It's Paul Zimbardo sitting in this busy morning. Thanks a lot. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Good morning. Paul Zimbardo : I wanted to check in. I believe the last long-term guidance you gave for AES Next was breakeven net income by the end of the plan in 2025. That's still a good assumption? And how could that evolve under the Inflation Reduction Act? Steve Coughlin : Yes. Actually, it was 2024, Paul, that I said that. So look Fluence is the largest component of Next. So I can't go into detail, they'll have their call soon and we'll talk about their performance. But they've been executing on a number of things lately. As Andr\u00e9s talked about, they are launching their Utah manufacturing facility. They're diversifying their battery supply base. So, we fully expect based on what they've guided to which is that they'll be bottom line neutral by 2024. That's very consistent with what we've included in our guidance as well. And so I would say, they'll talk about their progress, but we feel good about both. But Fluence is doing as well as the levers that AES has regardless of what happens with Fluence that that portfolio will be neutral and then growing from there. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : And maybe speak a little bit about the other components like Uplight. As you know, they did the deal with Schneider Electric. So they now have a much, let's say wider product offering and very strong strategic partner in Schneider. And then you have 5B, which is the producer of Maverick the prefab solar. We're seeing a lot of interest in Maverick, where you have the first large-scale projects being completed in Chile. We have big projects in Puerto Rico. And we've already done a small project in Panama. So what's very important about this project is \u2013 this product is that it's hurricane wind resistant. So we're seeing a lot of interest in all sort of hurricane built of the Caribbean for this product. And there's also been a change of government in Australia. This is an Australian company. So they have very large projects in Australia, which were looking very favorably and that's the sort of hometown [indiscernible]. So we feel good about that as well. So overall we feel that AES Next is fulfilling its mission of really giving us the leading-edge technologies and giving us the opportunity to be the first to roll them out. Paul Zimbardo : Okay. Great. Thank you. And then just separately could you please elaborate a little bit on the recent California legislation, how that would impact either extending, increasing or both the cash flows from the gas assets you have there? Steve Coughlin : Yes. No we feel very optimistic. So we have \u2013 as I talked about previously, we've only included Southland legacy businesses, you've got Alamitos Huntington Beach and Redondo through 2023. So it may not be all three plants, but I would say probably at least two that we would expect to be extended possibly for several years. So the formal process I would expect in terms of permitting the ones through cooling permits that are needed, et cetera will likely kick off here in the next one to two months. And then that will run into the first say half of next year through the first half of next year. As we've done in the past, when we've been facing a potential extension, we've looked to do where we've executed contingent capacity contracts, continued upon the permitting and all that coming forward \u2013 going forward. So we'll start looking at commercial opportunities for the extensions, once the formal process gets underway in the state. And so we'll have more certainty next year but I would say, we're all very optimistic here that given the fundamentals of the California system and the droughts in the Southwest of the US but that additional peak capacity is going to be needed for several years to come. And so we feel we're in a good position to provide that and that will provide some upside to our plan. Paul Zimbardo : Great. Thank you, Coughlin. Steve Coughlin : Thank you, Paul Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Peters from Wolfe Research. David, your line is open. David Peters : Yes. Hey, good morning, everyone. Andr\u00e9s, I was just wondering if you could comment, specifically with respect to the US, LPA. We've heard from some companies here recently that they're seeing issues with panels being stopped recently at the border. Just wondering if you all are seeing this at all and if not kind of what you're doing differently I guess. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes. The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, we have not seen any of our panel imports stopped by -- excuse me. As you know we've been on top of this matter for a long time, the polysilicon -- first the panels that we import to the US, come from Southeast Asia ASEAN countries. And we have asked the manufacturers to make sure that there's nothing that comes from Western China, that could be allegedly using forced labor. Polysilicon, the plan is that we're starting to use polysilicon coming from Korea. And that China would be the more likely place, where you -- there could be allegations of forced labor. But as you know the making of the wafers themselves, 95% of that today is still occurring in China. So we have to move that supply chain out of China, but it's going to take some time. But the short answer is no, we haven't seen anything and we believe our suppliers are the best place not to have any issues and documentations and we've been working with them, for a long time now. So this is nothing new, but we have to just see how this develops. So we don't expect any major issues. David Peters : Great. And then just one other one on the asset sale target being at the low end, and I guess you're expecting a little less dilution this year, as a result too. Can you just give a little bit more of an update on the processes in Vietnam and Jordan? And just when are those expected to close I guess? Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Yes. Look, what's basically have, at least have to do with government approval. So we've agreed with our counterpart. It's not a question of price. It's just a question that the government -- well in the case of Vietnam, it's been the government's approval, of the new operator of the plant. And so that's taken some time for them to get comfortable with it. That's why it's dragged on. But we do expect resolution, by the end of this year. And the other case, I think you mentioned is Jordan, and that really has to do with some of the lenders including the US government signing off the loans, to the new buyers. So these have been really just bureaucratic issues, but the sale price, the buyer, the conditions have all been agreed to and it has taken longer than we expected. Steve Coughlin : Yes. Yes. And that's the majority of the $500 million. So we feel good, as Andr\u00e9s said, we'll get there on those by the end of this year. And then, we have been working on additional sales and sell-downs of primarily thermal businesses. So as we work towards those and the timing around those, some variability, it looks like some of that may happen in say the first half of 2023, which is why we said, let's focus on $500 million this year, the remaining of the $500 million to $700 million will come in through next year. And then we have the full $1 billion target, we feel well on track for. So, it's just a matter of some timing expectations around, what we're doing in the next say 12 months or so. David Peters : Okay. Thank you, guys. Andr\u00e9s Gluski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have no further questions. Therefore, I would like to hand back to Susan Harcourt, for any closing remarks. Susan, please go ahead. Susan Harcourt : We thank everybody for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any follow-up questions, you may have. Thank you and have a nice day. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen this is today's conference call. Thank you for being with us today. Have a lovely day ahead. You may disconnect your lines now.",

[Operator Instructions] I will now hand you over to your host, Susan, to begin. Susan, please go ahead. Susan Harcourt : Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2022 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements, which are discussed in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website along with the presentation. Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Coughlin, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will turn the call over to Andres. Andres Gluski : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2022 financial review call. This morning, we reported third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.63, bringing our year-to-date adjusted EPS to $1.18. With these results, we now expect our full year adjusted EPS to come in at or near the high end of our guidance range of $1.55 to $1.65. We're also reaffirming our 7% to 9% annualized growth target for adjusted EPS and parent cash flow through 2025. Steve Coughlin, our CFO, will discuss our financial results in more detail shortly. Our business model continues to demonstrate its resilience with strong contractual protections and natural hedges that have insulated us well from foreign currency movements, higher interest rates and volatile commodity prices. In addition, the vast majority of our business is with U.S. utilities or investment-grade off-takers. Turning to Slide 4. At the same time, we have built flexibility into our portfolio, which has allowed us to capture upside in the current environment. For example, in Panama, we've been able to redirect Henry Hub priced LNG to European markets to capitalize on high international gas prices. This upside is the direct result of actions we took in the past to create a diverse portfolio that would limit our downside exposure to fluctuations, both in commodity prices and hydrology. With above-average rainfall in Panama this year, we have been able to buy cheap hydro power and run our gas plant less, which has made it possible to redirect a portion of our contracted LNG creating meaningful upside in our results. Now to Slide 5. We spoke briefly about the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, on our previous call. But since then, it has become even more apparent how it is likely to greatly accelerate the demand for renewables and stand-alone storage in the U.S. We are very well positioned to capitalize on this demand and growth through our market leadership in renewables, particularly in the C&I segment due to our strong customer relationship, our ownership interest influence and our extensive and growing pipeline. Specifically, the IRA extends the production tax credit, or PTC, and the investment tax credit, or ITC, for 10 years and provides additional tax credits for energy communities such as low-income areas or places where coal mining or thermal generation previously took place. We anticipate that the benefits of the IRA will result in a meaningful step-up in demand across the U.S., but particularly from C&I customers looking to reach their decarbonization goals. The IRA also includes a 30% ITC for stand-alone energy storage. AES benefits not only from being one of the largest developers of energy storage projects, but also from our ownership stake influence, the market leader in energy storage integration. We see battery-based energy storage as an essential enabler of more renewables on the grid by reducing intermittency and providing renewables-based capacity. As you can see on Slide 6, to address this expected growth in demand, we have been working hard to grow our pipeline of renewables and energy storage projects. Today, our pipeline stands at 64 gigawatts or more than twice the size of our entire current portfolio. The majority of our pipeline, 51 gigawatts is in the U.S. and much of it is in the most attractive markets for renewables such as California and PJM. Our pipeline consists of projects that have a combination of land, interconnection access or advanced permitting. Approximately 1/3 of our pipeline is in the energy communities that I previously described and are eligible for additional tax credits. We believe our pipeline will become increasingly valuable as sites for projects become scarcer. Turning to Slide 7. At the same time, since our last earnings call in August, we have signed an additional 1.6 gigawatts of new renewable PPAs or 3.2 gigawatts year-to-date. Furthermore, we are in very advanced late-stage discussions on several large contracts that we expect will bring us within our full year range of 4.5 to 5.5 gigawatts. Today, our backlog of signed PPAs stands at 11.2 gigawatts, the majority of which is expected to come online by 2025. We remain largely on track with our construction program, which is now 5.2 gigawatts. There are some projects that have been moved from this year to next, primarily due to delays from customers. But as we've mentioned before, none of these projects are late due to a lack of solar panels. We also continue to make very good progress on our 2 very large green hydrogen projects in the U.S. and Chile, which include the integration of electrolyzers and renewables. Although we don't have any specific announcements to make today, we are confident that we will have more to share with you on this important initiative before the end of the year. Turning to Slide 8 for an update on growth initiatives at our U.S. utilities. This quarter, AES Ohio filed a new electric security plan or ESP 4, which outlines a comprehensive road map to position AES Ohio to resolve outstanding regulatory proceedings and make significant investments to modernize its network. The filing is a substantial achievement for AES Ohio as it will lay a strong regulatory foundation for growth by implementing a more traditional utility rate structure. We expect the public utilities kind of Ohio to approve ESP 4 in the next 12 months. As a reminder, AES Ohio has the lowest T&D rates in the state across all customer groups, and we see significant opportunity to invest to improve reliability and strengthen the balance sheet, while remaining cost competitive. Finally, AES Indiana is in the last phases of its integrated resource plan process and plans to file the 2022 IRP report with the state regulator by December 1. The proposal includes another milestone in AES' decarbonization plan with the conversion of the last remaining units of coal operated by AES Indiana to natural gas in 2025 and the addition of up to 1.3 gigawatts of renewables, including wind, solar and battery storage. With that, I now would like to turn the call over to our CFO, Steve Coughlin. Steve Coughlin : Thank you, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our third quarter results 2022 parent capital allocation and 2022 guidance. Turning to our financial results for the quarter beginning on Slide 10. I'm pleased to share that our third quarter results are very strong, and we now expect to be at or near the high end of our full year 2022 adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.55 to $1.65. Third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.63 versus $0.50 last year, driven primarily by our LNG business, as Andres discussed. In addition, we also benefited from an increased ownership in AES Andes as well as higher margins in Brazil. These positive contributions were partially offset by onetime charges at our U.S. utilities in Argentina businesses. Relative to last year, we also had higher losses from our AES portfolio as financial results from Fluence were not reported in our Q3 numbers last year, higher parent interest stemming from higher debt balances as we increase investment in our subsidiaries and a higher adjusted tax rate due to a nonrecurring benefit in Q3 2021. I should also note that despite considerable macroeconomic volatility, we see very little impact on our financial performance. For example, the forecasted full year impact of foreign currency movements after tax is well under $0.01 of adjusted EPS due to our highly contracted and largely dollarized business, along with our very active hedging program. In addition, nearly 80% of our debt is either fixed rate or hedged against interest rate exposure and approximately 82% of our revenue is protected by inflation index for hedging.  Turning to Slide 11. Adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, was $569 million for the quarter, a $141 million increase year-over-year due to the drivers I just discussed. I'll cover the performance of our strategic business units or SBUs in more detail over the next 4 slides, beginning on Slide 12. In the U.S. and Utilities SBU, lower PTC was driven primarily recognition of onetime expenses at our U.S. utilities from previously deferred purchase fuel and energy costs. Including those related to an outage at our Eagle Valley plant from April 2021 to March 2022. We pursued and entered into a settlement for Eagle Valley and took a provision against a deferred fuel recovery asset at AES Ohio, which we will continue to pursue. These expenses impacted adjusted PTC by approximately $48 million in the third quarter. In addition, lower PTC was driven by lower availability in Puerto Rico. Our legacy Southland units provided significant energy margin contribution again in the third quarter this year, although this was not a material year-over-year driver. We are also very pleased that in the third quarter, the California State Regulatory Authorities formally launched the process required to further extend our Southland legacy units beyond 2023. Higher PTC at our South America SBU was mostly driven by our increased ownership of AES Andes and higher margins at both AES Andes and Brazil, but partially offset by a provision in Argentina. Higher PTC at our Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, or MCAC SBU primarily reflects our commercial team's outstanding effort to redirect our LNG supply from Panama to the international market as discussed earlier. These LNG sales were enabled by the flexibility we built into our commercial structure and gas supply agreements along with favorable market conditions, which may be present going forward, although we expect to a more limited extent. Finally, in Eurasia, adjusted PTC was relatively flat year-over-year with an overall net benefit from higher power prices at our wind plant in Bulgaria. Now to Slide 16. As a result of our overall strong performance year-to-date, along with the significant contribution from LNG sales, we now expect to come in at or near the high end of our full year 2022 adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.55 to $1.65. Growth in the year to go will be primarily driven by contributions from new businesses, including roughly 500 megawatts of projects under construction coming online as well as further accretion from our increased ownership of AES Andes. We expect to recognize additional LNG sales in the fourth quarter, but the contribution will be much smaller than the benefit in Q3. We are also reaffirming our expected 7% to 9% annualized growth target through 2025, based primarily on our expected growth in renewables, energy storage and U.S. utilities. Turning to Slide 17. As Andres highlighted, the Inflation Reduction Act extended and expanded the tax incentives available for U.S. renewables and energy storage. Tax credits have been an important part of the economic value creation of our U.S. renewables portfolio, and the IRA provides clarity on long-term eligibility for these credits. As U.S. renewables become a larger share of our portfolio, I want to briefly touch on the way these tax incentives contribute to our earnings and cash flow. Our U.S. wind projects are typically eligible for production tax credits over the first 10 years of operations. Our solar and solar plus storage projects typically qualify for an investment tax credit generally recognized within the first 2 years, the project begins commercial operations. To ensure we take full advantage of the tax value of our U.S. renewables, we usually bring on partners that will invest in these projects to be allocated the majority of the associated tax attributes. These are called tax equity partnerships. It's important to recognize that as we monetize these tax credits, they create earnings and cash for AES. For full year 2022, we expect our projects to generate approximately $280 million to $310 million in new tax credits. After monetizing these credits through our tax equity partnerships, the earnings recognized by AES this year from new project commissioning\u2019s will be approximately $200 million to $230 million, with the remaining earnings from tax credits to be largely recognized next year. Due to the late year seasonality of new project commissioning\u2019s, approximately two-thirds of these earnings will occur in the fourth quarter. This year, we expect to commission more projects in the fourth quarter than in 2021 which will benefit our earnings in the year-to-go period, improving the year-over-year comparison of adjusted PTC in our U.S. and Utilities SBU by the end of the year. Now to our 2022 parent capital allocation plan on Slide 18. Sources reflect approximately $1.6 billion of total discretionary cash, including $900 million of parent free cash flow, $500 million of asset sales and $200 million of new parent debt. On the right-hand side, you can see our planned use of capital. We will return nearly $500 million to shareholders this year. This consists of our common share dividend, including the 5% increase announced last December and the coupon on the equity units. We plan to invest approximately $1.1 billion in our subsidiaries as we capitalize on attractive opportunities for growth. About half of these investments are in renewables, which represent the largest portion of our growth. Nearly a quarter of these investments are in our U.S. utilities to fund rate base growth with a continued focus on grid and fleet modernization. In summary, nearly 3/4 of our investments this year are going to grow AES' renewables businesses in our U.S. utilities, reflecting our commitment to continue executing on our portfolio transformation. In addition, approximately 70% of our planned future investments are targeted for our U.S. subsidiaries, which will contribute to our goal of more than 50% of our earnings coming from the U.S. in 2023. I look forward to AES continuing our strong performance this year and sharing updates with you on our fourth quarter call. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres. Andres Gluski : Thank you, Steve. In summary, we now expect our 2022 adjusted EPS to come in at or near the high end of our guidance range of $1.55 to $1.65, and we are reaffirming our 7% to 9% annualized growth target for adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow through 2025. Our strong financial results continue to demonstrate the resilience of our portfolio to macroeconomic volatility. We signed additional agreements that will redirect excess LNG from our business in Panama to international customers. We expect the Inflation Reduction Act to greatly accelerate the demand for renewables, stand-alone storage and green hydrogen. To address this growth in demand, we have increased our pipeline to 64 gigawatts, including 51 gigawatts in the U.S. and year-to-date, we have signed 3.2 gigawatts of renewables and energy storage under long-term contracts, and we are in late-stage discussions on several more that we expect will bring us within our full year range of 4.5 to 5.5 gigawatts. With that, I would like to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We have our first question comes from Insoo Kim from Goldman Sachs. Insoo, your line is open. Insoo Kim : First question on the revised outlooks that you gave on U.S. pipeline and also just the backlog that you've updated. Given the IRA has passed, especially while we await the 4Q earnings for more guidance, do you -- at this point, do you have a pretty good sense of how upside to that backlog you see, whether it's through '25, '26 and whether that still gives you a good confidence that there is potential to achieve the upper end of that 7% to 9% EPS growth range? Andres Gluski : Yes. Insoo, what I'd say is that we're seeing very strong demand, especially in the U.S. market, especially among C&I customers. So really, I don't think it's an issue of demand. It's really an issue of having permitted projects that can meet our clients' demand in the different markets. So regarding the -- our growth rates, we feel very confident about achieving our 7% to 9%. The IRA is obviously a positive to this number. But we expect some adjustments in the market. So it's not only a question of growth. It's really a question of the profitability of those projects. So what we expect over the next, I'd say, months or year is there to be somewhat more, let's say, scarcity of projects as demand increases. So I think that's where people who have gotten ahead of this and really have a mature pipeline are going to be in a substantial benefit. Obviously, the IRA also has a $3 a kilogram incentive for green hydrogen, and this is also going to be a plus for the growth of renewables and the growth of AES. So all these things I see is positive. But right now, we're saying 7% to 9%. But we're seeing -- as the market becomes more favorable, it's not just a matter of how much you can grow, it's really making sure that you grow profitably. Insoo Kim : And we'll await more guidance there. Second question for me on LNG. It seems like a pretty sizable benefit at the MCAC segment. I think on an EPS basis, $0.25 or so of benefit year-over-year, which from our perspective, was much greater than expected. Could you just give more details on, if you can, on how much of that -- how much volume was driving that? And while acknowledging the hydro conditions will dominate whether you could see any level of benefit going forward next year and beyond. Assuming normal hydro next year and the current prices and global gas, could that still provide some level of tailwind as we think about '23? Andres Gluski : Yes. I mean, as we laid out, we have structured our contracts such that, for example, if it's a dry year, we have all of the LNG that we need to be able to fulfill our thermal contracts. However, if you have a wet year, then you are able to buy cheaper hydro and redirect those shipments. And I think what's very important is not only having the LNG, but having the capacity to ship that mostly to Europe and really get into the port because as you know, there are really bottlenecks in the port. So I think this really talks about the flexibility that we built in, the strategic relationships we have with LNG suppliers that allow us to take advantage of their position in these markets to move those shipments. So going forward, I mean, basically, when there's a La Nina in Panama hydrology, there's more water available. So we've -- so -- there's also a factor that where -- what's the level of the reservoirs. So it's -- right now, I'd say that we expect the conditions to continue. We -- it's really a matter of the spread between Henry Hub plus the shipping and what international prices are. So as Steve mentioned, we expect -- we have some additional contracts coming in, in the fourth quarter. And regarding next year, it's really are the conditions there? Is there water in the reservoirs? Is the hydrology positive? Is there the spread between Henry Hub, again, plus shipping and international prices? So those are the conditions given. So this is mostly an upside, let's say, going forward. We're not counting on it. And regarding the tonnage, we would expect somewhat less next year than we have shipped this year in terms of the actual volume. We can get back to you on the actual volume that was shipped. Operator : We have our next question. This comes from Richard Sunderland from JPMorgan. Richard, your line is open. Richard Sunderland : I mean one of these broader play in inflation, thinking about the outlook through 2025 and the broader inflation backdrop, how do you see the cost savings opportunity through 2025 currently standing versus your Analyst Day plan? Andres Gluski : If I understood the question, right, you're basically saying that in the inflationary environment that we're in, how do we see cost savings developing? What I would say is that we -- given our international exposure, we're very accustomed to dealing with inflation and having to control costs in an inflationary environment. So what we've seen so far, as we've mentioned on prior calls is that the cost of building renewables has gone up over the past year. There's no question there were panel prices have gone up in the U.S., EPC costs have gone up. However, we're seeing in this strong market, we're -- this is basically able to pass through, we're able to maintain our margins on new projects. Going forward, I mean, we've had cost saving programs in place for the past 12 years. On a run rate basis, we've got about $500 million of cost. So again, we have the infrastructure in place. It's part of our culture, continual improvement. So we're not particularly concerned on that side. On the pricing side, about 80% of our contracts and businesses have some form of inflation indexation. So we're very well protected on that side as well. So we have the experience. We have the methodology. It's part of our mindset. So we don't see that as a particular concern. Steve Coughlin : This is Steve. I would just add also, if you look at the escalation of fuel prices on the thermal side, they've gone tripled in some cases. So renewables, although the costs have increased are relatively more competitive than they were before this current inflationary cycle. And then in addition, we have the benefit with renewables, we're largely firming up prices right around the time that we're also signing up our PPA. So you have a good sense of what your levelized cost is over the life of the project and very little variable costs, of course. So we are able to build in this into the market. And then, of course, the IRA bill in the U.S., certainly with the expansion and extension and re-upping of credits, does serve to offset some of these additional inflationary increases in the renewables capital cost. So that's as an opposing effect, helping bring prices somewhat back down off of what they otherwise would have been. Richard Sunderland : No, that certainly makes sense. And I appreciate the color there. And maybe Steve, picking up that last point around the IRA. Curious on transferability could impact your tax credit outlook? Is this an opportunity to invest more on a net to AES basis or any other impacts you foresee? Steve Coughlin : Yes. Certainly, transferability. I mean what we like about the IRA is it brings a lot of optionality, a lot of flexibility. It brings the production tax credit as an option for solar. And certainly, that could be a opportunity for high installation is in the southwest of the U.S., for example, may be the best option. So with transferability, it certainly adds more liquidity to, I would say, a more liquid market to monetizing the tax attributes. There are still some significant benefits to having tax equity partnerships, though, where you have the tax depreciation benefit in addition to the credit that you're monetizing as well as just in the way these projects get structured, there's a step-up in the value of the assets when they're contributed to a partnership and there's a benefit to the value of the tax attributes when that occurs as well. So it does add some optionality, flexibility. And so for us, it's good to have in our toolkit. And then down the road, we'll look to see as AES moves forward in time, we may be able to utilize some of these tax credits for our own account, but I wouldn't expect that until several years down the road. Operator : Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski from Seaport. Angie, your line is open. Angie Storozynski : So first, just one clarification. So Stephen, you talked about the ITC contributions from the new build this year and the carryforward for 2023. Is there some change here versus how you have been accounting for these? I mean, I'm just trying to make sure that it's not somehow related to the IRA and some different recognition of the tax attributes. Steve Coughlin : No. No, Angie. No change. But what we wanted to do was, a, as the IRA has been put in place and now we see the tax credits having a much longer life cycle extension well into the next decade. We wanted people to understand this is part of the economics of renewables of the whole in the U.S. We wanted people to understand what it means for AES and that this is a long runway and is an important component of how these assets get monetized and the return gets earned. The -- certainly, they will -- this will escalate over time. So we should expect that as we grow the business as anyone would grow the business, they'll have more share of credits. The other thing we wanted to point out is just if we look at the U.S. and utilities business unit, the fourth quarter, the skew towards the fourth quarter is, in large part, driven by the fact that we are commissioning more projects typically in the fourth quarter, more renewables projects and the tax credit recognition for the investment tax credit is tied to the commissioning. And so we will see a lift in the U.S. fourth quarter results as we did last year, as we will again this year in the fourth quarter as a result. So it was really those 2 reasons I wanted to point out the IRA and then the seasonality of the tax credit recognition in the U.S. and utilities SBU. Angie Storozynski : And secondly and probably most importantly, so I remember a couple of quarters back, you guys had the seemingly lost growth targets. 4.5 to 5.5 gigs of PPAs per year. It seems like you're tracking well against that. I'm just wondering if there's any upside to that number. And even more importantly, it seems like you guys have more than 5 gigs of capacity under construction. And so I'm just hoping to get some reassurance how you're coping with that level of activity? And if you -- if there is a possibility to increase it and how, again, like logistically, can you handle that many projects? Andres Gluski : Yes. Thank you, Angie. That's a great question. Yes, we have a significant step-up in our construction between this year and next. And you correctly point out, we have more than 5 gigawatts currently under construction. I think we've handled it very well. We have doubled the amount of people that we have working on construction in renewables in the U.S. We have been working with strategic EPC contractors, meaning that we can give them not sort of just project by project, but really a line of sight, how much work they're going to get over the next 2 years, so they're able to staff up. So we've done very well there. I think we've done a very good job of managing the solar panel supply, which has been very turbulent. We've had no delays this year due to solar panels. We have already most of the solar panels that we need for 2023. So we're working very closely with that also the inverter. So I feel very good about that. We have done a lot of outside the renewables area, a lot of big projects. So I think we have experience there. So I feel very comfortable. We will have a roughly doubling of what we commissioned this year to next year. And again, we've been worried about the supply chain. We started more than 2 years ago. So we, I think, are in as good shape as anybody in handling it. And I think the results speak for themselves. We haven't had to delay any projects because of a lack of supplies or a lack of construction workers or anything of the sort. Regarding sort of the upside, as I said, the IRA does provide upside. It has good incentives for renewables. They will be, I think, increasing demand certainly from corporations. And I think what's very important is we're not just looking at increasing our growth rate but making sure that we're growing profitably and growing well. Angie Storozynski : And my last question about the financing of that incremental growth, especially in this higher interest rate environment. So I mean, are you revisiting the past idea of more of like a systematic recycling of capital from your existing assets? Is there again, especially ahead of the announcement for green hydrogen projects. I mean I'm assuming that, that comes with a pretty aggressive capital outlays. So how do you finance it? Andres Gluski : What I'd say, we're going to continue to churn capital. As our projects mature, it's a way of increasing our return on invested capital. As you know, once we finish renewable projects, we sell down to people who want a fully contracted U.S. dollar renewable. So our plan through 2025 that we've laid out is fully financed. If we were going to know I would say, going forward, if there are additional very profitable opportunities, we'll have to look at that, but we have a lot of options. We have a lot of options. We're investment grade. And as we have done in the past, we can turn more quickly some of our assets in terms of our sell-downs. Operator : Our next question comes from Nick Campanella from Credit Suisse. Nick, your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : This [Fae] is for Nick today. I just want to quickly touch on Ohio rate case. We saw some peers going through this process, having some challenges there. Could you just update us on how you're managing your regulatory strategy in Ohio and the rate outcome there? If there's any changes from the last update. But again, recognizing Ohio is pretty -- has a pretty minimal impact to the consolidated EPS. Just any color would be appreciated. Steve Coughlin : Yes. No, happy to. This is Steve. We are being very strategic. And I'm sure you saw that we did file for an electric security plan for, so our ESP 4 very recently. So we are still awaiting the decision from the utility commission on the rate case that's outstanding. We are expecting that decision still before the end of the year. . But look, the issue at hand is whether rates need to be frozen while we currently have this rate stability charge that's been in place for about 20 years. We think there is broad support for the new rates that are -- have been asked for in the plan and the staff came out and supported those. So what we decided to do was go ahead and chart a path to moving on to a new ESP regardless of what this outcome is in this case. And therefore, that clock has already started ticking. As Andres said, we'd expect that to be resolved by middle to second half of next year on the ESP 4. And our focus is really on growing the utility. As Andres said, this is a utility where we have the lowest rates by far across all customer classes. We want to get to a place. There's a significant opportunity for upgrades and investments, and we want to have a healthy structure from which to continue investing in a healthy balance sheet for the utility. So the ESP 4 was filed to give that path there. We still believe in the case that we filed and that the stability charge can still be in place. But in the case that the commission decides they want to hold rates until that stability charge is retired, then we'll have this ESP 4 path -- it's already out there. It's already being in the process, and we'll have that then by the middle of next year as opposed to waiting for this to be decided and then going ahead and creating what's the next security plan. So that was our goal and our thinking here. And as I said, we still expect a decision this year on the case. Operator : Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith. Julien, your line is open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Congratulations on the continued success here. If I can, just to pivot back to where we started with some of this conversation. I want to try to get back at some of the tax credit dynamics and how that plays itself out over the next few years. So clearly, you all have outperformed on continued backlog generation and bring into construction. Can we talk about some of the cadence of in-service here and how that translates back to credit? I appreciate the detail on '22 about what that means on an income basis. But can you talk a little bit relative to the earlier guidance, what was embedded as far as earnings expectations? And then try to transpose that against where we are against the current cadence of when is that construction progress going to reach in-service? When is that backlog effectively fully in service, right, i.e., over the next 2 or 3 years? I just try to reconcile prior versus today on the updated backlog as well as considering the pivot to a solar PTC from an ITC, which also may meet be something of an offset to the positives described here? Andres Gluski : Okay. Julien, good to talk to you, there are a lot of questions. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Sorry, I know a lot take it as you will. Andres Gluski : So let me -- let me try to frame it we'll answer between Steve and myself. So I guess the first question is, I think regarding the new IRA, it does give us flexibility to choose in terms of ITC, PTC on some projects. This will start in 2023, which is somewhat of a -- I'd say it's a slight upside there. Regarding sort of the cadence, these do tend to be somewhat backloaded in the end of the year. So that Steve had mentioned, this is just because of the financing structure. So it tends to be Q3, Q4. And I think that will continue to be so going forward. In terms of our backlog, yes, I mean we have -- as we mentioned, it's 11.2 gigawatts, and the vast majority of that is going to be commissioned before end of 2025. So there are a few projects that go beyond that. So as projects get commissioned, new ones come into the backlog. I think what's important, again, if you think of this in terms of our installed capacity, it's -- the backlog is one-thirds of our current installed capacity. So we feel good about our growth rates. We feel good about the -- who we're contracting with. So our growth in the U.S., of course, is investment-grade off-takers, utilities and -- but mostly corporate clients and internationally as well. What we're signing overseas is mainly in Chile with people like Codelco, big copper exporter, others that -- it's -- we feel it's just as good a risk as if they were in the U.S. So I think I'll pass it off to Steve to get a little bit more in the weeds of the tax itself, some of your other questions. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And if I can, just to clarify, if you don't mind, just to jump in, the cadence by year rather not by intra-quarter kind of thing, but by year breaking down that 11 gig, if we can. Just -- again, I'm just trying to reconcile the older expectations versus newer and try to understand how many gigs per year you can kind of credibly expect? Andres Gluski : What I would say is, look, we're going from about, I think, less than 2 gig this year, somewhere around 4 gigs next year. And then at some point, if you are always signing 5 gigs of new renewable contracts, you will be commissioning or bringing online 5 gig. The 2 sort of come together. So the catch-up is -- the biggest catch-up will be next year. And then you have the 2 lines going in parallel. Now again, if our signings increase, well, then there will be a lag of about a -- let's say, between 18 months and 24 months between the greater number for signing PPAs and the commissionings are bringing online. Steve Coughlin : Yes. And Julien, so I would say, also taking the number -- Andres said 4 gigawatts next year, that will continue to grow. This is our main growth business for us. It's 5 gigawatts, 6 gigawatts. We'll give more color on that next year as we update our guidance. And then I would look at that and say that roughly, on average, say, two-thirds of that is in the U.S. And then a larger share of that is solar and solar plus storage of that that's in the U.S. So say, roughly 75% today is solar, solar plus storage of the U.S. backlog. And so that's ITC qualified. We can't elect PTC now, as I said, we're looking at that where it makes sense for the returns, and that's typically where you have higher capacity factors, where the installation is high as, say, the Southwest of the U.S. The credits will continue to increase significantly. I think next year is on is going to be a big jump year-over-year because the level of commissioning is going way up next year. And it is heavily weighted towards the fourth quarter of the year. But as we continue to grow this business, the timing will become less of an issue as we get to more of a consistent state of additions year-over-year. But the credits are an important part of how it's monetized and wanted to show that given the IRA and also given how the U.S. Utilities SBU seasonality is becoming more shaped by the renewables, the clean energy business in the U.S. but it's important for everyone to understand what that looks like for modeling purposes. Operator : We have our next question comes from Ryan Levine from Citi. Ryan, your line is open. Ryan Levine : I wanted to follow up on some of the ITC clarifications. So as you're looking for the U.S. portion, what adders are you assuming that you'll be able to realize as you move forward with these projects? And specifically, are you seeing any low mineral income adders anticipated for your solar projects and both in your current portfolio? And then on a go-forward basis, are you looking to evolve what types of projects you're pursuing in light of the details of the IRA? Steve Coughlin : Yes. So you're talking about like the adders for the energy communities and domestic content, things like that. Is that right? Ryan Levine : Correct. Steve Coughlin : So yes, I think roughly one-third of our U.S. pipeline today is in these energy communities that qualify for the 10% adder. I think as we move forward, then we look at domestic content, we are a leader. We've launched our U.S. solar buyer consortium. We expect first supplies from that in 2024. So I would expect us to be having a share. I don't have a specific percentage right now, but a material share of our projects meeting the domestic content production in 2024. And then we are fully ready to be qualified for the wage and apprenticeship requirements and training already. So that's a nonissue. We're already have that 30% level with our project. And then I would expect at least one-third to be in that 40% level and some perhaps even higher up to 50% with the domestic content as that starts to become part of our panel supply in '24 and beyond. Ryan Levine : And then in terms of the transferability comments, as you're looking to make decisions around whether or not to use tax equity partners or utilize the transferability feature. Has that fully been determined at this point? Or is there still some negotiation or analysis that needs to do to determine how you'll structure for future deals? Steve Coughlin : I mean, I would say, look, I think the -- for us, as a leader in the market, we have a lot of long-term deep relationships on the tax equity side. So for us, and we have a lot of capabilities of very -- the top talent in the industry on structuring these projects on the commercial side, on the tax side so that we're optimizing returns. So for us, as I said before, transferability is an option, I'm not convinced, in fact, that it actually optimizes returns because there is the tax depreciation component, which is also an important component of value of the accelerated depreciation. So -- and they're structuring to step up the value of these projects as once they're built, the value of them is typically higher than what the capital cost was. So there's an important -- it's important that we pay attention to returns. And for us, transferability, although it brings more liquidity to the market. AES as a leader already has I would say, the liquidity we need to monetize the tax attributes. So we'll look at it, but there's nothing -- I wouldn't say for us, it's a significant game changer, given our scale existing capabilities. Operator : We have our last question comes from Gregg Orrill from UBS. Gregg, your line is open. Gregg Orrill : Congratulations. Regarding the LNG success year-to-date and your thoughts on next year, just in terms of the repeatability there. What gives you the confidence there? If there's anything you could share about what you might have sold forward or thoughts on what sort of conditions need to repeat for you to deliver that again? Andres Gluski : Yes. Gregg, I would say, look, -- what we said is that there are -- there is a continuation of this into the fourth quarter, a bit smaller. There's a possibility for next year. And that will depend on the spread between, again, Henry Hub plus prices that we get on our contracts and prices in Europe. So that's really the importance. I think in terms of the hydrology, we need continued good hydrology in Panama, and reservoirs are quite high. So we're going in, in a favorable condition. So it really is what will be the spreads that justify this making that shipment. And I would say also, we would expect less volume in any case next year than this year. So it would be an upside. We're not counting on a very large amount of LNG. So conditions, it looks like it's a possibility, but we're not counting on it. And those are the drivers. And so I think you can see how those drivers are moving and see there's a possibility for this. Steve Coughlin : Yes. And I would say just to add, for the fourth quarter of this year, we've already -- for whatever we would do with LNG has done for this year. So we've already -- we have a much smaller upside in the fourth quarter already built into our commentary on meeting the -- at or near the top end of our guidance range. So that any additional volumes would be -- we'd be talking about next year and whether the market conditions, as Andres said, are conducive to that, we think it's very possible, and it would be more upside. But for this year, we've already contracted what we could contract. Gregg Orrill : Does where you end up this year? Obviously, you've said at or near the top of earnings guidance. Does that have an impact at all on how you think about giving '23 guidance? Does it serve as a base or some kind of reference point? Or are you still sort of pointing back to a different base? Andres Gluski : We'd be pointing back to the different base. I mean we've said 7 to 9 growth and through 2025, and that's what we're committed to achieving. So it's not changing our base year for our growth rate. Steve Coughlin : Yes. And that was my -- yes. It's a very good year. I think there's more upside, as Andres said. But I wouldn't say it's such a new baseline because this isn't necessarily a recurring at this level thing. Operator : We have no more further questions on the line. I will now hand back to Susan for closing remarks. Susan Harcourt : We thank everybody for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have. We will look forward to seeing many of you at the EEI Financial Conference later this month. Thank you, and have a nice day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

My name is Candice, and I will be your moderator for today\u2019s call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand you over to our host, Susan Harcourt, Vice President of Investor Relations. The floor is yours. Please go ahead. Susan Harcourt : Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter and full-year 2022 financial review call. Our press release, presentation, and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements, which are discussed in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website along with the presentation. Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Coughlin, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will turn the call over to Andres. Andres Gluski : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full-year 2022 financial review call. Today, I will discuss our 2022 financial results and strategic accomplishments, as well as our 2023 guidance. Steve Coughlin, our CFO will discuss our financial results and outlook in more detail shortly.  Beginning with our 2002 results and accomplishments on Slide 3. I am very pleased with our performance in 2022, which was our best year ever. Adjusted EPS came in at $1.67, above our guidance range of $1.55 to $1.65. This accomplishment is primarily the result of three factors : strong performance across our portfolio, growth in renewables, particularly from solar and energy storage in the U.S., and the benefit of embedded optionality in our LNG contracts. Turning to Slide 4. I would like to highlight an area in which we are particularly proud of our performance, our success in bringing our construction projects online. In 2022, despite numerous market-wide challenges throughout the year, we added approximately 2 gigawatts of new projects to our portfolio, which was consistent with our expectations at the beginning of the year. Our success was the result of the extensive work we have done to develop the people, processes, and solid supplier relationships to rapidly expand our portfolio of renewables. We see our ability to execute as the source of competitive advantage that is highly valued in the marketplace. Not only does it support our strong global customer relationships, but it also contributes to our confidence in our long-term forecast. In addition to our execution, 2022 was a year where we focused on taking actions that will position us well for future growth. These actions included signing a record number of new PPAs for projects that we will complete in the coming years, investing in our pipeline of future projects, creating a leading position in green hydrogen, establishing strong regulatory foundations to support future utility growth, and achieving significant cold phase out milestones in Hawaii and Chile. As you can see on Slide 5, 2022 was a record year for PPA signings for AES. We signed 5.2 gigawatts of renewables under long-term contracts, increasing our backlog to 12.2 gigawatts. In fact, for the second year in a row, BNEF reported that AES signed more renewable deals with corporate customers than anyone else in the world. This included an expansion of our 24/7 structured projects. Moving to Slide 6. We also worked hard throughout the year to grow our pipeline of future projects, which increased by 25% to 64 gigawatts, including 51 gigawatts in the U.S. We see extensive and growing demand for renewables worldwide and expect that in the future a key limitation to growth will be the availability of projects. We have been preparing by investing in land, interconnections, and permitting work to advance the projects that will be used for future PPA signings. Turning to Slide 7. We also established ourselves as a leader in green hydrogen. In December, we announced a partnership with Air Products to develop, build, and own, and operate the largest green hydrogen production facility in the U.S. This project will have the capacity to produce more than 200 metric tons per day of green hydrogen and will include approximately 1.4 gigawatts of wind and solar generation. It builds upon the expertise we have developed in combining renewables to create around the clock carbon free energy. This project has the potential to serve approximately 4,000 trucks, which while significant represents less than 0.1% of the current market for long haul trucking. As such, we see a massive total addressable market for decarbonizing the transportation sector. Turning to Slide 8. Another focus of our 2022 work was to develop strong regulatory foundations for future growth at our U.S. Utilities, where we expect to grow the combined rate basis 9% annually through 2025. Specifically, at AES Ohio, we filed a new electric security plan or ESP 4 to enhance and upgrade the network and improve service reliability.  With the lowest [CND rates] [ph] in the states, across all customer categories, AES Ohio is well positioned to make the much needed customer centric investments. A ruling by the Ohio Commission on ESP 4 is expected this summer. Finally, we're pleased with the constructive outcome of AES Ohio's distribution rate case in which the Ohio Commission approved an annual revenue increase of $75.6 million. At AES Indiana, we filed our integrated resource plan for IRP with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission in December. AES Indiana's near term plan includes the conversion of the utility's last two coal units to natural gas in 2025 using an existing on-site gas pipeline. It also includes the addition of up to 1.3 gigawatts of new wind, solar, and energy storage by 2027 and should reduce AES Indiana's carbon intensity by two-thirds from 2018 to 2030. This plan is an important step to fully transition away from coal and provides the opportunity for substantial additional investments at AES Indiana. Now, turning to our outlook for 2023 on Slide 9. Today, we're initiating adjusted EPS guidance of $1.65 to $1.75, and reaffirming our long-term growth rate of 7% to 9% through 2025 for both adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow of a base year of 2020. Our focus this year will remain on execution. As you can see on Slide 10, we expect to complete approximately 3.4 gigawatts of new projects, including 2.1 gigawatts in the U.S. I will note that our 2023 guidance range does not include a potential upside from 600 megawatts of projects currently scheduled to be completed in December 2023, but which are likely to come online in 2024. Looking at our growth through 2025 on Slide 11. We expect to maintain the pace of PPA signings we have established with an estimated 14 gigawatts to 17 gigawatts expected to be signed over the next three years. We see strong demand for renewables across all of our key markets, particularly the U.S. where the benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act or IRA are becoming even clearer. Thus, given the strength of our backlog and our visibility into future PPA signings and project completions. We are confident in reaffirming our long-term guidance through 2025. Finally, today we're announcing that we will hold an Investor Day this spring, we will be sharing our strategic long-term view of the company, introducing new business segments, and extending our long-term growth rate. We will provide additional details at a later date. With that, I now would like to turn the call over to our CFO, Steve Coughlin. Steve Coughlin : Thank you, Andres, and good morning everyone. Today, I will cover the following key topics. Our financial performance during 2022, our parent capital allocation, and our 2023 guidance and expectations through 2025. As Andres mentioned, our results for 2022 demonstrate the strength, resiliency, and flexibility of our portfolio as we surpassed our guidance range of $1.55 to $1.65. Overall, our portfolio was well structure to perform in the current market environment and is well-positioned for growth as AES continues to lead the global energy transition. Turning to Slide 13. Full-year 2022 adjusted EPS was $1.67 versus $1.52 in 2021, driven primarily by a significant volume of LNG sales in our increased ownership of AES Andes. These positive drivers were partially offset by unplanned outages, several one-time expenses we recorded at our U.S. and utilities and South America SBUs, a higher share count as a result of the 2021 accounting adjustment for our equity units, and higher parent interest stemming from higher debt balances. The $1.67 per share also includes approximately $0.12 of losses from AES Next. Primarily from our ownership in Fluence, which served as an additional drag year-over-year. We expect Fluence's results to significantly improve beginning this year as they discussed on their recent earnings call. Turning to Slide 14. Adjusted pretax contribution or PTC was $1.6 billion for the year, an increase of 149 million and a 11% growth over 2021. I'll cover our results in more detail over the next four slides, beginning with the U.S. and utilities SBU on Slide 15. Lower PTC in the U.S. was primarily driven by the recognition of one-time expenses from previously deferred purchased fuel and energy costs at our utilities. Outages at Southland Energy and AES Indiana in the second quarter and lower contributions from Clean Energy and the retirement of our coal plant in Hawaii. Partially offset by higher contributions from our Southland legacy assets in the third quarter. Higher PTC at our South America SBU was primarily driven by our increased ownership of AES Andes and higher margins at both AES Andes and AES Brazil, but partially offset by a prior year gain related to an arbitration at Alto Maipo, outages at AES Andes and a one-time regulatory provision in Argentina. Higher PTC at our MCAC SBU reflects the benefit from a large volume of LNG sales redirected to the international market. As I'll discuss later, we do not expect an opportunity of the same scale recur this year and anticipate lower PTC from MCAC in 2023. The LNG sales were partially offset by the full-year impact from the sale of our coal plant in the Dominican Republic in 2021. Finally, in Eurasia, adjusted PTC was relatively flat year-over-year with an overall net decline driven by higher interest expense, but partially offset by higher energy prices earned at our wind plant in Bulgaria. Now, let's turn to how we allocated our capital in 2022 on Slide 19. Beginning on the left hand side, sources reflect 1.3 billion or total discretionary cash. This includes parent free cash flow of $906 million, which was near the top end of our guidance expectations. Asset sales were below our expectations for the year, but we still expect to achieve our goal of $1 billion in proceeds by 2025. Given the delay in asset sales, we accelerated the issuance of some parent debt, which is within our long-term expectations. Moving to uses on the right hand side. We invested more than 700 million in growth at our subsidiaries, of which approximately two-thirds were in the U.S. We also allocated nearly 500 million of our discretionary cash to our dividend. Turning to our guidance and expectations, beginning on Slide 20. Today, we are initiating 2023 adjusted EPS guidance of $1.65 to $1.75. This year, we expect to commission approximately 3.4 gigawatts of new renewables, which is the largest year-over-year increase in AES history. This growth further validates AES' position as a leader in renewables and highlights the outstanding efforts of our commercial and operations teams in our markets. Roughly 65% of this new renewable capacity is located in the U.S. More than half our total 2023 adjusted PTC will come from the U.S. this year as we execute on the transformation of our portfolio. As I discussed last quarter, our U.S. renewables projects benefit from both investment tax credits and production tax credits. Our 2023 guidance includes approximately 500 million of adjusted PTC from tax credits generated and recognized by new U.S. renewable projects coming online this year, which is approximately double the amount from 2022. Tax credits are an important component of our renewables business earnings and cash flow and we intend to provide updates on our 2023 tax credit expectations throughout the year. While the midpoint of our 2023 guidance range is below our long-term annual growth target, we are reaffirming the 7% to 9% growth rate through 2025. 2023 growth is lower than the long-term trend for a few reasons. First, we've taken a conservative approach to modeling renewables projects expected to come online in 2023. Our renewables construction is typically concentrated in the fourth quarter and this year will be no exception. As a result, construction delays of only a few days could cause a project to shift from 2023 to 2024 and negatively impact this year's results. This is particularly relevant for our U.S. renewables projects where we recognized significant earnings from investment tax credits in the year a project is placed into service. Of the 2.1 gigawatts we plan to complete in 2023, two-thirds are expected to come online in the fourth quarter. Our guidance assumes that an additional 600 megawatts of projects currently scheduled to come online in December slip into 2024. If some or all of these projects are completed on schedule, this will create up to $0.10 of upside to our 2023 guidance. It's also important to note that even if there are delays to next year, this is only a timing issue with no material value impact. And would support higher growth in 2024 with no impact on our long-term growth rate expectation. Second, we expect to see lower contributions from our MCAC SBU on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by more than 200 million of adjusted PTC from LNG sales we executed in 2022. Our commercial team was able to leverage the optionality embedded in our LNG supply contracts to capitalize on high international gas prices by redirecting Henry Hub-linked LNG cargoes to the international market. Although LNG sales will continue in 2023, we do not expect the same magnitude of opportunity as the spreads between Henry Hub and international gas prices have compressed and more of our gas supply this year is linked to TTF international prices rather than Henry Hub. Third, we expect to see lower margins at our Chile business this year, particularly in the first half of the year, which is a temporary impact of our Green blend and extend strategy to transition our customers from coal power to renewables. Several coal PPAs have or will expire this year as we proceed with our intent to fully exit coal by 2025, and others have been restructured to be priced off renewables that are still under construction. We view this as a short-term cost of decarbonizing our portfolio and do not expect any impact to our 7% to 9% long-term growth rate. Looking ahead, our teams are working on commercial solutions to mitigate the dilution as the portion of our earnings from coal continues to decline. Based on the drivers discussed, we expect our 2023 earnings to be significantly second half weighted with approximately three quarters recognized in the second half of the year. While we typically have had about two-thirds of our earnings in the second half, the increase in seasonality this year is driven by the significant volume of new U.S. renewable projects coming online in the fourth quarter. Now, turning to our 2023 parent capital allocation plan on Slide 21, beginning with approximately 2.2 billion of sources on the left-hand side. Parent free cash flow for 2023 is expected to be 950 million to 1 billion, in-line with our annualized growth target. In addition to parent free cash flow, we expect to generate 400 million to 600 million in asset sale proceeds this year. This includes our previously announced sale in Jordan, as well as the pending sell-down of some of our operating renewables in the U.S. I also want to point out that we intend to relaunch the sale process for our Mong Duong coal plant in Vietnam to better align with the approval requirements that became clear during the initial sale. The remaining portion of our 2023 asset sales is expected to come from additional sell-downs and sales supporting our decarbonization goals. Now, to the uses on the right-hand side. We plan to invest approximately 1.7 billion toward new growth, of which about two-thirds will be allocated in the U.S. to renewables and to increase our utility rate base. We expect to allocate approximately 500 million to our shareholder dividend, which reflects the previously announced 5% increase. In summary, we exceeded our financial commitments for 2022 and are confident in this year's guidance and the long-term outlook for AES. The energy transition provides tremendous investment and innovation opportunities, and I believe no company is better positioned than AES to lead this transition. As we execute on our strategy, we will continue to deliver on our financial commitments to maximize per share value for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres. Andres Gluski : Thank you, Steve. In summary, 2022 was our best year ever. Not only did we meet or exceed our targets for adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow, but we signed more PPAs and added more renewables to our portfolio than ever before. Once again, we were recognized by BNEF as the top developer worldwide, selling clean energy to corporations through PPAs. We also launched the first mega scale green hydrogen project in the U.S. and developed a regulatory foundation that will enable us to grow our U.S. utilities by 9% annually through 2025. Looking forward, we are very well positioned for the future. Our leadership in corporate PPAs and green hydrogen gives a line of sight into our continued success. We remain focused on executing on our construction program and further developing our pipeline of potential future projects, and we are on track to exit coal by the end of 2025. With that, I would like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] So, our first question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Angie Storozynski : Good morning, guys. So first, maybe about the disclosure that you guys have in the \u2013 in your presentation, I understand that there's an Analyst Day coming, but there are a number of slides that are missing, especially the segmental earnings contributions for 2023. I mean, is there any reason for that? Steve Coughlin : Yes, Angie, hey it's Steve. So yes, and that's because, as Andres shared in his remarks, we are intending to update you on our new business segments. And so when we issue that level of guidance, it will come in the Investor Day. Angie Storozynski : Okay. I understand. Okay. Just moving on, just looking at the year-over-year bridge between 2022 and 2023 [EPS] [ph] there is no benefit from lower losses of AES Next. And I'm just wondering, I mean, it's not even mentioned as a driver. Can you comment about your expectations for that business? Steve Coughlin : Yes. So Next, in total, Angie, was roughly a $0.12 drag last year. We have to be careful because Fluence is a separate public company, and we can't get ahead of their disclosures. They haven't specifically guided to earnings, but on their last call, they did guide to a significant improvement in margins this year. So, Next is a positive driver this year, and I would say, to a material extent, but I can't say specifically because I can't get ahead of them on their earnings disclosures. But we are expecting it to be much better. They've made a ton of progress on all of the operational and commercial improvements that they've been outlining. And as I've said previously, the Next portfolio we expect to be neutral to earnings by 2024, and I still expect that. Angie Storozynski : Okay. But I'm just \u2013 so again, not to be picky, but so which bucket would this be included in? I mean on that Slide 20, I mean, I understand that it's lumped with some other drivers. So, would it be based on the upside to the guidance? Steve Coughlin : No, it would be lumped into that second column with the negative \u2013 it would be an offset in that negative $0.15, basically. Angie Storozynski : Okay. Okay. I understand. Okay. And then just one other question about 2022. So, when I'm looking at the actual results versus what you were guiding to, the corporate drag as more than 100 million higher than expected. And I'm just wondering, I understand some of it is interest expense, but any other driver? Steve Coughlin : The corporate does include AES Next, under our current segments. And so, we'll be talking more at Investor Day about the future, but I can say, it's largely parent interest on the revolver, where we've had higher balances and of course, higher rates going into the revolver, as well as the incremental drag from AES Next. Angie Storozynski : Okay. Thank you. And then the core question. So, based on the IRA, I mean, there's this discussion about shifting from solar ITC to solar PTC, there's obviously the bonus ITC. And I'm just wondering how are you positioned to benefit from those additional tax credits in the U.S.? And also, I mean, it's a very competitive market, as I understand. So, can you actually retain some of this benefit, i.e., boost the profitability of future solar projects in the U.S. or is it more a function of basically securing more contracts by trading away that benefit? Steve Coughlin : Sure. So, look, first of all, we're very happy to have the optionality from the IRA on choosing ITC or PTC newly for solar, as well as having the ITC for storage. So, typically we're going to choose the tax credit structure that yields the highest return in the project. So, it's great to have that optionality. I would say, going forward, the ITC \u2013 there is a difference in the earnings profile. There's an upfront recognition of the ITC versus the PTC is spread out over 10 years, but other than that, you'd expect the lifetime earnings roughly to be the same if the credit structure yielded roughly the same returns. So, in this case, we have about \u2013 in AES\u2019 case, about one-third of our pipeline, we believe, will qualify for the energy community adder. And so, we feel that we're going to be very competitively positioned to get at least the 40% level for about one-third of our pipeline. So, that's a good thing. I would say in terms of where the credit accrues, I think it's going to be a mix of things. Certainly, there's been higher costs that the industry has absorbed on the order of 30%. I think part of it goes to absorbing that impact of higher costs in renewables. I would say some will go to competitiveness in terms of bidding for the PPAs. And largely, as Andres has talked about before, we see there being more of a constraint on the supply side in the renewables market. So, we do see that continued strong demand, but that there's going to be constraints on the supply side of projects being ready to meet that demand and that will have some upward pressure on returns. Andres Gluski : Yes. Angie, the way I'd put it is that the cost increases have largely been absorbed by the market. So, we're seeing constant margins. What you saw the last year, there was less commissioning of new projects in renewables than it was expected by a big factor, like 40%. So, what a lot of the clients have done has postponed some of their renewable goals, but eventually, what you're going to see is a shortage in the market. So, we feel confident about that, and that's why we're continuing to invest to build that pipeline to be able to respond to that demand. So, those are the dynamics. This is a market that, yes, while it's very competitive, the dynamics are positive. And then we are also selling a lot of our projects are differentiated projects. So, they're structured projects. They bring something to the table other just than your [indiscernible] PPA. Angie Storozynski : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nick Campanella of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. This is [indiscernible] for Nick today. First, a quick question on the Analyst Day. Can we just get some color on your thoughts on the timing? I know you mentioned spring, but what are some of the specific drivers to determine the timing of the Analyst Day? Steve Coughlin : Yes. I mean \u2013 so first of all, Andres mentioned, we will be discussing new business segments. So, we are closing out 2022 under our current segments. We will then move over to new segments very shortly. And so, part of the timing is to fully make that transition internally and then to be able to come out in the spring time frame with that look at the new segments, the new way of looking at AES going forward, as well as discussion about guidance beyond 2025. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And just maybe just on the asset sales proceeds. I know you're feeling some of the add to sales proceeds with the parent debt issuance, but as we think about the [79] [ph] CAGR currently, can you just \u2013 are you able to continue to bridge this growth rate without any additional common equity? Just want to check in on that. Andres Gluski : Yes. Look, we feel confident in terms of what we've said in the past that to grow through 2025, we don't need additional equity for that period of time. So, we also feel confident in our ability to raise $1 billion through asset sales. Steve Coughlin : Yes. Yes. And with regard to the debt, it's really just \u2013 it's somewhat fungible. We look at both our sales program, as well as our debt capacity, always holding to our investment-grade metric, plus a cushion as a minimum, but it's really just timing. So, there's just flex between when we determine to issue the debt within our expectations and when those asset sales come in. So, it's just executing somewhat of a flexibility on the timing of the asset sales and the debt, kind of flex back and forth. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks for the color. I appreciate and I\u2019ll back to the queue. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra of Evercore. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Durgesh Chopra : Hi, good morning team. Thank you for taking my question. Just, kind of \u2013 I want to focus on the plan for this year 2023, that is, what's the level of confidence? I mean maybe you can share some details with us in terms of what you already have in terms of material secured, et cetera, et cetera, and getting the, sort of the 3.4 gigawatts online and getting the $0.27 earnings accretion year-over-year. Andres Gluski : Okay. Hi, Durgesh. Listen, we feel good about the numbers that we're giving out there. We have all the equipment basically secured. And we're very \u2013 I'd say about what we have about 5.5 gigawatts under construction as we speak. Okay. Not all of them are going to come in line in 2023. But just to give you an idea, we feel very good about it. Now, the [600] [ph] megawatts that we said might slip into 2024. What are the issues? Well, for some of that, there could be equipment delivery. There could be interconnect timing, easement issues, [indiscernible] permits, the usual stuff that when you're doing construction. So, we're going to try very hard to get it done this year, but we feel it's prudent to say that these are going to slip most likely, slip into 2024. Now, what I would like to reiterate is that this really isn't a business issue. This is just an accounting issue from my perspective because we \u2013 all of those 600 megawatts, I feel very confident would get done, for example, by \u2013 certainly by March. So, there aren't any penalties involved and there isn't any significant change to the return of those projects. So, unfortunately, what you really have is given that we run on a calendar year. We have so much happening in the last quarter. But I want to really emphasize this is not a \u2013 we have \u2013 of all the renewable developers, we have not abandoned any project because of equipment delays or permit delays. We have delivered on [indiscernible]. So, we feel very good, but there is a timing issue, and we thought it prudent to say, look, these 600 megawatts, we think are most likely to fall into next year. But it's a matter of \u2013 it could be weeks. And we will nonetheless try very hard to get them done this year. Durgesh Chopra : Thank you, Andres. That's very helpful. And just in terms of milestones for us to watch, as to whether you can get them done this year or are they going to push next year? When are you going to have that clarity? Is that, sort of kind of a summer type of event or will you have more clarity by your Investor Day? Andres Gluski : I really don't think we'd have it honestly, by our Investor Day, to be frank. I think it'd be more by the summer that we would have more indications on particularly the project. This gets quite granular. [X projects] [ph] got a permit or something that was missing, but I don't really don't see that before that. Steve Coughlin : Yes Durgesh, our plan is \u2013 just on each call, we will give updates to the extent we have updates on the construction program, as well as the tax credit expectations throughout the year on the calls as well. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. And thanks, Steve. And just one last one. I noticed the 2023 to 2025 PPA finding is, again, very healthy 14 gigawatts to 17 gigawatts, but you're not, sort of giving us an annual number this year like you did in 2022, which was 4.5 gigawatts to 5.5 gigawatts and you came in right in that range. Are you expecting that 2023 to 2025 signings to be lumpy or should we still expect right, the new PPAs in the [indiscernible] range each year? Andres Gluski : I would expect, honestly, them to be right around that, sort of 4.5 megawatts, 5.5 megawatts every year, but we decided to [give] [ph] a multi-year range because there is some lumpiness. I mean, we do have some projects, which are like 1 gigawatt. And it's the same thing. The signing could happen in January instead of December. So, we wanted to give a \u2013 basically, think of it more as sort of a rolling number, but again, we feel good about being able to reach that range. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. Thanks guys. And congrats on the BNEF recognition again this year. I appreciate the time. Andres Gluski : Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Cameron Lochridge : Hi, there. Good morning. This is actually Cameron Lochridge on for Julien. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to maybe come back real quick to the idea of the renewal with backlog and how maybe that influences 7% to 9% growth CAGR that you guys have laid out. I appreciate that we reaffirm that through 2025, but given where the backlog is and where the growth is expected to come from over the next several years, is there any reason we should not be perhaps rolling that forward out beyond 2025 and continuing to underwrite to that or is there something else that may be driving that either higher or lower beyond 2025? Andres Gluski : Yes. I mean, look, let's say, we have a 12.2 gigawatt backlog, of which about 5.5% are under construction now. And a good portion of that is going to come online between now and 2025. So, there's no reason to think of a change. If anything, the market continues to grow, and we see a shortage. I don't know if \u2013 Steve, you want to comment... Steve Coughlin : Yes, I would say the backlog is at 12.2 and we're delivering [3.4] [ph] this year plus potentially some of that upside from the [600] [ph]. So that leaves still about [8.5] [ph] to be delivered over the next few years. So, we feel really good about the commissioning coming through 2025 to support the growth. And then as Andres has covered, the pipeline in the U.S. is 51 gigawatts and it is continuing to mature. So, we'll talk more at Investor Day about beyond 2025, but I feel really good about the growth expectations. Andres Gluski : Yes. This is not a market that is not growing very rapidly. And we do see pent-up demand. What we do see is that because a lot of people did not deliver in 2022, we see pent-up demand. So, what we have to do is really make sure that we're getting the returns that we want and really going after the value-add on those projects, but it's not for a [indiscernible] of projects by any means. Cameron Lochridge : Understood. Understood. Thank you both. Maybe just going back to 2023 and looking at guidance, I know you're looking at $0.27 a share from the new renewables in 2023. I kind of wanted to unpack that a little bit. In terms of how much, if you could quantify, how much of that $0.27 is, you know we'll call it a roll forward from projects that were placed in service in 4Q 2022? And is there any reason that was meaningfully different or will be meaningfully different this year thinking about the $0.10 a share that could potentially slip into 2024? Steve Coughlin : Yes. So, the primary portion of that relates to the increase in the tax credit. So, a portion of the $0.27 is related to just that base of projects from 2022 coming into 2023. So that's part of it. But I would say the largest component is the increase in the tax credit to the range of about 500 million recognized this year, which is a little more than double what we recognize that last year. So, that's the largest component of the $0.27. Cameron Lochridge : Okay. Got it. I guess\u2026 [Multiple Speakers] No, no, go ahead. I'm sorry. Steve Coughlin : Yes. I was also just going to say, and that's partly why we're calling out this additional 600 megawatts because it's largely \u2013 in fact, it's all investment tax credit-based projects. So, as Andres described in the most extreme, even if you just had a project that was commissioned on January 1 instead of December 31, you would move that tax recognition over a calendar year. So that's why we're calling out that as potential upside and the sensitivity to the tax credit, and it's just timing is all it is. Andres Gluski : Yes. The other thing I'd point out is, when we sell the tax credits, we also get the cash. Steve Coughlin : Exactly. Andres Gluski : So, there is lumpiness in the cash as a result of this. So, the cash and the earnings go together. Cameron Lochridge : Got it. Okay. That would do for us. Thank you guys, both. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Richard Sunderland of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Richard Sunderland : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the time today. Just one last one on this 2023 versus 2024 [on 600 megawatts] [ph]. It sounds like if the $0.10 looks to 2024, this clearly should be additive to the prior growth outlook [meaning] [ph] attitude to the 7% to 9% CAGR. Is that the right frame of reference for whether the 600 megawatts [indiscernible] in 2023 and brings you kind of back to the original range or 2024 pushes you above? Steve Coughlin : Exactly. So, that's exactly right. It doesn't change the 7% to 9% through 2025, but all else being equal, 2024 would go well above the 7% to 9% as a result of these projects moving into next year. That's exactly right. Richard Sunderland : Okay. Got it. Very clear. Thank you. Turning to Ohio, you asked before, any sense on the backdrop in conversations there after all the time and engagement around the [ASI] [ph] rate case? Steve Coughlin : Yes. So at this point, as Andres said in his remarks, the ESP 4, we're expecting to be decided this summer. So that was filed last fall. The [PUC] [ph] did issue the order on the distribution rate case back in December, which was very favorable to us. And so, really those rates are just pending the approval and finalization of the ESP 4. So \u2013 and keep in mind, the ESP 4 has a couple of things that are very additive. So, one is that it will catch up the investment that's occurred between the last rate case filing in 2020, up close to the point in which the ESP 4 was filed last year. So, there's a catch up there. There's also a new framework for investment going forward, including a distribution investment rider, as well as some additional riders that will result in faster recognition of investment going forward. So, our expectation is that we'll see the new structure in place that sets Ohio in the course for new investment for the second half of this year, and then it becomes a growth driver going forward into the next several years. We see in total our net rate base increasing close to 1.5 billion across both utilities from now until 2025. Richard Sunderland : Understood. Understood. Thank you. And then you reference changes around the Vietnam requirements for sale and relaunching that transaction. Could you just parse that a little bit more in terms of what you're expecting there now? Do you see a quicker path to divestment under a second go, anything else would be helpful here? Andres Gluski : Yes. Well, we hope so, and then it will be [indiscernible] second time around. I mean, basically, the \u2013 what happened here is that the government wanted more of an operator then a financial investor. They're very happy with us, and they want somebody equally good. So, we feel there is a number of people interested in the asset because they actually canceled the number of new coal plants that were going to be built. So, there's an appetite, especially from Asian operators for this asset. So, hopefully, it will be faster. It was somewhat of a surprise, but our intentions remain the same. So, to be out of coal by the end of 2025. Richard Sunderland : Got it. Thank you for the time today. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Steve Fleishman : Yes, thank you. Andres, maybe could you give us just some overall color on how things are proceeding on panel supplies and particularly you flip up implementation issues. And is that kind of a key variable in the timing of these projects or is it more other issues? Andres Gluski : Let's see. Well, we feel pretty \u2013 we feel good about the panel issue. As you know, again, we got all the panels we could use in 2022. So, in 2023, we have all the orders in. Our suppliers have been getting through. So, again, we feel good about that. In terms of what would determine that last, sort of 600 megawatts, it's really a combination of issues. It's not just solar panels. It runs the gamut from wind turbines, deliveries, et cetera, pyramids easing. Also, the interconnection timing, is the client ready to take that [energy] [ph]. That was one of the biggest issues we had in 2022. We were ready, but the client wasn't ready. So, it's just a bag of different issues. I'd say an important issue going forward is, as you know, we're heading the solar panel buyers consortium. We want to have solar panels starting to be delivered late 2024, 2025 made in the U.S.A., and what we're seeing now is really one of the regulations may be issued by treasury, what constitutes domestic content to get those additional credits. So, I'd say that's an item that we're watching very closely, but generally, we feel good about. And there are certainly people interested in locating that flat here to supply that contract. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And then just \u2013 I know this was discussed on the last call, but just how are you making the decision between on U.S. projects, ITC versus PTC. I guess, -- so PTC, I think you had talked about still having a lot of value in the tax equity and the depreciation, but just \u2013 do you see that starting to shift at some point in the \u2013 as you execute on future projects? Steve Coughlin : Yes, I do, Steve, now that we have the optionality for production tax credits on solar, I would see that option being exercised primarily in the sunniest places in the U.S. So, in the Southwest U.S. projects where the production-based incentive is going to yield a higher value than necessarily the CapEx based on the capital investment based incentive. So, we are modeling more production tax credit into our longer-term. For this year, it's not \u2013 I wouldn't say, it's impacted us really at all this year because for the most part, we're locked into a tax credit structure election and a tax equity partnership that we've already agreed to. But going forward, we'll start to see more production-based incentive come into the mix. And that's something, again, for Investor Day, as we talk about beyond 2025, kind of how do we look at the business, how do you look at the metrics of the business, how do you look at tax credits, distinct from earnings that don't include tax credits, things like that, that we'll be giving more guidance on to help people understand what that looks like going forward. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Orrill of UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Gregg Orrill : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to, sort of confirm where the credit goals are, sort of with the guidance update and the segment \u2013 the new segments that you're thinking about? Sorry, if I'm getting ahead of my [indiscernible]. Steve Coughlin : No, no, no. No problem. Are you referring to the tax credit? Andres Gluski : I think the credit rating, right? Steve Coughlin : Credit rating, okay. We've been talking so much about tax credit. So, yes, the credit rating, certainly the BBB- is a constant constraint. And then we see likely improvement going forward, particularly as our business mix evolves to more long-term contracted renewables and more investment in the U.S. utilities. So, I would say, that's going to be a driver of improvement to the overall profile and view on the source of where our cash is coming from going forward. The segments, there's no \u2013 I can't say too much about that right now. As we've been operating under the current segments, we'll be moving to the new one soon and then talking about that on the call going forward, but the segments will make it very clear as to the sources of earnings and cash going forward and where the business is growing, frankly, much, much higher than 7% to 9% and where the business is shrinking, largely consistent with our decarbonization goals. So, it will peel apart where that 7% to 9% has come from [2025] [ph] as well as go beyond [2025] [ph]. Andres Gluski : Yes. So Gregg, in terms of the credit rating, we're already more than 50% of our earnings are coming from the U.S. and a higher and higher percentage is coming from renewables. So, we already have a \u2013 if we're growing 7% to 9%, that includes the dilution from getting out of coal. So, actually, our renewables are growing at a much higher rate, more like 10% to 12%. So, to put that in context, all of those things point to an improvement, as Steve was saying, in terms of the quality of the numbers beyond the metrics. So, again, we feel very confident in what we've said. This is a red line. We're not going to drop below investment grade, and we're going to continue to strengthen it. Gregg Orrill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Levine of Citi. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Ryan Levine : Good morning. Hoping to follow-up on the change \u2013 in terms of the change in segmentation, maybe just to take a step back, what's prompting the re-review of how you're looking to disclose information? And is there anything that any re-review would signal strategically for the company? Andres Gluski : No. I mean we really think this is a culmination of what we've been doing in terms of moving into renewables. And our business is long-term contracted. And what we're seeing is a lot of this would make our business we feel more transparent and more comparable to other people's businesses. So, that's all I can say at this point, but it's something that I think you guys will welcome because it gives greater transparency. And I think it makes more and more sense as, again, we transition more to renewables. Ryan Levine : Okay. And in your guidance, you disclosed a step down from the LNG contribution for this calendar year. What are you assuming for like TTF Henry Hub spreads or upside or contribution from that portion of your contract portfolio? Andres Gluski : Well, I'll say the two elements. One is that we have less gas available to take advantage of that opportunity because we had a step down in our Henry Hub-based gas contracts. The second is, has to do with the spread between Henry Hub plus and TTF. So, those spreads have narrowed. It's been a very warm winter, especially in Europe. So, we'll see. So, that's an opportunity that exists there, but we're not \u2013 it would be smaller, smaller quantity. And we're not counting on it this year because right now, the spreads are not such that between all the transportation and the sharing of the upside with oil traders, et cetera, look particularly attractive, but the option is there, should the situation change. Steve Coughlin : Yes. So, it's \u2013 I mean, it's largely based on current outlook for the year on the commodities, but to the extent that spread were to increase, that would be an upside to the guidance we've given here. Ryan Levine : Great. And then last question for me. In terms of the asset sale process, to the extent some of these deals don't happen or get delayed, what tools do you have to alter your financing plan in light of looks like a choppy M&A market. Andres Gluski : Well, first, we have many assets that we can sell, and it's not only sell-out, sell-down. So, we have, I think, a lot of levers there. And we don't like to talk a lot about any specific asset until we have a deal done. It doesn't help us, but we always also sell-down, for example, some of our renewables because that increases our returns, sell-down a portion of it, we continue to operate them. So, if you have movements, say, in time that a specific asset sale gets delayed and you're not ready to do another one, that's where other kinds of financings come in, and we'll do the one that makes the most sense. But again, as I said before, maintaining our credit metrics and our investment grade, that's a red line in the [sand] [ph]. Ryan Levine : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our final question is a follow-up question from Angie Storozynski from Seaport. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Angie Storozynski : Thank you. Just one thing. So, the 600 megawatts that might slip into 2024, that's the growth number, right? What would it be adjusted by ownership? Andres Gluski : There\u2019s two things. I mean, we normally sell-down after the commissioning. Steve Coughlin : Yes. I mean, so we do have [indiscernible] so this is the U.S. number. So, we have our partnership with Alberta Investment Management. And so, I would say, for the most part, it's about 75% AES is that number. And the \u2013 up to $0.10 that I mentioned, Angie, is AES' share. So, that's not the [indiscernible]. Angie Storozynski : Okay. That\u2019s all I need. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. As there are no additional questions waiting at this time, I'd like to pass the conference back over to Susan Harcourt for closing remarks. Susan Harcourt : We thank everybody for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Thank you, and have a nice day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Have a great day ahead. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Alicia, and I\u2019ll be your moderator for today\u2019s call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to pass the conference over to your host, Susan Harcourt, Vice President of Investor Relations with AES Corporation. You may now proceed. Susan Harcourt : Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2023 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements, which are discussed in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website along with the presentation. Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Coughlin, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will turn the call over to Andres. Andres Gluski : Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our first quarter 2023 financial review call. We are very pleased with our progress so far this year. And today, I will discuss our first quarter results and provide key business updates. Steve Coughlin, our CFO, will give some more detail on our financial performance and outlook. Beginning on Slide 3. As you may have seen in our press release, we introduced new strategic business units, which better reflect the greatly simplified company that AES is today and the pillars of our future growth. We will be giving a broader strategic review at our Investor Day on Monday, including an update on our portfolio transformation and an overview of our strong growth expectations for our renewables and utility businesses. Our first quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share was $0.22 compared with $0.21 in 2022, which is in line with our expectations. With these results and the underlying performance we are seeing across our business, we are reaffirming our 2023 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $1.65 to $1.75, and our 7% to 9% annualized growth rate target through 2025. Now turning to Slide 4. We continue to see strong demand for renewables both in the U.S. and internationally, including from U.S. corporate customers with operations in international markets. So far this year, we have signed PPAs for 309 megawatts of new renewables, including 154 megawatts of wind with a U.S. technology customer in Brazil. We\u2019re in advanced negotiations for several large additional projects and remain on track to meet our PPA signing target of 14 to 17 gigawatts over the next 3 years. In the U.S., key elements of the inflation Reduction Act or IRA are being clarified. This past month, the Department of Treasury and the IRS release detailed guidance on how clean energy projects located in energy communities can qualify for an additional 10% bonus tax credit. We estimate that approximately 1/3 of our 51 gigawatt pipeline of projects in the U.S. would qualify, which directly translates into a combination of higher potential returns and increased competitiveness for the projects we are developing. We are currently awaiting treasury department guidance on certain provisions of the IRA, including requirements for the clean hydrogen production tax credit. As a reminder, at our green hydrogen project in Texas, the largest advanced green hydrogen project in the U.S., which we are developing jointly with Air Products. We plan to co-locate 1.4 gigawatts of new renewables with the electrolyzers. This means that the projects would have the lowest possible carbon emissions of any known project in the U.S. Additionally, the project is located adjacent to the site of a decommissioned coal plant, which will provide significant existing infrastructure. All of these attributes and the fact that the energy will include hourly matching indicate that the project should qualify for the highest possible tax credit in any scenario. Turning to Slide 5. Our backlog of projects with signed long-term contracts is now around 12 gigawatts. Of which roughly half are already under construction. We continue to maintain a robust supply chain, and we continue to hit our construction milestones without delay. We expect to bring online more than 3 gigawatts of new wind, solar and battery storage this year. As we bring projects currently in the backlog online in coming years, we will nearly double our installed renewables capacity, making us one of the fastest-growing renewable companies in the world. Turning to Slide 6. We are also happy to report a positive development at AES Ohio which puts us on track for unprecedented growth in the business. In April, AES Ohio signed a comprehensive settlement agreement for its Electric Security Plan, or ESP 4 which received broad support from residential, commercial, industrial and low-income customers. The settlement included the commission staff as a signatory, and we expect to receive final approval by the end of the third quarter. With ESP 4 in place, along with our existing investment programs, we expect to more than double our rate base by the end of 2027 which would make AES Ohio, one of the fastest-growing utility businesses in the country, while still having the lowest tariffs in the state. Turning to Slide 7. We also reached a major milestone towards exiting coal by the end of 2025. We agreed to terminate the PPA at the Warrior Run plant in Maryland, for which we will receive total payments of $357 million. We will retain control of the site and are exploring new uses that capitalize on its valuable location and existing infrastructure. We see this transaction is very beneficial for all parties involved. Moving to Slide 8. We signed agreements to extend the operations of 1.4 gigawatts of gas generation at our legacy Southland units in California for 3 more years. These plans were previously scheduled to retire at the end of this year. The extensions will lock in additional upside and will help meet the state of California\u2019s grid liability needs while supporting its efforts to transition over time to low carbon source of electricity. The monetization of the contract that Warrior Run and the extension of the legacy Southland units are both good examples of how we are creating value from our existing infrastructure assets during the energy transition. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, we will be holding an Investor Day on Monday, where we will be sharing our strategic long-term view of the company, discussing our new business segments and providing long-term growth rates through 2027 for adjusted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA and parent free cash flow. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our CFO, Steve Coughlin. Steve Coughlin : Thank you, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our first quarter results, 2023 guidance and 2023 parent capital allocation. Turning to Slide 10. As Andres mentioned, in the first quarter, we launched our new Strategic Business Units or SBUs. This new organizational structure reflects AES very focused and simplified portfolio. It also aligns our management teams by business line to maximize our operational synergies and to continue delivering excellent customer experiences across all our markets. Our new SBU reporting segments highlight our rapidly growing renewables and utility businesses and facilitate simplified modeling of AES, which will benefit current and new potential shareholders and analysts. Our new SBUs include renewables, which includes our solar, wind, energy storage and hydro businesses, utilities, which includes AES Indiana, AES Ohio and AES Salvador, Energy infrastructure composed of our thermal generation and LNG infrastructure businesses and new energy technologies, which includes our investments in energy technology businesses such as Fluence and Uplight as well as our green hydrogen business line and future new business innovations which support our mission. In addition to the SBUs, we also have a corporate reporting segment, which includes our corporate G&A our parent level debt and associated interest expense in our captive insurance program called AGC. Turning to Slide 11. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.22 versus $0.21 last year. Our business was favorable year-over-year, which I will discuss in more detail shortly. Our results were also impacted by higher parent interest expense and a lower adjusted tax rate. Now to Slide 12. We are fully on track to achieve our full year 2023 adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.65 to $1.75. We expect a significant contribution from new renewables of at least $0.27 this year. This is partially offset by lower contributions from LNG sales, as we have previously mentioned, higher parent interest expense from incremental debt and higher rates on our revolving credit facility and a marginally higher tax rate this year. As is typically the case, our earnings are heavily weighted toward the second half of the year. This year, we expect approximately 3/4 of our earnings to occur in the second half. Growth in the year to go will be primarily driven by contributions from new businesses including over 3 gigawatts of projects in our backlog coming online, which remains solidly on track for completion. We are also reaffirming our expected 7% to 9% average annual growth target through 2025. Turning to Slide 13. As you may have seen in our press release, while we continue to report adjusted EPS, today, we are also introducing adjusted EBITDA as a new reporting metric. As the renewables portion of our business grows at an extremely high rate, we believe adjusted EBITDA is a very informative metric in understanding our business results. First, it aligns well with the performance of our underlying business and operating cash generation. And second, adjusted EBITDA is reported before the impact of U.S. renewables tax attributes so that investors and analysts can separate renewable operating earnings from the very valuable tax incentives for U.S. renewables. Beginning this quarter, I will discuss our new SBU financial results using adjusted EBITDA, with the exception of our utilities SBU, which will be measured using adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, to facilitate comparisons with other utilities. We will provide full year guidance by SBU during our Investor Day on Monday. Adjusted EBITDA was $628 million this quarter versus $621 million in the prior year. This was driven by higher first quarter LNG sales and growth in renewables, but was partially offset by the impact of warmer than normal weather at our U.S. utilities. I\u2019ll cover the performance of our new SBUs in the next 4 slides. Beginning with our renewables SBU on Slide 14. Higher EBITDA was driven primarily by a higher level of generation at our facilities in Panama higher wind generation and contributions from new businesses. This was partially offset by higher spend as we continue to ramp up our renewables development and lower power prices impacting our Bulgaria wind facility. Lower PTC at our Utilities SBU was mostly driven by warmer-than-normal winter weather and higher interest expense, but partially offset by higher revenues as a result of our continued investment in the rate base. Higher EBITDA and our energy infrastructure SBU primarily reflects higher LNG sales, partially offset by lower margins from coal PPAs, the retirement of our coal plant in Hawaii last year and lower availability at Southland Energy. Finally, higher EBITDA at our New Energy Technologies SBU reflects a significant improvement in operations and gross margins at Fluence. Now to our 2023 parent capital allocation plan on Slide 18. Sources reflect approximately $2.1 billion to $2.6 billion of total discretionary cash, including $950 million to $1 billion of parent free cash flow, $400 million to $600 million of proceeds from asset sales and $700 million to $1 billion of planned parent debt issuance. On the right-hand side, you can see our planned use of capital. We will return nearly $500 million to shareholders this year. This consists of our common share dividend, including the previously announced 5% increase as well as the coupon on the equity units. We plan to invest approximately $1.7 billion toward new growth, of which the majority will go to renewables and utilities. In summary, we\u2019ve made great progress on our financial commitments for the year. At our Investor Day on Monday, we will provide detail on the strategy and future of AES overall and for each of our new SBUs. We will also provide long-term growth rates through 2027 for adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA and parent free cash flow. I look forward to talking with many of you then. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Andres. Andres Gluski : Thank you, Steve. In summary, we are pleased with our progress to date and remain on track to hit our 2023 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $1.65 to $1.75 and our 7% to 9% annualized growth rate target through 2025. We continue to see strong demand for renewables and especially from our corporate customers. Our supply chain is robust and our construction projects are progressing as planned. We\u2019re also encouraged by the settlement agreement at AS Ohio, which paves the way for final approval of our new electric security plan later this year and creates the framework for significant investments in the utility. Finally, we see our successful negotiations to terminate the Warrior Run contract and extend the operations of the 1.4 gigawatts of our legacy South line units as indicative of the success we are having in maximizing shareholder value from our existing assets as we transform the portfolio. We look forward to providing a broader strategic update at our Investor Day on Monday, including more details around our growth plans and guidance through 2027. With that, I would like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. You may now proceed. David Arcaro : Hi, good morning thanks for taking my question. One thing I wanted to check on, would there be any risk to your renewables growth outlook if the AD/CVD tariffs were to come back into effect just after we\u2019ve seen the House and Senate passed some legislation there. Just curious how you view that risk and also just longer term, how you mitigate that AD/CVD tariff risk. Andres Gluski : Yes, honestly, we don\u2019t see any risk whatsoever. First, it in the past, I believe the setting was 56 votes, and that was -- the President will be to it. And by the -- we have all the panels that we need for this year, and expect to have for next year, by June of next year when the tariff, let\u2019s say, tariff holiday rolls off. So we\u2019re in very good shape for 2023 and 2024. And after that, we expect to have supply coming in from the U.S. We\u2019re having no problems from our suppliers getting through under the UFLPA. So really, I think we\u2019re in the best shape of anybody. We have not delayed a single project due to solar panel supply issues to date. And I think that\u2019s something -- I don\u2019t know if anybody else can say that. David Arcaro : Excellent. That\u2019s helpful. And then I was just curious, any updates into the visibility for the 600 megawatts of projects that are potentially getting completed this year, but could get pushed to next year? Any increased visibility there at this point in the year? Andres Gluski : Look, as I said in my script, we are progressing well we have the supply chain. Everything is in place. But look, we won\u2019t know until the fourth quarter of this year, and they\u2019re going to fall in this year and they\u2019re going to follow in next. But I would remind everybody that\u2019s not value issue. If they come in a couple of weeks later, it doesn\u2019t affect the profitability of the project at all. It is an accounting issue. But as of now, we we\u2019re doing well, but we can\u2019t say -- give you any particular update with greater clarity and probably until the fourth quarter of this year. David Arcaro : Yes. Understood. That makes sense. And just one other quick question. I was curious if with the Warrior run project. Is there any level of EBITDA or earnings contribution that you would point to for that as that rolls off? And then curious how you think about the use of proceeds there if there\u2019s debt specifically on the project that would be paid down or if it gets used more broadly at the corporate level? Steve Coughlin : Yes, hi, this is Steve. There is definitely earnings from this. And so effectively, we\u2019re monetizing the remaining 7 roughly years of the PPA this year. And so we\u2019ll recognize earnings this year, and we expect to have an obligation for capacity through the middle of next year. So the earnings over this termination agreement will be recognized over roughly 11, 12 months following when the commission approval comes in. So say if it comes in, in June, probably about half this year and half next year. And there\u2019s very little debt to pay down here. So this is -- these proceeds will likely -- this is a 7-year payment stream, but we\u2019ll likely monetize that this year. And then that\u2019s captured in our asset sale in terms of our capital sources this year, if you saw on that slide. So that will be used to fund the growth of the business. David Arcaro : Okay, perfect. Great, thanks so much. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global. You may now proceed. Agnieszka Storozynski : Good morning. So I know we\u2019re going to talk about it on Monday, this transition from EPS to EBITDA. And if I understand correctly, at least that\u2019s how I see it. It\u2019s about renewables being more levered and having a higher depreciation rate than the thermal assets, for example, however. So there\u2019s only one issue here that as we\u2019re looking at the first quarter results, right, the contributions from renewables seems very small, right, to the total EBITDA. So that\u2019s one. And also, as you are aware, there are different ways how your peers show adjusted EBITDA. I mean in your case, you\u2019re adjusting it for minority interest there\u2019s no inclusion of the tax benefits, which, again, might understate the EBITDA versus what your peers report. So anyway -- and I know that we\u2019re going to talk about it on Monday, but just ease us into this EBITDA transition, please? Andres Gluski : Sure, Angie. Well, thanks for the question. Look, first, I\u2019d say, we continue to provide adjusted earnings per share guidance. And as we said, we\u2019ll be providing adjusted earnings per share guidance through 2027 on Monday. So I want to make that perfectly clear, but we\u2019re adding as an additional indicator which is adjusted EBITDA that we\u2019re going to be giving. And partly, it\u2019s to give greater clarity into our performance of our renewables and partly that has to do with sort of the lumpiness of the projects. So that\u2019s the real reason that we\u2019re giving an additional one. It also helped people to do so, for example, if some of the parts of our different businesses, renewables, utilities, infrastructure. So I want to make very clear that we are providing adjusted earnings per share through 2027. Regarding the other questions that you have, I\u2019m going to go ahead and pass that to Steve. Steve Coughlin : Yes. Thanks, Andres, and thanks, Angie. So definitely, we\u2019ll be talking some more about this on Monday. But our goal here is to really give the clarity that we think is important to understand and model the business. So as Andre said, we\u2019ll give the adjusted EPS, we\u2019ll also give the EBITDA, which is more closely aligned to the underlying business performance and cash generation from the PPAs and then we\u2019ll also give the tax attributes and then the sum of the adjusted EBITDA plus the tax attributes. So we think it\u2019s going to be a very complete view and package that helps people truly understand how the business is earning and generating cash. From the different components of the PPAs and the tax attributes. Agnieszka Storozynski : Okay. And then you can also help us how to allocate the corporate leverage across -- I mean, again, if we are trying to move to the sum of the part valuation from an EBITDA perspective, we need to figure out how to allocate the corporate debt, right, among these subsidiaries. Steve Coughlin : Yes. I mean, certainly, in our reporting now, we\u2019ll be able to separate the debt here for the business. And then as we look ahead, most all of our growth is in renewables and Utilities. About 80% of the growth is in renewables and utilities and about close to 0.75 80% in the U.S. market. So I think you\u2019ll have a lot of good detail to help understand how to do that allocation. Agnieszka Storozynski : Okay, okay. See you guys on Monday. Thank you. Operator : Thank you Miss Storozynski. The next question comes from the line of Richard Sunderland with JPMorgan. You may now proceed. Richard Sunderland : Hi, good morning and thanks for the time today. Maybe I\u2019ll pick it up where Angie left off on the new SBUs. Turning to the new energy technologies, SBU, can you speak more to the green hydrogen side. Curious if this represents a shift in thinking of where you like to be involved in hydrogen? Or are you just specifically calling out the breakout there relative to the renewables feeding in? Andres Gluski : Yes. Thanks for the question. Look, what I\u2019d say is that we have a very interesting pipeline, which we\u2019ll be discussing on Monday of green hydrogen projects. We really think we\u2019re a leader here. We have the most advanced and lowest carbon emitting project in Texas here in the U.S. But we also have projects in Los Angeles. We have projects in Houston. We have projects in Brazil for export, and we have projects in Chile for the -- for our corporate clients or the mining sector. So we\u2019ll be providing more color there. Now in the specific case, for example, Texas, we do co-own the electrolyzers as well as the renewables with our joint venture partner of Air Products. And the reason for that is to really maximize the value of the project because even though the project will be basically co-locating all the renewables with the electrolyzers, it is interconnected with the grid. So there could be occasions just to give you a hypothetical polar vortex in Texas where the most profitable use of our renewables is to inject them into the grid and actually not run the electrolyzers. And so we wanted to have all of our interests aligned. So there will be some projects like that where we also own the electrolyzers as well. In the case of Texas, it\u2019s a take-or-pay with Air Products, but there are other ones in which we would be selling possibly selling green hydrogen to our corporate customers to whom we\u2019re already selling renewables. So that\u2019s the reason for calling it out. Also, as you know, AES next looks at what\u2019s next in terms of technologies. So we\u2019re also, I would say, have it there so that we can look at what new technologies help us produce green hydrogen, cheaper and better for our clients. So that\u2019s the reason for calling it out there. Richard Sunderland : Got it. That\u2019s very clear. Sticking with the SBU theme, energy infrastructure, are you able to disclose how much of that is called today? Steve Coughlin : Yes. So we have roughly a little bit shy of 7 gigawatts of coal today, and that includes some of the assets that we\u2019ve already announced sales and retirement of including, for example, Mong gang in Vietnam, some of the retirements in Chile, and Ventanas, for example, so that number is coming down rapidly, but that\u2019s roughly what\u2019s in the base of energy infrastructure today. Richard Sunderland : Just this on an EBITDA contribution basis or a percentage of SBU basis? Steve Coughlin : Yes. So on a percentage, so what we\u2019ve talked about is it\u2019s about $0.30 of EPS is coming from coal today. Now what\u2019s important is that is -- that\u2019s not all necessarily going away. For example, we are converting the Petersburg 3 of 4 units in Indiana under the integrated utility in Indiana. So this will leave -- this will actually be a new investment to do the gas conversion, and so there\u2019ll be earnings from the rate base and the increasing rate base from that asset. And then in other cases, we are looking at some additional conversion opportunities for these. And then, of course, where there is sales, we\u2019ll have proceeds from those sales to then recycle capital into the renewable and utility growth segments. Richard Sunderland : Got it. Very helpful. And then just one more for me. in consideration of the Warrior Run termination relative to the $400 million to $600 million asset sale target, where are you currently with announced and closed transactions relative to that range? Steve Coughlin : Yes. So we -- I mean we initially announced this exit a year ago. And -- but really prior to that, we had already been significantly reducing our coal portfolio. So our coal portfolio at one point was around 22 gigawatts and we\u2019re already down to 7%. So the reality is we\u2019ve already executed on 2/3 of this program over the many years. And as we a year ago saw the pathway to meet our financial commitments and to fully exit coal, which we think is going to attract new investors to AES that have some bright line thresholds here. We saw that path. So I think we\u2019ve made tremendous progress already, and we have visibility into how we\u2019re going to exit the remaining assets, either through sales that we\u2019ve announced, additional sales that we have not yet announced and then some of these conversions and retirement that will continue. So we feel very good about the program and very good about the earnings trajectory even post coal. Richard Sunderland : But just on the numbers -- sorry. Sorry, Andres. Andres Gluski : No. Just what I would add is that just like we have simplified our portfolio, getting out of different markets over time. I think we\u2019ve done it in a way that maximizes shareholder value. I think we\u2019re doing the same with coal. So we could have perhaps accelerated this faster. But I think where you\u2019re run and for example, the monetization, some years ago, the BHP contract in Chile shows that we\u2019re really able to make money from the transition and tying this in a way that we can provide renewables to meet the energy demands of our clients, in some cases, batteries or hydro to meet the capacity or dispatchable need. So I just mentioned that we feel very good about the program, and we think we\u2019re executing very well on it. Richard Sunderland : Got it. Thank you. But just on the Warrior Run $357 million, $400 million is the low range of the 23 targets that gets you most of the way there? And then did you receive any proceeds on the quarter? Or is the rest either, I guess, Jordan or future announcements? Steve Coughlin : We had -- so also included in that number is the asset or the renewable business recycling. So we had the closure of that operating portfolio of renewable assets that capital into recycling it to new growth in renewable. So that\u2019s an important part of the program here is not just exits of coal, but also the way we recycle capital. Once we\u2019ve derisked projects, we brought them online, we\u2019ve recognized tax credits. We sell them down to relatively low-risk type capital and improve both our returns as well as then help us support a higher growth rate in the renewables business. So that\u2019s part of the asset sale program. And then we have the Jordan sale that has not yet been closed, but it\u2019s been announced, and then there\u2019s some additional possible sales and sell-downs in the works this year that could come into that number. But as you point out, we\u2019ve already made significant progress towards the target this year. So we feel very good about the target that we\u2019ve laid out. Richard Sunderland : Perfect. Well thank you for the time today. See you on Monday. Steve Coughlin : See you on Monday. Operator : Thank you Mr. Sunderland. The next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. You may now proceed. Durgesh Chopra : Hey good morning team. Thanks for taking my questions. Andres, just -- can you comment on the new PPAs signed year-to-date. When I compare this to first quarter of last year that is 2022, it signed over a gig you\u2019ve only signed 309 megawatts. I think in your commentary, you mentioned a couple of large contracts. So just maybe a little bit more color there? And are you confident that the 4 to 4.5 to 5.5 gigs per year signage, is that -- are you still tracking well against that? Andres Gluski : Well, thanks for the question. It\u2019s a great question. Look, we feel very good. And the one thing is, if you recall from last year, I believe we had a lot of signings in the last quarter. And so what we\u2019re seeing here, these things are lumpy. So we have been ranked 2 years running as the largest developer of renewable projects for corporations. And so when you\u2019re dealing with these corporations, these are big projects. So one project can easily be a giga. For example, the just another case, our green hydrogen project in Texas, that\u2019s 1.4 giga. So these are lumpy. So I\u2019m not the least bit concerned about meeting our growth targets. We\u2019re seeing a lot of interest. We\u2019re in advanced negotiations. But they don\u2019t count until you sign them. So we feel good about them. No cause for concern. And that\u2019s one of the issues we have, that they\u2019re lumpy. But when you\u2019re going for big contracts, as an example, the project -- the green hydrogen project in Texas, that\u2019s 1.4 gigawatts just in one. And we have others that are in that range. So it\u2019s going to be lumpy, but we\u2019re not concerned because we will land enough of these to keep us on track. Durgesh Chopra : Understood. That\u2019s very clear. And maybe is there a cost update on the -- on your joint venture, the hydrogen project with APD. I know their project, and I\u2019m not -- I\u2019m going to mispronounce this, but NUM. They had some increases early in the year when they reported, I believe. So any update to cost there in terms of the overall project cost or cost allocated to you for that project? Andres Gluski : Look, we have no update for cost. It\u2019s still going to be in the range of around $4 billion, the whole project. We think it\u2019s, again, it\u2019s going to be the lowest carbon project in the states. As you know, you have a $3 per kilogram subsidy, if you have below a certain threshold of carbon intensity. So we feel we\u2019re well within that. If you have less than that, for example, if you\u2019re taking energy from the grid, then it drops to $1. So we feel very good about that. In terms of the costs, what I\u2019d say is what they announced on their Neon project. And again, I\u2019m just repeating what they put on there that they were going to make some more capital investments to lower operating costs. So it\u2019s the Neon project in Saudi Arabia which is very good for us because they are using a very similar project to this one but it\u2019s at more advanced, so we can learn from that project jointly learned from that project. But no, we have no updates, but we have no reason to think that there\u2019d be any additional cost overruns at this point in time. Durgesh Chopra : That\u2019s very helpful color. Thank you Andres. See you on Monday. Andres Gluski : See you on Monday. Operator : Thank you Mr. Chopra. The next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. You may now proceed. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey good morning team. Thank you guys for the time and the question here. Look, I just wanted to follow up on the ITC, PTC conversation we\u2019ve been having of late. Just curious, are you guys still pretty committed to using ITCs. I know some of your peers have been evolving towards PTCs, you guys focused on the Eastern U.S. Can you talk about the thought process and philosophy there? And then also to follow up back on Angie\u2019s question to the extent to which that you are using ITCs. 70-30 split is still good. I know that, for instance, here in the quarter for tax cut, it\u2019s fairly low. So I just want to make sure that ITC heuristic of 70-30 in year 1, year 2 still applies. Steve Coughlin : Yes. Julien, it\u2019s Steve. So definitely, we have the lion\u2019s share of our tax attributes are from investment tax credits and will continue to be. So -- and I would say when we look at the investment tax credit with the profile of when projects are coming online, it is roughly fair to say about 2/3 of the investment tax credit gets recognized in the year of the commissioning and then about 1/3, 30% in the second year following commissioning. So that holds. The total volume of tax credits will grow annually, and we expect as the portfolio grows. So we\u2019re targeting the commissioning of about 2.1 gigawatts this year of U.S. renewables, say that doubles next year, I would expect the volume of tax attributes to roughly follow that same growth rate. So a doubling of the tax credit from this year to next year, just as it doubled from last year to this year when we went from 1 gigawatts to 2 gigawatts. The production tax credit is a good incentive in some or a better incentive in some projects. Typically, it has been in wind. But in some cases now where we see an energy community adder now that we have some clarity on that. And we see the potential for domestic content adders with the investment tax credit. Keep in mind, those adders are actually richer on the investment tax credit than they are on the production tax credit basis the way the higher was written. So we -- there\u2019s a bit of an offset there in that some projects where we have a very healthy pipeline, good opportunity to get these bonuses, the investment tax credit may still be the best option. But we\u2019ll look at that project by project and look at what yields the best returns. But I see very strong growth in our tax attribute number year-over-year going forward. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. But the point is your ITC, you\u2019re still vastly weighted towards ITC versus PTC, right, as you have been and you don\u2019t intend to change that necessarily, especially given your commentary here. I just want to make sure there\u2019s been some concern otherwise. Steve Coughlin : Yes. Vastly. And the vastness of that will be clear on Monday when I show you the tax credit breakdown between ITC and PTC. And then also keep in mind that for our backlog we\u2019ve essentially locked in already that election and who that tax equity partner is going to be. So for the next couple of years, it\u2019s pretty well decided. Andres Gluski : The one thing I would add on the... Julien, so we\u2019ll be doing more wind in the states, which will be PTC. So for example, the project in Texas is 900 megawatts of wind. So yes, we\u2019ve been more towards ITC partly is because we\u2019ve been very heavily in solar. We\u2019re very strong in solar. Over time, we expect more of a balance. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. And then on just the backlog adds, I know you said it\u2019s lumpy, but is domestic content is one of the reasons why customers aren\u2019t moving because they don\u2019t have guidance from treasury yet and so therefore, holding folks back? We\u2019ve heard this from some folks. Andres Gluski : Yes. I mean in our case, not really. I think I would point to that. It\u2019s just we\u2019re in some negotiations for some whales. And when we land them, it will come through. What did happen last year because of the OXi tariff circumvention case that did delay projects. It did delay projects and set them off into, let\u2019s say, a longer time horizon than would otherwise. But again, since we do a lot of bilateral negotiations, and we haven\u2019t had any problems with our supply chain. That is not what\u2019s driving it. Where the domestic content issue does come in is in terms of the $6 billion contract we have for domestic manufacturer of solar panels here in the states. And so obviously, what\u2019s key there before sort of sitting on the dot line is what is domestic content. And the main difference is how granular it\u2019s defined because if it\u2019s more similar to what has been done, for example, for wind, then it\u2019s much easier to comply with initially. But our plan is to move up the supply chain and have more and more of the inputs made in the states, including some of the more basic minerals, et cetera, coming in. We already have with our suppliers, the wafering is moving out of China, which was the last sort of main component. We\u2019re already buying panels that were made outside of China. And of course, all the wafering etcetera was done in Eastern China, not Western China. So we feel very good about that, and we\u2019ve had no issue thus far. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And last question just on 23 earnings. Just when you look at some of the items in the quarter, whether it was the gain on the asset sale, or whether it was LNG, was that upside relative to the plan? Are you trending better than you would have expected? Or was that gain kind of contemplated in your 2023 guide earlier when you think about your positioning on the year here? Steve Coughlin : Yes. I would say some of these are definitely upsides, Julien. So all else being equal, yes, there\u2019s upside. Unfortunately, as is the case, I think, with most utilities, the warmer winter weather was somewhat of an offset to those upsides for the first quarter. So we still see the potential for upside above even the midpoint of our guidance, but that\u2019s not -- it remains to be seen how the rest of the year goes. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay, excellent guys. See you Monday. Thank you very much. All the best. Operator : Thank you Mr. Julien. The next question comes from the line of Gregg Orrill with UBS. You may now proceed. Gregg Orrill : Yes hi, thanks for the question. I was wondering if you could. Congratulations. I was wondering if you could touch on the financing plan, just sort of the levers that you feel are available to you for equity or equity-like and would you need that to execute at least the plan through 2025, just to sort of reaffirm your thoughts there. Thank you. Steve Coughlin : Yes. No, it\u2019s Steve. So sure. So we\u2019ll definitely talk some more about the longer-term financing plan through 2027. So I think that will give additional color. So we\u2019ll hold for that. This year, I think as I laid out on the slide, we will raise additional parent debt capital largely to fund growth in the renewables segment. And then we have the asset sale program in addition to the close to $1 billion of parent free cash flow coming up from the existing business. So there\u2019s no plan for equity this year. Looking ahead, we\u2019ll talk some more about that in the plan for Monday. What I would say there is, certainly, we have we\u2019re well positioned for growth. We\u2019re in a leadership position, and we want to grow beyond 2025. But certainly, through 2025, we would not need equity to meet our 2025 commitments. However, we would expect to start investing in growth, including things like the green hydrogen project, which would get started before 2025 to support the second half of the decade. But we\u2019ll share more detail on that on Monday. Gregg Orrill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you Mr. Orrill. The next question comes from the line of Ryan Levine with Citi. You may now proceed. Ryan Levine : Hi. Hoping to get a better understanding of how you arrived at the new disclosure. You\u2019re using EBITDA with additional tax disclosure. How did you decide on that versus maybe CAFD or free cash flow for FFO metrics than some other peers are utilized? Andres Gluski : I would say, look, part of it is that, that\u2019s what the most of our peers are using. And what we felt was most transparent is to provide EBITDA and also then the tax attributes. And so if for comparison purposes, you need to add the two, you can do so. But it was really try to make it easier on everyone by using what\u2019s most used in the market. Ryan Levine : And then in terms of the new developments and extending contracts in California, are you anticipating that, that get extended further beyond the initial expansion that was recently announced? Andres Gluski : I think -- we\u2019ve got a 3-year extension. It\u2019s -- those assets -- those locations are extremely valuable for the grid. So we\u2019ll see what developments there are. But right now, 3 years going forward, it\u2019s pretty good. Ryan Levine : Okay. Thank you. Andres Gluski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you Mr. Levine. There are no additional questions waiting at this time. So I will pass the conference back over to Susan Harcourt, for closing remarks. Susan Harcourt : We thank everybody for joining us on today\u2019s call. We look forward to seeing many of you at our Investor Day on Monday. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Thank you, and have a nice day. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

My name is Ellen, and I will be coordinating the call for today. At the end of today\u2019s presentation there will be an opportunity to ask question. [Operator Instructions] It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Susan Harcourt, Vice President of Investor Relations. Susan, please go ahead whenever you are ready. Susan Harcourt : Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2023 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements, which are discussed in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website along with the presentation. Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Coughlin, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team.  With that, I will turn the call over to Andres. Andres Gluski : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2023 financial review call. Today, I will discuss our second quarter results as well as the excellent progress we're making towards our financial and strategic objectives. Steve Coughlin, our CFO, will give some more detail on our financial performance and outlook. For the second quarter, adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes was $607 million, and adjusted earnings per share was $0.21. Results for the quarter as well as for the first half of the year are very much in line with our expectations. Thus, we're reaffirming our 2023 guidance for all metrics and our targeted annualized growth rate through 2027. As we noted earlier this year, approximately 75% of our 2023 earnings will come in the second half of the year. Now for an update on our strategic priorities. At the core of our strategy is a focus on, first, new renewables with the target to triple our installed capacity by 2027. Second, growth at our U.S. utilities, where we expect to increase the rate base by more than 10% per year through 2027. And third, the transformation of our portfolio as we exit coal by the end of 2025 and invest in the new technologies that will define our industry for years to come. Today, I will provide an update on how we are executing across each of these focus areas, beginning with our renewables on Slide 4. We continue to see significant inbound interest from key customers wanting to do large U.S.-based renewable projects with us. We believe this reflects both our reputation for consistently delivering on time as well as our best-in-class ability to tailor projects to the specific needs of our customers. Year-to-date, we have now signed 2.2 gigawatts of new PPAs, including 2.1 gigawatts since our Investor Day in May. These numbers do not include 1 gigawatt from Belfield second phase or 1.4 gigawatts from our Green Hydrogen Project with Air Products in Texas, both of which could be signed before the year's end. I feel good about the likelihood that we will sign 5 to 6 gigawatts of new PPAs this year. We continue to be globally the number one seller of renewable energy to corporate customers. We also had a leading position in the U.S., providing renewable energy to data centers, which are seeing explosive growth in part as a result of the generative AI revolution. Turning to Slide 5. Another area of recent success is how we have been working with technology customers to complete projects initiated by other developers. Our corporate customers want us to take on these projects because they know we will deliver them on time and can also restructure the original PPAs to provide customized solutions. Two great recent examples of this are the 185-megawatt Delta Wind project in Mississippi which has a signed PPA with Amazon and the 2 gigawatt Belfield project in California, 1 gigawatt, of which has a signed PPA with a large technology company that is a repeat customers. Both of these projects demonstrate the strength of the relationships we have with our customers. For us, completing other developers' projects is especially attractive because we can get similar returns to greenfield projects while preserving our current pipeline for future projects. Our 61 gigawatt pipeline represents investments in land, interconnection and development which must be replaced once utilized, given growing constraints on new transmission in markets like California and PJM, having the flexibility to decide when to utilize these resources helps us maximize total returns from our renewables business. Moving on to Slide 6. We now have a backlog of projects with signed long-term contracts of 13.2 gigawatts, which is the largest in AES' history. I would like to reiterate once more that our definition of backlog includes only signed contracts for which we have an obligation to deliver and our customers have an obligation to take a given amount of renewable energy for a given amount of time. The average tenure of the contracts in our backlog is 19 years, and currently, 41% of our 13.2 backlog is already under construction, and 74% is slated to come online within the next 3 years. Turning to Slide 7. Since our Investor Day in May, we have completed a number of landmark projects. In June, we announced the commercial operation of the 238-megawatt Phase 1 of the Chevelon Butte Wind project in Arizona. It is one of the first projects in the country to be placed in service to qualify for the 10% additional energy community tax credit bonus under the Inflation Reduction Act. And once Phase 2 is completed, it will reach 454 megawatts and be the largest wind project in the state. In addition, we completed the Andes 2B solar-plus storage project in Chile for our copper mining customers. It's 180 megawatts of solar plus 560-megawatt hours of storage will make it the largest battery storage installation in all of Latin America. We were also able to use 5b prefabricated solar panels for a portion of the project, which advances the learning and lowers the cost of future developments. Turning to Slide 8. We are on track to complete the 3.4 gigawatts of new renewable projects we committed to earlier this year, including nearly 800 megawatts we've already brought online. In the U.S., we expect to commission roughly 2.1 watts which is roughly double the capacity we installed last year. I am very proud of the work our teams have done to ensure that we have had no supply chain or construction delays. All of the necessary equipment has been contracted for our 2023 through 2025 backlog. There remains the potential for completion of up to an additional 600 megawatts this year in the U.S. given the strong performance of our construction program. We see our record of completing projects on time as a key competitive advantage that is highly valued by our customers. We are one of the only major developers that did not abandon or meaningfully delay construction projects over the last 2 years due to supply chain issues. Furthermore, due to our emphasis on long-term planning and strong contractual agreements, we have maintained our project margins despite inflationary pressures and rising interest rates. Now moving to our second priority of utility growth on Slide 9. We remain on track to grow our U.S. pretax contribution at an annualized rate of 17% to 20% through 2027. At AES, Ohio, we expect to receive commission approval for our new electric security plan or ESP 4 by the end of August, at which point our new distribution rates would go into immediate effect. As a reminder, ESP 4 includes approval of timely recovery of $500 million in grid modernization over the next 3 years, carrying a 10% return on equity. This will allow us to accelerate investments to continue to improve the quality of service while maintaining the most competitive rates in Ohio. At AES, Indiana, we filed for a new rate case in June, the first rate case since 2018. The proposed new rates are designed to recover inflationary impacts since the last case as well as investments in reliability, resiliency improvements and system upgrades. We expect commission approval by the middle of next year. Even after this proposed increase, we still expect our residential rates to be among the lowest in the state. At AES Indiana, we continue to advance our low carbon generation growth plan. We recently filed for approval to build a 200-megawatt or 800-megawatt hour storage facility at the site of the retiring Petersburg coal plant. This project is expected to come online by the end of next year, at which point it will be the largest battery storage project in the Midwest. Now turning to Slide 10 and our third priority of transforming our portfolio by exiting coal generation by the end of 2025. Since our Investor Day in May, we have significantly advanced our decarbonization objective by assuring the retirement of an additional 900 megawatts of coal generation. In June, we retired 415 megawatts of coal as we shut down Unit 2 of the Petersburg plant at AES Indiana. We also announced the retirement of the 276-megawatt Norgener Air Plant in Chile by 2025. Additionally, we received final approval, allowing for the termination of the PPA at our 205-megawatt Warrior Run Plant in Maryland for proceeds of $357 million. Now turning to Slide 11. We have expanded our leadership in the development and application of new technologies in our sector. We see this as another important competitive advantage. A new example is the use of embedded artificial intelligence, including generative AI across our operations. This year, we already expect more than $200 million of our adjusted EBITDA to be enabled by AI through both cost reductions and revenue enhance. We have incorporated AI and data analytics across our operations from areas such as wind production forecasting to vegetation management to identification of isolated solar panel failures. As part of this program, we also continue to pioneer and advance the use of robotics to install and maintain solar panels. Through our solar robotics program, we are developing proprietary AI-based computer vision to install a wide variety of solar modules, including the largest and heaviest models. With this technology, we plan to install projects significantly faster and across a wide range of working conditions, including extreme heat. In the coming months, we will be validating this technology for the installation of tens of megawatts and expect to move to use it for full scale solar projects in 2024. Finally, we're consolidating our lead in advanced green hydrogen projects with committed offtakers. We are currently developing the largest announced green hydrogen project in the U.S. jointly with Air Products in Texas. It features 1.4 gigawatts of inside defense, hourly matched renewables, 200 metric tons of hydrogen per day and a 30-year take-or-pay contract. It is expected to come online in 2027. Our pipeline of advanced green hydrogen projects is equivalent to more than 6 gigawatts of renewables and 800 metric tons of hydrogen per day. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our CFO, Steve Coughlin. Steve Coughlin : Thank you, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our second quarter results, 2023 parent capital allocation and 2023 guidance. Turning to our financial results for the quarter, beginning on Slide 13. I'm pleased to share that the second quarter was fully in line with our expectations, keeping us well on track to achieve our full year guidance.  Adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes was $607 million versus $722 million last year, driven primarily by lower margins at AES Andes and higher costs at our renewables SBU due to an accelerated growth plan, but partially offset by new renewables coming online and higher availability at select thermal businesses. Tax attributes earned by our U.S. renewables projects were relatively flat at $38 million in the second quarter of this year, in line with our expectations. Turning to Slide 14. Adjusted EPS was $0.21 versus $0.34 last year. In addition to the drivers of adjusted EBITDA, we saw higher parent interest expense this quarter. As a reminder, our year-to-date EPS is fully in line with the breakdown that we outlined earlier this year, in which we noted that roughly 25% of our earnings would come in the first half of the year and 75% in the second half. I'll cover the performance of our strategic business units or SBUs in more detail over the next 4 slides, beginning on Slide 15. In the renewables SBU, we continue to execute on our strategic priority to triple our portfolio by 2027. For the second quarter, as expected, we saw higher adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes driven primarily by higher wind generation and new projects coming online, partially offset by higher business development and fixed costs due to our accelerated growth plan. At our utilities SBU, we saw higher adjusted PTC driven by lower maintenance expenses, but partially offset by higher interest expense from new debt. We continue to expect strong utilities earnings for the second half of the year driven by typical second half demand seasonality and the pending August decision on ESP 4 at AES, Ohio. With this pending decision and the great progress in renewables growth at AES Indiana, we are continuing to pursue our strategic priority to increase rate base by an average of 10% annually through 2027. Lower adjusted EBITDA at our energy infrastructure SBU, primarily reflects lower margins at AES Andes in line with our phase out of coal, partially offset by higher availability at select thermal units. As we execute -- our third strategic priority to exit coal and complete the transformation of our portfolio, although not every quarter, we generally expect to see annual year-over-year declines in energy infrastructure as we discussed at Investor Day in May. Finally, at our new energy technologies SBU, higher adjusted EBITDA reflects continued improved profit margins at Fluence. Fluence has shown year-over-year improvement for 3 straight quarters, and we are very pleased with the strong results they are delivering this year. Now to Slide 19. We are on track to achieve our full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion. Growth in the year to go will be primarily driven by contributions from new businesses including growth at our U.S. utilities and contributions from new renewables projects coming online. As a reminder, the 3.4 gigawatts of new renewables we expect to add this year represents an increase of over 75% compared to the 1.9 gigawatts we added to our portfolio last year. This amount also represents a doubling of new renewables in the U.S. versus 2022. This growth will be offset by approximately $200 million of LNG sales we've recorded primarily in the third quarter last year, which we do not expect to recur this year. In addition to our adjusted EBITDA, we expect to realize $500 million to $560 million of tax attributes in 2023, bringing our total adjusted EBITDA plus tax attributes to $3.1 billion to $3.5 billion for the year. Turning to Slide 20. We are also reaffirming our full year 2023 adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.65 to $1.75. As a reminder, we expect our adjusted EPS to be heavily fourth quarter weighted due to the late year seasonality of our U.S. renewable project commissioning. Now to our 2023 parent capital allocation plan on Slide 21. Sources reflect approximately $2.4 billion of total discretionary cash, including $1 billion of parent free cash flow, $400 million to $600 million of asset sales and a $900 million parent debt issuance we completed in Q2. For more information on our debt issuances at the parent company and our subsidiaries, please refer to the appendix of the presentation. On the right-hand side, you can see our planned use of capital remains largely in line with guidance, with higher parent investment reflecting our recent acquisition of the 2-gigawatt Belfield project in the U.S. At our Investor Day in May, we outlined our capital allocation plan through 2027, including asset sales, along with debt and potential future equity issuances. We appreciate all of the feedback we've received, and I want to take a moment to clarify that we will only raise and invest capital in a way that's value accretive to our shareholders. Any potential future equity issuances would have to yield accretive value to shareholders for us to pursue equity as a source of capital. We are also committed to improving our credit profile over time and further bolstering our investment grade rating. We have a number of other levers to pull to support our growth such as increased capital recycling through asset sales and sell-downs. Given our strong asset sales track record and recent success, it is possible that any future equity issuances could be materially lower than the 5-year figure we previously shared. As always, our Investor Relations team is happy to take additional feedback and to follow up on additional questions or data requests. In summary, we're continuing to make progress on transforming AES' portfolio while delivering strong growth in adjusted EBITDA, earnings and parent free cash flow. Our businesses are executing successfully and delivering on their commitments. We will continue to allocate our capital towards our high-growth renewables and utilities to maximize shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres. Andres Gluski : Thank you, Steve. In summary, we're reaffirming our 2023 guidance for all metrics and our targeted annualized growth rates through 2027. We continue to make substantial progress on our strategic priorities, including tripling our installed renewables capacity by 2027, increasing the rate base at our U.S. utilities by more than 10% per year through 2027 and and transforming our portfolio by exiting coal by the end of 2025, while investing in new technologies. We are delivering on all the commitments we made on our Q4 2022 earnings call and at our Investor Day presentation. With that, I would like to open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Durgesh, your line is open. Please proceed. Durgesh Chopra : Andres, just you're now -- if I heard you correctly in your remarks are targeting 5 to 6 gigawatts of new PPAs first. Can you confirm whether that is accurate because that's higher than what kind of you might have locked down in previous years? And then what's driving that higher range? Andres Gluski : Sure, Durgesh. Good to talk to you. Look, we signed 5.2 gigawatts of new PPAs last year. So what we're seeing this year is we already have 2.2 signed. We have visibility into just 2 projects, which would be another about 2.4, right? Which would put us 4.4. And of course, we have other projects in the pipeline. So we're not really setting out an official target, but I'm saying that we believe that we should be similar to last year. And we do have a couple of what I call these whales, the 1 gigawatt plus targets, but we feel very good because we see a lot of demand for our products. We have people coming to us with products. So it's really looking at how do we best allocate our money where we get the highest returns and best allocate our teams. Durgesh Chopra : And then maybe when could we get clarity on the potential 600 megawatts in terms of timing. Is that really sort of a Q3 call event when we would know more. How should we think about that? I'm just thinking about the projects that pushed into 2024, yes. Andres Gluski : Sure. Look, I would say that we feel very good about our construction program. So -- versus -- this was the big challenge of this year to grow our construction program in the U.S. by 100%. We feel very good about it. Unfortunately, a lot of these are slated to be commissioned towards the latter part of the year. So we should have a good view in -- on the Q3 call of where we stand. And whether we're going to do more of these projects this year. But in general, we're very pleased with the supply chain, with our construction teams. The team has really stepped up to the task, and I'm very proud of them. Durgesh Chopra : And then just one last one for me. Steve, you mentioned that the equity needs could be materially reduced. It's nice to hear that in your prepared remarks. Maybe just can you give us more color when could we get an update on timing? Where are you thinking just the current equity needs, when in the plan are those scheduled to hit? And just when could we get an update? Steve Coughlin : Yes. Look, I mean, as I said in my remarks, Durgesh, this is just a function of multiple levers. And we're seeing a lot of great progress on our asset sale program and the $3 billion that we put out at Investor Day was well below the total universe of opportunities. So -- what I wanted to point out is that we're only going to issue equity in the future, and that could be far in the future to the point that it's value accretive to shareholders, and we haven't also tapped other sources that we intend to tap, which is our asset recycling program. So as you saw with where you run, as we've seen, as we've executed on the renewable sell-downs, as we exit further coal assets, we have a lot of upside in that asset sale number. So at this point, it's indefinitely into the future and our share price would need to be substantially higher than where it is today, and it would have to be value accretive to shareholders on a per share basis. Andres Gluski : Durgesh, I guess another point I'd like to make is that we've been very effective at bringing in partners to fund our projects. So that's obviously another lever that we have. So we laid out what could be a possible path. We were very conservative on the numbers. But if we don't feel that we want to, at some point in the future, issue equity, we can always invite partners into our project. Of course, we're giving them part of the upside as well. Operator : Our next question comes from David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley. David, your line is open. Please go ahead. David Arcaro : I was wondering, just what's your latest thinking on just the hydrogen PTC timing in terms of treasury guidance here and what the rules around matching and additionality might be? And kind of just in coordination with that, what are your -- what's your current like project pipeline and discussions with potential partners on that side of the business as it stands currently? . Andres Gluski : Well, of course, the final rules haven't come out. What I would like to say is that our Felix project -- our project in Texas is -- really would meet the very strictest criteria. So it is additional. It is hourly matched. It is regional. So it has the very lowest carbon footprint technically feasible in the U.S. So I'd like to put that right out there that our project is not dependent in any way about how the rules come out. Now having said that, I do believe that additionality is important. I also believe that we have to move to early matching, in part because we need green hydrogen projects to be tradable goods. So these are the rules in Europe. I also think regionality is important, so we don't add further congestion. So really, what we want is that the new rules come out help us create a market, but they also help lower our total carbon footprint. So we don't want to just be squeezing the balloon, taking off renewable energy from the grid to produce green hydrogen.  And we can get into more specifics there. So I do expect that the rules will come out, we'll incorporate some of these factors. But I want to say that our projects are very solid. We have committed off-takers, which I think is the key because this market for green hydrogen is developing. So to have early-on projects, I think the key is not only have a great project, and it -- with a very low carbon footprint. So you get all of the benefits of the IRA, but to have a committed offtaker. David Arcaro : And then I was curious if you could speak to the transmission challenges just related to transformation interconnection in the renewable industry. You alluded to it in your commentary, but I was wondering if you could speak to what your kind of current pipeline of maybe transmission positions and also with regard to like early stage development, land positions, things like that. How soon could a transmission constraint potentially impact your business? And how are you positioned now to kind of avoid that in the foreseeable future? Andres Gluski : Well, look, I think transmission constraints are affecting the market already. So we got out early, and we started getting a filing for interconnections on a big way 3 years ago in key markets like PJM and CAISO. So I think we're in a good position there. I think right now, we have a new industry here. And so I think we have to come to terms with the new definitions. What is pipeline? So for us, pipeline is projects that we already have, either land rights, interconnection rights, real prospects to make a project. And then, of course, there are different phases. Some projects are far more advanced shovel ready and some are more at the beginning of the Q. I think having looked at a lot of say, proposals from other developers, they count pipeline things that are -- we would call prospects. And I think we have to move towards a common definition, I mean, a little bit perhaps like the oil sector, which has possible reserves -- has probable reserves and has proven reserves, right? And I think what's very important is that the -- to get a pipeline, you have to invest and you have to have money. So some of the new changes, for example, on the interconnections will make it a little bit more costly just sort of spurious flood the zone request for interconnections. So maybe Steve can give you some comments on how that is progressing, which would be favorable to us. We don't see any sort of short-run effect of it. But in the long run, it's favorable to us because I think we've been the most, I would say, stringent about what we consider pipeline. And what we're very interested in doing is maximizing the conversion rate. But I do also want to emphasize that if somebody comes to us, a client and ask us to complete on advanced stage development project, that's the best of all worlds because we get to conserve the pipeline. We weren't investing money when it was at the highest risk stage and can bring it online more quickly and satisfy that client. Steve Coughlin : Yes. And I would just add to that, look, I mean, we're very pleased with the final rules coming out of the third quarter 2023. But although, as Andre said, we've -- this has been our strategy to lead renewables development for many years. So we put ourselves in an advantaged position, I think, many years ago getting into these cues. Nonetheless, it is important for the industry overall for these cues to be move along faster in the process to be more efficient. So having the higher financial thresholds to get into the cues and to stay in the cue, having to demonstrate project maturity in terms of permits, and financing behind them, having cluster studies so that this isn't just a one by one review process. And then having the penalties and the teeth behind the deadlines that have to be met to do the studies is also important. So there's a number of angles at which this issue is being approached through the order. The order is due to be published, I think, very soon and will go into effect 60 days later. I think it's a great thing for the industry. We've already felt great about our position. But of course, over the longer term to have these cues cleaned up and moving faster is very important, and I think we'll further accelerate growth throughout the rest of the decade. Andres Gluski : And I say, look, we're also taking sort of technological a look at how we can improve transmission for our projects. So this is like using the grid stack to be able to baseload transmission lines, which were really peakers. This means dynamic line rating. This means using our prefab solar, which takes about half the space to be able to put higher loads where we have a good interconnection. And you also noticed that we're putting large battery projects where we have interconnections from our decommissioned coal plants. So we're looking at this problem rather holistically. And again, I think we're in a very good position to take advantage of what's going to be an increasingly congested grid. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Sunderland from JPMorgan. Richard, your line is open. Please proceed. Richard Sunderland : Circling back to the data center commentary from scripts. Curious how much of a near-term change in C&I demand you're seeing from this subsector specifically? And any indications of upside just on that ramp over the next 1 to 2 years relative to what you were seeing maybe 6 months or a year ago? Andres Gluski : I would say yes. I mean, the -- there's some definitions that they are waiting for in various markets, but about rules of where you can locate data centers. But no, we're definitely seeing increased interest and increasing demand, and we are the largest provider to U.S. data centers. And so I think we can uniquely provide data centers with the same quality of service, for example, in certain markets abroad, be it Mexico, Chile, Brazil, which is another advantage for us. So yes, we are seeing increased demand from that sector. Richard Sunderland : And then just wanted to parse the kind of backlog pipeline conversation a little bit more finally for the hydrogen. It sounds like the 1.4 gigawatts for Texas could come in this year. Could you just speak a little bit more to your confidence level there for '23 specifically, and what you're focused on there? And then thinking about the balance of the hydrogen opportunities, when could those come in over the next few years? Andres Gluski : Well, again, I think we're the most advanced in terms of real green hydrogen projects. So in the U.S., we have committed offtakers for that project in Texas. We have several other projects, including two of the hubs, one in Los Angeles also one in Houston. I would say that we could sign the first project this year. It will be -- we're coming online for 2027 outside our guidance range. And the subsequent wins would be somewhat further out, '27, '28. But what we're seeing is strong demand. And basically, we are seen as a preferred partner by several people. And we also have very good projects, for example, in Chile, which is to green the mining sector. They're heavy equipment. We've already green electricity use, and a possible ammonia export project in the Northeast of Brazil. So again, stay tuned, but I feel quite confident in saying we're the most advanced in projects with committed off-takers. And we think we will hit these numbers. It's really a question of as they come online because you have to have the equipment that can use it. Certainly, in the shorter term, you can substitute green hydrogen in thermal processes in a lot of petrochemicals or steel plants, other things like that. So we have to see as this market develops. But again, I think we're very well positioned. It's a very exciting opportunity for us. Richard Sunderland : And then just one final one for me. The Belfield project, you've been very clear in a lot of the messaging around how that came together. I'm just curious in terms of considerations around Phase 2 versus Phase 1, just Phase 1 your return thresholds on a stand-alone basis. How do you think about the progress to signing Phase 2? Anything you can offer there would be helpful. Andres Gluski : I think we're well advanced on Phase 2 is what I'm willing to say. It would be a similar project to Phase 1. So that is the largest solar plus storage project in the U.S. in California. So it's a very unique offering that we can bring together. Operator : Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Angie, your line is open. Please go ahead. Angie Storozynski : So I wanted to start with some high-profile management departures we've seen since the Analyst Day, basically from your core businesses, right, the U.S. utilities and U.S. renewables. I mean, you might be just victims of your own success in a sense, but just how you can reassure us that there's no change in the execution of your growth plans, especially in these 2 businesses and the demand that you have to fill those vacancies? Andres Gluski : Angie, and thanks for that question. And I think you got it spot on. Look, this is, quite frankly, a symptom of strength in our case. We have the hottest management team in the market. And so of course, people are going to be being made offers. And if people are obviously -- if they want to go to private equity and bet on a longer-term IPO, that's their right. But this in no way affects our business whatsoever. And I think the best proof of that is after the departure in clean energy, we've signed more PPIs. So we're doing very well. I don't expect it to have any impact on the business. And I expect the same in U.S. utilities. I don't expect this will have any impact whatsoever. But it is a sign of that, yes, we have a strong team, we have a deep bench, and we'll continue to identify talent and prepare it and move it up. Again, let's say, where AES was in, say, in 2012 or something, our team wasn't the honest in the business, people wouldn't be trying to poach it. So it is what it is, but I feel very good about where we are, and it doesn't change our plans whatsoever. And I think the teams are very motivated on executing on the plans that we laid out. Angie Storozynski : And then moving on, I mean, you talked a lot about your backlog of renewable power projects. So -- and then potential monetization of assets in the world of equity. So First, on the backlog, I mean, we've heard stories about some public renewable power developers basically showing in their backlog third-party projects where they don't have exclusivity for these projects. So again, this is just anecdotal evidence, but I'm just wondering if you've heard of those instances and if any of this could be true for you guys? Andres Gluski : Well, I can say categorically, absolutely, under no uncertain terms, we have no such projects in our backlog. I want to make very clear because maybe some other people are doing that. I think that's not transparent. I would not recommend anybody to do it. In our case, whatever we have in the backlog, we are -- we have the project, we are committed to delivering it on a certain date for a certain amount of time, and our clients have an obligation to take that energy -- a certain amount of energy for a certain amount of time. So this is binding for both sides. And the fact that 43% of our backlog is currently being built, we have ordered all the equipment for our '23 through '25 backlog, and about 3 quarters of them will come online by 2025. So I want to make very clear that's a good question. I wouldn't recommend anybody to do that. And I can say, categorically, we would never do something like that. Angie Storozynski : And then on the monetization of assets. So I understand that there is a very big difference between the assets that recently transacted and the ones that you are developing, it's only because of the duration of the PPAs, so basically the duration of the cash flows. But on the flip side, right, you have higher discount rates for the DCF value of those cash flows. So I'm just thinking if you were to monetize some of these assets, again, I guess it all depends where the stock is. But again, how would that, from your perspective, demonstrate the value of the portfolio that you currently have? Steve Coughlin : Yes, Angie, this is Steve. So look, we have, as you know, have been selling down our renewable projects after they've come online and we package them together in portfolio. So we have seen some, I would say, relatively small uptick in return requirements there, but nothing outside the range of what we expected within our plan in terms of -- this is -- these are very low-risk assets. They're solar coupon, essentially, no fuel costs, very low maintenance. So these are very predictable, and the demand for these assets continues to be very strong. So we don't see any impact to the plan for how we sell down from sort of where rates are in the market today. Does that address your question? Andres Gluski : I think -- I mean the other thing is that these are -- all investment-grade quality offtake or the very highest quality off-takers that you can have. So we are selling down the premium product in the market. So I think it's important to say that, look, people have talked about inflation, people have talked about writing interest rates, we're not seeing a degradation of our margins. So the margin of our money into these projects, we're not seeing any squeeze whatsoever. Steve Coughlin : Yes. And on top of that in site -- so just as Andreas pointed out, with the new project, we have the energy community adder for that project. And actually, most -- all of our wind projects going forward, we expect to qualify for the domestic adder as well, Angie, so there's some significant offsets to the cost of financing that we've been achieving too. Operator : Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Julien, your line is open. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: I know a lot has been said here already, but let me follow up on some details here, just on the year-over-year comparisons here as we go to the back half of the year, if I may. Look, I'd love to talk about -- I think you have in your slides here, $0.24 of positive net impact in the back half of the year from renewables and year-over-year comps on LNG if I rewind here, I think you said in the back half of the year that -- I mean, last year, it was like $0.30 contribution from LNG. Just as I think about that, that seems like a pretty big step-up year-over-year renewables. Can you talk about what renewables assumptions you're baking in as sort of a discrete item in -- especially in the back half of the year to sort of make up for what you need to get to your guidance? And then if I think about the start of the year, right, in terms of what you talked about renewable contributing, I think we talked about $0.27 for the full year. So -- it seems like what's implied here again, I'm curious that renewable is actually contributing more than what we thought at the start of the year and maybe what that says for future years as well. But please, by all means, respond accordingly. Steve Coughlin : So yes, this is Steve, Julien. So the $0.30 it doesn't -- sound correct or actually more like $0.20 is the LNG year-over-year delta to be offset. And then, of course, we're more than doubling the renewable commissioning this year. So if you recall, it was just around 1 gigawatt last year, and it's 2.1 gigawatts this year, most all of which is in the second half of the year. So what we're carrying in the first half is sort of more of the cost in renewables. The EBITDA has been relatively flat through the first half. In the second half, then we're going to see that renewable number pick up substantially, and that's why we have the 75% loading on the second half of the year earnings. That's a major driver. The other is, of course, utility demand in Ohio and Indiana peaking in Q3. You've got Southland, where we have the peak cooling season in the third quarter. And then we have hydro in Latin America, typically, the volumes are much higher as we come out of the wet season in the summer and the winter and you have the snow melt into the fall. So those are really the primary drivers is the clean energy Southland, the utilities and then some of the hydro assets in Latin America having much more volume in the second half of the year. But the LNG offset is really only about $0.20 for the -- and mostly in the third quarter. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Is there a use on that -- sorry, go forward. Andres Gluski : I was just say we're executing exactly what we laid out at the beginning of the year. So there's been no change. I want to make that clear. Steve Coughlin : Yes. Yes, this is -- I think we're right at 25% on the EPS, Julian, year-to-date. So this is -- what we're seeing, although the year-over-year in the quarter is lower, that's primarily due to coal retirements in Chile as we've done the green blended extend, some of the coal that's still there, the margins have come down, which was all expected. So we're exactly on track. And also, to your point, there is some potential upside, as Andres noted, we feel really good about being on track with the construction program and there still remains the upside on the 600 megawatts potential. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: But the point is the plan for $0.27 of renewables contribution in '23 unchanged from the start of the year still. Steve Coughlin : Yes. Let us get back to you on the exact number because I don't have that math in front of me, but the renewables contribution is looking at least on track, is what I would say. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: If I can give a slight different direction here, trying to follow up on a few earlier questions. Just on the asset sale dynamics versus equity, can you comment a little bit further about what else you're seeing out there? Or what else could be monetized just as you think about deemphasizing equity. It sounds like the principal lever Andres, you were alluding to is that you would just sell down your interest in the new renewables even more so. Is that fair to say in terms of like the alternative lever here versus the corporate level equity? And also just to clarify the point you made earlier on just very precisely, at these levels today, you would definitively move away from the equity levels that you -- equity-ish levels you defined earlier. -- in lieu of these alternatives? Andres Gluski : So on the first point, no, it's not fair. Characterization is not fair. So what -- look, all right, we have partnerships in all of our businesses. So we don't necessarily have to do it on the new projects. So we can bring in partners to -- money is fungible. So if we monetize a different business, that means we have more money available for renewables. We will -- as we have in the past, we can choose to optimize the return on invested capital. And I think that we're doing a very good job of how we exit coal. I think the Warrior Run monetization, I think is probably better than people's expectations. And so we continue to manage that. So all I'm saying is that -- we never -- as Steve said in his script, we didn't -- we put this out as a 5-year plan. And in the 5-year plan, we had a certain amount of asset sales, a conservative number, and we had a sort of range for potential equity issuance as well. So the 2 somewhat offset each other. So if we do better on the asset sales, we will need less equity and we do better in terms of bringing in partnerships. So what we're saying at these levels, we do not feel comfortable issuing equity. But I think it's been very clear from our presentation that we have tremendous demand for what we're doing. And that is a once-in-a-lifetime market opportunity. So we want to create the most value for our shareholders from that opportunity. So obviously, if we don't have -- what we feel is correctly valued equity, we'll have to use other levers. And this should be nothing new to you guys. We have financed a remarkable change in this company without issuing equity. We did it by selling down assets. We got into wind by bringing in partners. So what we're saying is nothing like a promise for the future. It's just more of the same. So we will use whatever the levers creates the most value for our shareholders, and we will continue to do so. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So your point ultimately is not committing to selling down partners per se, a variety of different sources here incrementally just not issuing the equity at current levels. And if I can also clarify this process underway. I know that it was listed in the queue here as well. Is that still status quo in a way? Steve Coughlin : No, there's no -- there's no specific Maritza process underway, Julien, at this point. So still evaluating different pathways for Maritza. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Levine from Citi. Ryan, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Ryan Levine : A couple of specific follow-on questions. Is your Fluence take core to your portfolio? And I guess secondly, on the financing side, are you still open to considering the convert market to help offset equity issuance? Steve Coughlin : So this is Steve. So yes, Fluence is part of the portfolio we own roughly 1/3, 34% of Fluence. It is not consolidated, but it does come in through equity method. And we do, in our adjusted EBITDA definition include an adjustment to include Fluence EBITDA. So that does show up and it's in our new energy technologies SBU influence margin... Ryan Levine : The question is that core, is that core? Steve Coughlin : Is it core? Or did you say -- is it core to our business? Ryan Levine : Core. Steve Coughlin : So look, I mean, I would say -- so given that it's an outside business, I don't think I would parse this out as like core or noncore. It's been a really important strategy for us to be able to lead in energy storage, both in development as well as in the technology as well as sort of advancing the way that storage gets used to create the innovative solutions we've done like 24/7 carbon-free energy to make those products work. We've done a lot of co-innovation, co-development with Fluence around that. So that's, I would say, definitely core to our strategy is what we've been able to do with storage. But as Andres said many times, these are technology businesses of their own right. They're separated. We are not in them indefinitely, and we continue to grow new opportunities. And as we do we may look to monetize part of our positions down the road. No time soon, and we see a lot of value upside. We're very pleased with how the new management team has driven value already that's been recognized, but we still see a lot of upside and there's a lot of partnership that we continue to work on new solutions around. So it is core from that perspective that I laid out. Ryan Levine : Okay. And then on the convert option? Steve Coughlin : So no, nothing that we're contemplating at this point. I mean, look, we did a $900 million debt deal just in the second quarter. Nothing -- no specific convert for us contemplated at this point. Ryan Levine : And then last question. In terms of Puerto Rico, what's your strategy there from existing assets and future development perspective? Andres Gluski : Well, in Puerto Rico, we're greening the island's energy grid. So we do have renewal projects we're bringing in batteries as well. And it's our plan to phase out coal by 2025. So we're assisting the island and its energy transition. And I think we've been very clear what our objectives are. Operator : Our final question comes from Gregg Orrill from UBS. Gregg, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Gregg Orrill : Yes. Probably quick. On AES Ohio, is the DPO rate case, how does that timing compare with what you were assuming in guidance or any other differences with how that's proceeding versus the '23 guidance? Steve Coughlin : Yes. Gregg, it's right on track with what we assumed in our guidance. So the decision has been put on the agenda for next week, August 9, that was just published, I believe, yesterday. So right on track in terms of when we assume the decision to be made. And we still feel really good about where that is likely to come out. As a reminder, once the decision is made, is to put in place, then the new rates that were decided upon last year immediately go into effect. And as we've laid out, the riders would go into effect and then the frequent quarterly recovery on our distribution investments going forward, would start to be put in place. And so this is a business really pivoting to a very different phase from where we've been delevering and setting that business up for a more normalized structure. This is an important pivot point for Ohio to really pivot to growth, and there's a lot of room for growth as there's the lowest rates in the state there in all customer classes. And even with the ESP 4, the new rates, we expect it to continue to be the lowest rates in the state for the foreseeable future. And we have, as Andres noted, 10%-plus rate base growth expected going forward. So we're very excited about this and look forward to the decision next week. Andres Gluski : Yes. And I'm also very excited about that Dayton is finally getting incoming investment. So you have a new Honda EV plant to have a battery plant coming into our service area. So you're starting to see an economic recovery. Dayton had sort of been not participating in the expansion that we had seen in Eastern Ohio. So it's a very exciting time, and we're very happy that we could invest and continue to improve the quality of service and continue to attract new investments into the Dayton area. So it's not only a rate base story, I think there's an economic recovery story happening in Dayton for the first time in decades. So it's a very exciting time to be in Dayton. Operator : I will now hand back to Susan Harcourt for any closing remarks. Susan Harcourt : We thank everybody for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Thank you, and have a nice day. Operator : This concludes today's conference for everybody. Thank you very much for joining. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a great rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and thank you for joining The AES Corporation Third Quarter 2023 Financial Review Call. My name is Kate, and I will be the moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Susan Harcourt, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may proceed. Susan Harcourt : Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2023 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements, which are discussed in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website along with the presentation. Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Stephen Coughlin, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will turn the call over to Andres. Andres Gluski : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2023 financial review call. In addition to discussing our third quarter and outlook for the remainder of the year, I will address some concerns that we have heard from investors since our second quarter call in August. Specifically, my remarks today will focus on three areas : strategic and financial updates, our funding sources, and our exposure to interest rates. Beginning on Slide 3. I am pleased to report that our financial results continue to be strong and we now expect full year adjusted EPS to be in the top half of our guidance range of $1.65 to $1.75. We are also reaffirming all of our short- and long-term financial metrics. For the third quarter, adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes was $1 billion, and adjusted earnings per share was $0.60. I'm very pleased with these results, which Steve will address in more detail shortly. Turning to Slide 4. We continue to see strong demand for long-term contracts for renewables, particularly from our primary customer base of large technology companies with a rapidly expanding data center business. Notably, even with rising interest rates, renewables continue to have the lowest levelized cost of energy, or LCOE, across almost all of the markets where we operate. So far this year, we have signed 3.7 gigawatts of new PPAs, including 1.5 gigawatts since our second quarter call in August. This number does not include the 1.2 gigawatts of new projects we were recently awarded in New York. Given that we have several large contracts that could be finalized in the coming weeks, we remain confident in our ability to sign at least 5 gigawatts of new long-term PPAs this year. Included in the new contracts that we have already signed, is our first-ever developed transfer agreement, or DTA, to transfer to a utility 975 megawatts of solar plus storage at the point of commencement of construction. This structure allows us to create value from our advanced pipeline without the investment of any AES equity beyond the development costs. Now turning to our backlog on Slide 5. Our backlog of projects with signed long-term contracts is now 13.1 gigawatts. Of this total backlog, we expect more than 70% or over 9 gigawatts to come online through 2025, and we have already secured all of the necessary equipment for these projects. Furthermore, 44% or 5.8 gigawatts is already under construction. Moving to Slide 6. Our construction program continues to make excellent progress with 93% of the megawatts expected to come online this year, already having achieved mechanical completion. As a result, we have increased our year-end construction target from 3.4 gigawatts to 3.5 gigawatts to incorporate the progress we have made this year. This figure reflects a more than doubling of the renewable projects placed in service compared to last year. Now turning to Slide 7. In light of current market conditions, I would like to directly address the sources of funding that we have in our long-term plan. We will not be issuing any equity until at least 2026, and even then, we will only issue equity if it is value accretive to our shareholders. Instead, we are significantly accelerating our asset sales, and believe, we now have line of sight to at least $2 billion of asset sale proceeds in '24 and '25, and expect our asset sale proceeds to total at least $3.5 billion through 2027. With the proceeds from the sell-downs of our businesses in the Dominican Republic and Panama that we announced in September, we have already secured all of our external financing needs for the year at attractive terms. The general buckets that are part of our asset sales plan are : coal exit; sell-downs of U.S. renewable projects; partial monetization of businesses, including new energy technologies; and the exit of certain noncore businesses. We also plan to bring in partners at some of our businesses as we have done in the past to reduce future equity needs. While we never disclose specific transactions until we have actually signed sales agreement, we are in active and positive discussions with many interested counterparties. Turning to Slide 8. The last topic I want to address before turning the call over to Steve is our exposure to interest rates. As a normal course of business, we have always proactively matched the profile of the debt to the profile of the cash flows that are supporting, which minimizes any impact from higher interest rates. Approximately 80% of our debt is non-recourse to the AES parent. And of that, the vast majority is either utility debt included in our customer rates or project level debt that is matched to the underlying project revenues. All of our long-term debt at Corp is either fixed or hedged, and as we have stated before, we've been able to pass on higher costs and interest rates in the new PPAs we signed. Finally, I want to highlight our commitment to maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings, which we see as an important component of our value proposition. To that end, in every business decision we make, we take into consideration our relevant credit metrics. We take a disciplined approach to growth and overall risk management to ensure that we consistently maintain these metrics. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our CFO, Steve Coughlin. Steve Coughlin : Thank you, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our third quarter results, our 2023 guidance, how we are flexing our plans to adapt to current financial market conditions and how we minimize our exposure to interest rates. Turning to our financial results for the quarter, beginning on Slide 10. I'm pleased to share that we had a strong third quarter and are fully on track to achieve our full year guidance. Adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes was just over $1 billion versus $991 million last year, driven primarily by higher contributions at our Renewables SBU, the recovery of prior year's purchase power costs at AES Ohio included as part of the ESP4 settlement and improved results at Fluence. These drivers were partially offset by the absence of the significant LNG transaction margins, which we earned last year. Tax attributes earned by our U.S. renewables projects this quarter were $18 million versus $60 million a year ago, in-line with our expectations of a higher share of renewable projects coming online in the fourth quarter. Turning to Slide 11. Adjusted EPS was $0.60 versus $0.63 last year. In addition to the drivers of adjusted EBITDA, we saw higher parent interest expense this quarter as well as a higher adjusted tax rate. I'll cover the performance of our strategic business units or SBUs in more detail over the next few slides, beginning on Slide 12. In the Renewables SBU, we saw higher adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes, driven primarily by higher contributions from new projects brought online in the last 12 months, as well as higher margins in Colombia. This was partially offset by lower tax credit recognition as a result of fewer new projects placed into service this quarter versus a year ago. Our business continues to make strong progress, not just with construction, but also the financing of new projects. We continue to see a robust market for tax credits. This year, we have already raised $1.8 billion in tax capital financing. The market for tax attributes is also greatly expanding as a result of the tax credit transfer option that has brought many more participants to the market. Importantly, tax credit transfers get recognized in operating and free cash flow, which further enhances our financial funding flexibility. Going forward, we will increasingly use tax credit transfers as a means to monetize tax credits including for nearly 500 megawatts of projects in 2023. At our Utilities SBU, higher adjusted PTC was driven by the recovery of prior year's purchase power costs at AES Ohio included as part of the ESP4 settlement, which have been recognized as an expense in the third quarter of last year. I'd now like to take a moment to discuss the continued progress of our utility growth program on Slide 14. In August, we received commission approval at AES Ohio for our new Electric Security Plan, or ESP4, which includes timely recovery of $500 million of grid modernization investments at a 10% return on equity, allowing us to further improve the quality of service. As a reminder, we plan to grow the combined rate bases of our U.S. utilities at a 10% average annual rate through 2027. 80% of our planned investments through 2027 are either already approved or under FERC formula rate programs. We are executing on this plan and with our investment programs across the two utilities, we are on track to increase our capital expenditures by over 35% year-over-year as we work to modernize and invest in system reliability. As we previously discussed, our utilities in Ohio and Indiana continue to charge the lowest residential rates of all electric utilities in both states. Turning back to our third quarter results, with our Energy Infrastructure SBU on Slide 15. Lower adjusted EBITDA primarily reflects significant LNG transaction margins in the prior year, partially offset by prior year onetime expenses in Argentina and higher revenues recognized from the monetization of the PPA at our Warrior Run coal plant. Finally, at our New Energy Technologies SBU, higher adjusted EBITDA reflects continued improved results at Fluence. Fluence has continued to demonstrate improving margins and strong pipeline growth, and they have indicated their expectation to be close to adjusted EBITDA breakeven in the fourth quarter of their 2023 fiscal year. This year-over-year improvement would be reflected in our own fourth quarter results. Turning to Slide 17. I'm very pleased to highlight that we now expect to achieve the top half of both our 2023 adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.65 to $1.75 and our parent free cash flow range of $950 million to $1 billion. This reflects the strong performance of our renewables construction team whose excellent execution this year means that we expect to exceed our construction target of 3.4 gigawatts by at least 100 megawatts. Now to Slide 18. We are reaffirming our full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion. Including the $500 million to $560 million of tax attributes we expect to realize in 2023, we expect adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes of $3.1 billion to $3.5 billion. The additional U.S. projects we expect to bring online this year should allow us to exceed the midpoint of the tax attributes estimate we provided at Investor Day. Now to our 2023 parent capital allocation plan on Slide 19. Sources reflect approximately $2.4 billion of total discretionary cash, including $1 billion of parent free cash flow, $400 million to $600 million of asset sales, and the $900 million parent debt issuance we completed in Q2. With the agreement to sell down a minority interest in our gas and LNG business in the Dominican Republic and Panama, we have secured the entirety of our external sources of parent level capital for 2023. Turning to Slide 20. Since our Investor Day in May, financial market conditions have changed, and AES will flex its near-term and long-term plans accordingly. Looking ahead, we will continue to prioritize our strong credit profile and investment-grade ratings, hitting our financial metric growth targets, funding our growth primarily in U.S. renewables and U.S. utilities and advancing on our decarbonization and portfolio simplification goals. We have a number of levers to adjust that will keep us on track with these objectives. First, and to be clear, we will not issue equity at or near current share price levels and not until it is value accretive to our shareholders on a per share basis. As such, we are increasing our asset sale target to at least $3.5 billion for the 2023 to 2027 timeframe and accelerating our plan to achieve $2 billion of asset sale proceeds in 2024 and 2025. With this change, we will not issue any equity until at least 2026, and the amount anticipated has been reduced to $500 million to $1 billion through our guidance period. Second, the tax credit transferability option that we now have creates added flexibility to monetize the tax value of our U.S. renewables projects with a broader base of market participants while also increasing free cash flow and the capacity to fund growth. Third, while we still intend to exit all of our coal businesses in a few of our markets, our coal assets will be temporarily needed to support the energy transition beyond 2025 as renewable deployments and transmission have not progressed as quickly as required. We still intend to exit the majority of our remaining coal businesses by the end of 2025. However, we have the flexibility to delay the exit of a few select plants through 2027 to support continued electricity reliability. This delay would yield continued financial contributions from these assets during this period. For 2024 and 2025, we expect to fund our remaining parent capital needs entirely with asset sales and planned debt issuances. We feel confident that we can achieve the $2 billion asset sale target in these years, as we have already held discussions for a large portion of the assets in this program. We anticipate competitive processes that will yield attractive valuations with minimal dilution to earnings and cash beyond what had been incorporated in our plan. Our sales program is designed to meet our strategic objectives to simplify and decarbonize our portfolio while funding our core growth investments in U.S. renewables and utilities. Finally, turning to Slide 21, we are largely hedged against future increases in interest rates. Looking at the parent company, our long-term debt is entirely fixed and we hedge our exposure to refinancing risk over a five-year window. Our nearest maturities in 2025 and 2026 were previously hedged at a rate of approximately 3%. Approximately 80% of our consolidated debt is at the subsidiary or project level and is non-recourse to the parent. We typically pre-hedge future project debt issuance for the full tenor when we sign a PPA, insulating our expected returns from future rate movements. The amortizing structure of our project debt rather than bullet maturities allow the project to support higher leverage. As we grow, our long-term debt balances will increase proportionally to the underlying cash flow of our businesses, enabling us to maintain steady leverage ratios and investment-grade credit metrics. At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $6 billion of interest rate hedges outstanding at an average rate of 2.9%. Looking at the impact of a 100 basis point shift in interest rates on our future issuances, refinancings and U.S. floating rate debt, we have under $0.01 of EPS exposure from interest rates in 2024 and $0.03 to $0.04 of exposure in 2025. Unhedged floating rate debt is primarily located outside the U.S. where inflation indexation in our PPAs provides a natural hedge against rising rates. In summary, as we approach year-end, we've made excellent progress on achieving our financial and strategic objectives for 2023. Our balance sheet is strong, and we are flexing to adapt to current financial market conditions. With line of sight to our future growth funding needs, we will create value from our excellent market position while continuing to prioritize maintaining investment-grade credit metrics and achieving our financial commitments. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres. Andres Gluski : Thank you, Steve. Before moving to Q&A, I would like to briefly address a few other concerns that we have heard from some of you regarding the future of the renewable sector in general. For starters, global warming is, unfortunately, very real and likely accelerating. We have seen it in all-time record temperatures over the past five years and especially this summer in the Northern Hemisphere. This new reality was reflected in record demand for energy during heat waves, unprecedented wildfires and more volatile rainfall, all of which affect the general public. Completely apolitical actors, such as insurance companies, are pulling out of certain markets in vulnerable areas after suffering material losses due to climate change. It is, therefore, extremely unlikely that major corporations will abruptly walk away from all of their carbon reduction goals regardless of any short-term unscientific political rhetoric. Given all that is happening in the renewable space, it is now more important than ever to differentiate among companies and developers. In my opinion, nobody is better placed than AES to create shareholder value from the ongoing energy transition because we have been focusing for years on the most resilient and lucrative opportunities. We are among the largest suppliers of renewable energy in the most attractive markets in the U.S., California, New York and PJM. We are also the biggest supplier of renewable energy to corporations in the world and particularly to data centers. Already, data centers represent half of our U.S. backlog and the growth of generative AI will only accelerate their demand for more renewable energy. An important differentiator is that AES is one of the very few major renewable developers that has not had to abandon projects in its backlog due to cost increases or supply chain disruptions. This has cemented our reputation for reliability among premium customers. And finally, AES is the most innovative company in the sector, developing and implementing new technologies such as : grid scale energy storage, hourly match renewable power purchase agreements, refabricated solar, construction robotics and software for energy efficiency in AI-enabled grid visualization. I believe these efforts will have material and growing benefit to our shareholders, especially by maintaining our lead in the most lucrative market segments. Regarding significant drivers for future growth post 2027, AES is best positioned to be the leader in green hydrogen production with the most advanced large project in the country, in Texas, in our participation in two of the largest hubs chosen by the Department of Energy. Our green hydrogen projects have real off-takers and sites, and we expect that they will meet the most exacting standards of additionality, regionality and hourly matching. Today, AES has the technology, the people, customer and supplier relationships, the scale and proven track record to continue to grow renewables profitably during the now unstoppable energy transition. While the total addressable market for our products and services is truly immense, I want to emphasize, once more, that our aim is to maximize shareholder value, not the number of megawatts or market share. Our priority will always be to ensure the best risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders on a per share basis. With that, I would like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question will be from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. David Arcaro : So strong update in terms of the contract originations within the renewables development portfolio. I was wondering if you could elaborate on what you're seeing in terms of that backdrop, the trends in customer demand. There have been concerns in the market around renewable slowdown given the higher PPA prices financing challenges, et cetera. Wondering if you could talk about what your conversations are like with your customers? Are there pockets of weakness? Or is there still an ample opportunity set out there for contract signings? Andres Gluski : What we're seeing is very strong demand from our target customers. So we have not seen a weakening. And as we said, it's -- I think it's very important to distinguish what markets you're operating in. So markets like California and New York, PJM, there is very strong demand. And there's very strong demand from corporations, especially from the tech companies in the data center business. So we have not seen a slowing down. Now, if you're talking about WEC and auctions for public utilities, et cetera, we're seeing a lot more competition for those projects. But for the -- our target customers in our target markets, we're seeing demand very firm. David Arcaro : Great. That's helpful. That's encouraging. And then maybe a question on the asset sale outlook here. You're accelerating -- targeting $2 billion over the next two years, I guess, what gives you the line of sight there? How is that market in terms of project sales? Are you seeing demand and the kind of off-takers there to acquire projects? And what are you seeing in terms of pricing? Are there favorable yields versus what you're developing those projects at? Andres Gluski : Okay. So I think that's sort of two parts of the question. So a lot of the asset sales are selling out or selling down a specific businesses as we have been doing for the past decade. Our businesses continue to perform very well. So we see that there is interest in these businesses, because it's not -- again, not all businesses are created equal and we have very favorable positions in these markets. We're also seeing great interest for people to partner with us. And that also includes our existing partners for greater participation. So those are things which decrease the equity needs over the next four, five years. So I think that's very important to see that we're balancing both. I think the question regarding the sell-down of renewable projects, I'll pass over to Steve, so he can give you an update on that. Steve Coughlin : Yes, that's going well. We -- as part of our sales, Andres walked through in his comments, there's a number of ways we achieve it. With the renewable sell-downs, we typically will sell down after the projects come online. And these are very low risk, long duration cash flows. Our average contract duration is 19 years. Obviously, no variable fuel cost, very little variable O&M in these types of assets. So they're very attractive -- and so yes, returns expectations have come up somewhat, but not in lockstep with where base rates have come because of the very low risk profile of these assets. So those sell-downs continue to yield a lift in AES' equity returns commensurate with what we've talked about in the past, David. Operator : The next question will be from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Durgesh Chopra : Just want to start off with a quick housekeeping question here. Just the $0.10 EPS upside that we talked about, Steve, from projects potentially being moved from '24 into late '23, is that factored into your raised EPS guidance now, or is that still an upside? Steve Coughlin : Yes. So a portion of it, Durgesh, so we did guide to 100 megawatts over at least this year, so the 3.4 to 3.5. So just a portion of that $0.10 is included. And the good thing is we have a very clear line of sight at this point to that increase as mechanical completion has been achieved on 93% of the new capacity. That means everything is all built out. We're just in final synchronization of equipment and systems. And so, we feel very confident in the year-end number. That which does not come online this year of that upside will be in the first half of next year. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. Okay. That's clear. And then maybe, Steve, there was a report from credit rating agency highlighting sort of weakening of your credit metrics here and then going into 2024. And then, Andres and you both talked about the importance of maintaining a strong balance sheet. Could you just sort of frame for us what your expectation is? With these asset sales because obviously, there's going to be a cash flow drop. What the expectation is for your FFO debt metrics next year versus your downgrade thresholds? Steve Coughlin : Yes. So one thing I would point out is that the credit metrics do fluctuate some during the year as we have higher construction balances in the middle of the year. We also have a higher level on our corporate revolver as projects come online towards the end of the year, paying down construction balances, and then we have the corporate revolver used to manage timing and distributions from our subsidiaries. The other thing to keep in mind is that we are in a high-growth mode. So at any point in time, we do have construction debt that's not yet yielding and that's all non-recourse. And it's also used to finance the tax credit value as well. So there's very quick paydowns on that debt once these projects come online. But no, we feel -- we're in regular contact with all the rating agencies. We feel very good about exceeding -- not just meeting but exceeding the thresholds. The other thing to keep in mind is that our leverage is amortizing. So most of our project level debt is amortizing over the PPA period. So this is a very low risk structure. It's non-recourse and it's not subject to significant bullets and it allows us to maintain a leverage ratio that will grow just proportionately -- our debt will only grow proportionately to the cash flows of the business. Durgesh Chopra : Okay. So but just to be clear though, Steve, I mean, next year, you feel with the plan that you have in place that versus your downgrade thresholds, you'll exceed them, right, into 2024? Steve Coughlin : Yes, absolutely. This is a top priority metric in all of our planning. So maintaining investment credit is at the top. And so as we look at the asset sales -- keep in mind, we already had a significant amount, $2.7 billion to $3 billion considered in our Investor Day numbers. And we are prioritizing assets that both hit our strategy, but as well are minimally dilutive on earnings, cash and credit. So I'm very confident that we will not impact our credit metrics negatively with the plans that we have. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. Perfect. And I know just -- but I just want to ask just one last question, and then I'll pass it on to others. But just Andres you mentioned active discussions with a lot of parties on assets. $3.5 billion is already very significant in asset sales. Could that number be higher as you sort of get more interest as you have those discussions? Andres Gluski : At this point in time, I would say that we feel that we will sell at least $3.5 billion through end of 2027, but a lot of these, again, are partial sell-down, sell-down of renewables, our plan to exit from coal. So if you look in the past, we've done a multiple of this number. I'd also point out that I'm not aware of any time that we have set a target for asset sales and not achieved it or exceeded it. So we feel very confident in achieving those asset sale numbers. Operator : The next question will be from the line of Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global. Your line is now open. Angie Storozynski : Okay. So first, I wanted to -- you mentioned about -- you mentioned transferability of tax credits. I just wanted to make sure that were not in a sense window dressing and trying to solve for a certain credit metrics, but this is actually driven by economics. So when I look back to your Analyst Day, you financed your renewables in the U.S., 40% tax equity, 40% project level debt and then 20% equity. So I just wanted to make sure that, that structure is still in and we're not trying to basically boost credit metrics by levering these projects more? And again, just explain to me that why we're moving from the traditional credit -- tax equity structures, which allowed you to monetize accelerated depreciation, among others to the transferability? Steve Coughlin : Yes. Angie, it's Steve. Thanks for the question. No, it is important to recognize that AES has always been maximizing their tax credit value. And so that continues to be the case. The reality is the transfers offer a more -- a broader market -- a broader set of market participants. I think a more liquid market, so many more corporates coming in from different sectors. It's a faster, simpler transaction to execute, but we'll still do both because it's important that you not only monetize the tax credit value but also the benefit of the accelerated depreciation which is not something that's transferable and does require either AES or a partner in the asset to be able to utilize that accelerated depreciation benefit. So there'll be hybrids done here. But my primary point is that it is a broader market, simpler transactions, more liquidity. And I do think it's appropriate that it shows up in operating cash and free cash because this is truly an important component of value and a return to the investment that gets made in the assets. Angie Storozynski : Okay. So that's treatment so that the FFO uplift under those structures, you already considered that when you quantified your equity needs during the Analyst Day? Steve Coughlin : So I would say at this point, we have already done 500 megawatts in transfer credits. The market is moving faster. So, I think in the Analyst Day, I would say there's upside in terms of our cash flow metrics related to the use of more transferability. But it's not necessarily something that is changing returns or anything. It's just that it's creating more visibility, more market participation and shows up in the operating cash flow. Angie Storozynski : Okay. But again, it's -- you're still sticking with solar ITCs. Again, that financing structure that I mentioned at the beginning, doesn't change, right? So you're not increasing leverage of the project, okay. Steve Coughlin : No, we are not just to be clear. So we are not increasing leverage at the projects that we are only looking to monetize the tax credits as efficiently as possible. And I would expect that given our credibility and our track record, any discount applied to the credits will be quite small relative to perhaps other market participants. And then, Andy, just also to reiterate, as I have said in the past, we choose the credit option based on what is the best cash financial return from the credit. So whether in most cases, that's been ITC for us, it makes very little sense to be choosing production-based credits, for example, in New England solar, where the capacity factors tend to be quite small. So I would question anyone that's doing that in their motives, but we are very focused on what's the credit that is yield the best return. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And then secondly, you mentioned the attractiveness of renewables versus other sources of power based on the levelized cost of electricity, so i.e., new-builds for renewables versus new-builds for thermal assets. But -- and not everywhere, do you have to actually add incremental generation sources, right? And then the pushback that we are hearing is that the PPA prices have now slightly exceeded forward power prices, be it on peak for solar or around the clock for wind. So again, I understand the distinction with tech clients, but how about any other locations and any other off-takers for new renewables? Andres Gluski : Well, again, we're talking about the markets where we're located. And the way I look at it is a little bit different. I mean, in terms of the energy, the LCOE, again, as I said, in most markets that we're operating, it is the cheapest. The issue with renewables is really having that dispatchable 24/7. So you need to complement it with regular power or batteries, which will require even more renewals. But I think the state is a huge play. So you can't say in every single location. But certainly in states that have high solar radiation or high wind, that's just the fact. I mean, the real issue is more having the 24/7 capability. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And then the last question about the -- some flexibility on the retirement of the coal plants. I understand the reliability needs of local grids, et cetera. But this is not your renewables coming online later than expected. It's just more of the market backdrop in which the coal plants operate. Is that correct? Andres Gluski : Exactly. No, exactly. You're taking it right. And as we've always indicated, we need regulatory approval to retire the coal plants. So what we're seeing is in some of the markets not us, but the general build-out of renewables enough transmission has been somewhat slower than planned and that these plants are likely to be needed through 2027. But I would add that this is the small minority of our total plants, okay? So we've gone from 22 gigawatts to 7. We have line of sight to about 4 of that is already planned. And of the remaining roughly 3, it would be a minority of that in terms. So I'm not talking about any walking away from our decarbonization plan. It's just a question that there -- we're seeing there's a couple of plants where it's going to be difficult to take them off-line prior to the expiry of their PPAs. Operator : The next question will be from the line of Richard Sunderland with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Richard Sunderland : Andres, you spoke to active conversations on the asset sale front. I'm curious if you can outline at a high level how advanced those discussions are? And if this is an effort that could yield any announcements before year-end or I guess, earlier on in that sort of '24, '25 window? Andres Gluski : Yes. It's a good question. I would think that, again, it's over a two-year period, but I would expect some important announcements in the first half of next year. And again, we tend to announce things when they're very firm. So the negotiations, et cetera, are ongoing. It's several assets. But yes, I would expect to be able to say something in the first half of next year. Richard Sunderland : Understood. And then looking back at, I guess, it's Slide 7, where you lay out the potential asset sales. Has any of your thinking on those buckets in terms of what's actually in those buckets changed since the May Investor Day, I guess, in particular, I'm thinking about the noncore businesses and if there are any new thoughts there relative to six months ago? Andres Gluski : What I'd say is, yes, I really can't comment on that. I would say stay tuned, and we will make announcements in that regard. But it's mostly assets that we have designated as noncore over time. So it's more of an acceleration or perhaps a deepening of some of the sell-downs. Richard Sunderland : That's helpful. And I'll try this from one other side if you'll indulge me here, new and expanded partnerships. New partnerships, any flavor for what that means? Just again, trying to get a sense of the scope of the opportunity. Obviously, you've laid out the magnitude with this $2 billion figure in the over $3.5 billion in total. Andres Gluski : Well, what I'd say is see what we've done in the past. So for example, if you look at when we made a big move into renewable energy, we -- our first big acquisition was sPower and we brought in a new partner and that relationship has evolved over time. So we're in a number of fields, which are very attractive right now. So I think it's an interesting time to see what our partners want to do or if some additional partners want to come in. But we're really sitting in a privileged position, especially for a lot of the new growing fields. Operator : The next question will be from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: First question here, I'm going to take it and play in every direction. All right, deal. $3.5 billion here. You talk about coal exits of selective assets in '27. To me, I hear that, and I'm asking well, how much does that delay some of the loss of contribution in the plan out to '28, i.e., the earlier targets that you gave through '27 contemplated full divestment of these assets. Now I get that you're raising the asset divestment target. So in theory, there's going to be fewer assets at the end. So in theory, you should be sacrificing some of the net income to the plan. But obviously, by selling some of the coal assets in '27, you're delaying or deferring some of the chunkiest lowest multiple assets potentially and the loss of the contribution into '28. I just want to like kind of hear how you think about that '27 versus '28, are you effectively pushing out a little bit of an earnings impact from '27 into '28 if you think about it or from '25 into '28? Andres Gluski : What I'd say is you're basically right that say, operating through the end of a couple of plants, PPAs, we have that flexibility, it would be beneficial. In terms of our asset sales, I mean, we have -- our assets have different earnings profiles. So, how would I say, we feel confident that we have a plan in place that we will hit our numbers. Now when you talk about post 2027, getting into '28, there'll be a balance between bringing in partners for some of those growth projects post '28. And there are a lot of factors, I think, happening in the market. I would expect, quite frankly, in our numbers, we don't have much more efficiency improvements, and we're working on a lot of technologies, which should have that. So in the net, again, you're right about some of the big blocks, but I really think that -- I feel very confident about our numbers, what they're going to look like '28 forwards because we have a really a pull position in all these new technologies and new sectors that are opening up. So there's not going to be a cliff that were pushed off into '28. I want to make that clear. As we've made clear in the past, there's no cliff in '26. So we manage -- we have a lot of variables, a lot of levers. So we're making sure that we have a smooth transition. So our real problem is not one of demand. There's a tremendous amount of demand, tremendous opportunities, is that what we want to make sure is that we're maximizing value per share and taking advantage of it and being smart in the best combination of levers that we pull. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: No. Look, I get it. It makes sense. And just to clarify, the select assets, though, those are the ones that the PPAs are expiring or the -- otherwise been regulatory issues, right? Again, I think that's a nice catch all, right? If that's the way you're framing it, one or the other? Andres Gluski : Well, that's correct. I mean that we have some assets that may be still under contract and that -- it's going to be -- it's looking more difficult to get regulatory approval to retire those assets in '25. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. Yes, indeed, right. There's a couple of them that stand out, if you will, that would seem to fit that right? Andres Gluski : I guess. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: I know you don't want to be too specific [indiscernible]. I'm sorry, I'm trying to be less specific here. Quickly, if I can pivot here real quickly. Yes, go for it. Steve Coughlin : I was just going to say, there's a number of ways we're exiting both the retirements and sales. So looking at this, we have 7 gigawatts of coal. We've already announced and the exits of half of that. So you're talking about 3.5% roughly remaining. And we're not talking about that whole amount. Even a small portion of that are these assets that will be selectively considered. Andres Gluski : Yes. as I said, it's a small part of the 3 that's remaining. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes. Okay. Sorry, I just wanted to try to put that in a box a little bit more. And just to clarify this, the partial monetization, how do you think about Fluence here just to hit that a little bit more squarely? I know it's a sensitive subject, whatever you can offer here about how you think about that through the plan? You talk about beginning next year here on sell-downs bit large, not specific to the new technologies bucket. Whatever you can offer? Andres Gluski : We can't call for much that we haven't said already. I mean what we've said is that we are really as an accelerator of new technologies. We create a lot of applications together. They help us. That's why we're the leader, I think, in the premium markets. But over time, we will monetize the positions. It's not just Fluence. We have other investments as well. And those new technologies have progressed very well. So we have other companies besides Fluence. But I'm not -- we really can't provide any further color on that. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And you feel confident in the previous marks in the other technologies? I mean, I know it's been a little bit of time there, but that's important as well. Andres Gluski : Sure. I mean -- there are different ones of levels of maturity. But of course, you have Uplight, which is, I think, proceeding well and incorporating more product offerings and becoming part of Schneider Electric's energy efficiency offerings. But then we have other ones that are in earlier stages. And whether they will create a lot of value outside of what they create for us. So certainly, one of the more exciting ones is the building of solar farms with robotics, I think, has a lot of promise. If you look at a longer term sort of four years out there, I would expect a lot from that. There's a lot -- we're doing a lot with AI operationally for us. I mean today, we use AI on the operations of our wind farms of next-day predictions for energy demand and weather. We're also using -- Fluence is using on its bidding engines, but there's much, much more. We have collaborated with some of the technology companies on things like grid visualization, et cetera, which I think will become part and parcel of how ISOs manage their build-outs and dispatches and reaction to natural catastrophes. And we do have a -- we would receive part of the royalties from the sales of the technology companies because we co-created them with them. So these are all things that are not in our numbers, but I think we'll we will be able increasingly to have significant cost savings and greater efficiencies from applying them. And in some cases, we'll be able to monetize these over time at the right time when market conditions are right. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes, absolutely. Sorry. And just a quick clarification, more setting expectations ahead. You guys have done a lot on the new origination front. You flagged it at the outset, this 5 gigawatt number, I think. Just to set expectations, you've also done a number of acquisitions of backlog here, too. How does that mesh with your commentary about origination, a? And b, should we expect a steady cadence of announcements of further backlog acquisitions here as some of these have been the higher price points? Again, I just want to tackle that directly and give you an opportunity to kind of bifurcate and clearly set expectations. Andres Gluski : Look, we -- I think you have to -- when you think about what we're doing is we're making -- creating the most value of the different assets we have. So we did our first sale of -- in the pipeline, if you will, with the DTA, where we actually don't build the project, but we sell a development project because we felt that, that was the greatest creation of value. So sometimes from our pipeline, we may be doing this because that's the best use of that pipeline. As I said in the past, probably the most attractive thing for us to do is to acquire late-stage development projects when -- especially when we have a premium customer who needs that energy. And why? Well, because -- well, you have a development project, it's some cost if you have to invest to create that development project. And so you don't know what is the conversion rate of your pipeline. So if you have something that's in late stage your conversion rate is basically one if you have the client. So it's a very good risk-adjusted rate of return. So we're going to be doing all those things. In the case of one of our utilities, they're buying one of the projects that have been developed by somebody else. We're selling one from the pipeline. Others are going to be repowering. So, we'll use all of the means at our disposal to create shareholder value. So I don't think it's -- the way to think about this correctly, is just pipeline, greenfield through final delivery is the best way to create value. I think it's really -- the most important really is having the right projects in the right markets and the right clients and thinking about how can you best satisfy what the clients' needs are. So I just mentioned that we can talk about it off-line. But quite frankly, what we're seeing is that all things being equal, acquiring late-stage projects, and it is a buyer's market now. It is one of the most attractive businesses for us. Operator : The final question for today's call will be from the line of Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Michael Sullivan : I wanted to start with, can we just confirm if there's been any change to your levered returns targets in the current environment up or down? And then maybe also just you alluded to it a little bit, but just a sense of like how much LCOEs or PPA pricing on new projects have changed? Andres Gluski : Okay. I'll take the first part of that. I'll have the second -- I'll pass that to Steve. Look, we are getting from our portfolio sort of low-teen returns. And that's at the project level. If we would include sort of core financing or mezzanine financing, we'd be high-teen returns. I don't think anybody is getting consistently higher returns than us because of the type of projects, the type of markets that we're in and the scale. We have sufficient scale to compete with anybody. And we have I think, had the best record of supply chain management. So, what I think has changed, we use a CAPM model, which is updated for risk-free U.S. treasuries, and they have moved up, obviously. So that's when we calculate our net present value that really comes into effect. So we do look at what's the net present value from these projects. So what I would say is that we've been able to pass on higher interest rates, pass on higher cost. And cost, by the way, are coming down. Battery prices are down 50%, solar prices are receding. And we do new projects for corporate clients outside of the U.S. And solar panels are near all-time lows. So all that put together, yes, we are using higher discount rates to see if the projects worthwhile pursuing in our net present value. And we have maintained our margins. And so we're seeing right now no stress on the market from that side. Now the second question you wanted to talk about was the particular projects here in the States and the returns we're seeing. Steve Coughlin : Yes. So I would say, generally in the States with our corporate clients, in particular, where we're doing structured products, we are seeing the higher end of that return range. And also, it's important, while PPA prices have been increasing, over the past one to two years, they've actually leveled off and are starting to come back down. We've seen significant reductions in solar module pricing this year. We've seen significant reductions in the commodities going into batteries and battery pricing coming down. So we're starting to see levelized costs come back down, which is also supporting the activity and the demand going forward. So I think we're in kind of past the difficulties of the supply chain past the impacts of the inflation and back to a declining curve in the key technologies we're using. Andres Gluski : Yes. Michael, maybe something that hasn't been asked on this call is that, first, we had the first project that we know they got the energy community additional 10%, which was a Chevelon Butte wind project, the largest wind project in Arizona. But we're also -- in terms of our wind farms, we are achieving the domestic content requirements. We expect that Fluence will be having next year, starting to receive domestic -- sufficient domestic content from its batteries and from its and casings. And then we're also in discussions for solar. We were one of the first to start discussions for solar. So what we see is upside from domestic content additionality. And we also see the energy communities we have already been achieving that. So I'll remind you, at least 40% plus of our pipeline is in energy communities as is today. So that would all be upside. So we are seeing upsides from the IRA in terms of the returns of some of the projects, especially those that are already signed. Michael Sullivan : Okay. One quick last one. Just -- can you give any thoughts on just the initial intervenor testimony in the Indiana rate case and what the path looks like from here to whether it be settlement or final order? Steve Coughlin : Yes. So just to kind of put things in context, too. This is our first rate case in over five years. And as I mentioned in my comments, we have the lowest residential rates in Indiana of any utility. So we're starting from a very good place. We had our IRP last year where we also have a lot of support for the growth that's there. So of course, any process like this, there are multiple stakeholders involved and interveners, they need to be heard. But we feel very good about what we asked for, given our position with the lowest rates and the growth plan that's been supported through the IRP. And again, it's our first rate case in five years. So in terms of timing, at this point, I would say, middle of next year for this to be all resolved and new rates to come into effect thereafter. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's Q&A session, and I will turn the call back over to Susan for final remarks. Susan Harcourt : We thank everybody for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have. We look forward to seeing many of you at the EEI Financial Conference later this month. Thank you, and have a nice day. Operator : That concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation, and you may now disconnect your lines.",

[Operator Instructions]. I'd now like to hand over to Susan Harcourt, Vice President of Investor Relations. The floor is yours. Please go ahead. Susan Harcourt : Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today we will be making forward looking statements. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements, which are disclosed in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website along with the presentation. Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Coughlin, our Chief Financial Officer and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will turn the call over to Andres. Andres Gluski : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial review call. Today I will discuss our 2023 strategic and financial performance. Steve Coughlin, our CFO, will discuss our financial results and outlook in more detail shortly. Beginning on slide three, 2023 was our best year ever as we met or exceeded all of our strategic and financial objectives, including signing a record of 5.6 gigawatts of new PPAs, putting us well on track to achieve 14 to 17 gigawatts of new signings through 2025, completing 3.5 gigawatts of construction, exceeding the target we laid out and doubling our additions compared to 2022, delivering adjusted EBITDA of $2.8 billion in the top end of our guidance range and adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes of $3.4 billion, achieving adjusted EPS of $1.76 and parent-free cash flow of just over $1 billion, both beyond the top end of our guidance ranges, and realizing asset sales proceeds of $1.1 billion, significantly above our target of $400 million to $600 million. Turning to slide four, despite the backdrop of rising interest rates and supply chain challenges across the sector, we demonstrated that our business model is strong, resilient, and well-positioned. Demand across the sector has never been stronger, and in this context, I'm pleased to announce that we are raising our expected annual growth rate for adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. We now expect our adjusted EBITDA to grow at an annual rate of 5% to 7% and adjusted EPS to grow at 7% to 9%, both through 2027. We are also reaffirming all of our other existing guidance. I can definitely say that I have never felt better about the outlook for this business. Turning to power purchase agreement signings on slide five, we signed 5.6 gigawatts of new PPAs in 2023, more than any other year in our company's 43-year history, putting us well on track to sign 14 to 17 gigawatts of new renewable contracts from 2023 through 2025. Today, our backlog of projects with signed PPAs is 12.3 gigawatts, the vast majority of which will be commissioned over the next three years. It is worthwhile to note that all of the projects in our contracted backlog remain on track for timely completion, consistent with our historical performance. Moving to slide six, I'd like to highlight that the largest segment of our new business is with corporate customers. In fact, in 2023, nearly 60% of the 3.5 gigawatts of projects we brought online were to serve corporate customers and large technology companies in particular. Bloomberg New Energy Finance has consistently named AES as one of the top two providers of renewable energy to corporations worldwide, and our business continues to expand, particularly given our focus on serving the power needs from data centers which are powering the rapid growth of AI. We are well positioned to serve this customer segment for a number of reasons. First, we have been on the forefront of working directly with these technology companies to provide innovative solutions to achieve specific renewable energy profiles. Back in 2021, we were the first company to introduce hourly match renewable energy, and today we are working with all of the hyperscale data center companies to provide solutions that are tailored for their renewable energy and sustainability goals. Second, we have a strong track record of delivering our projects on time, on budget, while meeting the unique needs of our customers, which I will cover in more detail momentarily. Our record of reliability is something that is increasingly recognized and valued by our customers. And third, we have the scale and the pipeline to address growing demand from data centers, which is estimated to more than double by 2030. With over 50 gigawatts of projects in our development pipeline and advanced interconnection queue positions in the most relevant markets in the U.S., we are particularly well positioned to meet the energy demand of technology customers. Turning to slide seven, our success with corporate customers combined with our improved efficiency in development and construction have increased the returns that we have seen across our renewable portfolio. As a result, we are upping our U.S. return ranges by 200 basis points to 12% to 15% on a levered after-tax cash basis. We are seeing even higher returns internationally. With strong market demand in AES's leading position, we are able to be increasingly selective about the projects we build with a focus on those with the best overall financial benefits. Next, turning to construction on slide eight, our ability to complete projects on time and on budget has become a major differentiator for AES. Not only is this something that our customers highly value, but it is also a pillar of our business model and ensures that our realized financial returns are on average equal to or better than our projections. At the time of PPA signings, we lock in contractual arrangements for all major equipment, EPC, and long-term financing, which we hedge to ensure no interest rate exposure. At the same time, we systematically embed flexibility in our supply chain to safeguard against a variety of scenarios. We also have a multi-year strategic arrangement with top suppliers, including Fluence, who we see as having the most competitive product in the industry. More than half of our solar projects in recent years have co-located storage components, and our relationship with Fluence helped us to have the best on-time project completion rate in the industry. In 2024, we feel very confident in our ability to add 3.6 gigawatts of new projects, including 2.2 gigawatts in the U.S. We currently have 100% of the major equipment for these projects contractually secured and nearly 80% already on site. Now turning to our utilities, beginning on slide nine. In 2023, we achieved important milestones at our U.S. utilities that will drive future growth, continue decarbonization, and improvement in customer service. At AES Ohio, we put in place a new regulatory framework, and at AES Indiana, we reached a unanimous settlement for our first-rate case since 2018. As a result, investments are on track for the rate-based growth in the high teens at both utilities, and we now have close to 70% of our planned investments through 2027 already approved in regulatory orders. Turning to slide 10. At AES Ohio, we are embarking on the largest investment program that this utility has ever seen, which includes the expansion and enhancement in our transmission assets. With over 25% rate-based growth per year, this is one of the fastest transmission growth rates in the country. We also recently filed for regulatory approval of the second phase of our smart grid plan, which upgrades our grid to improve service quality and customer experience. Turning to slide 11. At AES Indiana, we continue to invest to improve service quality and greener generation mix. I am happy to say that we now have regulatory approval for the build-out of all named renewable projects at AES Indiana, encompassing 106 megawatts of wind, 445 megawatts of solar, and 245 megawatts of energy storage. As we continue to invest in our customer experience, service quality, and sustainability at both of our U.S. utilities, two core principles have guided our growth plan. First is customer affordability as we address much-needed investments. We currently have the lowest residential rate in both states, which we expect to maintain throughout this period of growth. And second is to prioritize the timely recovery of our investments through existing mechanisms and programs. Across both utilities, we now anticipate approximately 75% of the growth capital to be deployed under such mechanisms, which substantially reduces regulatory lag. Finally, turning to slide 12. Last year, we set an asset sale proceeds target of 400 million to 600 million. We greatly exceeded this range with 1.1 billion of gross proceeds. These transactions not only put a high valuation marker on our businesses, but also put us well on our way towards achieving our asset sales goal of $2 billion through 2025 and $3.5 billion through 2027. Our success this past year provides us with a cushion, and we expect 2024 to be another strong year. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our CFO, Steve Coughlin. Steve Coughlin : Thank you, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our 2023 results and capital allocation, our 2024 guidance, and our updated expectations through 2027. As Andres mentioned, 2023 was AES's best year on record as we met or exceeded all of our strategic and financial targets. We beat our adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.65 to $1.75 and our parent-free cash flow guidance range of $950 million to $1 billion. We also recorded strong adjusted EBITDA well above the midpoint of our inaugural guidance range of $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion. Turning to slide 14, full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes was $3.4 billion versus $3.2 billion in 2022, driven primarily by contributions from new renewables projects, as well as the recovery of prior year's purchase power costs at AES Ohio included as part of the ESP4 settlement. These drivers were partially offset by lower contributions from the energy infrastructure SBU. Turning to slide 15, adjusted EPS was $1.76 in 2023 versus $1.67 in 2022. Drivers were similar to those for adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes. In addition, there was a $0.06 headwind from parent interest on higher debt balances primarily used to fund new renewables projects. I'll cover our results in more detail over the next four slides, beginning with the Renewable Strategic Business Unit or SBU on slide 16. Higher adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes at our renewables SBU was primarily driven by contributions from the 3.5 gigawatts of new projects that came online in 2023, as well as higher margins in Columbia, but partially offset by the sell down of select U.S. renewable operating assets. At our utilities SBU, higher adjusted PTC was primarily driven by the recovery of prior year's purchase power costs at AES Ohio included as part of the ESP4 settlement, as well as rate-based growth in the U.S. Lower adjusted EBITDA at our energy infrastructure SBU reflects significant LNG transaction margins in 2022, lower margins in Chile, and the sale of a minority interest in our Southland combined cycle assets. These drivers were partially offset by the higher revenues recognized from the accelerated monetization of the PPA at our Warrior Run coal plant. Finally, at our new energy technologies SBU, higher adjusted EBITDA reflects improved results at Fluence, which achieves positive adjusted EBITDA in their fiscal fourth quarter of 2023. Fluence also guided to positive adjusted EBITDA for their full fiscal year 2024. Now let's turn to how we allocated our capital last year on slide 20. Beginning on the left-hand side, Sources reflect $3 billion of total discretionary cash. This includes parent-free cash flow of just over $1 billion, which increased nearly 11% from the prior year to just above the top end of our guidance. We also significantly surpassed our asset sale target with $750 million in net asset sales proceeds to the AES parent after subsidiary level debt repayment, reinvestment, and taxes. And we issued $900 million of parent debt in May of last year. Moving to Uses on the right-hand side, we invested more than $2.1 billion in growth at our subsidiary, of which approximately two-thirds was in the U.S. We also allocated more than $500 million of discretionary cash to our dividends. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with our financial performance throughout 2023. Now let's turn to our guidance and expectations, beginning on slide 21. Today, we're initiating 2024 adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes guidance of $3.6 billion to $4 billion, driven by over $500 million in contributions from new renewables projects and from rate-based growth at our U.S. utilities. We have also incorporated a $200 million partially offsetting impact from asset sales we either closed in 2023 or plan to close this year. Excluding the $1 billion in tax attributes we expect to recognize in 2024, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion. The increase in tax attributes versus the prior year is partially due to our continued use of tax credit transfers, which results in earlier recognition of tax credit than typical tax equity structures. In addition, last year's increase in new project completions will drive higher tax attribute recognition in 2024. As a reminder, we will recognize approximately one-third of tax attributes generated on 2023 projects in the 2024 fiscal year. Looking beyond this year, our head start on asset sales gives us greater visibility toward our longer-term growth and puts downward pressure on our capital budget. We expect EBITDA to increase each year through the remainder of our long-term guidance period. Turning to slide 22, we expect 2024 adjusted EPS of $1.87 to $1.97, which represents a 9% increase year-over-year and puts us on track to achieve our 7% to 9% long-term growth target through 2025. Growth will be primarily driven by our renewables and utilities businesses and will be partially offset by higher parent interest. We also expect an 8% headwind from asset sales. Our construction program this year is more evenly spread than in recent years. As a result, we expect approximately 40% of our earnings to be recognized in the first half of the year and 60% in the second half. And we will have greater visibility throughout the year into our expected construction completion. Turning to slide 23, as Andres mentioned, our very strong market position in providing tailored solutions to corporate clients, including large data centers, has allowed us to realize higher returns on our renewable\u2019s projects. In addition, as our renewables business continues to scale, we anticipate further realization of productivity and scale benefits. Based on these factors and our 2023 results, we now expect AES's U.S. renewables returns to be in the 12% to 15% range. These higher returns in the U.S., along with productivity benefits, are directly accreted to our earnings and cash flow, and as a result, we are increasing our expected long-term adjusted EBITDA growth rate to 5% to 7% and our long-term adjusted EPS growth rate to 7% to 9% through 2027 off of base of our 2023 guidance midpoint. Now, turning to our 2024 parent capital allocation plan on slide 24, beginning with approximately $3.1 billion of Sources on the left-hand side. Parent free cash flow for 2024 is expected to be around $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion. We expect to generate $900 million to $1.1 billion of net asset sale proceeds this year. By the end of this year, we expect to be more than halfway toward the $3.5 billion gross asset sales target we announced on our third quarter earnings call. Although we expect an increase of approximately $1 billion of parent debt this year, our business is well insulated from changes in interest rates. Our new projects are funded primarily with fixed rate or long-term hedged self-amortizing debt with tenors similar to the length of our PPAs, and more than 80% of our outstanding debt is non-recourse to AES Corp. Our exposure from floating rates and future issuances is managed with nearly $8 billion in outstanding hedging. Looking at the impact of a 100 basis point shift in rates on our future issuances, refinancing\u2019s and outstanding U.S. floating rate debt, we have only one penny of EPS exposure from interest rates in 2024. Now to the Uses on the right-hand side. We plan to invest approximately $2.6 billion in new growth, of which about 85% will be allocated to growing our renewables portfolio and utility rate base. More than 90% of this will be directed into the U.S., with the remainder going to growth projects in Chile and Panama. We expect to allocate approximately $500 million to our shareholder dividend, which reflects the previously announced 4% increase. Turning to slide 25, our long-term sources of parent capital through 2027 reflect the accelerated asset sales target we introduced on our third quarter call. We also expect higher organic cash generation as a result of our increased long-term growth rates. As a reminder, we will not issue any new equity until 2026 at the earliest, and we'll only do so in a way that creates value on a per share basis. Now to slide 26. Uses through 2027 reflect more than $7 billion of investment in our subsidiaries, primarily to grow our renewables and utilities businesses. We also expect to allocate more than $2 billion to our dividend. Given our surplus of attractive investment opportunities and our desire to minimize equity issuance as a source of capital, we now expect to grow our dividend at 2% to 3% annually beyond 2024. We believe this provides an optimal balance between an already attractive dividend yield and strong earnings and cash flow growth throughout our planned period. In summary, 2023 was an extraordinary year for AES. We demonstrated our ability to adapt to the current market and execute on our growth commitments while we further advanced our competitive position. As we continue to perfect and scale our renewables machine, we expect to have another record year in 2024 and to deliver on our now higher long-term growth target. We have positioned AES to achieve our strategic priorities and grow our business in a way that's highly value accretive to our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres. Andres Gluski : Thank you, Steve. In summary, 2023 was our best year ever as we met or exceeded all of our strategic and financial objectives across our guidance metrics, PPA signings, construction completions, and asset sales. We are seeing strong demand for renewables across the sector, particularly due to the unprecedented demand from data centers. As a result, we are not only upping our U.S. project return ranges, but increasing our expected average annual growth rates for adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share through 2027. Finally, our significant success with asset sales to date, as well as the outlook for the near future, gives us great comfort in our long-term funding plans. With that, I would like to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nick Campanella with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Nicholas Campanella : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions today and appreciate all the update. I guess you originally had a 3% to 5% EBITDA target when you put out that analyst day range. Then I guess the EBITDA guidance that you gave today for fiscal 2024 does seem to just be a bit flat versus that growth outlook. Is that just from the timing of asset sales? Could you just help clarify what's driving that? Steve Coughlin : Yes. Hey, Nick. It's Steve. That's right. It's primarily because we're ahead on the asset sale target significantly from 2023. We had the $1.1 billion versus the $400 to $600 guidance. That's why the asset sale drag, as there's a lag to when we redeploy the capital and it's yielding again, is about $200 this year. A little higher than what we would have anticipated a year ago. Overall, good news for the [Technical Difficulty] but it is offsetting the growth that's coming from the rate base and utilities in the renewables projects. That's right. Nicholas Campanella : That's helpful. Then just on asset sales, to the extent that you're continuing to be successful here and doing more versus what you have in this plan, is there room to offset that $1 billion apparent debt issuance? Does that change at all? Where exactly is there flexibility in this plan today from your perspective? Then could you just also update us on where your leverage targets are and your minimums in this new plan? Thanks. Steve Coughlin : Yes. Definitely. The investment grade is a top priority. We designed the plan to meet the investment grade targets that we have. We built cushion into the metrics themselves, but also keep in mind that the quality and the duration of the cash flows in the business is transitioning dramatically. We're going to a much longer duration, average duration of contracts, more than -- is 20-year contracts. This is Clean Energy, no carbon risk. These are U.S. dollar contracts with large corporates, many of which are data center customers, big tech companies, very high-quality credit. It's both the solid credit metrics as well as the quality and profile of the cash flows that's evolving. We don't count on that when sizing the new debt. We count on the metrics, but the quality is improving as well. In terms of levers, the asset sale target is, as it's always been, has multiple ways that it can be achieved. There's some conservatism built in over the total. We have fully anticipated any temporal dilutive impacts in the numbers that we've given, as I said, but there is some flex there as needed. On the debt side, the investment grade is a top priority. Nicholas Campanella : Alright. I'll leave it there. I really appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : We now turn to David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead. David Arcaro : Great. Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the questions. I wanted to dig in a little bit on the higher return levels that you're projecting here. Was there something that sparked it? Any kind of catalyst that has pushed you up in terms of the higher return levels in the renewables business? You've been in a higher interest rate environment, obviously, for a while, higher PPA price environment for a while. Is it more the mix of end customers that you're selling to now? Andres Gluski : David, I'd say it's a combination of things. First and foremost is the returns that we are [Technical Difficulty] on prior PPAs that we signed. So that's the first. We are seeing that we're getting higher returns. Second, what is driving these higher returns? You may recall for some time, maybe like three years ago, starting three, four years ago, I started saying that in select markets, there would be really a shortage of good renewable projects. These are markets like California, like PJM, New York. What we started to do was position ourselves and actually enter the queue, buy land rights, etcetera, to have projects to be able to fulfill this. I think that part of it is in these select markets, you are starting to see the shortage of renewables that we had been seeing. I think this is something that will spread market to market. It's not going to be true for all markets. Out West, there's a lot of land. There's not that much demand, but in select markets, you will be seeing that. I think that's also part of the result is that we are positioned in the right markets. The third thing I would say is that we're becoming more efficient in our construction and in our development process. Stay tuned. I think that will continue to improve. Realize that 2021, you had a lot of supply chain disruptions. Those are well past us and we're really getting to optimize that. Based on our greater efficiency, what we're seeing is that we are getting higher returns. We've also positioned ourselves, this is about our fourth year, fifth year of really positioning ourselves with large corporate customers. Those corporate customers have very strong demand growing very quickly. If you ask me from a sector point of view, I think the real question is, can we meet the demand that they have for Clean Energy in all of these markets? By the way, I would add Chile is a similar market to California where there's a real shortage of projects. There's a very strong demand from our customers and that we're very well placed. This is not like a catalyst. We had several pieces which are played out as we expected them to play out. Steve Coughlin : The only thing I would add, David, is that looking at 2023, what we signed up was well within that new updated range. David Arcaro : Okay, thanks. That's good to hear. Then in terms of the higher growth rates that you've outlined today, wondering if we could just unpack that a little bit. Is that all coming from the renewables segment in terms of the higher returns that you're seeing or is the utilities business or energy infrastructure also experiencing higher EBITDA growth outlooks here? Andres Gluski : What you have is both. I think there are two key segments. One is the utilities. We have some of the fastest growing utilities in the U.S. Second, yes, we are also seeing better returns in the renewable sector. The combination of those two is resulting in a faster growth rate. David Arcaro : Okay, great. Thanks so much. Andres Gluski : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Cameron Lochridge : Hi there. Hey, thanks for taking my question. This is actually Cameron Lochridge on for Julian. I wanted to start just on the raised growth expectations. And kind of piggybacking on the last question, if I look at what you had planned for your EBITDA contributions across the different businesses, 45% renewables, 32% utilities, 23% energy infrastructure in 2027, how has that mix shifted as a reflection of this -- these raised expectations for growth? Steve Coughlin : Yes. So, I would say, I think the mix roughly be maybe a little bit more on the renewable side, we're seeing the higher returns. So maybe that's above the 45 50-ish. So, it's going to be higher on the renewables. I think the utilities, as Andres said, will be a little bit more of a share. On the energy infrastructure, we did communicate that, that was going to shrink as we execute on the coal exit plan. Although for just a handful of assets, we extended that to 2027. So that dilution from those coal exits, this is the smaller portion, will be spread out over more time, which overall, I think, is a good thing in terms of the -- in the financials as well. So a little more renewables, a little more utilities and then the energy infrastructure is shrinking a little bit less, but it's still in that same range. Cameron Lochridge : Got it. And then just digging in on the renewables, just the cumulative capacity additions you guys have communicated, tripling the bag to 25 to 30 gigawatts of cumulative additions, is that still the case through 2027? Or is that bumped higher? Or is this purely just a function of returns improving? And then on that returns improving piece, how do we think about the bifurcation between, perhaps more ability to capitalize on IRA credits versus just true economic improvement vis-\u00e0-vis PPAs, pricing increasing. Just kind of help us unpack that a little bit. Andres Gluski : Let me sort of give a big picture, and then I'll pass it off to Steve. Look, what we're going after, really, as I said in my script, is really going after those projects, which provide the best financial benefits. You've known me for a while, I've never gone for growth for growth's sake. So really, what we want to do is maximize shareholder value on a per share basis. So really, this is an upgrading of the quality of the growth, more than a greater numeric growth. Now I do think that it's very important to understand sort of what market segments we're in. We're in the corporate segment, but we're also very heavily into the data center segment. And this is something, again, we've been working on for many years. We have really very good relationships with key clients, and that is a demand that's growing very quickly. And certainly, that we don't mention in our speech, quite frankly, because it's very early times. But we're really going to go after artificial intelligence as an efficiency improvement in the company. And we have a big kickoff meeting that we're going to have in the next couple of months. But this is something I think we've taken in a very sort of strategic line. Inderpal Bhandari, who was the global Chief Data Officer for IBM until 2023 has just joined our Board, and somebody who is very knowledgeable in the area. We also have Janet Davidson, who's also a PhD in computer science. It's interesting. I mean, right now, with Inderpal, we have 5 PhDs on our Board, which has got to be one of the highest percentages in things that run from computer science to finance to economics of business. So that's what I wanted to put it in. What we're pursuing is returns, we're pursuing value per share. And I think we've been very systematic now for many years in positioning ourselves in a given sector and learning about and preparing ourselves for the new technologies which are coming. So, there's a lot of buzzwords of AI. Well, what's behind this is 5, 6 years of getting ourselves in a position to really utilize the data and have the understanding of the company. So, with that, I'll pass it off to Steve to answer the other parts of your question. Steve Coughlin : Yes. No, I agree wholeheartedly that we're focused on cash returns, and that's primarily where the higher growth is coming from. You'll notice that it was really the EBITDA growth rate that ticked up the most. And so not really from tax credits. So, we had already talked about that about 40% of our pipeline was in energy communities that continues to be roughly the case. So, it's really from the cash generation of the assets that the increase in rates is coming up. And we're less focused on megawatts. So, it's roughly a similar amount of capital, maybe even a little bit lower. But if that means less megawatts, that's okay. We're focused on what are the best returns that we can get for our capital that's deployed. And that's cash based and not based on the credit. Cameron Lochridge : Got it. Awesome, guys. Thank you very much. Steve Coughlin : Alright. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Durgesh Chopra : Hey good morning, team. Thanks for giving me time. I just wanted to ask about the -- I want to ask you about the new projects, the 3.6 gigawatts to be added in 2024. I mean, obviously, you've done pretty well versus your own stated 5-gigawatt target, the renewable signing. You're doing 5.6, materially higher than 5 gigawatts. But why only like the level of gigawatts actually entering commercial operation is kind of flat to 2023? So just wondering if that's just related to project timing? Because I would have expected to materially tick up, just the new projects going here. Andres Gluski : Yes. Hi, Durgesh. That's a good question. Look, 2023 was a dramatic year where we increased construction, 100%. And we've been saying, look, we're not going to grow it at 100% per year. Now we've been signing over 5 gigawatts a year of new PPAs. So eventually, these two have to somewhat converge. I mean, at some point, we have to be cutting the ribbon on around 5 gigawatts. But that's not going to happen likely next year, just because of the timing of some of the projects. We also have a developing transfer project as well, and that's not part of our backlog, but it's part of the signing. So that also is part of the reason for that. So -- this is not a signal of anything. It just has to be the particular timing of the projects that we have. And again, we feel this year, very good about commissioning them all on time and on budget. We have 100% of the major equipment already secured and 80% of it is on site, which is we've never been that good this early in the process. And I think another thing important that Steve said, this is going to be reflected in our earnings profile, whereas we were very back-end loaded last year because of this very rapid growth. As growth enters a more steady state, we're going to have 40% of our earnings in the first half and only 60% in the second half. So, this is something we also worked very hard to achieve. So qualitatively, we feel [Technical Difficulty] here is 2024, 2025, you're going to have a catch up to the amount of PPAs that we're signing. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. Thank you for that Andres. And then maybe, Steve, can I just go back to Nick's question earlier on credit metrics. Can you remind us where you\u2019re ending FFO to debt in 2023 and then where are you projecting 2024 to be versus your credit downgrade thresholds? Thank you. Steve Coughlin : Yes, I had no problem to guess. So we had a solid year end on the credit metrics. So our thresholds are at 20% FFO to debt and we were roughly at 22% approximately. We do keep atleast a very strong cushion that\u2019s very healthy. And going forward that ratio is actually improving over time in our plan. So for the end of 2024 I would expect it to be at least at 22 if not a little bit higher that. So the leverage of the company overall, we do get a lot of questions about it, but it is important to keep in mind we have a recourse, not recourse structure. And particularly in the non-recourse debt this is amortizing debt. I think not everyone is doing it that way and so our project debt is really amortizing and it serves by the cash flows from the projects. The parent debt level is actually going to be, it will come up a little bit over the planned period, but not a lot. So, it's $4.5 billion now. And as I said in my comments on the slides, maybe another 1 to 1.5 over the 4-year period, but it's going to be pretty stable. Durgesh Chopra : I appreciate that. Thank you very much. Steve Coughlin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport Research Partners. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Angie Storozynski : Thank you. So I was just wondering, are you guys seeing any degradation in either EBITDA or cash flow generation of existing assets? I mean, we're seeing examples of -- especially on the wind side -- that wind assets are having some issues with both OpEx and CapEx, hence re-powerings. But just wondering if there's obviously this positive momentum on the new build side, but is there any offset from existing assets? Andres Gluski : Hi, Angie. No, none whatsoever. In fact, as I said, we continue to operate better. And we are seeing that our older projects are giving the returns that we are actually giving better returns than we had forecast. So, we're not seeing that. I mean, we don't have perhaps that many older wins. We do have awful low gap, but we have not seen any degradation in performance. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And then the second question. So I remember in the past, you were mentioning that the slightly delayed coal plant retirements could be a lever for actually both earnings and cash flow. So is there an update there? Steve Coughlin : Yes. So Angie, as I was mentioning, the -- so there's just a handful of assets that we've extended through 2027, primarily due to the short remaining duration of the contracts, and it's making both operational sense as well as financial sense for us to remain the owner through the end of life. So there is some upside to that -- 2 upsides really. It smooths out the $750 million of EBITDA reduction from the coal exit plans throughout the 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028 period, so there's no real cliff. And then it does add to the EBITDA over the time frame. But it's one of the -- it's the smaller driver. The biggest driver of the EBITDA uplift is the higher returns we're realizing on the renewable projects, given the market dynamics that Andres discussed as well as the productivity and scale benefits we've realized in the portfolio and expect to continue to realize as we scale up. Andres Gluski : Yes. And I'd like to add that we still plan to be out of coal by the end of 2027, and that we -- after 2025, we'll have somewhere about 1 gigawatt plant. And part of this is driven by the fact that these plants are still needed to for stability of the system, so we are not allowed to shut them down in part. I just wanted to clarify. So the strategic objective remains the same, it's just slightly delayed in time. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And then lastly, and again, it's a bigger picture question, right? We -- it's very topical for today, given a lot of discussion about nuclear power. So we're all getting excited about the colocation of data centers and nuclear plants, and there is argument about spatial limitations for renewable power, given how much land it actually needs to offer similar amounts of computing capacity and especially in Virginia, where those land shortages, I think are most pronounced. So do you actually see that there is disadvantage to your pursuit of tech clients, if that's nuclear angle were to take off? Andres Gluski : Well, I think, look, a rising tide lifts all boats. So I don't think this is a situation where there's just going to be like one technology that solves all the needs. So I don't see that any future where there's not, quite frankly, a shortage of renewable projects in the key markets. I know it takes a long time to permit nuclear plants. To my knowledge, excuse me, no new nuclear plants have been built, maybe even in the last decade, anywhere near budget. So on the one hand, I do think nuclear is part of the long-run solution, because I do agree. There's only so much land, so much interconnection. On the other hand, I think that the nuclear renaissance has yet to prove itself and it has yet to build out. So the demand from these clients is so strong. I mean, they are taking second best. Sometimes they can't get -- they want to require additionality because they really want to be part of the solution to climate change. Well, there are circumstances where they will take no additional audit and basically have recontract nuclear power today, at least 0 carbon. But the truth is that squeezing the balloon. That's taking 0 carbon energy off the grid. So I don't think -- I'll put it this way, I feel it's extraordinarily unlikely that the growth in renewables will stop and be replaced with nuclear power. And it's certainly in the next 5 years, I don't see it, and I see it very difficult in the next 10 years. Angie Storozynski : Okay, thank you. Andres Gluski : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We now turn to Ryan Levine with Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Ryan Levine : Good morning. Given the scarcity of data center projects, how are returns for these projects compared to the projects for other customers? Andres Gluski : The scarcity -- look, we don't talk about individual projects, but we do talk about our averages. And so the return on the project will depend, obviously, if you have the suitable location, if it's providing something other than a plain vanilla. So all put together, what I can say is, again, on average, we're seeing an increase in our returns, looking backwards and looking forward, and corporate customers are our most important segment. But yes, we will not comment on sort of specific client areas. Ryan Levine : Okay. And then how did you arrive at the 2% to 3% long-term dividend growth is the right growth rate from a financial policy standpoint? And what are factors that could cause that policy to continue to evolve? Steve Coughlin : Ryan. So look, I mean AES has established itself as a dividend payer a long time ago. We've been consistently growing the dividend at that 4 to 6 range for quite a long time. Obviously, the company's success in the renewable space and now our utilities position for significant growth, has put us in front of a huge amount of growth opportunity, and we want to manage our capital sources appropriately. And so we are committed to our dividend. We want to continue to grow, but we felt on balance given the capital opportunities in front of us and the higher returns that growing the dividend at a little bit of a lower rate made sense at this point, particularly as we've seen higher returns coming from our growth investments. Ryan Levine : Okay. And why start that in 2025 as opposed to another year from a timing standpoint? Steve Coughlin : Well, we look at this -- so I'm not sure that you were pointing out, so we did grow at 4% this year. This is a policy that we take very seriously and thoughtfully. And so we weren't prepared -- we made that decision for this year, towards the end of last year. We weren't prepared to make this decision until we had thoroughly analyzed it and recently made that decision as we locked down our final plan here. And we think, therefore, it makes sense once we've made the decision to go ahead and implement it as soon as we're able, which will be 2025. Ryan Levine : Thank you. Steve Coughlin : Thank you. Operator : Our final question today comes from Gregg Orrill with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Gregg Orrill : Yes, thank you, congratulations. Just a detail-oriented question. The 2024 tax credit guidance of $1 billion. Is there anything in there that is timing related or you might describe as more onetime in nature? Or is that -- would you grow that from that level as you add renewables projects? Steve Coughlin : Yes. So it will grow. And it's not timing so much as it's just the success of the business. As Andres said, we doubled our construction last year. And keep in mind that not all of the credits are recognized in year one in tax equity structures. It's roughly 1/3 get recognized in the second year. So that's boosting the credit this year as well as all of the projects that will come online this year, the new projects on top of that. The other thing that's driving it is the transfer of credit does get recognized earlier, essentially almost all in the first year. And so there's a greater mix of credits transferred in this vintage this year as we -- that grows as a component of how we monetize the credits. So that's driving it higher. But I don't expect this to have dipped, I think it will continue to rise as we head into the years ahead, as the growth program continues. And then keep in mind that we are benefiting from the energy community adder and a significant portion, which increases the credit. And our wind projects are all qualifying for domestic content also going forward. So that all else being equal, is driving the credit value up. And what's important for everyone to understand is the credit is cash and earnings. And the great thing about these -- particularly the investment credits, which is the lion's share of our mix of tax attributes is upfront. So you're getting a return on your capital investment of a significant portion, at least 30%, in some cases, up to 50% right away, which is a fantastic cash profile as well as an earnings profile. Gregg Orrill : Okay, thanks. Operator : This concludes our Q&A. I'll now hand back to Susan Harcourt, Vice President of Investor Relations, for final remarks. Susan Harcourt : We thank everybody for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Thank you, and have a nice day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, today's call has now concluded. We'd like to thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

All lines will be muted during the presentation portion of the call with an opportunity for questions and answers at the end. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Susan Harcourt, Vice President of Investor Relations at AES Corporation. Susan, you may begin. Susan Harcourt : Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2024 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements, which are disclosed in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website along with the presentation. Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Coughlin, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will turn the call over to Andres. Andres Gluski : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2024 financial review call. We are pleased with our performance this year. And today, I will discuss our third quarter results, a robust growth we are seeing at our renewables and U.S. utility businesses and our progress towards our asset sales target. Beginning on Slide 3 with our third quarter results, which were generally in line with our expectations. Adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes was about 1.2 billion, adjusted EBITDA was 692 million and adjusted EPS was $0.71. We're on track to meet our 2024 financial objectives, including our expectation to be in the top half of our ranges for adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes and adjusted EPS. At the same time, we now expect adjusted EBITDA to be towards the low end of the guidance range for the year, primarily due to the one-time impact of extreme weather in Colombia and the lower margins in the Energy Infrastructure SBU. We are reaffirming our expected growth rate through 2027. Steve Coughlin, our CFO, will provide more detail on our financial performance and outlook. I'm also very pleased to report that since our last call in August, we have signed or been awarded 2.2 gigawatts of new contracts. This includes both long-term renewable PPAs and new data center load growth at our U.S. utilities. Moving to our Renewables business on Slide 4. Since our Q2 financial review call, we have added 1.3 gigawatts of new PPAs to our backlog, bringing our year-to-date total to 3.5 gigawatts, more than 70% of which is with corporate customers. As a reminder, last year, we set a target of signing 14 to 17 gigawatts of new PPAs from 2023 to 2025. And with 9.1 gigawatts signed or awarded since the beginning of last year, we're currently well on track to meet this objective. Since setting that goal, we also materially increased our project return targets and we are focused on prioritizing the most profitable PPAs. Moving to Slide 5 and our construction progress. Since our second quarter call in August, we have completed construction of an additional 1.2 gigawatts of new projects, bringing our year-to-date total to 2.8 gigawatts, which represents nearly 80% of the 3.6 gigawatts we expect to complete this year. On-time execution is one of our competitive advantages, and we believe we have the best supply chain management in the industry. In the U.S., we have 100% of our solar panels on site for those projects coming online this year and 84% in country for next year. For 2026, we have 100% of our solar panels either in country or contracted to be domestically manufactured, providing protection against potential changes in tariff policy. We have also been a first mover in securing domestically manufactured battery modules and cells. We expect our first battery energy storage project with domestic content to come online in the first half of 2026. Additionally, we have established a robust supply chain for wind through our strategic suppliers with domestic manufacturing. Regarding long lead time equipment, such as transformers, and high-voltage breakers, we have secured all of the supply for our backlog through 2027. Turning to Slide 6. We are very well positioned as a leading provider of renewable energy to data center companies, particularly in the U.S. and to large mining companies outside the U.S. These customers want to work with AES due to our track record of providing customized solutions that best serve their specific needs and delivering our projects on time and on budget. With the U.S. elections only a few days away, I have great confidence in the resilience of our business plan, regardless of the outcomes of the presidential and congressional elections. While we do not believe the elimination of the investment tax credit or production tax credit is likely, even in an extreme scenario, we're uniquely well positioned due to the following. First, regardless of federal policies, our corporate customers had a massive need for new power that can only be met by renewables over the next decade. McKinsey estimates that in the U.S. data centers alone could require an additional 450 terawatt hours through the end of the decade, which is equivalent to more than the annual electricity consumption of France. With these market dynamics, we will continue to sign high-return renewables PPAs with our core customers. Second, should there be any changes to U.S. tariff policy, we have a resilient supply chain, with a large majority of our project components manufactured domestically by 2026. Finally, our strategy of procuring our equipment at the time of the PPA signing provides clear Safe Harboring protection from potential changes in policy. Now turning to Slide 7. Over the last 12 months, we have embarked on the most ambitious investment program in the history of our U.S. utilities, which will improve reliability and quality of service for our customers, while maintaining some of the lowest rates in both states. AES Indiana and AES Ohio are now 2 of the fastest-growing U.S. utilities, with projected double-digit rate base growth through 2027 based on necessary investments for our customers. As you may recall, in the third quarter of last year, we received commission approval for a new regulatory structure for AES Ohio, providing for timely recovery of the majority of these investments. Similarly, earlier last year, we received commission approval for new rates at AES Indiana, our first rate case in seven years. We are starting to see the benefits from the $1.2 billion we have invested in both utilities so far this year, representing a year-over-year increase of investment of 60%. Excluding the onetime settlement benefit recognized in 2023, year-to-date EBITDA is up 25%. Turning to Slide 8. We're also seeing additional investment opportunities from data center growth in our service areas above and beyond our existing rate base projections. Our utilities have many natural advantages that are attractive to large technology companies, such as proximity to fiber networks and the presence of ample land and water. We have worked to proactively identify sites that are well positioned to support new data centers, capitalizing on our deep relationships with technology companies. At AES Indiana, we expect to have specific data center deals to announce in the coming months, as we've been in active negotiations with several parties. We recently launched an RFP for 3 gigawatts of new generation to support accelerating demand growth. From a regulatory perspective, we will use the results of this RFP to help inform our IRP submission next year. At AES Ohio, we have now signed agreements for new data center load growth of 2.1 gigawatts, including an incremental 900 megawatts, on top of the 1.2 gigawatts we already announced on our last call. On our fourth quarter call in February, we will provide a comprehensive update on how these agreements impact our long-term investment plan and rate based growth. Today, we can indicate that just what we've signed to date provides a nearly 30% increase in investment through the end of the decade over our current plan. Turning to Slide 9. In September, we announced the plan to sell down 30% of AES Ohio to CDPQ, our longtime partner in AES Indiana. This transaction builds upon our strong relationship with CDPQ and allow us for common ownership across our U.S. utilities. This partnership will support growth at AES Ohio, with CDPQ as a funding partner for increasing investments to support reliability and economic development. Finally, as you may have seen in our release, we are pleased to report that we have now closed the sale of our equity interest in AES Brazil. We are proud of the work our people have done in Brazil to expand beyond the 2.7 gigawatt hydro portfolio by adding 2.5 gigawatts of operating wind and solar, creating one of the largest renewable businesses in the country. With these two transactions, we have now signed or closed agreements for more than three quarter of our 3.5 billion asset sale proceeds target through 2027. We have also further simplified our portfolio and eliminated Brazilian weather, interest rate and currency risks. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Steve Coughlin. Steve Coughlin : Thank you, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our third quarter results and our 2024 guidance and parent capital allocation. Turning to Slide 11. Adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes was approximately 1.2 billion in the third quarter versus 1 billion a year ago. Although we realized 458 million of additional tax value year-over-year, renewables EBITDA was down 68 million, driven mostly by breaking drought conditions in South America. In addition, our energy infrastructure SBU was down 221 million largely due to expected items, which I'll cover in more detail on a later slide. Turning to Slide 12. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.71 versus $0.60 last year. Drivers were similar to those of adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes, but partially offset by higher parent interest due to growth investments as well as a higher adjusted tax rate. I'll cover the performance of our SBUs, or strategic business units, on the next four slides. Beginning with our Renewables SBU on Slide 13. Higher EBITDA with tax attributes was driven primarily by significant growth from new projects in the U.S., where we've added 3.3 gigawatts since Q3 2023, but was partially offset by significant declines at our Colombia and Brazil businesses. This year, we've experienced unprecedented weather volatility and a record-breaking drought in South America, driven by El Nino conditions. In June, a historic flooding event took out our 1 gigawatt Chivor facility in Colombia for nearly 2 months, followed by an extreme drought across the entire country. Also, you may recall that the third quarter of 2023 was extremely positive as we had better hydrology at our Chivor facility than the rest of the country, while spot prices were very high, yielding significant margins. As a result, Colombia is down 92 million versus the third quarter of last year and over 130 million year-to-date versus last year. In Brazil, the record drought and extremely low wind resource this year have also negatively impacted renewables in Q3 and year-to- date. While 2024 has been a difficult year due to the events in South America, we expect our renewables segment will grow significantly in 2025. Emerging La Nina conditions in the Pacific are expected to return the region to much better hydrology. While in the U.S., by the end of this year, we will have brought online a total of nearly 2 gigawatts of new capacity, which will drive a large increase in our Renewable segment EBITDA in 2025. Now turning to Slide 14. Lower adjusted PTC at our Utilities SBU was mostly driven by the prior year recovery of 39 million of purchase power costs at AES Ohio, included as part of the ESP IV settlement, as well as higher interest expense from new borrowings. This was offset by returns on new rate base investment in the U.S. as well as new rates implemented in Indiana in May. Adjusting for the onetime settlement last year, utilities adjusted PTC grew by 18% in the third quarter over prior year. Lower year-over-year Q3 EBITDA at our energy infrastructure SBU was primarily driven by nearly 200 million of expected declines at our Warrior Run Southland legacy businesses and the impact of several sell-downs, all of which were baked into our guidance. At Warrior Run, we recognized revenues from the accelerated monetization of the PPA beginning last year and ending in the second quarter of this year. Our legacy Southland assets benefited from energy margins earned in the prior year, which are no longer an opportunity in 2024 under the new extension monetization structure. In addition to these known drivers, we experienced lower margins at our new Southland combined-cycle asset U.S. due to much milder weather as well as extended outages at our TEG and TEP thermal plants in Mexico. Finally, higher EBITDA at our New Energy Technologies SBU reflects continued high growth and margin increases at Fluence. Now turning to our expectations on Slide 17. We are reaffirming our 2024 adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes guidance of 3.6 billion to 4 billion and adjusted EPS guidance of 1.87 to 1.97 and continue to expect to be in the top half of both ranges, driven in part by the success we've had securing higher tax value on our new projects. Our renewables team expects to capture over 200 million in tax value upside this year, which reduces our growth capital needs. EBITDA from renewables will be favorable in the fourth quarter from revenues earned on our PPAs, although we expect lower tax attributes in the fourth quarter as a result of the more balanced timing of renewable commissionings throughout the year. We also expect further growth in our U.S. utilities in Q4 as we continue to realize returns from our investment program. This will be offset by the negative impact from the prior year monetization of the Warrior Run PPA as well as incremental impact from asset sales, including AES Brazil. Drivers of adjusted EPS will be similar along with higher interest expense from growth capital, but benefiting from a lower adjusted tax rate. As a result of our efforts to spread renewables construction more evenly throughout the year, we've achieved more than 80% of our adjusted EPS guidance year-to-date, providing greater certainty around our 2024 financial objectives. Turning to Slide 18. We are also reaffirming our adjusted EBITDA guidance range of 2.6 billion to 2.9 billion. While I'm pleased with our execution this year on our growth objectives, several large drivers have impacted results, primarily at our legacy businesses, and we now expect to end the year towards the lower end of our guidance range. Milder weather compressed spark spreads in California resulting in lower margins at our South and combined cycle gas plants. The PPA for these assets contains an option that allows us to choose to sell the energy to the market in a given year. We previously chose to execute this option for 2024 and were therefore impacted by declining spark spreads that occurred later in the year. In Mexico, the unplanned outages, which have now been resolved, further impacted our results in the second and third quarter. In Colombia, the combination of the Q2 flood-related outage at Chivor and year-long record drought have negatively impacted us versus our guidance. Finally, inverter failures at several of our solar sites impacted availability versus our plan. These inverters were under warranty and are being remediated by the manufacturers. Despite the confluence of these onetime negative impacts, growth in U.S. renewables remains very strong, and our U.S. utilities have outperformed. We expect to continue this momentum and substantially increase EBITDA at both our renewables and utilities businesses in 2025. Now to our 2024 parent capital allocation plan on Slide 19. Sources reflect approximately $2.7 billion of total discretionary cash, including $1.1 billion of parent free cash flow, $950 million of hybrid debt that we issued in May and $650 million of proceeds from asset sales. Sale proceeds will be slightly lower than expected in 2024 due to timing, but we are well ahead of our $3.5 billion long- term target through 2027. On the right-hand side, you can see our planned use of capital. We will return approximately $500 million to shareholders this year, reflecting the previously announced 4% dividend increase. We also plan to invest $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion in new growth. In summary, we've continued to execute in the year-to-date and are well positioned for a strong finish to 2024. Our substantial renewables commissioning thus far give us greater line of sight toward achieving our earnings and cash targets, and our funding plan is largely complete. With $1.60 of adjusted EPS year-to-date, we have overachieved on our EPS growth with a clear path to landing at least in the upper half of our guidance range. As we look ahead to 2025, we see strong growth in our Renewables and Utility segments and continued execution of our decarbonization strategy in energy infrastructure. I look forward to providing additional detail around 2025 and beyond on our fourth quarter call. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres. Andres Gluski : Thank you, Steve. Before opening up the call for Q&A, I would like to summarize the highlights from today's call. We continue to execute well on our strategic priorities, including robust growth at our renewables and U.S. utility businesses. With 9.1 gigawatts of new PPAs signed or awarded in 2023 and year-to-date 2024, we are well on our way towards achieving our goal of 14 gigawatts to 17 gigawatts in 2023 through 2025. Regarding our construction program, we have added 2.8 gigawatts of new projects to our operating portfolio so far this year, and we're seeing the direct financial benefits in our adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes results. At our U.S. utilities, we have embarked on the most ambition investment program in their history, while signing agreements for 2.1 gigawatts of data center load growth, and we expect more in the coming months. We're also executing well on our asset sale and transformation program and we feel good about the remainder of 2024 and our long-term outlook, despite specific onetime weather-related events this year. Finally, I can confidently say that I believe no one is better positioned with large technology customers than AES. Energy market fundamentals and the strong demand we're seeing from our corporate customers give us great confidence in the resilience of our business plan, regardless of the outcomes of the upcoming U.S. elections. Operator, please open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will go to the line of Nick Campanella with Barclays. Nicholas Campanella : Good morning, thank you for taking my question. So, I wanted to just ask the comments about supply chain, you seem well positioned through 2026 with panels, etcetera. But you continue to construct 3.5 gigs for this year. You kind of outlined this previous target at the Analyst Day of 14 gig into 2025. So, we're getting closer up to '25 now. I just kind of check in and see how you feel progressing towards that target because it seems like it will be a pretty good step up into '25 here? And is that still attainable? Andres Gluski : Yes. Thanks for the question, Nick. I mean we feel very strong about our supply chain management and construction program. We are the only large renewables developer, which really hasn't had to abandon any large PPAs over the last 3, 4 years. So, what we've said, we have all the equipment we need this year. We have 84% of what we need for next year already in country. In the next month or so, we should have 100%. So, we feel very good about supply chain. We intend to concentrate on the big items like wind turbines, batteries, solar panels. But you also have inverters and you have transformers, which are long lead time and we feel very solid there. In addition, we've really had no problems with the workforce either because we have strategic relationships with EPC contractors so that they can move the crews from one project to the next. So, in answering your question, we feel very good about our construction program. And as you know, in 2023, we geared up 100%. So now we've been able to really smooth out our commissioning throughout the year, and we expect that in 2025 and 2026. Nicholas Campanella : All right. When I think about '25 again, obviously, you had, on a tax attribute basis, some one-timers that's kind of putting you a little lower here. And I sense the notable confidence on the growth into 2025. Can you just kind of quantify for us how much has really just returned to normal versus new EBITDA from renewables contributions? And then when you consider things like Brazil rolling off, do you still expect that renewable segment to grow year-over-year? Andres Gluski : Yes. Look, that's a very good question. We aren't giving guidance for 2025 at this time. But you're right, what you really have is mean reversion. You were really coming back to sort of more normal year. 2024 is a year that we've never had before, the sort of combination of extreme floods and extreme droughts in some of our service territories, largely driven by El Nino, coming into La Nina, we expect a return to normal. But you also correctly point out that we're maintaining all of our guidance and our long-term growth rates without Brazil. And so that means that the other sectors are picking up. So, to the extent that I can say we expect next year to be a more normal year and we've absorbed the sale of Brazil by increasing the growth rates, especially in U.S. renewables and U.S. utilities. Stephen Coughlin : Hi, Nick. It's Steve. I would just add. We've added and will add a total of 3 gigawatts of new renewables this year across the portfolio. So in addition to some more normalization, like La Nina coming in South America, the installed base is going to be significantly higher. So that's part of it. Renewables segment will grow significantly. And we also have outside the renewables, we have the utilities growth. So, with a full year of new rates in Indiana and continued rate base growth in Ohio. Nicholas Campanella : That makes sense. Thanks for answering my question and see you soon. Operator : Thank you, Nick. Our next question comes from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. David your line is now open. David Arcaro : Hi. Thanks so much. Good morning. I was wondering if you could elaborate on the outperformance you had in tax credits that you received. You referenced the $200 million higher-than-expected tax credits. Wondering what that stemmed from? And is there an opportunity for any more outperformance from here? Steve Coughlin : Dave, it's Steve. Definitely been a very good year. Look this is I would say, a very core competency for us and a key differentiator. We have I think the strongest tax team and renewables finance team there is. We're always looking to ensure that we maximize the tax value opportunity because what does that do? It reduces our capital requirements and also increases returns. So we've had a good year. We've done a number of things to ensure we qualify for bonuses, including places where there's a brownfield at or -- that allows us to qualify for the energy community. These are sites that were formerly, say, agricultural sites that had, had different materials, chemicals applied that allowed them to qualify. So we've done a lot of research and digging to justify adders where we can. So the other thing we're doing is all tax credits are not created equal. So because of our track record, people tend to come to us, expect -- and we get less of a discount and we get people very focused on working with us. So I would say monetizing through transfers, we've had a lot of success and transfers do tend to get recognized a little earlier than through the tax equity partnerships the credit value. So that's part of it as well. So I do see this as potential upside in the future. But of course, there's other things going on in the portfolio. We have to take a holistic look. And when we give guidance in '25, we'll update you guys on the entire portfolio. David Arcaro : Okay. Got it. That's helpful. Good to see just chipping away at the financing need with that. And then wondering if you could just touch on what renewable returns have been on the incremental projects that you've been signing, I guess, since raising your return expectations earlier in the year, how those return levels have been trending? Has there been continued momentum upwards? Andres Gluski : Well, we're seeing good returns from our projects, and we continue to see a market that values what we bring to our customers. So the answer to that is yes, that we continue to see -- our newer projects have been within that range towards the upper end of that range. So we feel very confident in the numbers that we've provided. David Arcaro : Okay got it. Appreciate it. Thanks so much. Andres Gluski : Thanks, David. Operator : Thank you, David. Our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Durgesh your line is open. Durgesh Chopra : Hi. Thank you. Good morning team thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to start off with the actual portfolio that is going to come online, not from the guidance. But in terms of the 2.8 gigawatts that's coming online this year, should we expect an uptick in that number as we go into 2025, the actual construction and getting projects online? Steve Coughlin : Yes. So this is Steve. So we'll give that guidance in February. So there's a number of moving pieces here. I would say the largest inflection will be beyond 2025, Durgesh. And so I expect renewables will be up somewhat. But I think based on what our COD schedules look like, the largest increases will come in '26 and '27. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. Okay. That's very helpful. That's just project timing. Okay. I have two other questions. First, on the hydrogen project with APD, there may have been some changes there, with the activist involvement with the company. Just can you update us what your plan is there? How much capital might you have invested to date? And what do we do with those gigawatts coming online? Just anything you can share there, that would be helpful. Andres Gluski : Sure. No, I appreciate the question. Look we have developed a very attractive 1.5 gigawatts of renewables which, as you know, there is a market that there's a shortage of large advanced renewable projects. So we have to see when 45 V comes out and other things, how much of this goes to hydrogen. But in any case, we have a very attractive asset there. Regarding outside of the states, I do see those projects likely going forward with Asian buyers stepping up and as partners in the early part of it. So we don't have a lot of money invested other than development money that we've done. However, I think that this is probably some of the best pipeline development that we've done because it's a particularly attractive asset. Durgesh Chopra : Got it, Andres. That's very helpful. And this is part of the backlog that you show, right? The -- I believe that number is 12 now. Is that the 1.5 gig that's included in the 12? Andres Gluski : No, no. We only include in our backlog, that's which is signed or awarded at the very final stage. We've never taken any project out of our backlog really. Nothing but -- so we wouldn't include it until we have a signed PPA. Durgesh Chopra : Understood. Okay. Very clear. And then one final question, sorry for dragging for this long. Steve, just on Moody's basis, earlier in the year, we've had conversations on the methodology -- potentially a methodology change at Moody's. Maybe just update us on where you stand on Moody's basis and the latest conversations you've had with the credit rating agency? Steve Coughlin : Sure, Durgesh. So the dialogue continues. I do expect that they will publish an update before year-end. I characterize the conversation continuing to be very constructive. I hate to see that our credit quality has indeed improved since they gave us the initial upgrade a few years back. What's the reality here is that we've been really transforming the portfolio, exiting markets, exiting carbon-intensive assets and rotating capital into long duration, U.S. dollar, high creditworthy counter-parties with no fuel exposure. So we have a very, very attractive profile. I think what they're working through since Moody's looks at AES on a consolidated basis, as opposed to S&P and Fitch, which is at the parent recourse level only, they're looking at the project finance structures and how they take account of those. Project finance is amortizing when we put debt on our projects, it amortizes over the life of the contract, so there's not an exposed levered tail there. So it's a low-risk structure. It's actually investment-grade-rated debt at the project level. So it's an attractive structure, it just hasn't fit within the well within the way they define their thresholds. So they're looking at that. They're also looking at how -- given our high growth, we carry a fairly material amount of construction debt, and that's not yet yielding. And so they're looking at that in ways to recognize that there is cash flow pending that's certain. And of course, this is nonrecourse debt as well that they're looking for adjustments along those lines as well. So I feel good about where we are. I feel really good about the conversations. And I do expect there'll be sharing their view here before the end of the year. Andres Gluski : I would add that if you think of the sort of the big picture overall, we continue to improve our credit profile. So we exited Brazil which was a substantial amount of our FX, certainly a big part of our foreign interest rate exposure and weather-related exposures we learned this year. So as we shut down coal plants or sell coal plants, you're changing 2-year PPAs with fuel risk for really long-term 20-year PPAs with no fuel risk with investment-grade off-takers in the U.S. So I feel very confident that any credit rating agency looking at overall company, where we are today versus where they gave us the ratings a year or 2 ago is a substantially better company. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. Really appreciate that color guys. Thank you. Andres Gluski : Thank you, Durgesh. Operator : Thank you, Durgesh. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies. Julien, your line is open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hi, good morning team. Thank you guys very much for the time. I appreciate it. Can you guys hear me? Andres Gluski : Yes, Julien very well. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Thanks you, Andres. Excellent. Well, actually since we're talking on the credit here, just to kick off on the nuance, just where do you see your metrics getting here and then more specifically, do you anticipate needing to upsize the asset sales or accelerate the asset sale target to kind of true up the balance sheet for any reason here? I get the Moody's methodology is in flux, but as you think about the asset sale piece of this, any observations to make on that front since we were focused on in the second year? Steve Coughlin : No, certainly. So I mean the credit metrics remain strong at the parent level. And actually, things that we've been doing are quite credit accretive. So some of the largest things we've done here now just closing on Brazil. Brazil, while it was generating a significant amount of EBITDA in the Renewable segment was actually producing very, very little cash. The business is highly levered and so the sale is actually very credit accretive. Similarly, with the Ohio sell-down when that closes next year, we're going to be paying down a tranche debt that's due at the holdco over 400 million. So we see that as also credit accretive and that we do, in fact, expect as a result of the transaction Ohio will be able to start paying dividends at least a year sooner than it otherwise would have. So we really feel good about the trajectory. I would expect at the end of this year, the parent level metrics will be between 22% and 23% which are well above the threshold of 20% that we have. And so yes, no, Julien, I think the asset sale program, we've had a lot of success, targeted 3.5. The universe is, in fact, bigger. So we'll see what makes sense going into the future. But I see us having a lot of runway here and that the credit metric has actually, in fact, been supported by the asset sale program. Andres Gluski : I'd like to sort of also say that we've always exceeded our asset sale program targets. And I would also say, quite frankly, I think we have a very good record of selling assets at good value. And what we've always been doing is maximizing the value for our shareholders and not just doing asset sales to hit a certain, let's say, megawatt or generation composition target. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: No. Fair enough, guys and thank you for that. Let me pivot real quickly to Palco here. We saw your peers to the north with NIPSCO. NiSource gave a very robust update. You guys are talking about 3 gigawatts of procurement activity. I know you guys already had a team's trajectory articulated at the Analyst Day last year, but I suspect that number is potentially meaningfully higher or potentially extend it out for meaningfully greater duration given A the 3 gigawatts and B the baseline of the rate base at Palco here. If you can speak a little bit to what your expectations on what total portion that you can own and how it impacts your financials here? Steve Coughlin : Okay. So look, I mean the rate case this year was resolved early settled early and approved early. So we had a significant increase over $70 million annual increase. And so that is driving a significant year-over-year. We'll have a full year of the new rates next year. And then as Andres described in his comments, we're once RFP for a lot of new generation in the utility. It will go into the integrated resource plan to be filed next year. And we're talking -- I think we said in the last call, 3 gigawatts total and that's increasing of data center load across the utilities, in addition to what we've already signed. So there's a -- I would say what we guided to is double-digit rate base growth across the utilities. It's going to be much higher than that. So we'll give more guidance in '25, Julien, but -- given what we're seeing the utility investment is going to increase, the returns are going to increase, the rate base will increase. And that's also part of why we also sold down Ohio because although we're selling down 30%, in fact, our net investment in the utilities is increasing. So this sell-down is allowing us to improve credit, get to earlier distributions from the utility, it will improve the credit quality in Ohio and it helps fund a much bigger investment program than even we anticipated a year ago. And our net investment, even though we're at 70% ownership in both utilities it\u2019s going to be even higher. So that's how I would look at it. And of course, in Indiana, it's an integrated utility. So not only do we have the load on the network, but we also have the generation piece to supply as well. So we see a lot of generation growth. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. So even the medium-term rate base growth CAGR, it could potentially be heading higher is what I'm hearing. But actually, you made allusion to one thing here, if I can just clarify. You'll be providing an updated outlook here on the fourth quarter. And I know that there's a lot of different things that are moving around in the plan. So as you guys have done historically, expect that kind of integrated update here on 4Q roll forward from the Analyst Day? Steve Coughlin : Yes, absolutely. Yes, we will update you on our long term for -- in February. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Wonderful. Excellent, guys. Thank you for the time. Appreciate it. Steve Coughlin : Thanks Julien. Operator : Thank you, Julien. Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Angie your line is open. Angie Storozynski : Thank you for taking my question. So I just wanted to focus on the renewable power EBITDA. So the one without credits for cash EBITDA, I would call it. So I'm looking at these results. I mean you will be basically flat since 2022. And now it looks like 2025 is going to be also like 620, 630 range. So I mean I understand that there are one-off items that weighed on this year's EBITDA which is going to be even lower than the number I just mentioned. So I mean there has to be some growth in that number. And I hear you, Steve, that there will be some in '26, '27, but you're making very substantial investments and we're not seeing growth in that cash renewable EBITDA. Now the reason I'm actually asking about it is because if you look at the parent free cash flow, parent distributions, I mean the vast majority of them come from energy infrastructure, but that's a segment that is shrinking. So I will have to rely on cash distributions from renewables very soon in order to hit the free cash flow expectations. So I'm just hoping that we can reconcile this. Thanks. Andres Gluski : Yes. First, we're not saying that the renewable EBITDA will grow substantially in 2025. And what you have is the fact that we're selling Brazil. That's 5 gigawatts, so -- which are having a little bit of apples and oranges here. So we're seeing the operating results from our renewable build, absolutely in where we think it should be. So it is -- there's a number of things going on here, Angie, that we can -- time will clarify. But I don't think that it's -- you can say that we're not getting the results from the investments that we're making. It's just moving. And then second, on the energy infrastructure, yes, I mean, we have a balanced portfolio. So we tend to have that event in one spot, offset by good events in the other. And this was a particular quarter where really a lot of things came together that normally don't come together. So normally, if you have conditions, you have more win. This time we had both. But what we also had was sort of all the years rain came in a very short period of time and damage of 1 gigawatt hydro, so I think we really did have sort of onetime events, and I think you're drawing sort of longer-term conclusions from that. I'll pass it to Steve. Steve Coughlin : Yes. I would just say, Angie, the only reason we're down year-over-year is because of the record drought. The only material reason is because of the record drought, primarily Colombia and to a degree, Brazil as well. So those conditions are known to be changing, moving to La Nina. Obviously, Brazil is out of the portfolio. So Colombia, we do expect returning to much more normal conditions next year. And don't forget, we also had an extremely high third quarter last year in Colombia, unusually high. So it makes the year-over-year comparison look more extreme. But what's the reality is the U.S. growth is significant. And so this year and even higher into next year, more than overcoming the loss of Brazil from the renewables segment. So the renewables growth will be very material this year. So we get that we're not on track at this point with the guidance for -- if you were to straight line the guidance, but we're picking up substantially into next year and are reaffirming through 2027 that 19% to 21% growth rate, and that's largely driven by all of this U.S. growth, which is taking off. As I said, we have added a total of 3 gigawatts of renewables across the across the year since Q3 of last year. We also will ultimately move Chile into the renewable segment where it belongs as we execute on our coal exit. So the cash from this renewable segment will grow accordingly as well, and the EBITDA will be on track with that growth rate. Angie Storozynski : Okay. So let me just push back the latter, meaning that Chile was supposed to be additive to the growth trajectory that you were showing at the Analyst Day. And now that we see the results, like year-over-year changes versus '23 results, you clearly point out that the second half of '23 had some big onetime benefits, which you could not have counted on during your '23 Analyst Day, and yet you came below your expectations, even the low end on renewables EBITDA for '23.So again, I mean I hear you that there is growth in the U.S. portfolio, which will benefit the EBITDA, but again, I mean, you had some big positives in the second half of '23, which you could not have expected when you were giving guidance on '23 on renewables and you came below expectations on renewables in '23 now. So why should I have conviction that the same is not going to true in future years? Andres Gluski : Well, we feel confident we're going to hit the long-range growth that we talked about. I mean it has to do with reaching critical mass on some of these things. And certainly, we can have onetime weather events. But I think the important thing is what returns are you actually seeing from the projects you're bringing online? What is the value of the PPAs you are signing? And as we move forward, it will be easier to make apples-and-apples comparisons as we have the same portfolio new year. Steve Coughlin : Yes. The other thing I would say, Angie, is referring to last year, we did end up having more of our commissionings very late in the year, in fact, most in December. So a little later than expected this year. We have substantially changed that trend. And so the renewable commissionings were much more really spread throughout the year. That's why we've already recognized $900 million of tax attributes already. So I think that's another reason that, that program has become more mature and spread throughout the year that we're seeing a better result, and that \u201823 was lower. Angie Storozynski : And just one other question. So I'm looking at your guidance here on the free cash flow for the parent for the year. It seems like you are expecting about $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion in distributions from subsidiary and you are at about 800, 880, I forget. So is this apples-to-apples, meaning that I am basically 50% of distributions, meaning that the fourth quarter will be the big catch-up on distributions? Steve Coughlin : Yes, but that's a normal trend. So that's -- we've been having that type of seasonality for a long time. And I would say, in most cases, the cash is already sitting there. It's based on the windows in time relative to our debt service that we're also allowed to pay dividends. So we have clear visibility into the remaining dividend. It's just a matter of timing at this point as to when they get released on the periodic twice a year, once a year in some cases. So I'm very, very confident in the distribution level. Angie Storozynski : Okay. Thank you. Steve Coughlin : Thank you, Angie. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research. Michael your line is now open. Michael Sullivan : Hi. Good morning. Steve Coughlin : Good morning, Michael. Michael Sullivan : Yes, just -- I know that kind of got passed through a bunch there on the last line of questions or commentary, I guess. Just to make it simple, like you keep talking about significant growth in '25. We obviously don't know what that means exactly. But you have this 5% to 7% EBITDA CAGR off of '23. When do you get inside of that within your plan? Steve Coughlin : Yes. So again, we'll give an update in February. The early years as we have been executing on the transformation and things like the Brazil exit, we'll have the Vietnam exit next year. We had the Warrior Run shutdown, and so that goes away. So that weighs on the early years, but the trajectory, as I said, there's more of an inflection point beyond next year, overall, getting through the 2027. Period. So what's happening is that the renewables will grow significantly next year. The utilities will grow significantly, catching back up to closer to that level of return of growth that we've been expecting, but the energy infrastructure shrinking has been a little more front-end loaded. And then the Brazil sale, obviously, is a headwind in renewables in the near term, but we're more -- significantly more than offsetting it next year. So that's how I would characterize it. We feel good about the growth rate overall, but it's influenced by how we execute on the transformation as well as the growth, and the transformation shows up in the shrinking of the energy infrastructure. So that's how I would characterize it. And so we'll give more in February. But again, I feel really good about the renewables and the utilities. And then the energy infrastructure we\u2019ll look at choices we have around how fast to continue the transformation and discuss that in February. Michael Sullivan : Okay. That's very helpful, Steve. And then I had 2 ones just on your resource additions. The first, just in terms of looking at new gas at the utility, do you see that in the RFP? Or is that not until the IRP? And do you have a good handle on how much you could look to be doing in gas? And then on the nonutility side, you all have traditionally been pretty solar heavy though I think you mentioned wind a few times just in terms of supply chain. But when I look at you and your peers, it doesn't seem like anyone's adding too much wind these days. So just curious what you're seeing on that front? Andres Gluski : Yes. On your first question, that would be really waiting for the IRP. So we certainly are looking at all options. So it will be likely a mix of renewables and some thermal, of course, batteries as well. Now regarding the second question in wind. Well, we were -- we had been building quite a lot of wind in Brazil. But a lot of the projects that we have in the pipeline have a considerable amount of wind. So if you think of the -- what's been known as sort of the green hydrogen project in Texas, 1.5 giga, that's primarily wind. So we'll have a more of a balance in the U.S. between wind and solar in future years. Michael Sullivan : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you, Michael. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Levine with Citi. Ryan your lines are open. Ryan Levine : Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. What is the time line for the $92 million Colombia impact to return to historic norms? And what is the risk to achieving this ramp at this stage in the year? Steve Coughlin : Yes. So conditions are already improving. The fourth quarter, in fact, I expect will be higher in Colombia than last year, Ryan. And all forecasts point to La Nina being highly probable over the next couple of months and lasting well into next year. So it's pretty much turning around now. Again, I expect the fourth quarter to be higher. And then throughout next year, I expect Colombia to be higher in this year overall. So Colombia has been -- and it was $92 million in the quarter alone. It's $130 million down year-to-date over prior year. So that is the single largest driver here, and it shows up in the Renewables segment. But the U.S. growth is doing hard work to offset that and significantly overcome overcomes it in the fourth quarter here and into next year. Andres Gluski : Yes. I would add we had a two-month outage. Yes. So the truth is that outage was at the worst possible time because if we hadn't had the outage because we had a rain, which was 25% higher than anything prior previously recorded, we could have used that water to very good results subsequently in the drought. So being out for two months is -- that's part of the recovery. Ryan Levine : Okay. So then by 2026, you should be back to a more normal performance? Steve Coughlin : No, '25, Ryan. So the conditions are already improving. We expect this quarter, fourth quarter to be higher than last year. And next year, in 2025, we expect normal to better hydrology from the La Nina. Ryan Levine : Okay. And then maybe switching gears, as you referenced in your prepared comments, impact to California spark spreads, are you looking to change your hedging strategy there? Or any color you could share around the outlook going forward for the Southland? Steve Coughlin : Yes. So just -- as a reminder, the Southland structure has a 20-year contract for capacity and energy. So we have a very known monetization stream. It is at our election annually a year in advance to decide whether we want to market the energy ourselves and hedge it or put it to the uptake or under the PPA. So for '24 we did previously decide, at the end of '22, to call the energy to us and to market it. Unfortunately, spark spreads changed significantly during the time that we made that decision, and we're executing on the hedge program. And so we had downtime this year. But still relative to the put value, still a good decision. And so we have made that decision also for 2025 that we will market the energy. We are over 95% hedged already at values well in excess of the put value. So it -- the market has changed. The market has compressed a lot due to better hydro conditions. What we've had is milder weather. There's been a lot more battery penetration in California. So the market value is not as high over the long term as it had been back in '22 when we first made that decision. But nonetheless, we see, overall, the strategy is -- has been increasing or has added over the put is just not as much as we expected when we gave the guidance, unfortunately. Ryan Levine : So, then as a follow-up, given that framework and your decisions for next year, is there any color around -- any direction of travel for that asset's performance for '25 given what your parties decided? Steve Coughlin : Yes. I would say, at this point, since we've already decided on '25, it is in excess of the put value. And we're already nearly 100% hedged, 95% hedged, as I said. So it the value is lower than it was in the original guidance, but still above had we taken a no-risk strategy. And then for 2026, we have not yet made that decision. And we'll have to here later in the fourth quarter, and we'll update you all on that later. And that will be based just upon what we see in the hedge market at the time relative to the put value. Ryan Levine : Thanks for taking my question. Operator : Thank you. Ryan. Our next question is from the line of Richard Sunderland with JPMorgan. Richard, your line is open. Richard Sunderland : Thanks for the time. I know you've covered a lot of ground. Just one quick cleanup. You've talked at various points about asset sale program and how you've thought about timing that and affecting that it sounds like more to come on year-end around that. But just curious how you're thinking about monetizing the new energy technologies investments? And if that's something that should fall within the planned period? Any thoughts there. Andres Gluski : When you think about the new energy technologies, look, what we've talked about is through 2027. And we approached these strategically. So what we've always said is that we will monetize these assets when we feel it's appropriate. And when we are out of long-term venture capitalist investors. So we'll monetize them at the right time when we don't think we're adding a lot of value. And we've already done some monetization and taking some money off the table. So it's been a very successful program. And I think there's a lot more value there than is being recognized by most of the parts. But what I would say is that so long as we add a lot of value, we'll stay in. However, we'll continue to opportunistically monetize. And certainly, we're well ahead of our plan for 2027. But as Steve mentioned, the universe is greater. So it would include some things from new energy technologies. Richard Sunderland : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you, Richard. There are no additional questions waiting at this time. So I'll turn the call back over to Susan Harcourt for closing remarks. Susan Harcourt : We thank everybody for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have. We look forward to seeing many of you at the EEI Financial Conference later this month. Thank you, and have a nice day. Operator : That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, everyone, and a warm welcome to the AES Corporation Q2 2024 Financial Review Call. My name is Emily, and I'll be coordinating your call today. [Operator Instructions] I will now hand over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Susan Harcourt, to begin. Susan, please go ahead. Susan Harcourt : Thank you, Operator. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter 2024 financial review call. Our press release, presentation, and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today we will be making forward-looking statements. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements which are disclosed in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website along with the presentation. Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Coughlin, our Chief Financial Officer, and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will turn the call over to Andres. Andres Gluski : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2024 financial review call. We are very pleased with financial performance so far this year. Today, I will discuss our results, the significant advancements we've made with large technology customers, and the work we are doing to incorporate generative AI in our portfolio to develop new competitive advantages. Beginning on slide three, with our second quarter results, we had a strong second quarter that was in line with our expectations, with adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes of $843 million, adjusted EBITDA of $652 million, and adjusted EPS of $0.38. We are on track to meet our 2024 financial objective, and we now expect to be in the top-half of our ranges for adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes and adjusted EPS. We are also reaffirming our remaining 2024 guidance metrics and growth rate to 2027. Steve Coughlin, our CFO, will give more detail on our financial performance and outlook. I'm also pleased to report that, since our last call in May, we have signed 2.5 gigawatts of new agreements in total, including 2.2 gigawatts with hyperscalers across our Utilities and Renewal businesses. This includes 1.2 gigawatts of new datacenter load growth across AES Ohio and AES Indiana. A PPA to provide 727 megawatts of new renewables in Texas, and a 310 megawatt retail supply agreement in Ohio. With these arrangements, we are expanding our work with the major datacenter providers to new areas of business. Turning now to datacenter growth at our U.S. utilities, on slide four, since our last call, we have signed agreements to support 1.2 gigawatt of new load across AES Ohio and AES Indiana, expected to come online in phases, beginning in 2026. Additionally, we're in advanced negotiations across several sites to support another 3 gigawatts of new load. These agreements are transformative for both utilities, with the potential to increase the peak load at both AES Ohio and AES Indiana by more than 50%. As a result, AES Ohio's rate base will consist predominantly of FERC-regulated transmission assets, receiving timely recovery through a formula rate. For AES Indiana, this growth creates the potential for significant investment in transmission, as well as additional build-out of new-generation assets. These opportunities will even further increase our industry-leading U.S. utility rate base growth plans. Our service territories are particularly well-positioned to serve datacenters and other large loads with available interconnection, lower rates, and land prices, access to water resources and local incentives. Turning to slide five, and the generation build-out at AES Indiana, we continue to make progress in upgrading and transforming our generation fleet as we shutdown or convert our coal units to gas, and build our renewable fleet. I am pleased to announce that we have signed a deal to acquire 170 megawatt solar plus storage development project that AES Indiana will construct and own. The project will require approximately $350 million of CapEx, with an expected completion date in late 2027. Once approved by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, this will be the sixth project supporting AES Indiana's recent generation growth. Now turning to our Renewables business on slide six, since our last all in may, we have further expanded our partnership with Google, signing a 15-year PPA for 727 megawatts in Texas to power its datacenter growth. The agreement includes a combination of wind and solar to further Google's 24-7 carbon-free energy goals. These projects are expected to come online in 2026 and 2027. We also recently signed a retail supply agreement with Google for 310 megawatts to support their Ohio datacenters. This agreement demonstrates the strong trust and collaboration between our companies, which began with our original 2021 partnership to provide 24-7 renewable power in Virginia. We see further opportunities to add renewables to support Google's datacenter growth in Ohio. Turning to slide seven, with these major announcements today on our collaborations with hyperscalers, we have now signed a total of 8.1 gigawatts directly with technology companies, which is clearly a leading market position. As you can see on slide eight, our backlog of projects under signed long-term contracts now stands at 12.6 gigawatts. Our focus remains on maximizing the quality of megawatts over the quantity, which means delivering high-quality projects with higher returns and long-duration PPAs. We have never felt better about our key customer relationships, the long-term market dynamics that are supporting growth and value creation in our portfolio. Turning to slide nine, the demand for power that is coming from the rise in generative AI in datacenters, represents a significant structural change in the Power segment, and no one is better positioned than AES for sustained growth from this opportunity. Regardless of election or policy outcomes, we are confident in our ability to continue signing renewable PPAs with mid-teen IRRs. Our corporate customers value our unique record of bringing projects online on time over the past five years. Furthermore, looking at the interconnection queues, time to power and price certainty, we see renewables as the only source of new power that can meet most of the demand over the next decade. AES has a longstanding and deep relationship with hyperscaler customers. This includes our ability to co-create new offerings and structure innovative clean energy solutions, such as hybrid PPAs, shaped products, and 24/7 renewables. As you can see on slide 10, of the 3.6 gigawatts that we expect to bring online this year, we have already completed the construction of 1.6 gigawatts and expect the remainder to be weighted towards the third quarter. I should note that for the projects coming online this year, we have all of the major equipment already on site in almost all for 2025. Additionally, we expect a significant portion of our solar panels to be domestically produced beginning in 2026. All of the above combined with having panels on site for 2025 projects, greatly mitigates our exposure to any potential new tariffs. Our diversified and resilient supply chain has been and will continue to be best-in-class. Finally, turning to slide 11, not only is generative AI shaping the customer landscape, but it is also transforming how we work internally, providing new opportunities for efficiencies, customer service and innovation that will give us new competitive advantages. As you may have seen, in June, we announced a partnership with AI Fund to accelerate AI-driven energy solutions. Founded by AI leader, Andrew Ng, AI Fund is a venture studio that works with entrepreneurs to rapidly build companies. We are collaborating with AI Fund on co-building companies that leverage AI to address bottlenecks and improve efficiencies in the energy transition in areas such as developing and operating renewables and asset management. At the same time, we continue to leverage AI across our portfolio with our culture of innovation and continuous improvement. We are increasingly using proprietary tools across a wide range of our business operations, enabling our people to work faster and smarter. For example, our renewables team has built sophisticated tools that utilize generative AI to accurately predict the speed at which projects will move through interconnection queues, helping us more efficiently coordinate the various simultaneous development processes. As you can see on slide 12, earlier this week, we launched the world's first AI-powered solar installation robot, Maximo, which uses state-of-the-art AI and robotics to complement our construction crews in the installation of solar modules. Maximo enables faster construction times and reduces overall project costs. It can work three shifts, even in the worst weather conditions, with a more inclusive workforce. Not only does it reduce time to power, which is highly valued by our customers, but it will boost overall project returns. We plan to ramp up our use of Maximo in 2025 and are already utilizing it to construct a portion of our two gigawatt Bellefield project in California, which is the largest solar plus storage project in the U.S. and is contracted to serve Amazon. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Steve Coughlin. Steve Coughlin : Thank you, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our second quarter results and our 2024 guidance and parent capital allocation. Turning to slide 14, adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes was $843 million in the second quarter versus $607 million a year ago. This was driven by growth in our renewables SBU, new rates and growth investments in our U.S. utilities, and higher margins in our energy infrastructure SBU. Turning to slide 15, adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.38 versus $0.21 cents last year. Drivers were similar to those of adjusted with tax attributes, but partially offset by higher depreciation and higher interest expense as a result of our growth. I'll cover the performance of our SBUs or Strategic Business Units on the next four slides. Beginning with our renewables SBU on slide 16, higher EBITDA with tax attributes was driven primarily by contributions from new projects, but was partially offset by lower availability from a forced outage event at our 1 gigawatt Chivor hydroplant in Columbia. The outage was caused by record water inflows in early June, which brought significant sediment into the plant and damaged the units. Repairs of the plant were completed quickly and all units resumed operations by mid July. Higher adjusted PTC at our utilities SBU was mostly driven by higher revenues from the $1.6 billion we invested in our rate base in the past year, new rates implemented in Indiana in May, year-over-year low growth of 3.1% as well as favorable weather. Higher EBITDA at our energy infrastructure SBU primarily reflects higher revenues recognized from the accelerated monetization of the PPA at our Warrior Run plant and higher margins in Chile. Partially offset by lower margins in the Dominican Republic and the sell-down of our gas and LNG businesses in Panama and the Dominican Republic. Finally, relatively flat EBITDA at our new energy technologies SBU reflects our continued development of early stage technology businesses. Partially offset by continued margin increases at Fluence. Now turning to our expectations on slide 20, as a result of our strong first-half performance and high confidence in a strong second-half, I am very happy to share that we now expect adjusted EBITDA with tax attribute to be in the top half of our 2024 expected range of $3.6 billion to $4 billion. Drivers of adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes in the year ago include higher contribution from new renewable commissioning, contributions from growth investment, and expected higher load at our U.S. utilities. Partially offset by expected closings in our asset sale program. Turning to slide 21, I am also very glad to share that we now expect our 2024 adjusted EPS to be in the upper half of our guidance range of $1.87 to $1.97. We increased our share of earnings in the first-half of the year from 25% in 2023 to nearly half in 2024. Growth in the year to go will have similar drivers as adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes. Partially offset by higher interest expense from growth capital. Now to our 2024 parent capital allocation on slide 22, sources reflect approximately $3 billion of total discretionary cash including $1.1 billion of parent free cash flow, $900 million to $1.1 billion of proceeds from asset sales, and $950 million of hybrid debt that we issued since our last earnings call in May. On the right-hand side, you can see our planned use of capital. We will return approximately $500 million to shareholders this year, reflecting the previously announced 4% dividend increase. We also plan to invest $2.4 billion to $2.7 billion towards new growth. Of which, 85% will go to renewable and utility. Turning to slide 23, we are well on our way to towards achieving our long-term asset sale target of $3.5 billion from 2023 through 2027. We signed or closed more than $2.2 billion of asset sales since the beginning of last year. And we are now nearly two-thirds of the way to reaching our target even though we are only 1.5 years into our five-year guidance period. We do not announce specific asset sales in advance. But the remaining proceeds could come from sell-downs of renewables projects, our intended coal exist, monetization of our new energy technologies businesses, and sales or sell-down of other noncore assets. In summary, we made excellent progress this quarter toward all of our strategic and financial targets. We have clear line of sight towards achieving the key drivers of our year-to-go earnings growth. And we are well-positioned to continue delivering on our financial goals beyond this year. We also made significant headway on our long-term funding plan which allows us continue simplifying and focusing our portfolio while we scale our leading renewables and utilities business. Our strategy to serve high value corporate customers including a rapidly growing base of datacenter providers across our Renewables and Utilities businesses is highly resilient, and will continue to yield financial success for AES and our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres. Andres Gluski : Thank you, Steve. Before opening up the call for Q&A, I would like to summarize the highlights from today's call. With more than 8 gigawatts of agreements already signed directly with large technology customers, including 2.2 gigawatts signed since our last call. We continue to be the industry leader in this segment. At the same time, we continue to deliver our projects on time and on budget, with 1.6 gigawatts completed so far this year. We are fully on track to add a total of 3.6 gigawatts by the end of 2024. We see demand for power from datacenters in the U.S. growing around 22% a year. And we could not be better positioned to serve these customers, from our Renewable business to our Utilities. I would like to reiterate that with strong demand for the projects in our 66 gigawatt development pipeline and our existing 12.6 gigawatt backlog of signed long-term PPAs. We are very confident in our ability to continue to meet or exceed our long-term objectives. Operator, please open up the line for question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Durgesh, please go ahead. Durgesh Chopra : Hey, team, good morning. First off, congrats on a solid quarter and first-half. Too bad the market is [viscose] (ph) today. Maybe just I had one question on the numbers, and then I have just one high-level macro question. First, to Steve, could you update us on credit metrics, where did you end up as of Q2, and then were do you expect to be at the end of 2024 on FFO to debt? Steve Coughlin : Yes, sure. Hi, Durgesh, it's good to hear your voice. So, the credit is looking very, very strong. So, we continue to be on a path of improving credit. At the parent level, I expect will be even higher than last year's year-end. And so, it looks very good. There's obviously intra movement in quarters as we have some cash flow lumpiness coming up, but it continues very strong. I think we'll see the year end be even better than last year. Durgesh Chopra : So, just to be clear there, Steve, I think the target last year was 22%, if I have those numbers right on FFO to debt basis is the S&P methodology. Is that still kind of a good goalpost? Steve Coughlin : Yes. So, we have a threshold of 20%. So, you're referring more to, I think, where we ended, which had plenty of cushion above that. And I think we will likely see ourselves even higher than that at the end of this year. Durgesh Chopra : Okay, perfect. [A lot of] (ph) question on the balance sheet. Okay, then maybe just one election question. Andres, appreciate the commentary in your prepared remarks. But I'm just wondering, obviously a great quarter here. You added to the Utilities, you added on the Renewable side. But I'm just wondering if all the noise around repeal of tax credits and other policy chatter, does that hurt your ability to sign new contracts? Does that come up in your contract negotiation, is that a risk? Maybe just help us sort through that. Thank you. Andres Gluski : Sure, Durgesh. No, it's not slowing down our signing of contracts. What we really had is a situation that we had, to some extent; foreseen a couple years ago where it's really there's a shortage of renewable power for datacenters in many markets. So, what's the biggest concern of our clients is actually time to power, can you get me the power on time to power datacenters. And that's their main constraint. So, no, there has been anything holding us down or, quite frankly, a major issue of conversation with them. I do think we have to step back and say, \"Look, ITC investment tax credits, production tax credits, they've been around for 32 years.\" Second, there's been a tremendous amount of investment related to the Inflation Reduction Act. And 85% of that investment has gone into republican districts. Today, there are eight million people working directly or indirectly in renewables in the U.S. So, a total dismantling is highly unlikely in any scenario, whether there are some changes around the margin; sure. But thinking about the sector, quite frankly we operate in markets where there are no subsidies. We actually make more money in those subsidies. And it would change somewhat the structure of the contracts. But we see a wholesale revision of this very, very unlikely. Something more likely what happened to NAFTA, where it became the USMCA, and actually was, quite frankly, updated and improved in some areas. So, that's where we se the market right now. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. [Indiscernible]. Thanks so much for the time, I appreciate it. Andres Gluski : You're welcome. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Richard Sunderland with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Richard Sunderland : Hi, good morning, and thank you for the time today. Andres Gluski : Hi, good morning, Rich. Steve Coughlin : Hi, Rich. Richard Sunderland : Starting on the Utility announcements, can you outline the utility load opportunity in terms of the breakdown of that 3 gigawatt in advanced negotiations between Indiana and Ohio, plus how much of that capital could fall into the transmission and generation buckets relative to what's in the plant today? Andres Gluski : Okay, look, that's a great question. But we will give you more color on that as time passes, because these are multiple agreements with multiple clients. And we'd really like to see how it shakes out. We're certain that there's going to be a lot of load added, a lot of transmission assets added. But this is between two utilities, between multiple clients. So, right now it's a little bit too early for us to give too much in term of exact load growth by business. Steve Coughlin : Yes, and just to add to that, Rich, we had previously guided to around 10% up for the utilities combined, this is definitely upside. There's significant acceleration of discussions. So, definitely upside to the plans that we've given in the past. Timing matters here though, so we'll see some within our long-term guidance period, and some beyond that. But we do see a lot more growth than we saw even at the start of this year. Richard Sunderland : Understood. Thanks for the color there. And then, your language in the slides on maximizing megawatt quality over quantity; that message has certainly been clear. But I'm curious if this is consistent with your raise per turn assumptions, I think that was back in 4Q. Or do you see further upside potential to returns given the supply and demand dynamics currently? Andres Gluski : Okay. Basically, I think there's several things. One, when we talk about pipeline, that means we have something in the interconnection queue. And we have some degree of land control. So, I would say not all pipeline were created equal. And when we talk about backlog, that's actually contracts that are signed and that we have to deliver, and people have to buy that energy. So, we've never taken anything material out of our backlog, even during COVID. So, what we're saying here with -- the basic message is, one, yes we increased our average rate of returns on these projects. We're not talking about mid-teens. The other thing is that rather than sign like one umbrella agreement with one particular client, we're optimizing the value of this resource among various clients and among opportunities. So, we see this as something where we invest in, we create this real pipeline. And then, we want to optimize the value from it. Will the average returns go up further? Well, I think it would depend market by market, and the opportunity. But right now, we feel very good about the mid-teen returns that we talked about. And we also feel very good about that we're making the best use of that pipeline to create value for our shareholders. Richard Sunderland : Great, thank you for the color there. I'll leave it there. Andres Gluski : Okay. Thanks, Rich. Operator : The next question comes from Antoine Aurimond with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Antoine Aurimond : Hey, guys. Hope you're well. Thank you for taking my question. Andres Gluski : Good morning. Antoine Aurimond : Good morning. I guess to follow-up on Durgesh on the credit side, how do you frame the prospects of going towards a mid-BBB rating and what would be the timeline, we'll be contemplating? Steve Coughlin : Yes. So, as I said, credit metrics are definitely continuing to improve and so I see that as a possibility in a matter of years, not this year, that will be have those metrics. So, we don't have a specific target to share with you at this point, but I expect to be higher than last year and I expect it to continue to improve. As the installed base of our growth continues to grow and add cash. Today, we do carry construction debt that's not yet yielding. But relative to the base, the base is increasing every year significantly in this moment that we are in. So, yes, I think that's very possible, but I don't have a specific date to share with you at this point. Andres Gluski : One thing I'd like to add, as we exit countries and as we're investing primarily in long-term contracted with investment grade off takers in renewables, or our U.S. utilities, which also with this transformation are moving more towards a transmission rate base. The quality of our cash flow continues to improve. So, it's not only a question of the metrics, which as Steve said are improving, but the quality of that cash flow or how it's seen by credit rating agencies is improving as well. So, on both sides, we feel very good about it. Steve Coughlin : Yes, and actually, I guess we'll keep going here because I have just that reminds me of another topic really here. Keep in mind that 80% of our debt is nonrecourse to the parent, and nearly all of that is amortizing investment grade rated subsidiary debt. So, it's a very high quality structure, and the agencies are seeing that. So, I think this, both the quantified metrics as I've mentioned as well as Andres said in the quality and looking at the debt structures, amortizing investment grade, it's a very, very robust, healthy structure. Antoine Aurimond : Got it. Yes, that makes sense guys. I guess on that note, with 85% of the CapEx going towards U.S. based businesses, where do you see the geographical mix trending towards the end of the time period? Steve Coughlin : End of the time period, like 2027 you're speaking? Antoine Aurimond : Yes, yes. Steve Coughlin : Okay. Look, I'd say we can I think there's a transformation in terms of, we're moving more towards U.S. dollar based investment grade off takers? So, yes, there's going to be heavier weighting towards the U.S. We do have opportunities to serve the same type of clients outside the U.S., with your investment grade dollar contracts, many times with the same, with the same client. So, if we serve hyperscalers in the U.S. and they want the same services, say, in Chile or in Mexico, then we can service. And that is a competitive advantage we have. Antoine Aurimond : Got it. Okay. That makes sense. And then, I guess, so you mentioned more sort of quality of megawatt versus this is just volume. We're going to do, what 3.6 gigs this year. How should we think about that number evolving? Assuming it's still going to increase, but I guess you mentioned more quality, right? So what's sort of like that number fast forward a couple years? Andres Gluski : Look, when I put it this way, we have a backlog of more than 12 gigawatts of signed PPAs we have to deliver. The majority of that will be within the period of by 2027. So, that gives you -- that that's a guaranteed build out that we have to do over the next three years. So, over time, assuming we're signing somewhere about 4.5, 5.5 gigawatts of new PPAs, those numbers have to converge. Unless, we grow the number of megawatt, PPAs that we're signing, and then it'll take a little bit more time to converge. But given -- that gives you sort of the run rate. Yes. We'll be 4 plus in coming years just from the backlog we have today, and expect that to grow over time past that period of time of 2027. Antoine Aurimond : Yes, that makes sense. Okay, great. Well, Andres, thank you so much. Andres Gluski : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Arcaro : Hey, good morning. Thank you. Maybe back on the utility side of things, it's great to see all that load growth opportunity coming. When do you think you'd have an opportunity to relook at the CapEx outlook? And then at a high level, how do you think about financing, upsides in the utility CapEx trajectory? Andres Gluski : Yes, hey, David. Good morning. So, as we are looking through the details of the timing of what we've recently signed, we'll flesh that out in our planning process, in the second-half of this year and bake that into our update of guidance for the beginning of next year. So, definitely, I would see in the long-term horizon that we have out there through '27, this will start to come into play in the capital plan, but our funding plan, I don't expect to change at all. We have really done well on our asset sale plan. We are two-thirds of the way through, after only 18 months on a five year plan. We've got a lot of flexibility there. We have partnership capital. So, there is no shortage of capital to invest in the utility growth here. It's a very attractive profile. And so, I see it becoming material, but I see it within the funding plan that we've already released through '27. David Arcaro : Got it. That's really helpful. Thanks for that. And then, just appreciate the comments on the supply chain outlook on the renewable side. I was just curious if I could get your sense, like how much line of sight do you have right now for that domestic supply in 2026, just as we think about navigating some of the tariffs on solar panels and battery storage? How are you feeling right now in terms of the line of sight for both of those supply chains? Andres Gluski : Well, we're feeling very good. And what I would say is, as we've mentioned, we have everything we need for this year, for 2024, and most of you know, vast majority of what we want for 2025. And then, we have signed agreement with domestic suppliers for starting in 2026. So, we feel very good about our ability to execute, deliver on our backlog in the U.S. And I would say that again, to date, we have not had to postpone or abandon any material project in our pipeline over the last five years. So, compared to what happened to supply chains with COVID, this is much more predictable. So, we feel very good about it. And basically, we're again going to make that switch to domestic supply starting in 2026. David Arcaro : Okay, great, understood. Thanks so much. Andres Gluski : Thank you. Steve Coughlin : Thanks, Dave. Operator : The next question comes from [Feeney Shea] (ph) with Barclays. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. Thanks very much for taking my question. So, I guess just first quickly on renewable execution, really great to see the guidance update in terms of EBITDA with tax attributes. I guess, could you maybe just talk about, given the backlog, the PPA signing cadence, the ability to bring projects online, how does your EBITDA excluding tax attribute would trend, I guess given where it is now year-to-date? Seems a little light, but just wanted to see how should we think about it going deeper into the year? Thanks. Steve Coughlin : Yes, good morning. Thanks. So, we do have a significant upside in our tax credits as I mentioned in my remarks, primarily that's driven by -- we're qualifying for more energy communities than originally anticipated. And we also have seen the valuation of our tax attributes, particularly through transfers, be valued at a higher level. What's important, as I've always emphasized is that these are cash. It's a very attractive profile. This is not just earnings, but it's cash coming in, which is a very early return of a significant amount of capital 30% up to 50%. So, we're really, really pleased with this upside. There are a few other upsides in EBITDA as well. So, we have had higher margins and higher dispatch in our gas business in the Dominican Republic. We've also continued to drive efficiency and productivity in our renewables and utilities businesses where we're very focused on growth. And in fact, growing those businesses is actually costing less than we anticipated. So, we see favorability in costs going through EBITDA this year. So, as you caught on, there has been an offset to that, and it's what I mentioned in my remarks, which is primarily the Columbia outage. It was a record amount of flooding and inflow that took the units out for all of the month of June and the first part of July. So, that unfortunately did offset and is a negative driver to EBITDA this year. And then, the other, and I think we mentioned this, we did have a very low wind resource in Brazil, more so in the first quarter, but that also had impacted our EBITDA this year. So, we have some offsets, but overall really pleased with the growth, the cash-driven growth, and that we continue to be even more efficient in our renewables and utilities growth machines. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. No, that's very helpful. I guess second, we noticed a comment on being able to bring the majority of the backlog online by 2027. I guess with this year, 2024, a targeted 3.6 gigawatts of new projects online, could you talk about the cadence on bringing new projects online -- just on this front, from this year through 2027, and what kind of lumpiness should we expect coming out of it? Andres Gluski : Yes, well, I think we've very much smoothed out the cadence of bringing projects online. At the beginning where we were ramping up very fast, in fact, last year we grew 100% the number of projects we're bringing online. So, this year we're able to manage it much better in the sense that it's almost about half is being done in the first-half, and the third quarter is going to be quite heavy as well. So, the cadence is going to be much more even throughout the year, as again, the growth rate is not 100% in one year, and obviously it will increase because again, we have to deliver 12.6% over the next three years. And so, most of that is it gets your numbers closer to four. So, we feel very good about the cadence. The biggest challenge was to ramp up 100%, and we did that, and we actually did all of our projects that we needed to get done last year on time. Unidentified Analyst : That's great. Really appreciate the colors from both. Thanks. Andres Gluski : Thank you. Steve Coughlin : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Michael Sullivan : Hey, good morning. Andres Gluski : Good morning, Michael. Michael Sullivan : Yes. Hey, Andres. A couple of questions, I know there's been some on the utility growth, but 50% plus load growth seems pretty eye-popping, and I'm just curious, like, how you're feeling about the supply side and ability to serve that. Like, for example, if I just look at, you have an AES Indiana, I don't know, I mean, there's like a planned conversion, and then a handful of renewables, and a lot of load growth coming. And then, obviously, in Ohio, you have less control over the supply, and we got a data point on that earlier this week. I guess, yes, just how explosive load growth, how are you feeling about the ability for generation to serve that in those two states? Andres Gluski : Yes. Look, that's a great question. This is going to be timed over the years, so it's not like all at once we have to deliver this in the next two years. So, it represents opportunities, definitely, for additional generation. And as I've been saying in my remarks a good part of that's going to come from renewables. Some of that increased demand may come from gas in some locations. So, definitely all of this is we feel it will get done, and the solution will be different in MISO or PJM, there will be differences, and it'll be different between the two utilities, in terms of one of them will involve more direct securing the generation itself. So, this will pan out, but it's a very good question, because yes, there is quite a high number of growth. It represents a great opportunity, but we wouldn't have said it if we didn't know how this could be served. Steve Coughlin : Yes. And I would just add to Andres' point in Indiana, where generation will be part of the solution keep in mind, we have multiple existing gas sites. So, we have the conversion at Petersburg, but we also have space for additional gas at Eagle Valley, at Harding Street, and at the Georgetown site. So, we are seeing the whole package being able to support datacenter growth there. In Ohio, of course, you mentioned that that's a distribution transmission. We have a very attractive area for datacenters, our service territory is quite large, a lot of available cheap land, very centrally located to fiber networks and data load, accessible water. So, it is a very appealing area. You can see from the -- I think you're referring to the PJM capacity auction, was quite high, demonstrating how significant demand has increased. But within PJM, I think our territory in Western Ohio is one of the most attractive areas, if not the most. Michael Sullivan : Yes, appreciate all that Color. Just to follow up on that last point this came up on some of your peers' calls, but any appetite from your standpoint to own regulated generation in Ohio, and what could that look like if it turns out that this can't be done through competitive markets? Andres Gluski : Yes, look, right now we have no appetite for generation in Ohio directly, but again, this represents opportunities for our renewables team. So, I would say stay tuned, but certainly we feel that these targets can be met, but again realize this is going to happen over time, as Steve had said in his comments. Michael Sullivan : Okay, great. And then, just one more, over to like the renewable side, I think since the last call we had the Brazil asset sale announcement, should we just think about that as fully embedded in your longer-term guidance, or is there like more additions than expected that are going to kind of backfill that in terms of the longer-term growth? Andres Gluski : No, that's already embedded in our guidance. Steve Coughlin : Yes, both this year and obviously the long-term Brazil exit is included in our numbers. Michael Sullivan : Great. Thank you. Andres Gluski : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Willard Grainger with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Willard Grainger : Hi. Good morning, everybody. Can you hear me? Andres Gluski : Yes. Good morning. Willard Grainger : Thanks for taking my question. Just maybe one, with the results of the PJM capacity auction coming out this week and just directionally higher power prices and projects coming out of the queue for next year, just how are you thinking about the cadence of your development pipeline? And any color on that would be super helpful. Thank you. Andres Gluski : Look, we have been saying, again, for several years that we were seeing shortages developing, just looking at the corporate demand, especially for renewables, and the ability of suppliers to ramp up to meet that demand. So, to some extent, what is happening in the market is what we expected. This is not going to make any difference to our plans. Again, we have contracts, we have sites, we've already locked in financing, et cetera. So, equipment prices, so it doesn't make any change to our plans. What it does, I think, signal is the value of our existing assets are going to go up as this shortages materialize. So, no effect in the, generally, in the shorter term, but in the longer term, it means that our assets are more valuable, and to some extent, it's what we've been planning for. So, it's not, of course, a specific option, we don't intend to be clairvoyant, but the general direction of the market that's unfolding is what we expected. Willard Grainger : I appreciate the color there. Most of my questions have been answered. Thank you. I'll get back in queue. Andres Gluski : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Please go ahead. Angie Storozynski : Thank you. So, I have lots of questions. So, first, maybe in this low interest rate environment, I'm just, I'm actually wondering. So, first, again, so does that actually help further boost the profitability of the projects that are yet to be built? Meaning, I mean, you have embedded certain assumptions about interest rates for like construction financing, for cost of debt, et cetera. So, do I get actually an incremental benefit now that we're seeing seemingly in a lower interest rate environment? Steve Coughlin : So, Angie, this is Steve. Good morning. So, look, we can't have it both ways. So, we have, as I've often talked about, a very low risk way of executing, which means we lock in almost all of our costs when we sign our PPAs, including hedging the long-term financing. So, for anything that we've signed, we're pretty much, we've baked in the price of that financing. But on a go-forward basis, look, lower interest rates are a good thing. They reduce the cost of new infrastructure, and so reduce the cost to the customer. So, overall, I think it's a further catalyst to demand and will help the whole sector. But we maintain a low risk structure in the way we execute. Andres Gluski : Obviously, we are highly contracted for future cash flows. So, lower interest rates means a lower discount rate. It means those cash flows are worth more. But the benefits on a sort of new contract basis will be for new contracts being signed, but not for the backlog. Angie Storozynski : Okay. So, then, changing topics, so those emission reduction targets or renewable power targets for hyperscalers, so obviously, here are those points that they're making, but I also see a number of these datacenters being developed on very coal-heavy grids, like Kentucky and Mississippi. I mean, and then the utilities that are on the other side of those transactions are basically saying that hyperscalers have eventual targets for emission reductions or carbon goals. But they're happy with just absorbing carbon-heavy power early on and then dealing with that carbon footprint later. So, how does that tie into this pitch that, in a sense, they have to just procure renewable power when, again, when we have these instances where they're just going for large quantities of available power, largely regardless of the carbon footprint? Andres Gluski : That's a great question. The way I would put it is their preference is renewable power. Right? So basically, you're talking about situations where they have no other alternative. So, they're not happy to suck up coal power from the grid. They basically will either have offsets with a VPP or by RECs, and quite frankly, in most cases, will require that renewables come online in the future. So, you have to put it like this is the last alternative. And so, obviously, if you have a datacenter, the most important thing is to have power. So, if you have no other alternative, you will not go for renewables. But they do have the renewables goals, and they do want that power to be as low carbon as possible. So, that's in terms of the demand. Now, let's look at the supply. If you look at what's in the interconnection queue, almost all of it is renewables, if you include batteries. So, the fact is what can get built, let's say, over the next five years, for sure, is going to be very heavily weighted towards renewables. As Steve mentioned, you have to combine these in the lowest carbon way possible. And if that means adding some gas plants, that will be done. But I think that the direction is clear, because I remember you on one call said that it's all going to be nuclear. And I kind of laughed, we both laughed and said, tell me what the price of an SMR is? How can we sign a PPA with embedding nuclear? Second of all, the regulatory hurdles to bringing on nuclear are still very significant. And we really don't have price certainty on it. So, renewables are going to be the bulk of that add-on. That's what they want. Again, yes, they will make deals for the short run if that's the only alternative. But it's not their preferred route. Angie Storozynski : No, I understand. But again, I obviously hear your point, yes. It's just that I'm wondering if renewable power is more like a source of basically carbon-free credit, or is it the source of energy? Because again, one could argue that the datacenters are basically using traditional thermal power for the supply of energy. And then, renewables, again, just offset the carbon footprint. And I'm not sure if that's actually bad or good. I'm debating it myself; it depends on my question. But I'm just again. Andres Gluski : Yes, I think it depends on the client, quite frankly. Some clients are much more stringent. Some clients actually want hourly-matched renewables. Some clients require additionality. Most of them require additionality. So, it's not just one-size-fits-all. I think the renewable standards will differ among them. But the direction is very clear. So, I don't see anybody sort of walking away from it at this point. And quite to the contrary, they're under pressure a lot because as they ramp up very significantly their datacenters and they're taking some power which is not renewable, their total carbon footprint goes up, and that's something that they've had to address. So, I would say that, yes, they're being pragmatic. But in terms of their goals and desires, those remain unchanged. And it's not uniform across all of them. It's not one-size-fits-all. Angie Storozynski : And then lastly, you have this page where you mention all of these additional transactions you've entered into with hyperscalers. So, is this co-location? Is it that this is sort of a set of assets located at least in the same sort of zone, like say in PJM or again, I'm just -- I'm not trying to be facetious here? But I'm just wondering, so is this power really directly feeding into these hyperscalers? Or is it just like being commingled with other power and it's, again, this sort of a carbon attribute as opposed to the energy? Steve Coughlin : Yes. So, I'll just add on to what Andre said. So, in almost all these cases, even you're talking about, Angie, not to say, yes, these are resulting in renewable PPAs, some cases in the same location or nearby locations, and others where they're focused on time to power going to the grid, but then also contracting for renewables perhaps further away. Most of what we are doing is I would say you would call more of a co-location regionally where we're supplying energy, including most of what we signed recently in the same grid and relatively close to the datacenter. So, that is by and large what we've seen most looking for. But when time to power is, of course, a priority, they're looking for alternatives. But the great thing is that in all cases, the additionality of renewables, whether it's direct or through RECs, is a top demand from these customers. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And then, lastly, so what happens, for example, with AES Ohio now that we have this pickup in capacity prices, most of the energy prices will follow. I mean, this is a wires only business. Are you concerned about the impact on electric bills and affordability and how that might suppress any sort of a T&D investment? Andres Gluski : I would say, look, first, we have the lowest rates in the state. So, we're starting off from the best position of anybody. Second, realize that our new additional growth, these are people who, again, the most important thing is to find a good location and to have the power and the other services that they need. So, that does not concern me in terms of, let's say, saying, well, this growth will not happen because the capacity prices went up. And as I've said before, to some extent, not this particular auction, not the extent of this one-time jump. But we had been expecting this. So, this is not something that's like out of left field and we have to scramble. We have been talking about, and you can hear from all our earnings calls, and we've been saying, look, there's going to be a shortage. And returns are going to improve over time. And so, directionally, this is very much what we expected. Angie Storozynski : Okay. Thank you. Thanks. Andres Gluski : All right. Thanks, Angie. Operator : The next question comes from Biju Perincheril with SIG. Please go ahead. Biju Perincheril : Yes, thanks for taking my question. A question on domestic content bonus, can you talk about when your projects might -- when you're targeting your projects to be eligible for that and maybe the implications for your returns? And if you could talk to separately the solar and storage projects, that would be great. And then, I have a follow-up. Andres Gluski : Okay. So, first, I'd say in terms of domestic content, in terms of our wind project, those already meet the criteria. Remember, it's a criteria based on the total cost of the project, the different components. In terms of solar panels, again, we expect to be meeting that by 2026. In terms of batteries, our main supplier is Fluence, and they should be meeting that, quite frankly, starting in 2025. So, all together we feel very good about meeting domestic content requirements. And then, there are other things like trackers, inverters, et cetera, that we've been working on as well. So, I think the team's done a very good job to combine the various assets such that they do meet the domestic content criteria. So, it's not one-size-fits-all. It's like what's available and if you have wind, it may be greater. If you have, say, solar panels, it may be lesser, but you put it together and the total meets it. So, we feel very good about that meeting the domestic content criteria. Steve Coughlin : And I would just add, keep in mind that the adder is across the entire capital cost of the project once you meet the threshold for the certain components that have to be domestically sourced. So, it's a 10% across not just those components, but the whole thing, which is really attractive. Andres Gluski : Yes. And we have no trouble meeting things like prevailing wage, et cetera. Steve Coughlin : Right. Andres Gluski : So again, the team's been working very hard on this, and we feel that we're very well positioned. Biju Perincheril : And is your expectation that you would be able to retain most of that or you would have to pass along that in terms of PPA pricing, just trying to understand the impact to your returns? Andres Gluski : Again, I think it's on a case-by-case basis. It depends on the demand supply in the particular market. So, -- Biju Perincheril : Okay. Andres Gluski : I think the best answer would be shared. And then, the vision of spoils will depend on the particular circumstances. Biju Perincheril : Got it. My follow-up was -- and we talked about a lot about sort of time to power. So, for renewables projects, can you talk about sort of the advantages or what you bring to the table specifically from a technology perspective? I think last quarter you sort of talked about DLR and batteries and that almost that or there are other solutions that you could bring to the table in terms of addressing that concern for your end customers. Andres Gluski : Yes, we really look at this sort of holistically and we tend to co-create with the client. Say, look, what do you want? And then we'll bring the technologies to bear. We don't come and say, look, we have this really neat widget. This is what you should buy. Now, given the new technologies I really do feel that we've been a leader in this. So, in everything from we did invent lithium ion -- the use of lithium-ion batteries for grid stability. We started that 14 years ago. We do have the biggest dynamic line rating project in the country. Fluence is doing a number of very innovative things to use batteries to be able to get more use out of existing transmission lines. We also were the first to do hourly matched 24/7 long-term contracts for hyperscaler clients. So, we continue to do that. And with Uplight, there's a number of VPP facilities that's well-managed -- energy management. And finally, I think Maximo is a great example of we are thinking about the future. One of the constraints, and I am sure you've heard it, was like labor force for building solar projects. And the fact is you have lift 65 pound today solar panels. In heavy heat the restrictions, crews can only work six hours for example. And it takes a very strong individual to be able to do this task at all. So, with Maximo this really allows us, first, to do it much more quickly. You can work three shifts even in terrible weather or hot weather conditions. In addition to that, we don't have to be particularly physically strong to do it. You have to be able to supervise the robot. So, Maximo is an example of how we would bring projects online faster and also with cost at damages as well. So, this is the first step. We are starting to use it. Next year, we will be ramping up. But after that, we can see a fleet Maximo out there, which would give us a competitive advantage. In other words, that we could bring -- we wouldn't say it's labor shortages, because we can hire a much broader universe of individuals. We can work in three shifts in all weather conditions. And we can quite frankly do it faster and better. So, that's another example. So, again, I think our AES Next and our views on technology have been really industry leading. Biju Perincheril : Okay. Thank you. Andres Gluski : Thank you. Operator : Those were the questions we have time for today. And so, I'll turn the call back to Susan for any closing remarks. Susan Harcourt : We thank everybody for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Thank you. And have a nice day. Operator : Thank you everyone for joining us today. This concludes our call. And you may now disconnect your lines.",

All lines will be muted during the presentation portion of the call with an opportunity for questions and answers at the end. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Susan Harcourt, Vice President of Investor Relations at AES Corporation. Susan, you may begin. Susan Harcourt : Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2024 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements, which are disclosed in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website along with the presentation. Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Coughlin, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will turn the call over to Andres. Andres Gluski : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2024 financial review call. We are pleased with our performance this year. And today, I will discuss our third quarter results, a robust growth we are seeing at our renewables and U.S. utility businesses and our progress towards our asset sales target. Beginning on Slide 3 with our third quarter results, which were generally in line with our expectations. Adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes was about 1.2 billion, adjusted EBITDA was 692 million and adjusted EPS was $0.71. We're on track to meet our 2024 financial objectives, including our expectation to be in the top half of our ranges for adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes and adjusted EPS. At the same time, we now expect adjusted EBITDA to be towards the low end of the guidance range for the year, primarily due to the one-time impact of extreme weather in Colombia and the lower margins in the Energy Infrastructure SBU. We are reaffirming our expected growth rate through 2027. Steve Coughlin, our CFO, will provide more detail on our financial performance and outlook. I'm also very pleased to report that since our last call in August, we have signed or been awarded 2.2 gigawatts of new contracts. This includes both long-term renewable PPAs and new data center load growth at our U.S. utilities. Moving to our Renewables business on Slide 4. Since our Q2 financial review call, we have added 1.3 gigawatts of new PPAs to our backlog, bringing our year-to-date total to 3.5 gigawatts, more than 70% of which is with corporate customers. As a reminder, last year, we set a target of signing 14 to 17 gigawatts of new PPAs from 2023 to 2025. And with 9.1 gigawatts signed or awarded since the beginning of last year, we're currently well on track to meet this objective. Since setting that goal, we also materially increased our project return targets and we are focused on prioritizing the most profitable PPAs. Moving to Slide 5 and our construction progress. Since our second quarter call in August, we have completed construction of an additional 1.2 gigawatts of new projects, bringing our year-to-date total to 2.8 gigawatts, which represents nearly 80% of the 3.6 gigawatts we expect to complete this year. On-time execution is one of our competitive advantages, and we believe we have the best supply chain management in the industry. In the U.S., we have 100% of our solar panels on site for those projects coming online this year and 84% in country for next year. For 2026, we have 100% of our solar panels either in country or contracted to be domestically manufactured, providing protection against potential changes in tariff policy. We have also been a first mover in securing domestically manufactured battery modules and cells. We expect our first battery energy storage project with domestic content to come online in the first half of 2026. Additionally, we have established a robust supply chain for wind through our strategic suppliers with domestic manufacturing. Regarding long lead time equipment, such as transformers, and high-voltage breakers, we have secured all of the supply for our backlog through 2027. Turning to Slide 6. We are very well positioned as a leading provider of renewable energy to data center companies, particularly in the U.S. and to large mining companies outside the U.S. These customers want to work with AES due to our track record of providing customized solutions that best serve their specific needs and delivering our projects on time and on budget. With the U.S. elections only a few days away, I have great confidence in the resilience of our business plan, regardless of the outcomes of the presidential and congressional elections. While we do not believe the elimination of the investment tax credit or production tax credit is likely, even in an extreme scenario, we're uniquely well positioned due to the following. First, regardless of federal policies, our corporate customers had a massive need for new power that can only be met by renewables over the next decade. McKinsey estimates that in the U.S. data centers alone could require an additional 450 terawatt hours through the end of the decade, which is equivalent to more than the annual electricity consumption of France. With these market dynamics, we will continue to sign high-return renewables PPAs with our core customers. Second, should there be any changes to U.S. tariff policy, we have a resilient supply chain, with a large majority of our project components manufactured domestically by 2026. Finally, our strategy of procuring our equipment at the time of the PPA signing provides clear Safe Harboring protection from potential changes in policy. Now turning to Slide 7. Over the last 12 months, we have embarked on the most ambitious investment program in the history of our U.S. utilities, which will improve reliability and quality of service for our customers, while maintaining some of the lowest rates in both states. AES Indiana and AES Ohio are now 2 of the fastest-growing U.S. utilities, with projected double-digit rate base growth through 2027 based on necessary investments for our customers. As you may recall, in the third quarter of last year, we received commission approval for a new regulatory structure for AES Ohio, providing for timely recovery of the majority of these investments. Similarly, earlier last year, we received commission approval for new rates at AES Indiana, our first rate case in seven years. We are starting to see the benefits from the $1.2 billion we have invested in both utilities so far this year, representing a year-over-year increase of investment of 60%. Excluding the onetime settlement benefit recognized in 2023, year-to-date EBITDA is up 25%. Turning to Slide 8. We're also seeing additional investment opportunities from data center growth in our service areas above and beyond our existing rate base projections. Our utilities have many natural advantages that are attractive to large technology companies, such as proximity to fiber networks and the presence of ample land and water. We have worked to proactively identify sites that are well positioned to support new data centers, capitalizing on our deep relationships with technology companies. At AES Indiana, we expect to have specific data center deals to announce in the coming months, as we've been in active negotiations with several parties. We recently launched an RFP for 3 gigawatts of new generation to support accelerating demand growth. From a regulatory perspective, we will use the results of this RFP to help inform our IRP submission next year. At AES Ohio, we have now signed agreements for new data center load growth of 2.1 gigawatts, including an incremental 900 megawatts, on top of the 1.2 gigawatts we already announced on our last call. On our fourth quarter call in February, we will provide a comprehensive update on how these agreements impact our long-term investment plan and rate based growth. Today, we can indicate that just what we've signed to date provides a nearly 30% increase in investment through the end of the decade over our current plan. Turning to Slide 9. In September, we announced the plan to sell down 30% of AES Ohio to CDPQ, our longtime partner in AES Indiana. This transaction builds upon our strong relationship with CDPQ and allow us for common ownership across our U.S. utilities. This partnership will support growth at AES Ohio, with CDPQ as a funding partner for increasing investments to support reliability and economic development. Finally, as you may have seen in our release, we are pleased to report that we have now closed the sale of our equity interest in AES Brazil. We are proud of the work our people have done in Brazil to expand beyond the 2.7 gigawatt hydro portfolio by adding 2.5 gigawatts of operating wind and solar, creating one of the largest renewable businesses in the country. With these two transactions, we have now signed or closed agreements for more than three quarter of our 3.5 billion asset sale proceeds target through 2027. We have also further simplified our portfolio and eliminated Brazilian weather, interest rate and currency risks. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Steve Coughlin. Steve Coughlin : Thank you, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our third quarter results and our 2024 guidance and parent capital allocation. Turning to Slide 11. Adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes was approximately 1.2 billion in the third quarter versus 1 billion a year ago. Although we realized 458 million of additional tax value year-over-year, renewables EBITDA was down 68 million, driven mostly by breaking drought conditions in South America. In addition, our energy infrastructure SBU was down 221 million largely due to expected items, which I'll cover in more detail on a later slide. Turning to Slide 12. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.71 versus $0.60 last year. Drivers were similar to those of adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes, but partially offset by higher parent interest due to growth investments as well as a higher adjusted tax rate. I'll cover the performance of our SBUs, or strategic business units, on the next four slides. Beginning with our Renewables SBU on Slide 13. Higher EBITDA with tax attributes was driven primarily by significant growth from new projects in the U.S., where we've added 3.3 gigawatts since Q3 2023, but was partially offset by significant declines at our Colombia and Brazil businesses. This year, we've experienced unprecedented weather volatility and a record-breaking drought in South America, driven by El Nino conditions. In June, a historic flooding event took out our 1 gigawatt Chivor facility in Colombia for nearly 2 months, followed by an extreme drought across the entire country. Also, you may recall that the third quarter of 2023 was extremely positive as we had better hydrology at our Chivor facility than the rest of the country, while spot prices were very high, yielding significant margins. As a result, Colombia is down 92 million versus the third quarter of last year and over 130 million year-to-date versus last year. In Brazil, the record drought and extremely low wind resource this year have also negatively impacted renewables in Q3 and year-to- date. While 2024 has been a difficult year due to the events in South America, we expect our renewables segment will grow significantly in 2025. Emerging La Nina conditions in the Pacific are expected to return the region to much better hydrology. While in the U.S., by the end of this year, we will have brought online a total of nearly 2 gigawatts of new capacity, which will drive a large increase in our Renewable segment EBITDA in 2025. Now turning to Slide 14. Lower adjusted PTC at our Utilities SBU was mostly driven by the prior year recovery of 39 million of purchase power costs at AES Ohio, included as part of the ESP IV settlement, as well as higher interest expense from new borrowings. This was offset by returns on new rate base investment in the U.S. as well as new rates implemented in Indiana in May. Adjusting for the onetime settlement last year, utilities adjusted PTC grew by 18% in the third quarter over prior year. Lower year-over-year Q3 EBITDA at our energy infrastructure SBU was primarily driven by nearly 200 million of expected declines at our Warrior Run Southland legacy businesses and the impact of several sell-downs, all of which were baked into our guidance. At Warrior Run, we recognized revenues from the accelerated monetization of the PPA beginning last year and ending in the second quarter of this year. Our legacy Southland assets benefited from energy margins earned in the prior year, which are no longer an opportunity in 2024 under the new extension monetization structure. In addition to these known drivers, we experienced lower margins at our new Southland combined-cycle asset U.S. due to much milder weather as well as extended outages at our TEG and TEP thermal plants in Mexico. Finally, higher EBITDA at our New Energy Technologies SBU reflects continued high growth and margin increases at Fluence. Now turning to our expectations on Slide 17. We are reaffirming our 2024 adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes guidance of 3.6 billion to 4 billion and adjusted EPS guidance of 1.87 to 1.97 and continue to expect to be in the top half of both ranges, driven in part by the success we've had securing higher tax value on our new projects. Our renewables team expects to capture over 200 million in tax value upside this year, which reduces our growth capital needs. EBITDA from renewables will be favorable in the fourth quarter from revenues earned on our PPAs, although we expect lower tax attributes in the fourth quarter as a result of the more balanced timing of renewable commissionings throughout the year. We also expect further growth in our U.S. utilities in Q4 as we continue to realize returns from our investment program. This will be offset by the negative impact from the prior year monetization of the Warrior Run PPA as well as incremental impact from asset sales, including AES Brazil. Drivers of adjusted EPS will be similar along with higher interest expense from growth capital, but benefiting from a lower adjusted tax rate. As a result of our efforts to spread renewables construction more evenly throughout the year, we've achieved more than 80% of our adjusted EPS guidance year-to-date, providing greater certainty around our 2024 financial objectives. Turning to Slide 18. We are also reaffirming our adjusted EBITDA guidance range of 2.6 billion to 2.9 billion. While I'm pleased with our execution this year on our growth objectives, several large drivers have impacted results, primarily at our legacy businesses, and we now expect to end the year towards the lower end of our guidance range. Milder weather compressed spark spreads in California resulting in lower margins at our South and combined cycle gas plants. The PPA for these assets contains an option that allows us to choose to sell the energy to the market in a given year. We previously chose to execute this option for 2024 and were therefore impacted by declining spark spreads that occurred later in the year. In Mexico, the unplanned outages, which have now been resolved, further impacted our results in the second and third quarter. In Colombia, the combination of the Q2 flood-related outage at Chivor and year-long record drought have negatively impacted us versus our guidance. Finally, inverter failures at several of our solar sites impacted availability versus our plan. These inverters were under warranty and are being remediated by the manufacturers. Despite the confluence of these onetime negative impacts, growth in U.S. renewables remains very strong, and our U.S. utilities have outperformed. We expect to continue this momentum and substantially increase EBITDA at both our renewables and utilities businesses in 2025. Now to our 2024 parent capital allocation plan on Slide 19. Sources reflect approximately $2.7 billion of total discretionary cash, including $1.1 billion of parent free cash flow, $950 million of hybrid debt that we issued in May and $650 million of proceeds from asset sales. Sale proceeds will be slightly lower than expected in 2024 due to timing, but we are well ahead of our $3.5 billion long- term target through 2027. On the right-hand side, you can see our planned use of capital. We will return approximately $500 million to shareholders this year, reflecting the previously announced 4% dividend increase. We also plan to invest $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion in new growth. In summary, we've continued to execute in the year-to-date and are well positioned for a strong finish to 2024. Our substantial renewables commissioning thus far give us greater line of sight toward achieving our earnings and cash targets, and our funding plan is largely complete. With $1.60 of adjusted EPS year-to-date, we have overachieved on our EPS growth with a clear path to landing at least in the upper half of our guidance range. As we look ahead to 2025, we see strong growth in our Renewables and Utility segments and continued execution of our decarbonization strategy in energy infrastructure. I look forward to providing additional detail around 2025 and beyond on our fourth quarter call. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres. Andres Gluski : Thank you, Steve. Before opening up the call for Q&A, I would like to summarize the highlights from today's call. We continue to execute well on our strategic priorities, including robust growth at our renewables and U.S. utility businesses. With 9.1 gigawatts of new PPAs signed or awarded in 2023 and year-to-date 2024, we are well on our way towards achieving our goal of 14 gigawatts to 17 gigawatts in 2023 through 2025. Regarding our construction program, we have added 2.8 gigawatts of new projects to our operating portfolio so far this year, and we're seeing the direct financial benefits in our adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes results. At our U.S. utilities, we have embarked on the most ambition investment program in their history, while signing agreements for 2.1 gigawatts of data center load growth, and we expect more in the coming months. We're also executing well on our asset sale and transformation program and we feel good about the remainder of 2024 and our long-term outlook, despite specific onetime weather-related events this year. Finally, I can confidently say that I believe no one is better positioned with large technology customers than AES. Energy market fundamentals and the strong demand we're seeing from our corporate customers give us great confidence in the resilience of our business plan, regardless of the outcomes of the upcoming U.S. elections. Operator, please open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will go to the line of Nick Campanella with Barclays. Nicholas Campanella : Good morning, thank you for taking my question. So, I wanted to just ask the comments about supply chain, you seem well positioned through 2026 with panels, etcetera. But you continue to construct 3.5 gigs for this year. You kind of outlined this previous target at the Analyst Day of 14 gig into 2025. So, we're getting closer up to '25 now. I just kind of check in and see how you feel progressing towards that target because it seems like it will be a pretty good step up into '25 here? And is that still attainable? Andres Gluski : Yes. Thanks for the question, Nick. I mean we feel very strong about our supply chain management and construction program. We are the only large renewables developer, which really hasn't had to abandon any large PPAs over the last 3, 4 years. So, what we've said, we have all the equipment we need this year. We have 84% of what we need for next year already in country. In the next month or so, we should have 100%. So, we feel very good about supply chain. We intend to concentrate on the big items like wind turbines, batteries, solar panels. But you also have inverters and you have transformers, which are long lead time and we feel very solid there. In addition, we've really had no problems with the workforce either because we have strategic relationships with EPC contractors so that they can move the crews from one project to the next. So, in answering your question, we feel very good about our construction program. And as you know, in 2023, we geared up 100%. So now we've been able to really smooth out our commissioning throughout the year, and we expect that in 2025 and 2026. Nicholas Campanella : All right. When I think about '25 again, obviously, you had, on a tax attribute basis, some one-timers that's kind of putting you a little lower here. And I sense the notable confidence on the growth into 2025. Can you just kind of quantify for us how much has really just returned to normal versus new EBITDA from renewables contributions? And then when you consider things like Brazil rolling off, do you still expect that renewable segment to grow year-over-year? Andres Gluski : Yes. Look, that's a very good question. We aren't giving guidance for 2025 at this time. But you're right, what you really have is mean reversion. You were really coming back to sort of more normal year. 2024 is a year that we've never had before, the sort of combination of extreme floods and extreme droughts in some of our service territories, largely driven by El Nino, coming into La Nina, we expect a return to normal. But you also correctly point out that we're maintaining all of our guidance and our long-term growth rates without Brazil. And so that means that the other sectors are picking up. So, to the extent that I can say we expect next year to be a more normal year and we've absorbed the sale of Brazil by increasing the growth rates, especially in U.S. renewables and U.S. utilities. Stephen Coughlin : Hi, Nick. It's Steve. I would just add. We've added and will add a total of 3 gigawatts of new renewables this year across the portfolio. So in addition to some more normalization, like La Nina coming in South America, the installed base is going to be significantly higher. So that's part of it. Renewables segment will grow significantly. And we also have outside the renewables, we have the utilities growth. So, with a full year of new rates in Indiana and continued rate base growth in Ohio. Nicholas Campanella : That makes sense. Thanks for answering my question and see you soon. Operator : Thank you, Nick. Our next question comes from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. David your line is now open. David Arcaro : Hi. Thanks so much. Good morning. I was wondering if you could elaborate on the outperformance you had in tax credits that you received. You referenced the $200 million higher-than-expected tax credits. Wondering what that stemmed from? And is there an opportunity for any more outperformance from here? Steve Coughlin : Dave, it's Steve. Definitely been a very good year. Look this is I would say, a very core competency for us and a key differentiator. We have I think the strongest tax team and renewables finance team there is. We're always looking to ensure that we maximize the tax value opportunity because what does that do? It reduces our capital requirements and also increases returns. So we've had a good year. We've done a number of things to ensure we qualify for bonuses, including places where there's a brownfield at or -- that allows us to qualify for the energy community. These are sites that were formerly, say, agricultural sites that had, had different materials, chemicals applied that allowed them to qualify. So we've done a lot of research and digging to justify adders where we can. So the other thing we're doing is all tax credits are not created equal. So because of our track record, people tend to come to us, expect -- and we get less of a discount and we get people very focused on working with us. So I would say monetizing through transfers, we've had a lot of success and transfers do tend to get recognized a little earlier than through the tax equity partnerships the credit value. So that's part of it as well. So I do see this as potential upside in the future. But of course, there's other things going on in the portfolio. We have to take a holistic look. And when we give guidance in '25, we'll update you guys on the entire portfolio. David Arcaro : Okay. Got it. That's helpful. Good to see just chipping away at the financing need with that. And then wondering if you could just touch on what renewable returns have been on the incremental projects that you've been signing, I guess, since raising your return expectations earlier in the year, how those return levels have been trending? Has there been continued momentum upwards? Andres Gluski : Well, we're seeing good returns from our projects, and we continue to see a market that values what we bring to our customers. So the answer to that is yes, that we continue to see -- our newer projects have been within that range towards the upper end of that range. So we feel very confident in the numbers that we've provided. David Arcaro : Okay got it. Appreciate it. Thanks so much. Andres Gluski : Thanks, David. Operator : Thank you, David. Our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Durgesh your line is open. Durgesh Chopra : Hi. Thank you. Good morning team thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to start off with the actual portfolio that is going to come online, not from the guidance. But in terms of the 2.8 gigawatts that's coming online this year, should we expect an uptick in that number as we go into 2025, the actual construction and getting projects online? Steve Coughlin : Yes. So this is Steve. So we'll give that guidance in February. So there's a number of moving pieces here. I would say the largest inflection will be beyond 2025, Durgesh. And so I expect renewables will be up somewhat. But I think based on what our COD schedules look like, the largest increases will come in '26 and '27. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. Okay. That's very helpful. That's just project timing. Okay. I have two other questions. First, on the hydrogen project with APD, there may have been some changes there, with the activist involvement with the company. Just can you update us what your plan is there? How much capital might you have invested to date? And what do we do with those gigawatts coming online? Just anything you can share there, that would be helpful. Andres Gluski : Sure. No, I appreciate the question. Look we have developed a very attractive 1.5 gigawatts of renewables which, as you know, there is a market that there's a shortage of large advanced renewable projects. So we have to see when 45 V comes out and other things, how much of this goes to hydrogen. But in any case, we have a very attractive asset there. Regarding outside of the states, I do see those projects likely going forward with Asian buyers stepping up and as partners in the early part of it. So we don't have a lot of money invested other than development money that we've done. However, I think that this is probably some of the best pipeline development that we've done because it's a particularly attractive asset. Durgesh Chopra : Got it, Andres. That's very helpful. And this is part of the backlog that you show, right? The -- I believe that number is 12 now. Is that the 1.5 gig that's included in the 12? Andres Gluski : No, no. We only include in our backlog, that's which is signed or awarded at the very final stage. We've never taken any project out of our backlog really. Nothing but -- so we wouldn't include it until we have a signed PPA. Durgesh Chopra : Understood. Okay. Very clear. And then one final question, sorry for dragging for this long. Steve, just on Moody's basis, earlier in the year, we've had conversations on the methodology -- potentially a methodology change at Moody's. Maybe just update us on where you stand on Moody's basis and the latest conversations you've had with the credit rating agency? Steve Coughlin : Sure, Durgesh. So the dialogue continues. I do expect that they will publish an update before year-end. I characterize the conversation continuing to be very constructive. I hate to see that our credit quality has indeed improved since they gave us the initial upgrade a few years back. What's the reality here is that we've been really transforming the portfolio, exiting markets, exiting carbon-intensive assets and rotating capital into long duration, U.S. dollar, high creditworthy counter-parties with no fuel exposure. So we have a very, very attractive profile. I think what they're working through since Moody's looks at AES on a consolidated basis, as opposed to S&P and Fitch, which is at the parent recourse level only, they're looking at the project finance structures and how they take account of those. Project finance is amortizing when we put debt on our projects, it amortizes over the life of the contract, so there's not an exposed levered tail there. So it's a low-risk structure. It's actually investment-grade-rated debt at the project level. So it's an attractive structure, it just hasn't fit within the well within the way they define their thresholds. So they're looking at that. They're also looking at how -- given our high growth, we carry a fairly material amount of construction debt, and that's not yet yielding. And so they're looking at that in ways to recognize that there is cash flow pending that's certain. And of course, this is nonrecourse debt as well that they're looking for adjustments along those lines as well. So I feel good about where we are. I feel really good about the conversations. And I do expect there'll be sharing their view here before the end of the year. Andres Gluski : I would add that if you think of the sort of the big picture overall, we continue to improve our credit profile. So we exited Brazil which was a substantial amount of our FX, certainly a big part of our foreign interest rate exposure and weather-related exposures we learned this year. So as we shut down coal plants or sell coal plants, you're changing 2-year PPAs with fuel risk for really long-term 20-year PPAs with no fuel risk with investment-grade off-takers in the U.S. So I feel very confident that any credit rating agency looking at overall company, where we are today versus where they gave us the ratings a year or 2 ago is a substantially better company. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. Really appreciate that color guys. Thank you. Andres Gluski : Thank you, Durgesh. Operator : Thank you, Durgesh. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies. Julien, your line is open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hi, good morning team. Thank you guys very much for the time. I appreciate it. Can you guys hear me? Andres Gluski : Yes, Julien very well. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Thanks you, Andres. Excellent. Well, actually since we're talking on the credit here, just to kick off on the nuance, just where do you see your metrics getting here and then more specifically, do you anticipate needing to upsize the asset sales or accelerate the asset sale target to kind of true up the balance sheet for any reason here? I get the Moody's methodology is in flux, but as you think about the asset sale piece of this, any observations to make on that front since we were focused on in the second year? Steve Coughlin : No, certainly. So I mean the credit metrics remain strong at the parent level. And actually, things that we've been doing are quite credit accretive. So some of the largest things we've done here now just closing on Brazil. Brazil, while it was generating a significant amount of EBITDA in the Renewable segment was actually producing very, very little cash. The business is highly levered and so the sale is actually very credit accretive. Similarly, with the Ohio sell-down when that closes next year, we're going to be paying down a tranche debt that's due at the holdco over 400 million. So we see that as also credit accretive and that we do, in fact, expect as a result of the transaction Ohio will be able to start paying dividends at least a year sooner than it otherwise would have. So we really feel good about the trajectory. I would expect at the end of this year, the parent level metrics will be between 22% and 23% which are well above the threshold of 20% that we have. And so yes, no, Julien, I think the asset sale program, we've had a lot of success, targeted 3.5. The universe is, in fact, bigger. So we'll see what makes sense going into the future. But I see us having a lot of runway here and that the credit metric has actually, in fact, been supported by the asset sale program. Andres Gluski : I'd like to sort of also say that we've always exceeded our asset sale program targets. And I would also say, quite frankly, I think we have a very good record of selling assets at good value. And what we've always been doing is maximizing the value for our shareholders and not just doing asset sales to hit a certain, let's say, megawatt or generation composition target. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: No. Fair enough, guys and thank you for that. Let me pivot real quickly to Palco here. We saw your peers to the north with NIPSCO. NiSource gave a very robust update. You guys are talking about 3 gigawatts of procurement activity. I know you guys already had a team's trajectory articulated at the Analyst Day last year, but I suspect that number is potentially meaningfully higher or potentially extend it out for meaningfully greater duration given A the 3 gigawatts and B the baseline of the rate base at Palco here. If you can speak a little bit to what your expectations on what total portion that you can own and how it impacts your financials here? Steve Coughlin : Okay. So look, I mean the rate case this year was resolved early settled early and approved early. So we had a significant increase over $70 million annual increase. And so that is driving a significant year-over-year. We'll have a full year of the new rates next year. And then as Andres described in his comments, we're once RFP for a lot of new generation in the utility. It will go into the integrated resource plan to be filed next year. And we're talking -- I think we said in the last call, 3 gigawatts total and that's increasing of data center load across the utilities, in addition to what we've already signed. So there's a -- I would say what we guided to is double-digit rate base growth across the utilities. It's going to be much higher than that. So we'll give more guidance in '25, Julien, but -- given what we're seeing the utility investment is going to increase, the returns are going to increase, the rate base will increase. And that's also part of why we also sold down Ohio because although we're selling down 30%, in fact, our net investment in the utilities is increasing. So this sell-down is allowing us to improve credit, get to earlier distributions from the utility, it will improve the credit quality in Ohio and it helps fund a much bigger investment program than even we anticipated a year ago. And our net investment, even though we're at 70% ownership in both utilities it\u2019s going to be even higher. So that's how I would look at it. And of course, in Indiana, it's an integrated utility. So not only do we have the load on the network, but we also have the generation piece to supply as well. So we see a lot of generation growth. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. So even the medium-term rate base growth CAGR, it could potentially be heading higher is what I'm hearing. But actually, you made allusion to one thing here, if I can just clarify. You'll be providing an updated outlook here on the fourth quarter. And I know that there's a lot of different things that are moving around in the plan. So as you guys have done historically, expect that kind of integrated update here on 4Q roll forward from the Analyst Day? Steve Coughlin : Yes, absolutely. Yes, we will update you on our long term for -- in February. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Wonderful. Excellent, guys. Thank you for the time. Appreciate it. Steve Coughlin : Thanks Julien. Operator : Thank you, Julien. Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Angie your line is open. Angie Storozynski : Thank you for taking my question. So I just wanted to focus on the renewable power EBITDA. So the one without credits for cash EBITDA, I would call it. So I'm looking at these results. I mean you will be basically flat since 2022. And now it looks like 2025 is going to be also like 620, 630 range. So I mean I understand that there are one-off items that weighed on this year's EBITDA which is going to be even lower than the number I just mentioned. So I mean there has to be some growth in that number. And I hear you, Steve, that there will be some in '26, '27, but you're making very substantial investments and we're not seeing growth in that cash renewable EBITDA. Now the reason I'm actually asking about it is because if you look at the parent free cash flow, parent distributions, I mean the vast majority of them come from energy infrastructure, but that's a segment that is shrinking. So I will have to rely on cash distributions from renewables very soon in order to hit the free cash flow expectations. So I'm just hoping that we can reconcile this. Thanks. Andres Gluski : Yes. First, we're not saying that the renewable EBITDA will grow substantially in 2025. And what you have is the fact that we're selling Brazil. That's 5 gigawatts, so -- which are having a little bit of apples and oranges here. So we're seeing the operating results from our renewable build, absolutely in where we think it should be. So it is -- there's a number of things going on here, Angie, that we can -- time will clarify. But I don't think that it's -- you can say that we're not getting the results from the investments that we're making. It's just moving. And then second, on the energy infrastructure, yes, I mean, we have a balanced portfolio. So we tend to have that event in one spot, offset by good events in the other. And this was a particular quarter where really a lot of things came together that normally don't come together. So normally, if you have conditions, you have more win. This time we had both. But what we also had was sort of all the years rain came in a very short period of time and damage of 1 gigawatt hydro, so I think we really did have sort of onetime events, and I think you're drawing sort of longer-term conclusions from that. I'll pass it to Steve. Steve Coughlin : Yes. I would just say, Angie, the only reason we're down year-over-year is because of the record drought. The only material reason is because of the record drought, primarily Colombia and to a degree, Brazil as well. So those conditions are known to be changing, moving to La Nina. Obviously, Brazil is out of the portfolio. So Colombia, we do expect returning to much more normal conditions next year. And don't forget, we also had an extremely high third quarter last year in Colombia, unusually high. So it makes the year-over-year comparison look more extreme. But what's the reality is the U.S. growth is significant. And so this year and even higher into next year, more than overcoming the loss of Brazil from the renewables segment. So the renewables growth will be very material this year. So we get that we're not on track at this point with the guidance for -- if you were to straight line the guidance, but we're picking up substantially into next year and are reaffirming through 2027 that 19% to 21% growth rate, and that's largely driven by all of this U.S. growth, which is taking off. As I said, we have added a total of 3 gigawatts of renewables across the across the year since Q3 of last year. We also will ultimately move Chile into the renewable segment where it belongs as we execute on our coal exit. So the cash from this renewable segment will grow accordingly as well, and the EBITDA will be on track with that growth rate. Angie Storozynski : Okay. So let me just push back the latter, meaning that Chile was supposed to be additive to the growth trajectory that you were showing at the Analyst Day. And now that we see the results, like year-over-year changes versus '23 results, you clearly point out that the second half of '23 had some big onetime benefits, which you could not have counted on during your '23 Analyst Day, and yet you came below your expectations, even the low end on renewables EBITDA for '23.So again, I mean I hear you that there is growth in the U.S. portfolio, which will benefit the EBITDA, but again, I mean, you had some big positives in the second half of '23, which you could not have expected when you were giving guidance on '23 on renewables and you came below expectations on renewables in '23 now. So why should I have conviction that the same is not going to true in future years? Andres Gluski : Well, we feel confident we're going to hit the long-range growth that we talked about. I mean it has to do with reaching critical mass on some of these things. And certainly, we can have onetime weather events. But I think the important thing is what returns are you actually seeing from the projects you're bringing online? What is the value of the PPAs you are signing? And as we move forward, it will be easier to make apples-and-apples comparisons as we have the same portfolio new year. Steve Coughlin : Yes. The other thing I would say, Angie, is referring to last year, we did end up having more of our commissionings very late in the year, in fact, most in December. So a little later than expected this year. We have substantially changed that trend. And so the renewable commissionings were much more really spread throughout the year. That's why we've already recognized $900 million of tax attributes already. So I think that's another reason that, that program has become more mature and spread throughout the year that we're seeing a better result, and that \u201823 was lower. Angie Storozynski : And just one other question. So I'm looking at your guidance here on the free cash flow for the parent for the year. It seems like you are expecting about $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion in distributions from subsidiary and you are at about 800, 880, I forget. So is this apples-to-apples, meaning that I am basically 50% of distributions, meaning that the fourth quarter will be the big catch-up on distributions? Steve Coughlin : Yes, but that's a normal trend. So that's -- we've been having that type of seasonality for a long time. And I would say, in most cases, the cash is already sitting there. It's based on the windows in time relative to our debt service that we're also allowed to pay dividends. So we have clear visibility into the remaining dividend. It's just a matter of timing at this point as to when they get released on the periodic twice a year, once a year in some cases. So I'm very, very confident in the distribution level. Angie Storozynski : Okay. Thank you. Steve Coughlin : Thank you, Angie. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research. Michael your line is now open. Michael Sullivan : Hi. Good morning. Steve Coughlin : Good morning, Michael. Michael Sullivan : Yes, just -- I know that kind of got passed through a bunch there on the last line of questions or commentary, I guess. Just to make it simple, like you keep talking about significant growth in '25. We obviously don't know what that means exactly. But you have this 5% to 7% EBITDA CAGR off of '23. When do you get inside of that within your plan? Steve Coughlin : Yes. So again, we'll give an update in February. The early years as we have been executing on the transformation and things like the Brazil exit, we'll have the Vietnam exit next year. We had the Warrior Run shutdown, and so that goes away. So that weighs on the early years, but the trajectory, as I said, there's more of an inflection point beyond next year, overall, getting through the 2027. Period. So what's happening is that the renewables will grow significantly next year. The utilities will grow significantly, catching back up to closer to that level of return of growth that we've been expecting, but the energy infrastructure shrinking has been a little more front-end loaded. And then the Brazil sale, obviously, is a headwind in renewables in the near term, but we're more -- significantly more than offsetting it next year. So that's how I would characterize it. We feel good about the growth rate overall, but it's influenced by how we execute on the transformation as well as the growth, and the transformation shows up in the shrinking of the energy infrastructure. So that's how I would characterize it. And so we'll give more in February. But again, I feel really good about the renewables and the utilities. And then the energy infrastructure we\u2019ll look at choices we have around how fast to continue the transformation and discuss that in February. Michael Sullivan : Okay. That's very helpful, Steve. And then I had 2 ones just on your resource additions. The first, just in terms of looking at new gas at the utility, do you see that in the RFP? Or is that not until the IRP? And do you have a good handle on how much you could look to be doing in gas? And then on the nonutility side, you all have traditionally been pretty solar heavy though I think you mentioned wind a few times just in terms of supply chain. But when I look at you and your peers, it doesn't seem like anyone's adding too much wind these days. So just curious what you're seeing on that front? Andres Gluski : Yes. On your first question, that would be really waiting for the IRP. So we certainly are looking at all options. So it will be likely a mix of renewables and some thermal, of course, batteries as well. Now regarding the second question in wind. Well, we were -- we had been building quite a lot of wind in Brazil. But a lot of the projects that we have in the pipeline have a considerable amount of wind. So if you think of the -- what's been known as sort of the green hydrogen project in Texas, 1.5 giga, that's primarily wind. So we'll have a more of a balance in the U.S. between wind and solar in future years. Michael Sullivan : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you, Michael. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Levine with Citi. Ryan your lines are open. Ryan Levine : Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. What is the time line for the $92 million Colombia impact to return to historic norms? And what is the risk to achieving this ramp at this stage in the year? Steve Coughlin : Yes. So conditions are already improving. The fourth quarter, in fact, I expect will be higher in Colombia than last year, Ryan. And all forecasts point to La Nina being highly probable over the next couple of months and lasting well into next year. So it's pretty much turning around now. Again, I expect the fourth quarter to be higher. And then throughout next year, I expect Colombia to be higher in this year overall. So Colombia has been -- and it was $92 million in the quarter alone. It's $130 million down year-to-date over prior year. So that is the single largest driver here, and it shows up in the Renewables segment. But the U.S. growth is doing hard work to offset that and significantly overcome overcomes it in the fourth quarter here and into next year. Andres Gluski : Yes. I would add we had a two-month outage. Yes. So the truth is that outage was at the worst possible time because if we hadn't had the outage because we had a rain, which was 25% higher than anything prior previously recorded, we could have used that water to very good results subsequently in the drought. So being out for two months is -- that's part of the recovery. Ryan Levine : Okay. So then by 2026, you should be back to a more normal performance? Steve Coughlin : No, '25, Ryan. So the conditions are already improving. We expect this quarter, fourth quarter to be higher than last year. And next year, in 2025, we expect normal to better hydrology from the La Nina. Ryan Levine : Okay. And then maybe switching gears, as you referenced in your prepared comments, impact to California spark spreads, are you looking to change your hedging strategy there? Or any color you could share around the outlook going forward for the Southland? Steve Coughlin : Yes. So just -- as a reminder, the Southland structure has a 20-year contract for capacity and energy. So we have a very known monetization stream. It is at our election annually a year in advance to decide whether we want to market the energy ourselves and hedge it or put it to the uptake or under the PPA. So for '24 we did previously decide, at the end of '22, to call the energy to us and to market it. Unfortunately, spark spreads changed significantly during the time that we made that decision, and we're executing on the hedge program. And so we had downtime this year. But still relative to the put value, still a good decision. And so we have made that decision also for 2025 that we will market the energy. We are over 95% hedged already at values well in excess of the put value. So it -- the market has changed. The market has compressed a lot due to better hydro conditions. What we've had is milder weather. There's been a lot more battery penetration in California. So the market value is not as high over the long term as it had been back in '22 when we first made that decision. But nonetheless, we see, overall, the strategy is -- has been increasing or has added over the put is just not as much as we expected when we gave the guidance, unfortunately. Ryan Levine : So, then as a follow-up, given that framework and your decisions for next year, is there any color around -- any direction of travel for that asset's performance for '25 given what your parties decided? Steve Coughlin : Yes. I would say, at this point, since we've already decided on '25, it is in excess of the put value. And we're already nearly 100% hedged, 95% hedged, as I said. So it the value is lower than it was in the original guidance, but still above had we taken a no-risk strategy. And then for 2026, we have not yet made that decision. And we'll have to here later in the fourth quarter, and we'll update you all on that later. And that will be based just upon what we see in the hedge market at the time relative to the put value. Ryan Levine : Thanks for taking my question. Operator : Thank you. Ryan. Our next question is from the line of Richard Sunderland with JPMorgan. Richard, your line is open. Richard Sunderland : Thanks for the time. I know you've covered a lot of ground. Just one quick cleanup. You've talked at various points about asset sale program and how you've thought about timing that and affecting that it sounds like more to come on year-end around that. But just curious how you're thinking about monetizing the new energy technologies investments? And if that's something that should fall within the planned period? Any thoughts there. Andres Gluski : When you think about the new energy technologies, look, what we've talked about is through 2027. And we approached these strategically. So what we've always said is that we will monetize these assets when we feel it's appropriate. And when we are out of long-term venture capitalist investors. So we'll monetize them at the right time when we don't think we're adding a lot of value. And we've already done some monetization and taking some money off the table. So it's been a very successful program. And I think there's a lot more value there than is being recognized by most of the parts. But what I would say is that so long as we add a lot of value, we'll stay in. However, we'll continue to opportunistically monetize. And certainly, we're well ahead of our plan for 2027. But as Steve mentioned, the universe is greater. So it would include some things from new energy technologies. Richard Sunderland : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you, Richard. There are no additional questions waiting at this time. So I'll turn the call back over to Susan Harcourt for closing remarks. Susan Harcourt : We thank everybody for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have. We look forward to seeing many of you at the EEI Financial Conference later this month. Thank you, and have a nice day. Operator : That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day.",
