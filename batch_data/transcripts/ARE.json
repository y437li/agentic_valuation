At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. And at this time I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Rhonda Chiger. Please go ahead. Rhonda Chiger : Thank you and good afternoon. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the Company\u2019s Form 10-K, Annual Report and other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Joel Marcus. Please go ahead. Joel Marcus : Thanks, Rhonda, and welcome everybody to the first quarter \u201814 conference call. With me today are Dean Shigenaga, Peter Moglia, Steve Richardson, Marc Binda, Andres Gavinet and Amanda Cashin. So my take on the first quarter really echoes our theme that was presented in Investor Day December \u201813 on our return to stable growth with increasing FFO per share growth NAV per share growth really a very clean quarter, strong [core], solid operating metrics and very positive external growth. As many of you have read Michael Porter of Harvard has spoken off I mean written off on about kind of the urban clusters. And it\u2019s useful to reflect that ARE has really chosen to focus the bulk of its efforts and the bulk of its precious capital in the leading urban innovation clusters with the focus on quality buildings locations and tenants in each of those submarkets, ultimately reaping higher value stronger and more durable rental streams in up and down cycles, deeper and more creditworthy tenant base, tenant rollovers more protective again on releasing stronger rental rates, more pricing power, lower cap rates and lesser CapEx. We also noted in our press release that we celebrated our 20th anniversary as a company and proud of our exceptional track record starting with the mere $19 million back in 1994 and addition them today a total market cap of $39 billion and we\u2019re probably been able to generate a return of about 579% from IPO through the end of the first quarter. On macro comments on the FDA, they have been actually 12 FDA new drug approvals through April 24 of this year and 50% were ARE plant tenants, very proud of that. There is part of the 2012 Drug Act, the new breakthrough designation court order if you will was introduced and there have been 48 breakthrough designations through May 05, \u201814 and Alexandria client tenants have 56% of those of breakthrough designations. And as you may know, those are promising drug candidates with clinical which remarkable -- in clinical development with remarkable clinical activity and this has really been unveil since the breakthrough designation was part of the prescription drug and user (inaudible) past in 2012 July which Alexandria actually helped grab the breakthrough designation provision, we are very proud of that. The Affordable Care Act which has been much in the news is forecast to have $25 million new insured lives by 2023 and we feel strong demand for innovative medical products. Large pharma now has 56% of its Phase 3 pipeline from external sources up from 38% of decade ago. So I think it\u2019s fair to say the attempt of the interaction with biotech in the heart of the urban clusters really continues unabated. And as many of you know much in the news these day pharma M&A has been front and center. I think it's fair to also say that the most successful based on past history of those who are driving biotech are acquired in the research units continue as independent competitive unit. This was really the formula Roche used with Genentech many, many years ago. Big pharma are increasingly focused on activities which benefit from scale and subcontract out so to speak a scientific work that doesn't primarily the biotech. If we move to operations and internal growth, Greater Boston and San Francisco primarily contributed the strong cash and GAAP rental rate increases and Steve will talk more about the detail there. First quarter leasing are 563,000 square feet, Greater Boston had 42%, San Francisco 19% and Maryland 14%. And a lot of smaller spaces were involved in these leases, so somewhat shorter duration lease terms could be or were evident. We feel very confident by the increasing GAAP leasing spread on Dean\u2019s adjusted guidance in that regard and occupancy across the regions continue to trend out best all time highs. Moving to external growth quickly, acquisition activity has been fairly substantial, year-to-date approaching $150 million primarily because of the strong sector demand from our growing and expanding tenants is really driving our need to find additional facilities to retrofit for their use, as their occupancy drives to all time high in existing assets. So, we're actually running at a space for some of our tenants, so we've had to look at opportunities to acquire and this is good for them and certainly good for us. And this is partly a consequence of accelerated FDA approvals and a heavily cash plus biotech sector. Steve will also detail the very strong large tenant demand which we're seeing in both Greater Boston and San Francisco. On the development front, we\u2019ve had good steady lease up progress ahead of our pro forma in New York City now approaching 70%, on 75/125 Binney. We're on target there, we have frequent dialogues and meetings with Ariad. We're making solid progress on the development of another Class A facility and this is science and technology close to market at 75/125. As all of you know Ariad has a contractual lease commitment for 99% of the project with contractual rent payments. Target rent commencement date is contractual and the [refinement] of the lease is March 22, 2015. We have some good news in Longwood, we expect to have another fourth floor leased by around the end of this quarter and activity is picking up in that regard. And on our 50/60 Binney corridor two 250,000 square foot untitled shovel ready buildings. We will shortly commence marketing with one of the buildings of 250,000 square feet given the very large market tenant demand and we are proceeding on our joint venture as well. In San Diego, we have very strong demand there Spectrum 1 is 40% preleased and 40% in negotiation. We are getting close singing the LOI with Alumina on their 150,000 square foot build-to-suit; same thing at campus point, a 120,000 square feet build-to-suit out of the 140 we\u2019ll build and we're also in build-to-suit negotiations with Spectrum 2 in San Diego. Dean will talk about the balance sheet in detail, but -- and confirm our land sales of about 145 to 245, we feel comfortable with that number. Our forward active pipeline is about 35 million and right behind that is another 95 million plus, maybe 50 on the horizon. So we\u2019ll keep you posted as our negotiations move forward. And we feel good about kind of where we\u2019ve guided the street. And then finally on the dividend, the company intends to continue with policy to share increasing cash flows with shareholders as we maintain a continuing low payout ratio of about 60%. So Peter? Peter Moglia : Thanks Joel. I'd like to run you guys through or highlight two notable life science trades that offer further proof that life science real estate in the core market is achieving cap rates at or near those of Class A office products. And in addition, I'd like to present some office trades that occurred in and around our submarket to offer additional context for your valuation of our operating portfolio. So first, I'd like to discuss the depending sale of Vertex headquarter research building in the Seaport Fan Pier submarket of Boston. Outside of HCP\u2019s purchase of this portfolio in 2007, this is the largest life science real estate transaction we have seen with the purchase price of $1.125 billion or a $1,022 per square foot. Vertex occupies a 100% of the 1.08 million square feet of lab and office based. The project also contains 50,000 square feet of retail phase and 740 parking spaces. Based upon publicly disclosed information and our own estimates, we believe the cap rate of this trade was in the low sixes, likely near 6.2 upon lease up the retail space. If the property had been located in Cambridge, we believe that cap rate would have been much lower. We know that there was at least one other bidder at that price point, but senior housing properties trust was the buyer. We had a very early look at this transaction through our relationship with the developer and the brokerage for marketing the property. And although the real estate is Class A and Vertex is a solid tenant, we are unsure if Fan Pier will be able to compete with Cambridge for life science Tennessee over the long-term as it is lacks the ecosystem Kendall Square. That ultimately led to our exit from the bidding process of that transaction. Outside of the cap rate compensation, we believe that this trade offers further evidence that life science real estate has become acceptable to a wider range of investors. This is [S&H's] first life science real estate investment and we know that a number of other bidders included pension fund advisors and a sovereign well fund. This trade also illustrates that lower cap rates are driving our price per square foot statistics as we also see in Kilroy\u2019s purchase of 401 Terry in Seattle for $106.1 million or $755 per square foot. 401 Terry is a laboratory office building located in the South Lake Union sub market that garnered considerable national attention with over 30 initial bidders. The building is relatively new and 100% leased to the institute for systems biology with moderate churn left on the lease. The cap rate on this transaction was 6.0% in considering that the tenant is not credit and a small research non-profit we believe it could have been lower. Like [to see in fewer] transaction this trade also offers further evidence to the widing audience for life science real estate. So before I hand it over to Steve, I wanted to briefly mention that 221 Main Street, a 379,000 square foot office building located in San Francisco South Financial District just north of Mission Bay traded at a 4.0% cap rate in April with a price per square foot of $725. Posting about the trade on the website [the registry] mentioned that many in the brokerage industry saw that cap rate is a little high for a large institutional quality building. We believe that as Mission Bay continues to be developed into an infield location it will become more and more integrated into SoMa and the financial district. The northern edge of Mission Bay is only mile away from 333 Brand Street where Drop Box recently signed a lease with a new high end rental rates for the area. The recently announced Warrior event center which will be located on 12 acres of land adjacent to our 401 499 Illinois property and in close proximity to 455 Mission Bay Boulevard will accelerate this integration by further enhancing Mission Bay as a 24X7 live, work, play environment and an unparalleled destination to recruit the [10 top talent]. So even if you apply the discount to our Mission Bay assets that are long-term leased to credit tenants such as Baird, Pfizer, Celgene, ECSS and The VA a cap rate in the high 4s to low 5s is justified. Lastly I\u2019d like to note that [SO Green] is selling 673 First Avenue in New York at a 4.7% cap rate. This was actually passed on to us by one of our coverage analysts who thought it would be applicable to our New York City assets given its location of half mile the north of the Alexandria Center for Life Science, it\u2019s [NOIE] score and medicine tenancy and that it is a leasehold interest. With our assets being long-term leased to credit tenants newly constructed fully amenitized and lacking in competitive product we\u2019ve argued for a rate lower than this. So with that I\u2019ll pass it over to Steve. Steve Richardson : Thank you Peter and good afternoon everyone. I\u2019d like to highlight two key points we may for Marc\u2019s truly underlying the theme of stable growth that Joel referred to earlier as it\u2019s well underway in our Gateway cities where we\u2019ve concentrated our significant capital allocation in Class A urban science and technology campuses. First we\u2019ll discuss the truly stellar performance of our core doing great part to our best in the business fully integrated regional teams. Second the ability of our teams to capture additional growth opportunities in the best locations such as the recent 500 Townsend Street acquisition in the SoMa district in San Francisco. First the quarter is performing very well as we reported cash and GAAP increases of 10.4% and 18.2% respectively this past quarter for renewals in releasing space. The business imperative for our investment grade tenants to commit the space is clearly evidenced by the truly stellar 96.6 occupancy rate for North American operating properties, up 240 bps from Q1, 2013 and just 292,000 square feet of rollovers remained to be resolved in 2014 or just 1.9% of our operating asset base. We are seeing tenants with 2015 rollovers also pursuing early renewals to ensure they secure a high quality space in these key clusters. Drilling down a little further in Alexandria\u2019s key innovation clusters, we can see the broad and strong business patterns outlined by Joel manifesting themselves in these healthy real estate indicators. In Cambridge, we are tracking demand of more than 2 million square feet in the market from both life science and tech users. We expect our mark-to-market on rollovers for the balance of the year to be in the 9% range on GAAP basis as [the switch are] concentrated in Cambridge where we think continue to drive rents in the high 50s to low 60s triple net for existing product. As we discussed earlier The Binney Street marketing and prospect discussions are continuing and we continue to see rents in the low 70s triple net for ground up project. Direct vacancy rates remained very healthy at 10.2% contributing to the overall sense of urgency in the market. Moving out to the West Coast, The San Francisco Bay area continues to experience exceptional demand as we have hit an all time high of 99.8% occupancy in the operating and development portfolio. We are tracking approximately 1 million square feet of life science demand and another 6.5 million square feet of tech demand and know two recent very substantial leases, hind in San Francisco with salesforce taking down 700,000 square feet and linked in another 400,000 square feet driving lease rates for new products in the mid 50s triple net. Mark-to-market for our Bay area 2014 rollovers is anticipated to be in the high teen with lease rates in the high 40s in Mission Bay to mid 30s in South San Francisco and low to mid 40s in the Stanford cluster. And market continues to tighten as vacancy rates drop to 100 basis points in Mission Bay and SoMa to a tenth of a percent of 6.4% respectively and 40 bps to 6.4% in South San Francisco. Moving to South, San Diego is also in a strong demand cycle with 800,000 square feet of requirements in the market and rents on Torrey Pines pushing through the $40 triple net mark for high-quality product an increase of nearly 10% from last year. UTC submarket has a direct vacancy rate of 6.4% and Torrey Pines vacancy rates of 10% will be dropping into the single-digit during the next quarter. We expect the mark-to-market on the modest rollover remaining in 2014 to also contribute to core growth. Seattle, Maryland and RTP will also provide mark-to-market gains in the range of 5.9% to flat to 20% respectively for 2014. Vacancy rates are tight in these markets as well with Seattle, South Lake Union at 4.9%, Rockville at 10%, excluding the HTS big block, Gaithersburg at 5.6% and RTP at 10%. Demand is very healthy again with almost 900,000 square feet in the Seattle science and tech sector; 220,000 square feet in Maryland; and another 125,000 square feet in RTP. Second is the 500 pounds industry parcel acquisition and strategic plan to perfect entitlement design and construct nearly 300,000 square feet of Class A science and tech space, is really a testament to each of the regional team\u2019s ability to execute on meaningful and compelling new growth opportunities. This location at the geographic intersection of Mission Bay and SOMA mirrors the deep industry intersection and really trend of collaboration and overlap in the science and technology innovation grounds. SoMa's extraordinarily demand cycle of 4.5 million square feet of absorption during the past three years is continuing as it added another 1.1 million square feet with the leases noted above. 500 Townsend with its best-in-class development team, this is a team that has decades of experience in wide ranging expertise delivering Class A high-quality projects in the city of San Francisco including driving the occupancy rate to 99.8% for its 1 million square foot Mission Bay cluster, is on track to create an iconic and state-of-the-art facility that captures the architecturally historic term that SoMa District at the absolute Gateway entry to San Francisco. With that, I'll turn it over to Dean. Dean Shigenaga :  Thanks Steve, Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everybody. I\u2019ve got three important topics to cover. First, I want to provide an update on our balance sheet which has positioned us to support stable per share earnings growth. Second, I want to provide key updates on important strategic capital related events for 2014. And lastly, I'll provide a summary of key drivers of our $0.05 growth and guidance for 2014 FFO per share and continued confidence in our ability to deliver solid growth and cash flows, net asset value and per share earnings in 2014 and beyond. Starting with the balance sheet update, we continue to focus on a strong and flexible balance sheet which will allow us to execute on our business strategy. We have almost $9 billion in gross assets, up 32% since we received our initial investment grade rating in 2011. We have over $1.3 billion in liquidity. We have only $20 million and $61 million of debt maturing in the remainder of 2014 and in 2015 respectively. We anticipate continued improvement overtime in net debt to adjusted EBITDA on a trailing 12 month basis driven by growth in EBITDA and near-term projected land sales. Our fixed charge coverage ratio continues to improve as our business benefits from the continued migration of high quality tenants into Class A collaborative science and technology campuses in urban innovation clusters. Our fixed charge coverage ratio has improved significantly to 3.3 times or up about 50% since our initial credit rating assessment. Our unhedged variable rate debt of 26% is currently at a level to support an opportunistic bond offering in 2014 without having to terminate swap contract as we use the proceeds from the offering to reduce outstanding variable rate bank debt. We expect unhedged variable rate debt to be approximately 11% as at year-end. Moving onto an important capital update for events for 2014; first with our bond offering, we remain focused on our strategy to maintain strong a flexible balance sheet, specifically our bond offering will focus on extending our maturity profile appropriately lettering maturities and refinancing outstanding bank debt. We have increased our targeted size of our bond offering by $150 million to a midpoint of $550 million and anticipate executing this offering in the near-term. The proceeds of this bond offering will be used to reduce $100 million our 2016 term loan with the remaining proceeds to reduce outstanding borrowings under our line of credit. We will continue to focus on execution of our strategy including further reductions in our 2016 term loan in 2015 and \u201816 issuing long-term bonds for growth capital and driving steady growth and FFO per share quarter-to-quarter and solid growth year-over-year. Briefly on land sales, our guidance for land sales in 2014 will focus on generating important capital from non-income producing assets for investment into high value development projects. Our land sales will also include the first part of important capital from a pragmatic JV partner with the sale of an interest in our near-term development opportunity in 50, 60 and 100 Binney located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. We are comfortable with the range of guidance for land sales of $145 million to $245 million or midpoint of $195 million for 2014 and anticipate providing more details over the next quarter or so. Lastly on guidance I want to touch on two important topics, leasing activity expectations for the remainder of the year and key drivers of the solid $0.05 increase in FFO per share guidance for 2014. We reported strong rental rate growth on lease renewals and releasing space for the first quarter of 18.2% and 10.4% on a cash basis. These stats were solid with 53% of the renewals and releasing of space related to leasing in Cambridge, Massachusetts with rental rate increases of over 18% and 12% on a cash basis. We remain on track to achieve solid rental rate growth on leasing activity for 2014 and remain optimistic that we\u2019ll hit the upper-end of the ranges for guidance for rental rate growth. We are pleased to announce a solid $0.05 increase at the midpoint of our FFO per share guidance for 2014 to a range of $4.70 to $4.80, the new midpoint of our guidance of $4.75 represents solid growth of approximately 8% over 2013. The increase in guidance reflects the continued execution of our business strategy to deliver solid and stable earnings growth and consisted of the following key drivers. The $0.02 increase from core operations driven by solid early renewals including a 130 square foot lease in Cambridge, a $0.01 increase from a value creation projects including lease up of an additional 25,000 square feet at 499 Illinois and Mission Bay now 98% leased and the renewal of the lease in the potential area of the San Francisco Bay market. A $0.01 increase from acquisitions and a $0.01 increase from various other items including updated assumptions for our bond offering in 2014. The delivery of certain pre-leased value creation projects in 2014 is anticipated to be primarily in mid to late 3Q. Our expectation for FFO per share through 2014 is in line with our goal and is expected to show steady growth of a penny per share each quarter going forward. In closing of my comments, we\u2019re pleased to be in a solid position with our balance sheet with continuing solid core operations and demand from high quality science and technology companies to drive stable growth in FFO per share and net asset value in 2014 and beyond. With that I\u2019ll turn it back to Joel Marcus. Joel Marcus : So operator if we could open it up for Q&A please. Operator : Yes. Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And we will take our first quarter today from Emmanuel Korchman with Citi. Please go ahead. Emmanuel Korchman - Citi: Hey guys, thanks for taking questions. Dean I will start with you, looking in your sub, you have a comment on the marketable securities balance underlying gains going up pretty significantly but it didn\u2019t look like the biotech index sort of went up same amount. Could you talk about what might be happening there is just sort of a single need and that\u2019s really outperforming or something else? Dean Shigenaga : Well, I think in the follow on to our comment Manny, last quarter we had touch briefly on the upside and the value of our investments been easily two times cost and most of those investments are healthy cost. So you did have couple of securities that driven primarily by one that have a significant increasing value during the quarter and that\u2019s reflected through equity, so just for everybody\u2019s note here that is not part of our P&L or income statement. But I think they\u2019re going to find us from time-to-time. You will see some pretty meaningful growth in the value that will reflect in our investment holdings on the balance sheet, primarily as privately held or private investments and private companies transferred into a public security and that really occurs into. One as the company is for public or two the required by a public filtrated company and we end up with a unrealized increased in valuation and that will allow us to have liquidity events overtime as we been fit providing a little bit of weather income from time-to-time. Emmanuel Korchman - Citi: Thanks guys for the explanation. Your exposure [India] went up in the quarter, previously had spoken about decreasing our exposure (inaudible) sort of idea? Joel Marcus : That\u2019s all FX. Emmanuel Korchman - Citi: But it looks like your number of assets went up unless I\u2019m mistaken? Joel Marcus : We brought one asset from redevelopment into operating that was fully vacant. Emmanuel Korchman - Citi: Got it. And then my final question, you guys have increased your debt issuance guidance within the notes, but you haven't increase any of your sort of sales guidance. And given the environment that Peter spoke about what assets trading at, pretty low cap rate. Have you thought about selling more stabilized properties and kind of rolling those into other lands and so other sort of the nominal properties, rather than selling out to the bonds markets? Joel Marcus : As you know, we did that in a couple of submarket during later part of 12 and early part of 13. And so that program is done and we're really focused more on the land sale opportunities we have to use together obviously with bonds to invest in both redevelopment and development projects. Emmanuel Korchman - Citi: Thanks Joel. Joel Marcus : Yes. Thank you. Operator : And we'll now go to Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, thank you. I know you guys touched on, in a couple of different ways on your JV prospects, I think you mentioned something like contributing land. Can you just clearly say, actually how we should be thinking about the JV going forward? And when we might see some activity and how? Joel Marcus : Well, I think if I said a quarter or two ago, we would hope to have a JV in place, where we would be a majority partner, hopefully sometime late second or early third quarter and it would be focused on 50, 60 Binney properties on potentially on a 100 Binney. And because the opportunity is there on leasing or pretty sizable the dollar amount of building that project out approach $750 million so it's ideal for a JV opportunity where we can also earn fees and promote et cetera. So, that's haven't changed from the discussion we have maybe at Investor Day or thereafter. Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  Okay. And then reading the press release, if I read it correctly, so you talked about it potentially taking about Executive Chairman role in several years, can you talk more about what that means and if that means maintaining the CEO spot or not? Joel Marcus :  Well, I think it\u2019s -- probably the easiest way to think about it is that under the new contract, I\u2019ll continue to as CEO of the company through December 31, 2016, beyond that the contract will be what it is, or it may change, I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019m focused on this quarter. Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. I mean I guess, if you are Executive Chairman, would you stay as CEO, those are distinct roles, you can\u2019t keep both? Joel Marcus :  I think they\u2019d two distinct roles. Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  Okay. Joel Marcus :  Yes. Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  And then finally, when you guys were quoting rents you talked a lot about tech rents and life science rents, so you -- as you think about your major markets; are you tempted to go more down the tech route at this point than life science and how are you thinking about that decision? Joel Marcus : Well, I think if you focus on kind of what we\u2019ve said and how the supplement is presented and the press release, we haven\u2019t changed our focus from these critical core urban science and technology clusters. I mean, if you walk into Mission Bay in our lobby, you\u2019ve been there many times, you will see I think the moniker is Alexandria Science and Technology Mission Bay Campus. And so we have focused primarily on the life science industry, but as Steve said, it\u2019s clear that the integration of information technology, engineering and other disciplines with life science continues unabated especially as we get into the digital healthcare age. And so these markets tend to melt together. So I think our focus won\u2019t change, we\u2019ll continue to focus on class A buildings, AAA locations urban campuses, innovation clusters. Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : But as you think about the rent growth, you're seeing in the market, is it rising faster for a traditional tech space or should I say tradition for modern tech space than it is for life science space? Peter Moglia :  Yes, I think the rate of increase is probably a bit higher in the technology sector than it is the life science sector. Having said that as we've seen healthy rental rate increases in Mission Bay and Cambridge and Seattle and San Diego as well, so they\u2019re all very healthy. Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  Okay, alright. Thank you. Joel Marcus :  Yes, thanks Jamie. Operator : And we'll now go to Sheila McGrath with Evercore. Sheila McGrath - Evercore: Yes, good afternoon. Joel, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the land acquisition in SoMa, how long you think it will take to entitle the pricing? And also you mentioned in your prepared comments that your recent acquisitions were tenant driven. I was just wondering if you're already in discussions with tenants at that site. Joel Marcus : Yes, I\u2019ll let Steve comment on that and then I\u2019ll come back to some other items on the acquisitions. Steve Richardson : Yes. Hi Sheila, it's Steve. On 500 towns and the entitlement process, we\u2019ve actually submitted to the city as of last Friday. So the development team is very experienced team. We were able to go ahead and execute on that quickly. We expect that to take anywhere from 12 to 18 months. And we are on that full time. And as far as the pricing, I think, as you think about the pricing and they were two other bidders as well who were essentially at that price point. Relative to the rental rate increases, it's very consistent with the pricing that we've seen in the past for other high profile parcels like this one. Joel Marcus :  And our internal team and our external team have ongoing discussions with potential tenants. So that actually even to some extent began in a shadow fashion before we closed on the transaction. I think if you look at the acquisitions, both in San Diego and in Greater Boston, those have primarily been driven by either existing tenants or new tenants who have come to us needing real estate solutions where we couldn\u2019t accommodate them with existing assets. So that as I said in my prepared remarks has driven some of the acquisition activity. And again it\u2019s driven a lot by FDA approvals and the biotech sector being among many of the companies being pretty plush with cash and ready to do expansion, undertake expansion. Sheila McGrath - Evercore: Okay. And Dean, a couple of quick questions, if you were in the bond market today 10 year debt, where do you think you could execute roughly? Joel Marcus :  Yes. Let me say while Dean is giving some thought to that. If you look at our last two bond deals, both were 10 year. If entire likely we wouldn\u2019t do a 10 year bond deal; we would look to latter maturities and we might have them maybe somewhat shorter and somewhat longer duration bonds as we are thinking about this. Sheila McGrath - Evercore: Okay. Dean Shigenaga :  Yes, I\u2019d have to say probably somewhere depending on treasuries and treasuries have been moving around quite a bit but call it somewhere in the low 4% range on 10 year line. Sheila McGrath - Evercore: Okay. And then Dean any comments on other income? It was a little bit higher than we had forecasted in the quarter. What was that? And if the quarter if you think you had any weather impact in the quarter? Dean Shigenaga : Two questions, Sheila; the first one regarding other income. I\u2019d say nothing really unusual in other income in the first quarter. I would say if you\u2019re thinking about a run rate, you should think about roughly $3 million a quarter or $12 million of other income for the year. And then as far as weather because it\u2019s been a key topic for earnings for REIT this quarter, we\u2019re no different in the sense that our portfolio was exposed to the weather conditions in the quarter across the country. But the benefit we have is we do have a tripe-net lease portfolio, so the tenants to bear across cold weather or heavy snow, as well as heating and cooling costs depending on hot or cold weather. So the true difference here is we had limited P&L exposure as a result of our tripe net portfolio. Sheila McGrath - Evercore: Okay, great. Thank you. Joel Marcus : Yes, thanks Sheila. Operator : Next is Steve Sakwa with ISI Group. Steve Sakwa - ISI Group : Thanks, good afternoon. I just wanted to I guess go back to the JV and just make sure Dean in the supplemental where you\u2019ve got the guidance staged, and you talked about the land and sales (inaudible) strategically venture your capital, just kind of roughly 150 to 250. Are basically all the sales actually tied up in this Binney project and if not, are there other assets that you\u2019ve got currently on the market today for sale? Joel Marcus : Yes, let me say before Dean takes you through that. No, they aren\u2019t all Binney. We\u2019ve got about $35 million having nothing to do with Binney that\u2019s in the forward part of the pipeline. And then Dean can give you some of the Binney stats. Dean Shigenaga : Yes, I think the way Steve to think about Binney is if you turn to the supplemental near the very back in our feature and near term projects, on page 31 of the supplemental, our book value on 50/60 and 100 Binney is roughly $286 million. So, our goal would be to bring in and still maintain a majority position, but sell an interest in the land for development there. And you can apply a factor, if you want to assume something just sort of something in the 45% range for a partner for the sake of doing some math. And we expect to be north of book as we sell an interest in that opportunity there. So Binney is an important component but nowhere near. We still have a number of transactions that Joel mentioned that are smaller that are moving through and we think we are going to close the gap here on the remaining that has not been discussed somewhere in the $60 million to $65 million range. And we will provide more details probably over the next quarter. Joel Marcus : Yes, so that means about 35 near term, you got another chunk for Binney and then a chunk that Dan just described that could in the [$50] million to $65 million range that\u2019s kind of behind Binney. So we hope to accomplish those during 2014. Steve Sakwa - ISI Group : And Joel, I can appreciate you\u2019re not giving too many details on the joint ventures negotiated, but are there -- I mean do you have kind of one partner that you are kind of actively going through right now or are you still kind of reporting partners or are there kind of issues that have come up in the discussions? Joel Marcus : No, we are negotiating with one partner. Steve Sakwa - ISI Group : Okay. And then I guess just on the bond deals, what -- I guess is there anything that kind of triggered sort of pushing this off? I know back at the Analyst Day you talked about setting conservative guidance having to deal effectively beginning of the year. And I can appreciate this deal might happen in the second quarter, but basically, it got pushed off six months. Is there anything specific that kind of pushed that back obviously with your benefit to weighted -- I'm sure you wouldn't have forecasted the [rates] going down per se. So, is there something that kind of drove that decision? Joel Marcus : Yes, I noted in your note that you had indicated that we said it would be early in the year. I don't know that we said that precisely, I think what we said is we had modeled that as if it would be earlier in the year, which would be the most conservative approach to it. But we have always thought about opportunistically taking advantage of that. We wanted to see -- we wanted to get through the tax square payoff, we've looked at the secured debt market, because we now have a huge amount of unencumbered NOI over 80%. So, we've been busy looking at that market as well. And I think we still see an opportunistic chance to do what we want to do that maybe outside the 10 -- within the 10 and outside the 10. So, I think that comment was we modeled it early, but we never committed to do it day 1 of 2014. I don't think that was ever on our mind. Steve Sakwa - ISI Group : Okay. And then I guess just lastly, Dean in terms of land sale gains, maybe I missed this in your comments. But would the land sale gains I guess to be related to the Binney sale or would they be separate sale. Dean Shigenaga : Well, we haven't given guidance on gains for land sales and any gains would be excluded from our core FFO numbers. But we do expect the assets that are currently under advanced negotiations would be sold at a modest gain or a small gain. Steve Sakwa - ISI Group : Okay, thanks. That's it. Joel Marcus : Yes, thanks Steve. Operator :  And we\u2019ll now go to Jeff Theiler with Green Street Advisors Kevin Tyler- Green Street Advisors :  Hi, it's Kevin Tyler here with Jeff. I had a question. There was an article about a potential Alexandria partnership with Rice University's BioScience Research Collaborative. I know you guys have had success with deals like this and recently with the NYU deal in New York at the Alexandria Center for Life Science but do you feel it's in a bit on your current appetite for University related transactions and more broadly for a larger footprint in Houston? Joel Marcus : Yes. I don\u2019t want to comment on future market but I would say that our focus is not so much on University related transaction. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s where we want to keep our focus, I think, one, because the NIH budget is muted. That our experience along clearly would indicate that those budgets are more difficult to take operating monies for rental payments and we've never historically tried to tie our business to that factor. I think our focus has always been on the science and technology, urban cluster, innovation, locations and we want those to be near major urban centers, multiple centers, with [spawn] technology, which provides clinical trial opportunities, etcetera. I mean, New York is the paradigm example; Longwood is another great example; obviously UCSF. But we wouldn't just go to some random city and do a one-off deal with the University. That's not what we do. It would be an integrated campus made up of quite a number of participants in the ecosystem and that\u2019s how we think about it. So if we do something in another location, it would be according to our strategic plan, not like a one-off deal. Kevin Tyler- Green Street Advisors : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks very much. I think the rest of our questions have been answered. Joel Marcus :  Thank you. Operator : And we'll now go to Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets : Yes, thanks. I'm not sure if you guys talked about this yet or not. But can you give us an update on the Ariad situation? I know the tenant has had some positive announcements, have there been any update about the amount of sub-lease space they want to do at 75, 125 if any? Joel Marcus :  Yes. I think I specifically indicated in my comments Mike that we have frequent dialogues and meetings with Ariad obviously because they are the tenant in our development project at 75, 125. I don't have any news or update on their sub-leasing activities, as they say it\u2019s the last [offer] they were interested in sub-leasing all over a portion of the smaller building and that\u2019s as far as we know that they have had discussions with a number of parties on that. But there is no update that I have specifically. Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. And then the increase at the bottom end of your guidance, was that largely due to the, I guess pushing back the bond offering in your model or pushing back in the year? Joel Marcus :  No, I think Dean went through the couple of items. He will just recap it for you quickly. Dean Shigenaga :  Yes, Mike not at all. The $0.05 growth as I stated earlier, I will rattle through quickly or $0.02 of that came from core related to early renewals. Primarily a large lease in Cambridge for 130,000 square feet $0.01 from value creation projects from lease up of additional space but we plan to deliver this year at 499 Illinois, $0.01 from acquisitions. And then $0.01 from various items included in that were updated assumptions for bond offering in 2014. Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets : Okay, great. Thank you, guys. Joel Marcus :  Yes. Thank you. Operator :  And next is Tom Catherwood with Cowen and Company. Tom Catherwood - Cowen and Company :  Yes thank you. Dean we look at this quarter pretty strong internal growth obviously, from a GAAP standpoint you are up 3.8% and your leasing spreads were strong as well. As we think about it though given the guidance raise and the strong performance we were somewhat surprised that you didn\u2019t raised the same store guidance for the full year. And we are wondering as we think through the rest of the year is growth going to moderate somewhat internally or is there something else kind of driving leaving the guide where it is? Dean Shigenaga :  No I think we are doing very well relative to our guidance on same store, both the traditional GAAP view as well as the cash view. I think our cash tax as an example of 43 for the quarter if you just compare it the midpoint, the midpoint of 46 for cash basis NOI growth still puts us tracking for a 5%. So I think that you are going to see collectively as we proceed through the year, same store performance move closer to the midpoint and I think there is room to be on the upper end relative to those midpoints both on GAAP and cash. Tom Catherwood - Cowen and Company :  Got you. And then Peter appreciate the outlook on some other recent sales. It looks like cap rates are coming down on some transactions, but when I look at you guys I mean you are trading at roughly at 6.4% implied cap rate and there seems to be some sort of a split between how public markets are viewing these and what they are going for in private transactions. I want to know your sense of kind of what\u2019s driving that split and if you still see cap rates compression to the rest of this year. Peter Moglia :  Well, I guess Tom what I could tell you is that any time that we enter into a transaction the core markets we\u2019re just seeing more and more people involved and that\u2019s just driving the pricing further and further. And then after something trades I get an email or a call from somebody looking to find out why did it trade so well and we talk it through and then it turns out to be a good on transaction and a good comp and we talked about here on the earnings call. I think this is the third quarter in a row I\u2019ve gone through some pretty good comps that would give people an idea of what makes you trade for it doesn\u2019t seem to translate when we look at our implied cap rate. So I can\u2019t be answer why there is a gap, I don\u2019t quite understand it. But I will, I certainly think that we\u2019re going to continue to see more and more investment in this sector and pricing will continue to be strong. Tom Catherwood - Cowen and Company : Got you. And then kind of building off of that, obviously a lot of interests in the sector not only assets, but in the kind of business itself; we\u2019ve seen the entrance of senior housing obviously with the Vertex deal into the now life science real-estate sector which Kilroy has purchased in Seattle as they\u2019re entering the sector as well. And obviously given the growth that you guys are seeing the value creation potential you\u2019re seeing it\u2019s kind of obvious that you would see more competition. But do you see some potential for that competition to even to some of your main areas or no someway affects your business strategy? Joel Marcus : Well, I think it\u2019s -- you have to distinguish between somebody owning a building or two or three or whatever even a big building like the Vertex building at Seaport Center versus somebody who has fully integrated teams in the ground who\u2019ve operated for 15 to 20 years and who have a kind of base second to none. So, I don\u2019t think we get much worried about the competition. As Peter said, we think it is absolutely fine the cap rates are being driven lower because that gives us a chance to create value whether I think say Peter likes to say rather than buying somebody else\u2019s value and that just happened, impacted us. We have great opportunities for growth, I mean we can literally double the size of the company on a square footage basis on the land we own we hope to monetize a lot of that in the near-term has been said and on board EBITDA, but it haven\u2019t stopped our growth in the core urban innovation centers. So I think just a acquisition or purchase doesn\u2019t make a life science real estate company that really can expand multiple markets. Tom Catherwood - Cowen and Company : Got you. Thanks. I appreciate it. Joel Marcus : Yes, my pleasure. Thank you. Operator : And we will go to Gabe Hilmoe with UBS. Gabe Hilmoe - UBS: Thanks. Joel, just on the redevelopment property as 225 second, I am just trying to get a sense of what the opportunity is there, is that a version play from office (inaudible) and I guess what type of use it can be? Joel Marcus : Yes, it\u2019s an existing tenant that house outgrown their space and asked us to find a specific solution for them. And so yes, it\u2019s a retrofit. Gabe Hilmoe - UBS: Okay. And then I guess on the move out, I mean I guess for you, I think (inaudible) to support is that a asset that something we can get put into, I guess for sell bucket or is that plan to redevelop that as well? Joel Marcus : Yes. We\u2019re actually already are in discussions with potential tenant to take that building, so we are advancing that more than likely going to be a retrofit into a lot building from currently a specialized use. Gabe Hilmoe - UBS: Okay. And then, I guess last from me, just going back to 500 pounds, any interest there or opportunity you bring in a capital partner or will that be all Alexandria 100%? Joel Marcus : Yes, it would be Alexandria 100%. Gabe Hilmoe - UBS: Okay, great. Thank you. Joel Marcus : Yes, thank you. Operator : And at this time, there is one name remaining on the roster. (Operator Instructions) And we'll now take a follow-up question from Emmanuel Korchman from Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Bilerman - Citi: Yes, it's Michael Bilerman with Manny. Good afternoon. Joel Marcus : Hi there. Michael Bilerman - Citi: Dean this 130,000 square foot large renewal, when did that become effective? Dean Shigenaga : All right, effective in the first week. Michael Bilerman - Citi: Right\u2026 Dean Shigenaga : Right. It was an original lease; there was a lease with an original lease end day in 2016. So, we have an opportunity to do an early renewal that started in the first quarter. Michael Bilerman - Citi: And just doing the math $0.02 is a $1.4 million. So, that's $11 a foot greater than what you would have expected, or what that's currently paying today In terms of a mark-up? Dean Shigenaga : There was a very healthy mark-up on this space on a cash basis. And because it's, it's got a good term on it, as we get a GAAP benefit increases well with the annual steps. Joel Marcus : So yes Michael, very solid step on rents. Michael Bilerman - Citi: Yes, it's a big building and it's a triple A location in the heart of Cambridge. Dean Shigenaga : Hopefully it doesn't surprise you because BHP had massive steps in their Bakken holdings as well this quarter. So, Michael Bilerman - Citi: No, I just, I thought it was relative to renewal that was schedule to expire not forgetting that was 16 that you brought forward because I was just thinking about the delta from what was already in guidance, but this is effectively a new lease that you have brought forward or renewal that you brought forward, we are able capture a significant amount of markup, but I was just trying to make sure that I understood the dynamics of what was in guidance versus now. Now I understood it. Joel Marcus : Yes. And the reason that happened actually is this was a tenant that\u2019s had some pretty great success recently. And they are nervous about the opportunities to expand in Cambridge or even maintain themselves and so they emerged and came to us to try to put this field together. So that\u2019s the market dynamic there Michael but as you know from the tour you guys took in January. Michael Bilerman - Citi:  Yes, is there other opportunities like that where you can bring and I know you are always aggressively leasing space, but is there other role that you can pull forward from future years that can help growth in the near term? Joel Marcus :  The answer is yes. Michael Bilerman - Citi:  And do you a number, I mean is there a certain size that you are working with right now in terms of transactions and leasing? I know the leasing volume at least in the quarter was lighter than what the history has been. Joel Marcus :  Yes, Jeff, because we have, so this is one of the smallest yearly rollovers I think in the history of company. The answer is yes, but I don\u2019t think we want to re-revise guidance here on this call, so we just stay tuned. Michael Bilerman - Citi: And then just last question, just as you think about sources and uses this year, you\u2019ve made the decision to fund the extra $100 million of your effective -- use of capital through acquisitions and development spend all with debt. And so I\u2019m just curious in your mind, you worked so hard to get the balance sheet in the position, at what point do we start thinking leverage neutral? Because as it stands right now and you think about sources and uses in the guidance, the extra 100 million completely get funded. So what point did you trigger? Joel Marcus :  Yes, I think that's not an accurate for trail. So maybe Dean, you want to comment on that. Dean Shigenaga : Michael, it\u2019s Dean here. I would say in my comments, what I would like everybody to remember is that we have tremendous EBITDA growth occurring in \u201814 and continuing into '15. And if you recall my prepared comments touching on the fact that trailing 12 net debt to adjusted EBITDA will continue over time to migrate lower at a lower leverage point over time. And this is going to be driven primarily by EBITDA growth. But in this year, we do have some projected land sales, which we feel very comfortable with and that will help as well. But the EBITDA growth continues beyond \u201814 and that's your primary driver of balance in it. And on a trailing 12 basis, you're going to see continued improvement in debt-to-EBITDA. So, we did have a spike on a current quarter annualize, but that has more to do with funding and relative timing. Michael Bilerman - Citi: Right. No, I -- and I understand that. But all that is to create EBITDA growth that you're pushing in selling the land and not [introducing] assets, all of that was known, right? What I'm just trying to think about is this quarter you've added a $100 million to your uses of capital. You're finding that 100 million irrespective of the EBITDA growth, irrespective of the land sales all of which was fully discussed at the Investor Day. Your funding the extra $100 million of capital spend with debt and all I was trying to think about is knowing the future uses of capital that will be on the [common], think about the San Francisco land use just bought, you\u2019ll have a development. At what point in your mind has it triggered the need for either to sell more assets given how robust the market is; Peter has talked a lot about that on the call or the need to raise common equity which I know you have talked about not wanting to do? And so that\u2019s and I am just trying to balance out a little bit. Joel Marcus :  Yes, I think you will see Michael and it\u2019s a really good question and we have to think about this everyday obviously because our target debt to EBITDA as we said, we want to migrate not only from broadly the [6.5] but hopefully over coming years lower. We clearly we will see we hope a larger amount of land sales this year than even the guidance has provided and we clearly would look at low yielding assets as a possibility for asset sales. And so, we have said we aren\u2019t going to raise common equity this year. So, I think that we expect the land sales to make up the majority of what we need to make sure we are in the target debt to EBITDA ranges. Michael Bilerman - Citi: Okay. So I guess any incremental potential new use you would have need to actually raise the asset sale guidance if next quarter we come around and you have another $15 million of opportunity at that point, we would actually see an increase? Joel Marcus :  Yes. And I don\u2019t want to -- I want to be really careful because this is a public call but I think you will see over the coming quarter, the $15 million that we spent on the tons of acquisitions will be fully covered as an example by a sale of an asset that we haven\u2019t commented about we are still negotiating but we believe we\u2019ve got a good probability of success. So I think in a sense it\u2019s a little bit of match funding. Michael Bilerman - Citi: Okay, thank you. Joel Marcus :  Yes. Thank you for the great question. Operator : And there are no other questions. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Joel Marcus for any additional or closing remarks. Joel Marcus : Thank you very much. We managed to keep it within the hour. And I appreciate and look forward to talking to you on the second quarter call. Thanks everybody. Operator : And thank you very much. That does conclude our conference for today. I\u2019d like to thank everyone for your participation. And have a great day.",

Baird Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors Sheila McGrath - Evercore Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets Michael Bilerman - Citi Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company Operator : Welcome to the Alexandria Real Estate Equities Incorporated Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jessica and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note today's conference is being recorded. And I will now turn the conference over to Rhonda Chiger. Ms. Chiger, you may begin. Rhonda Chiger : Thank you and good afternoon. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the Company's Form 10-K, Annual Report and other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Joel Marcus. Please go ahead. Joel Marcus : Thanks, Rhonda, and welcome everybody this second quarter call. With me today are Peter Moglia, Steve Richardson, and Dean Shigenaga. As all of you have seen from the press release we are pleased to have reported our second quarter FFO at 1.19 a share an increased in the mid point of our narrow 2014 guidance range $4.74 to $4.80. In the second quarter we have witnessed the very positive conversions of really more a key cyclical as well as structural factors which have resulted in exceptionally strong environment for our unique collaborative science and technology campuses in our great urban innovation clusters. And point we actually see exceptional opportunities, very strong tenant demand, increasing rents and occupancy and Alexandria is able to drive earnings and NAV growth therefore. We will at Investor Day in December set expectations for growth and 2015, as well as how our value added growth pipeline should evolve over the next two to three years. We will also detail our funding approach to our capital allocation in 2015 as the company continues to have the full range of capital sources available to it and if you look at -- take a glimpse of 2015 can be seen on page 50 of the supplement. Other macro comments let me share with you. We see continuing strong improvement in the life science industry\u2019s ecosystem participants to be urban core clusters, Peter will talk about this in a minute, presences, really tertiary cluster locations outside of the key core urban clusters are really declining even if you have got a second tier academic or university nearby and Pfizer sale of three facilities and they are moved to the heart of Cambridge which again Peter will comment on in detail in a moment, really are the prime example we have witnessed the strong biotech and pharma capital markets performance over the last many months and solid profitability and lots of cash. As you know, record high FDA approvals of new drugs are with us plus the FDA review time is down from about 23.8 months as the high and 20.08 to right now about 9.4 months in 2013. When combined with the new breakthrough therapies designation and the new way of precision targeted medicines to treat serious life threatening illnesses and diseases, it's pretty clear that we\u2019ve got substantial improvement over existing therapies and better targeting of medicines with fewer side effects. And of the six breakthrough therapies approved by the FDA, four Alexandria tenants Roche, Gilead, Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline. In the first half of 2014, in fact 143 digital health companies raised $2.3 billion or 168% growth over 2013, so another good factor. If you look at July 25, Wall Street Journal, they did a feature article on Google Acts, an important tenant of ours in the San Francisco Bay region and Google's so called New Moonshot project to human body was kind of elucidated in that article and simply stated it\u2019s focused on not being restricted to specific diseases, using new diagnostic tools to collect a broad range of samples using Google's massive computing power defined biomarkers and patterns and then using these biomarkers to detect diseases much earlier than we ever have. So we\u2019re on the new frontier of some pretty dramatic breakthroughs. We moved operations and internal growth and both Steve and Dean will talk about this. We\u2019re certainly beating our occupancy and rental rate increase estimates and we\u2019re in a strong environment given our urban locations. Leasing by region has been driving internal growth with 752,000 square feet lease this quarter, Greater Boston contributed 58%, San Francisco 13% and San Diego 12%. On external growth, you\u2019ve seen the disclosure on the acquisition of 500 Townsend Street in the SoMa district of San Francisco in April adjacent to our Mission Bay cluster and really over time we think integrated well will help driver our continued growth in the city of San Francisco where we\u2019ve successfully developed over 1 million square feet. I also direct your attention to page 27 of the supplement, our near term value add pipeline. It is the strongest it\u2019s ever been in key multiple and innovation clusters and we\u2019re very pleased about that. I'll leave the balance sheet comments this quarter to Dean and may be finish up on the dividend. The company will continue its policy to share increasingly strong cash flows with shareholders as we continue to maintain a low payout ratio, 61% this quarter. So I\u2019m going to turn it over to Peter for some comments. Peter Moglia :  Thanks Joel. Good afternoon. This quarter I would like to highlight one notable life science trade that provides some clarity on cap rates in Torrey Pines, San Diego, one of Alexandria's largest sub markets. Trades of office property in San Francisco and Manhattan that illustrate continuing cap rate compression in the core urban markets that Alexandria invests and operates in and then highlight the sale of life science portfolio by Pfizer in West Cambridge, not so much for its financial metrics but because it offers further support that the transition of large pharma and biotech companies from siloed research campuses to centers of innovation anchored by academic institutions is continuing. First, I would like to discuss the sale of 11099 North Torrey Pines Road by Angelo Gordon to HCP. The asset is 93% occupied, 92,479 square foot multi tenant laboratory office building on the northern age of the Torrey Pines sub market. There are about a dozen tenants in the facility that are mix of large company or institutional credit with some early stage private biotech. The sale price was $43,750,000 which would indicate a low 5% cap rate on in place income. But after allocating value to excess land, it was reported to be at 5.67%. So this is a solid building but we believe our portfolio in the submarket is of higher quality and therefore this comparable should support low 5% cap rates for our higher-end Torrey Pines properties such as our Nautilus and Spectrum projects. There were no other life science trades to report this quarter, but we would like to note that last week an article in the registry noted that 405 Howard Street in San Francisco is being acquired by Norges Bank Investment Management and TIAA-CREF for $350 million, which is estimated to be $750 per square foot at a cap rate of between 3% to 4%. This asset is located within 1.5 miles of our 500 towns in project in the Northern edge of our Mission Bay Holdings. We believe the Mission Bay is on course to be every bidders of a desirable location at SoMa and Financial District as it moves towards full build-out aided most recently by the announcement of the development of the new Golden State Warrior Stadium and supporting on the east (inaudible). Because of this we believe that cap rates for our Mission Bay assets closely resemble those of assets trading in SoMa in the Financial District. Adding the Mission Bay\u2019s terrific location and close SoMa and the Financial District is that our Mission Bay assets are relatively new within average age of 5.8 years and are leased to high quality tenants such as Pfizer, Celgene, UCSF, the VA and Baird under long-term leases. We\u2019d also like to note that both 5 Times Square and 920 Broadway traded in Manhattan at $1,361 and $1,091 per square foot respectively showing that investor appetite for New York City asset is not necessarily being governed by price per pound limitations. No cap rate was reported for 920 Broadway, but the 5 Times Square cap rate was reported at 4.35% and we\u2019d like to note that it was a lease hold transfer. Lastly, Pfizer the recently sold vacants asset 87 and 200 Cambridge Park Drive in West Cambridge total in 280,000 feet to King properties for a $192 per square foot. But what is really interesting about is that the sign a lease with MIT at 610 Main Street South in Kendall Square for 287 square feet and are rumored to be looking at taking another 140,000 square feet at MIT 610 Main Street North project. A June 15th article on Boston Globe references that Pfizer will consolidate employees from West Cambridge 620 Memorial Drive and some employees relocated from Groton, Connecticut to 610 Main. Although only 4.5 miles away from their new location, Pfizer decided to sell fully improved owned research assets in West Cambridge and materially increase their occupancy costs by leasing space in the heart of Kendall Square because to close the article. \u201cWhile the company has historically deployed the standard pharmaceutical industry model of in-house, siloed drug discovery, the new research center here has stolen a page from the collaborative culture and open architecture of the entrepreneurial startups that dot Kendall Square.\u201d They obviously see that the value of the location will vastly out way the increase in operational costs. Mikael Dolsten, Pfizer\u2019s President at Worldwide Research and Development was quoted saying that Pfizer\u2019s decision in consolidate in the Kendall Square location \u201cis a real recognition of our confidence in Cambridge, Mass., to become one of the leading hubs of biomedical research for us in the future\u201d. Examples like this continue to validate our cluster model and we expect more in the future as a result new product pipelines and lower overall cost of drug development. So with that, I'll pass it over to Steve. Steve Richardson : Good afternoon, everyone. At the outside, I'd like to first commend our best in class regional teams for truly exceptional operational performance year-to-date as we are hitting on all cylinders. The level of expertise and commitments excellence in all facet of the business is truly unique and unparalleled in the industry. Today I will touch on two key aspects of our operations in my remarks. One the ongoing and sustainable solid performance of our core. And two as we forecasted earlier this year the increasing actual and immanent deliveries from our significant $1.1 billion current value creation development pipeline. First the core is performing very well as we reported cash and GAAP increases of 6.3% and 13.6% year-to-date and 3% and 9.9% respectively this past quarter for renewals and re-leasing of space. We were seeing now more broadly as a trend the clear and compelling sense of urgency towards Alexandria\u2019s Class A facilities and operational teams and its irreplaceable cluster locations as tenants with 2015 and even in some cases with 2016 rollovers engaging our regional leadership teams to renew leases and lock down space. This is a very noteworthy and powerful market dynamic that we really haven\u2019t seen in decade or more. The stability provided by our Class A facilities and AAA, urban science and tech campuses populated by investment grade tenants with a high bar 96.9% occupancy rate for North American properties is also impressive as this is the second consecutive quarter we have been greater than 96.5% occupied. Probably no better metric for the return to stability seeing we outlined at our December 2013 investor meeting. The rollovers remaining to resolve in \u201814 are very manageable 150,958 square feet or just 1% of our operating base. We'll take a closer look at each of Alexandria's urban science and technology innovation clusters and a very positive fundamentals for each. In Cambridge we are seeing demand remaining very robust and increasing with more than 4.3 million square feet of demand from both life science and tech users. Our mark to market and rollovers for the balance of the year is targeted at 14% on a GAAP basis and the region has hit a high order mark of 98.5% occupancy. The clear scarcity of both large blocks and smaller blocks of space is maintaining rents at the new level of high 50s, low 60s triple net for existing product and Binney Street build-to-suit prospects are anticipating rents in the low 70s triple net. Direct office vacancy rates in East Cambridge remain very healthy at a low of 6.8% and lab vacancy rates remain unchanged at 10.7%. Although it's important to note that the bulk of this lab availability is really B quality leave behind space from Vertex and Pfizer and as such the desirable direct spaces are experiencing competition for multiple users creating a clear landlords market. Moving over The San Francisco Bay, it's also continuing its strong demand cycle as we're maintaining our strong occupancy level at 98.4% in the operating and development asset base. We're tracking 750,000 square feet of life science demand and a pretty amazing 7.9 million square feet of tech office demand. We recently note Google's leased out approximately 250,000 square feet and purchased of an adjacent 90,000 square foot building in the Selmont further contributing to lease rates for new product now in the mid 50s tripe net. The mark to market for 14 rollovers is anticipated to be nearly 14% with lease rates increasing again to the low 50s triple net Emission Bay mid 30s in South San Francisco which could pop if the Amgen's rumored plans to reoccupy space that they've had on the market for sub lease transpires and mid to upper 40s in the Stanford Cluster. The market overall continues to tighten and vacancy rates dropped 50 basis points in the lab market from Emission Data Palo Alto to 6.3%. Its sense of urgency is clearly evident with a December 2015 and December 2016 tenant completing the early renewals. Moving down to San Diego the core is performing very well with 97.2% occupancy, up 300 basis points from Q2, '13 and the market overall is similarly enjoying continued strong demand with 1.3 million square feet of life science requirement, up significantly from the 800,000 square feet earlier this year. A number of transactions along with Torrey Pines [Villas] had been recently completed in the range of $40 triple net for high quality product which is now becoming even more scarce as of the direct vacancies just 10% and our current negotiations are now reaching into the mid to upper 40s triple net. ETC's direct vacancy rate has dropped 30 bps to 6.1% and although the remaining roll over is small, it's important to note that mark-to-market will be significant as legacy lease expires. Finally Seattle will provide mark-to-market gains in the mid-teen range for the balance of 2014. Vacancy rates are also tight in the South Lake Union district to 4.9% and demand continues in Seattle with fresh requirements for nearly 500,000 square feet in the science and tech sector. Finally our current value creation development pipeline remains on track with an additional 110,000 square feet delivered in place into service during this past quarter. We're on track to deliver and place in service significant fully leased facilities during the second half of 2014 and Q1 \u201815. These projects represent the highest quality Class A assets in core urban science and technology innovation clusters, Cambridge, Manhattan, San Diego and San Francisco and are another testament to the acumen of our fully integrated regional teams. With that I\u2019ll hand it off to Dean. Dean Shigenaga : Thanks Steve, Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. I have four important topics to cover. First, I want to provide an update on our balance sheet including our recently highly successful issuance of unsecured notes; second, I\u2019ll provide a key update on land sales for the second half of this year; third, briefly touch on interest expense for the second quarter; and fourth, provide a summary of key drivers of growth and our guidance for 2014 FFO per share and confidence in our ability to deliver solid growth and cash flows, net asset value and FFO per share in 2014 and beyond from our Class A buildings and land parcels in AAA locations in urban innovation clusters. Starting with our bond offering, mid-July, we completed our third highly successful unsecured bond offering and increased the strength and flexibility of our balance sheet and capital structure. Our $700 million dual tranche offering focused on three primary goals, first transitioning variable rate bank debt to longer-term fixed rate unsecured bonds; second, prudent laddering of debt maturities; considering our outstanding bonds with maturity dates in 2022 and 2023; and greatly increasing flexibility as we focus on several high value build-to-suite development projects. Our bond offering consisted of $400 million of 2.75% 5.5 year unsecured notes due in 2020; $300 million of 4.5%, 15 year unsecured notes due in 2029; blending to a weighted average rate of 3.5% and a maturity of 9.6 years; and to put this pricing into context, a 10 year deal would probably have priced within interest rate around 4%. This highly successful transaction also extended our average maturity of outstanding debt to 6.3 years, up from 5.1 years; increased our liquidity to 1.8 billion; and reduced our unhedged variable rate debt to 7% of total debt. Briefly on a few other balance sheet matters. The high value projects that we have leased completed and delivered over the past several years along with delivery scheduled over the next few quarters really highlights the solid demand for our Class A assets urban innovation clusters. Our target net debt-to-EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 14 annualized is on track with our plan at 6.8 times and is relatively consistent with leverage at the beginning of the year of 6.6 times. Additionally, our target net debt-to-EBITDA of 6.5 times is expected to occur by the fourth quarter of \u201815. Non-income producing assets will decline to 15% by year-end and to 12% by March 31, 2015, primarily through the completion and delivery of pre-leased Class A development and redevelopment projects. These forecasts include a very conservative assumption for construction spend related to new projects and includes the land sales targeted for 2014. We also anticipate significant EBITDA growth for 2015 when compared to 2014 plus solid cash flows from operating activities after dividends, which in aggregate will provide funding for growth of approximately $500 million to $600 million in 2015. Briefly on our second topic on land sales for the second half of the year, we remain comfortable with our range of guidance for land sales of $145 million to $245 million for the full year \u201814 and approximately $115 million to $215 million to complete for the remainder of the year. Moving on to our third topic, I briefly want to touch on interest expense for the second quarter. Interest expense declined approximately $1.7 million, driven by a $2.4 million reduction in gross interest expense offset by an approximate $700,000 reduction in capitalization of interest. Gross interest expense declined primarily due to the repayment in January of \u201814 of a $209 million secured loan with an interest rate of 5.6%. Additionally, we had $200 million of notional and swap contracts that ended on March 31, 2014 which fixed LIBOR under the contracts at about 5%. Capitalization of interest was lower this quarter, primarily as a result of the weighted average interest rate required for capitalization at 3.41%, down from 3.88% as of the first quarter. This temporary dip in the interest rate was caused by the higher proportion of variable rate debt outstanding under our line of credit which obviously has a lower interest rate. This temporary decline in the rate was reversed in July upon completion of our bond offering when we repaid almost all of our outstanding borrowings under the line of credit. We expect the weighted average interest rate for capitalization of interest to return to its prior run rate in the range from 3.8% to 4% for the second half of \u201814. Lastly on guidance, our core operations continue to benefit from one of the REIT industry\u2019s highest quality tenant basis with about 52% of our total ABR from investment grade rated tenants. Additionally high quality science and technology entities continue to drive strong demand for our Class A assets in urban innovation clusters, including build-to-suit opportunities on our land parcels. This high quality demand drove continued improvement in our outlook for \u201814. Our guidance for FFO per share this year was increased $0.02 at the midpoint to a range from $4.74 to $4.80. We increased the range of our occupancy for year-end up to 97.2% after hitting the upper end of prior occupancy guidance well ahead of schedule. We also increased the range of guidance for same property NOI growth to a range from 3% to 5%, up 1% on both ends of the range. Additionally, we increased the ranges in rental rate increases on renewal and releasing a space to a range from 11% to 14% and a range for 4% to 6% on a cash basis, again both up 1% each on each end of the range. Most importantly, there is strong demand for our high quality buildings and urban innovation clusters will allow us to monetize several land parcels through development in the near term. As we look back to the Investor Day in December of \u201813, our outlook at that point for 2014 was very solid. Now that we're seven months through the year, it's very clear that demand for space in our buildings has meaningfully improved. Again this demand and the strength in the performance of our core operations drove the aggregate $0.07 today in our mid-point guidance for 2014 FFO per share.  The key drivers of this $0.07 growth and $0.04 from core operations, $0.01 from value creation deliveries earlier than anticipated, $0.01 from acquisitions and $0.01 from other items including our recent bond offering. In closing, we're very pleased to be in a solid position with our balance sheet, with continuing solid core operations and demand from high quality science and technology entities to drive stable growth in FFO per share and net asset value in 2014 and beyond. With that, I will turn it back to Joel. Joel Marcus :  Operator, we are open for Q&A. Operator :  Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we'll go first to Emmanuel Korchman with Citi. Emmanuel Korchman - Citi: Hey thanks guys. Dean, if we just look at your income statement there was no other income in the quarter typically you\u2019ve had some amount in there attributable at least to marketable security sales, could you just tell us what's going on there? Dean Shigenaga :  Yes, I\u2019d say we had a onetime decline in other income, typically you see other income in the $3 million to $4 million range and that's our outlook for the remainder of the year. In the quarter, we did have a lower amount of investment income. In fact there was a small loss in aggregate during the quarter. So that was the driver there. Emmanuel Korchman - Citi: And then given the strength you spoke about in terms of assets sort of next you're already selling it good cap rates have you thought about selling more core assets into that type of market rather than just the non-income producing ones? Dean Shigenaga :  We did go through recycling of assets that we wanted to lighten up the uncertain sub market in latter '12 and part of '13 and I think that was completed at the moment. We're reviewing things constantly and you may see us do some of that but at the moment we don\u2019t have anything particularly to target. Emmanuel Korchman - Citi: And then in terms of the non-core sales the 50, 60, 100 JV do you still plan to have them this year? Dean Shigenaga :  We\u2019re certainly on target to do that, yes. Emmanuel Korchman - Citi: Great. Thanks guys. Dean Shigenaga : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, thank you and good afternoon. So I guess sticking with the acquisition or the disposition market, can you talk a little bit more about the types of buyers you guys are seeing for your asset class? Peter Moglia : Hey Jamie, it\u2019s Peter Moglia. We\u2019ve seen a lot of domestic and foreign capital private equity, we\u2019ve had a lot of pension funds interested in both buying our product and in joint venturing with us. So I would say that pretty much every class of investor has looked or purchased life science product now, maybe that wasn\u2019t the case seven years ago but it is now. Joel Marcus : Yes and I think that\u2019s a good thing because it\u2019s become more mainstream and certainly cap rates have reflected that. Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And then in terms of operating, I mean a little bit of a differentiated asset class today operated in-house or there is just specialized third-parties or do you guys maybe more retain more today? Dean Shigenaga : I think most of the things that that have traded to those types of buyers have been long-term leases that they\u2019ll likely probably be distil maybe within 3 years or 4 years of those leases bring up. We haven\u2019t got to that point where someone needed to operate something yet. Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, all right. And then shifting to the development pipeline. Can you talk a little bit more about your leasing prospects at 3013 Science Park Road and then New York? Dean Shigenaga : Yes, I\u2019ll speak to New York, you want to talk about 3013. Joel Marcus : 3013, we\u2019ve got the existing building that we\u2019re saving the steel frame where we\u2019ve got that 25% lease to a top tier life science company in that market and then for the other project we actually have a letter of intent for the entire 65,000 or so square feet for a long-term lease there. So all we have left would be about three floors on building that development. Unidentified Company Representative : And then in New York we have four floors left and we have some reasonable activity on some of those floors, we don't have anything that\u2019s moved to the stage or LOI, but we're very active and we think that over the coming couple of months we'll have some news ahead of our internal projection. So I'd say stay tuned for that. Unidentified Company Representative : Yes and Jamie, let me just add from a modeling perspective or guidance only assumes we deliver about 60% of the project by the end of this year for the West Tower. Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. So I guess just thinking about leasing and just kind of interest in New York. I mean is there anything that\u2019s changed or is it just a bit, is just lower than expected. I guess that\u2019s an expected could you stay your environmental guidance but just how tenants are reacting to the market into those assets? Joel Marcus : Yes. I think we're ahead of our own internal expectations, so I think that's reflected I the model that Dean just referred to. But I think you have to look at New York, again always in New York we are building a cluster there and so there is not, if not like Cambridge or San Francisco. But I'm very comfortable, we've got a number of tenants book big pharma and one very interesting entity that a non-profit that are looking that good blocks of space and we'll see. But a great market and I say rental rates are exceeding what we hope to get. So we are I think feeling pretty good about that. Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then finally can you talk about your largest expirations in the bank half of the year and then in 2015? Steve Richardson :  Jamie its Steve. The expirations in \u201814 are really marginal as I was saying it\u2019s a 150,000 feet total just 1% of the asset base. I think the largest block is potentially in Maryland and it\u2019s probably about a third of that, otherwise it\u2019s pretty well distributed in either Cambridge, San Francisco really. Joel Marcus :  And then for 2015, it\u2019s really split among quite a number of regions, it\u2019s about 1.1 million square feet which generally takes us about two quarters lease or sometimes in even one quarter, the largest is a suburban property in out in Route 128 and we are well on our way to working on a retenanting plan, we have got one or two tenants already until. So we feel pretty good about that there is a some phase that could be significantly up in tech square and kind of varied by region. I don\u2019t know Steve any other color. Steve Richardson :  Yes, no. I think that\u2019s right, I mean as you look at these rolls that were in the core markets, tech square, San Francisco piece and UTC in town center, so the larger blocks in \u201815 are all in good core locations. Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And do have a sense to the mark to market on your expirations? Steve Richardson :  Yes certainly in \u201814 as we touched on as we closed the year out those are all on a GAAP basis in the mid-teens so I think that will continue to support the guidance we had at the beginning of the year. Dean Shigenaga : Yes. And I would expect directionally on the rental rate steps on our leasing activity for \u201815. I think generally speaking we're going to be in the general ranges of both GAAP and cash steps. So I think the performance we have this year or at least our expectation for 14 should continue in the \u201815. Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : You are saying the leasing spread should be about the same [you read box]? Dean Shigenaga : Yes. Joel Marcus : Yes, the leasing spreads. Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Leasing spread. Okay. Joel Marcus : So, the rental rate increases. Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Alright, great. I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Gabriel Hilmoe with ISI Group. Gabriel Hilmoe - ISI Group : Thanks. Just maybe following up on the last question little bit, but just on the expansion on the leasing spread guidance. Steve you talked a little bit about the current mark to market in a portfolio. But can you talk a little bit about where things are may tracking ahead of where you thought they would be maybe three or six months ago by market I guess? Steve Richardson : Yes Gabe, it's probably certainly Cambridge, San Francisco and San Diego. I think overall we just see demand has not only continued, but it's strengthened in those areas. People are locking down space, so that's enabling us to drive rents in those kind of key core market more so. So, it's probably those three markets that are driving it primarily. Gabriel Hilmoe - ISI Group : Okay. And then I realize this is still strong number, but it looks like the occupancy dipped a little bit in San Fran, anything in terms of the progress and back selling some of those smaller move ups in the quarter? Steve Richardson : Yes, we did have one legacy tenant at one of our mid Peninsula properties that ultimately rolled out, we're actually working with the Group right now. So, temporary dip from 99.9% occupancy there. Gabriel Hilmoe - ISI Group : Okay. And then maybe lastly for Joel, I may have missed this, but any update on the plans or progress for the North parcel in New York or is the West Tower still kind of the priority for the time being? Joel Marcus :  Well both, the West Tower is still the priority with four floors left and some under active discussions but no paper trading yet and then we are in discussions with the city on North parcel also. Gabriel Hilmoe - ISI Group : Any idea of any type of timing around that North parcel? Joel Marcus :  Too early to say at the moment. Gabriel Hilmoe - ISI Group : Okay, thank you. Joel Marcus : Yes, thank you. Operator :  We\u2019ll go next to Dave Rodgers with Robert W. Baird. David Rodgers - Robert W. Baird:  Yes, hey Joel. You\u2019re 97% leased, I think in the operating portfolio 77% leased or negotiated in the development portfolio. What should we expect to see coming out of the ground in terms of new development? I mean obviously you want to get more product out there. So may be give us a sense on starts may be over the next 6 months to 12 months and then also where those starts might be located, where do you feel the best about kind of getting new projects coming out of the ground? Joel Marcus :  Yes. I think in my prepared remarks I mentioned, if you go to page 27 of the supplement, this is kind of the best way to visualize it. And if you go to the second half, the bottom half of that spread sheet, if you will, we find a LOI with alumina working on finalizing the lease that will kick off here pretty quickly and that will be delivered next year. We're in active discussions with two significant tenants in 6 Davis Drive. And my guess is that will probably kick off here in the second half of the year. Townsend, Steve can give you a quick update on that. Steve Richardson :  Yes, we\u2019re making a real good progress. The team on the ground with advancing the entitlements there and perfecting the entitlements we\u2019re engaging tenants in the market in a series of serious conversation, so we\u2019re encouraged there as well. Joel Marcus : On Campus Point, we have a letter of intent with an existing tenant to take most of the new buildings and we expect that will move forward here over the next few months. Lake Union, we\u2019ve got two parcels in play with multiple users, don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to go but we think we have a shot, so I\u2019ll reserve judgment on kind of the starts there. And then on 50, 60 and 100 Binney we\u2019ve got a lot of activity on those parcels. David Rodgers - Robert W. Baird: Would you feel comfortable going just back on any of those or pre-leasing continues to be the focus? Joel Marcus : When you say any of those meaning any of these on the whole list or any\u2026 David Rodgers - Robert W. Baird: Yes, the bottom assets that don\u2019t have that pre-leasing component or the negotiating component already underway. Joel Marcus : It\u2019s possible. I think the strength of the Cambridge market might move us to go forward, we\u2019re already -- we're doing site work right now. So I\u2019d say stay tuned there. David Rodgers - Robert W. Baird: Okay. And I guess with 50, 60, and 100 Binney, maybe -- I don\u2019t know how much you can talk about this under your negotiations but talk about maybe the cost and return terms to you as you think about maybe what you might be giving up. And I guess the only reason I ask that is your cost of capital has come way down with the both of bond offering and where the stock is. And I think that returns continue to improve given where rents are going in those markets. So, you said you\u2019re still on track with that and certainly understand the capital component of it, but maybe can you talk about the cost and return terms to ARE? Joel Marcus : Yes, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ready to talk about anything. But I would say in general that we feel that we\u2019ve got as I used the term exceptional prospects. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever used that before in all the conference calls I\u2019ve done. So I think that with that clearly we want to keep our balance sheet in great shape. I think Dean\u2019s report on the balance sheet is very comforting. So for us to be able to look at exceptional prospects and have another major source of capital to do things that we want to do and are greater than clusters gives us I think a big advantage. And so I think that just stay tuned. But we don't we're -- I wouldn't characterize that as giving up anything, I think we're gaining something very valuable. And we can move a number of projects ahead much more quickly than maybe we could on our own. And we are focused on again keeping both the NAV growth moving and very importantly our earnings growth moving, not only this year but well into next year in \u201816. David Rodgers - Robert W. Baird: Great. Thank you. Joel Marcus :  Yes. Operator : We'll go next to Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors. Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors : Hi guys, good afternoon. Question for you, and this has been asked a little bit, but I just want to take a slightly different tack. Your \u201815 releasing spread sounds like will be similar to \u201814, but just curious given the strength of the tenant demand you're seeing, if you think that you might see at some point the cycle re-leasing spreads exceed what look to be the peak from last cycle about 8% on a cash basis, on an annual basis just curious. Yes, sorry go ahead. Dean Shigenaga : Michael, Dean Shigenaga here. Yes, I gave you some baseline assumptions to think about for \u201815, but no doubt the strength of our core markets and demand in the marketplace for quality space that exist in our asset base or space like the quality of our asset base I think is going to provide opportunities, both in capturing new requirements but also as we work through early renewals, I think we have an opportunity on both sides. But I guess I want to give you some baseline assumptions as we think well ahead of Investor Day six months from now or five months from now. Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And do you guys think about where your overall portfolio is on a mark to market basis today, sounded like the \u201815 expiries are in pretty good markets and is sort of inline with spreads you are seeing this year but just curious if the overall portfolio is maybe a little better than that or sort of similar to that sort of up 5% on a cash basis. Dean Shigenaga :  Yes, I think on a cash basis, we are probably in that 2% to 3% and an 8% on a GAAP basis on a mark to market overall operating portfolio. Keep in mind, you have got long-term leases, you have annual cumulatively compounding increases with some pretty great tenants. So I think it\u2019s important to really look at the GAAP metric as well. Joel Marcus :  And we are trying to be conservative so that it makes sense. Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors : Got you. And then Joel or Dean, just curious how much development you are comfortable at carrying at any one time as a percent of total assets, just curious how you think about that? And obviously the list of projects you have going is pretty appealing at this but just curious how you think about it from an aggregate standpoint? Joel Marcus :  Yes I can ask Dean to comment from an aggregate. I think though the most important thing is that we try to cover the vast majority of our capital spend with both free cash flow and the generation of EBITDA from projects. And so to the extent that we can do that, Dean laid out I think a pretty nice slide on that. Dean Shigenaga :  Page 44 has a really nice depiction of\u2026 Joel Marcus :  So I think that\u2019s how we think about that. At the same time, we are bringing down non-income producing assets as a percentage of total gross assets, funding our construction spend, really our spend on growth is really and this is just our own credit capital plan nothing is definitive yet till we give for sure guidance in December, but this is I think a handy way to think about it. Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors : Okay. Thanks for pointing that out. And last one from me on that, debt to EBITDA target of 6.5 times. First, thanks for providing that, none other companies are thoughtful enough to do that, so thanks for that. But my question is, just curious is that your long-term target or is that more or just sort of where are you going to end up in the near term? And then also just curious how you arrived at that target as opposed to something else? Dean Shigenaga : Well, I think 6.5 times has been a bogie for ours for some time. So it is near term by the end of \u201815. And I think we'll always look for opportunities as we grow our EBITDA to possibly improve that. But for now that's our bogie. And really most of our EBITDA growth is providing the opportunity to manage the growth of our business without moving leverage in the wrong direction. Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Sheila McGrath with Evercore Sheila McGrath - Evercore: Yes, good afternoon. Joel, I noticed that Longwood had a little bit of pickup in leasing in the quarter. I just wondered if the level of tenant interest is continuing there? And how the velocity of leasing you expect? Joel Marcus : Yes, as I said. Thanks Sheila for the question. As I said last time and we've made comments on and maybe other places, of all the markets and the all the segments, this is the one that I think is most disappointing in a sense when we \u2013 they had the current vacancy rate in Longwood it's about 1%. But I think there has been this weird overhang of NIH not increasing the budget it was kind of little bit under the Budget Act from congress and then it got restore and it's kind of current run rate is about 30 plus billion dollars although I note that I think Tom Parkins I think Iowa just introduced the bill in Congress to raise it over, I think a five year period to 46 billion I don't know where that's going to go but that would be good. But I think the institution has got a little bit frightened, they're also a little bit nervous about where Obama Care is headed, because nobody really has been through that process. So I think their operating spend has been more conservatively managed while their capital spend certainly is going forward. So we've had a lot of interest in buying floors for condominiums. We've kind of put that off for the moment. We may return to that at some point if we decide to. But we do have some -- we do have current demand for two floors which we hope to resolve over the coming may be quarter or so. And then beyond that we got active discussions with the bunch of people but nothing to show up on the scoreboard yet. There is some pharma interest in Longwood although -- although the main pharma interest does tend to be as Peter pointed out Kendall Square. So we'll see what happens. But as they say that's the one area with such a low vacancy rate our view, back a couple of years ago when we proceeded on this process. We thought this would be much more efficiently leased than it is, but we're still comfortable. We don't deliver till the end of the year. And I think we'll be well over 50% at that point which will meet our internal projections. And we hope our rates stay at what they are pro forma wise which today have been the case. So we'll see where that goes keep in mind remind we have a 27.5% interest in that joint venture. Sheila McGrath - Evercore:  Then just on 50, 60, and 100 Binney it sounds like you\u2019re seeing a lot of interest and given where you have the NOI coming online in 2016. Is the interest that you\u2019re seeing more life science or is a mix of tax as well? Joel Marcus : It tends to be very heavy life science at the moment. Sheila McGrath - Evercore: Okay. And then last question Steve, you mentioned in your remarks that the Amgen submarkets base might come off the market. Could you just give a little more detail and how much space there is and maybe the impact on vacancy potentially? Steve Richardson : Sure Sheila. The vacancy overall is probably right around 10% in the market although if you segment that and take smaller blocks of space you\u2019re probably at just 3% to 4% so that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been able to be very successful with our projects there. In the smaller blocks over the past several quarters, these couple of blocks you\u2019ve got probably roughly 0.25 million square feet and it looks like they may take back one if not both of those blocks of space there. So that\u2019s been something they\u2019ve talked about much more intently. I think as they look at 1000 Oaks recruiting versus South San Francisco. So we\u2019re hopeful that conversation is becoming more serious than we occupying that space. That would drop the overall vacancy rate, you probably down total that would cut it in half really be at 3%, 4%, 5%. Dean Shigenaga : Yes, I\u2019d make one footnote comment to that Amgen who I used to deal with pretty regularly and we have pretty close relationships with, approached us recently and we did a bit of a strategic planning session with them on innovation and it was pretty interesting because I think Amgen similar one or two of the big pharma is probably hasn't been historically as innovative as Genentech was. Genentech ended up spending out 75 to 100 companies over its lifespan, before it finally got acquire by Roche, Amgen is just starting to do that, but historically hasn't. So I think what Steve says make on the provision they really thinking about becoming a much more innovative company, they've been highly, highly successful. But it hasn't generate a lot of spin-off companies and out licensing of technology, which I think they are now under new leadership really beginning to examine pretty carefully. Sheila McGrath - Evercore: Okay. Thank you. Joel Marcus : Yes. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets : If you guys give us some color on monthly for 124 Terry Avenue and 9950 Medical Center Drive. It looks like you moved those two projects out of the near-term by accretion pipeline and moved them into the future one. Can you kind of explain what changed there? Joel Marcus : Sure. Maryland I think the simple fact is we don't see the demand that would really push us to do development there. We think there is adequate available space there through we have some space obviously and others have a bunch space both local and national folks. So I think that was put down and then although we have been approached a number of times by the NIH, but we'll see where that goes up for some new space. And then 124 Terry, we think that's probably likely to go resi and so that's probably something we wouldn't do ourselves. So stay tuned we might years sell the parcel or joint venture the parcel something like that. Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. How is I guess, how long does it take for 50 and 60, 100 Binney Street to do development how improved are those land sites and if you start the construction let\u2019s say beginning of \u201815 were to get done by \u201816? Joel Marcus :  Yes there is several ready and there is something in the range of about\u2026 Steve Richardson :  30 months construction timeframes. Joel Marcus :  Yes. Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets : Alright and then do you expect to start 50 and 60 before 100 or 100 just takes longer because it\u2019s a bigger project? Joel Marcus :  At the moment although we have it in the disclosure but it looks like 100 would be started later it really depends on the demand the demand in Cambridge is as I said is pretty large and so it\u2019s hard to say at the moment. Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets : Okay, great thanks. Joel Marcus :  Yes. Operator :  (Operator Instructions). And we will go back to Emmanuel Korchman with Citi. Michael Bilerman - Citi: Hey it\u2019s Michael Bilerman. Good afternoon. I echo Michael (inaudible) thank you for the target debt disclosure as well as level of the commentary that you had in the release. And if I may I just had just a question sort of surrounding it. When you think about getting to 6.5 by the end of \u201815 from 7.2 today what else is sort of in that forecast in terms of capital spend and any asset sale. So we know what\u2019s sort of happening in the back half of the year which I think you have about $380 million left to spend, you have about $16 million of free cash flow that\u2019s coming in and then you have the asset sales you have targeted, but I am curious I didn\u2019t know what was factored in to 2015 in order to get to that target? Dean Shigenaga :  Michael it\u2019s Dean here. I think the best way to think about 2015 is that we have a number of items that bring clarity to what can unfold i.e. the retained cash flows after dividends and EBITDA growth. So we have tremendous capacity to fund growth for \u201815. Hopefully, everybody can appreciate it, it's a little difficult to predict the exact dollar amount of construction spending related to a number of projects that we've identified. And this goes back to page 27 on the pipeline of opportunities in the near term. We have a number of negotiations ongoing, the exact starts will likely depend on the pace of those negotiations and leased executions on many of them. So, I would say give us some time to come back to you, probably closer to Investor Day to give you better clarity on the exact mix of what will unfold for \u201815, because there is a lot of moving pieces at the moment. Michael Bilerman - Citi: Maybe we talk it from a different level, there are some known factors that actually more embedded. One is you talked about that other income being very low, this quarter and you had a lot sales, investment sales, you had a loss. Just moving that back towards the average is about 0.2 times on debt to EBITDA. So, 7.2 goes to 7. You have same store EBITDA growth. I assume next year. And so that's going to add some level, I don't know what are you going to forecast for next year, whether it'd be 3% or 4%, but probably somewhere within that range. That's going to add to it. And then you have this large redevelopment development platform that has delivered some assets that are not yet stabilized and that are going to be delivering over the course of the back half of this year and next year. Do you sort of have the buckets of that EBITDA from those activities. So at least we can get the EBITDA numbers that underly the forecast and then we can figure out what spend will be? Dean Shigenaga : We'll provide that clarity in December Michael, at our Investor Day. Michael Bilerman - Citi: How much of development, re-development pipeline is -- where is that number for what you want to be delivered in 4Q of next year, how of much that's been leased. So you do very highly leased development platform what is that number in terms of the projects that will be earning income 4Q \u201815? Joel Marcus :  Yes, I think if you look at page 28 of our supplemental which highlights the current development pipeline, it\u2019s probably as simple as just to go top down on page 75/125 Binney Street, which is 99% released to ARIAD, will be delivered contractually here in late March and rent will commence in late March. 499 Illinois will be delivered over multiple quarters but I think we get to stabilization close to year-end, probably in 90% range with a little bit being delivered in the first quarter. And again, that\u2019s 100% leased. 269 East Grand will be probably in October 1 delivery, 100 leased. Science Park, Peter ran through, 60% leased negotiating today; pretty good shape there. We talked about New York being about 60% delivered by the end of this year with upside on delivery through \u201815. On the redevelopment front on page 30, 225 Second Avenue looks like 100% leased with an occupancy in the second quarter of \u201915; Barnes Canyon 100% leased, delivery later this year in the third quarter. And then Rozelle, it's mix, 75% leased, 24,000 square feet has been delivered; we have another 17,000 to be delivered probably in second quarter of \u201815 with a little bit to resolve. So big picture of your answer of your question Michael, the pipeline of active projects that will be delivered substantially through the first quarter is driving the tremendous amount of the EBITDA growth that\u2019s been forecasted. And big picture I think same property performance on the cash side I think will be solid, given the occupancy growth in the portfolio over \u201814 which will contribute to \u201815 as well as nice steps on leasing activity and contractual rent steps embedded in the leases. So, core should deliver strength into \u201815 and you\u2019ve got tremendous value-add that\u2019s highly pre-leased but driving a significant EBITDA growth. So, we\u2019ve got a pretty good ability for internal funding which is what we\u2019ve been trying to highlight and again I think we\u2019ll provide more clarity to some of your questions on Investor Day Michael. Michael Bilerman - Citi: And then just going back to Binney 50, 60, and 100, so you have about $300 million in the effective land today on your schedule pace 32, my understanding is that\u2019s going to be where you\u2019re going to raise some capital as part of this joint venture capital forecast you have of $110 million to $210 million, part of that\u2019s going to be putting some of this land into a joint venture. How much of the project are you going to be putting into joint venture? Joel Marcus : It will be a minority interest. Michael Bilerman - Citi: So, 25%, to 30%? Joel Marcus : Yes. I am not sure I am ready to announce any percentage but it will be a minority percent; it will be less than 50%. Michael Bilerman - Citi: And as you think Joel, as you think about putting in land and obviously getting some mark-to-market on that piece of the value that\u2019s been created in the value in Cambridge, how do you sort of evaluate that versus settling in 25% or 30% interest in a core stabilized asset versus putting a lot of money into Cambridge at arguably a very attractive yield relative to your plan basis. How have you sort of wrestled with being of current cash flow at attractive valuation given how where cap rates are versus developing to a higher yield and earning the NAV spreads on that? Michael Bilerman - Citi: Yes, I mean that's always the historical challenge, but I think that, because Cambridge is so large and may move all together that having a capital makes a lot of sense and we look forward to having a more programmatic sense of other things that we have in more the medium term pipeline that aren\u2019t necessarily reflected here as far as our thoughts and things that we're going to do we'd like to have that source of capital available to us to do things that we might otherwise can\u2019t do. I think if we go down the road of we are looking hard at a variety of assets that we haven't made any decision about, we have recycled assets as you know. But I think in recycling assets, we've got strong cash flows, we've got long-term tenants, we probably would not want to give up what we would consider to be really irreplaceable locations that are already cash flowing at very strong yields out there. But there are a host of assets that we might consider, so I think stay tuned on that score. Michael Bilerman - Citi: Okay. Thanks for the color. Look forward to Investor Day. Joel Marcus : Yes. Great questions as usual. Operator : And we'll go to Jim Sullivan with Cowen and Company. Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company : Thank you. I just have one quick question. Digital houses a category has been attracting a lot of start-up funding as you were (inaudible) recent report from mid-year indicator a very, very significant uptick year-over-year in that category and I know that you've mentioned once or twice in connection with some of the land acquisitions and I wonder if you could talk to us a little bit about how you assess the potential for growth in digital health demand number one, number two whether or not there is any regional concentration in demand so far or anticipated? And I guess number three whether there is any specific physical demands in terms of space let\u2019s say need i.e. can they take conventional office space or not and I guess finally is there any need for them to be and what you would think about is innovative cluster markets or approximate or adjacent to the innovative cluster markets? Joel Marcus :  Yes all good questions, I think it\u2019s really an emerging sector broadly under the IT sector and under the life science sector my sense is over the next five to ten years it will be a very big sector and it will come into maybe some prominence that would be identified as a some category under/either both of those the growth is really pretty staggering, the opportunity is huge. But I think it\u2019s too early to tell I think the main cluster where we are seeing activity is San Francisco at the moment there is some in New York and in the Boston Cambridge area, but I would say primarily in San Francisco and that\u2019s due to the extremely heavy concentration of tech-oriented venture capital on San Hill Road et cetera. Most of those requirements can be accomplished with office kind of a creative tech office some might require some enhanced features, but we view that those people generally will want to be at least the ones that we identify now will want to be in kind of the urban innovation cluster markets primarily for recruitment and retention. So we're tracking that sector, emerging sector very closely. And I'd say we hope to see it growing in pretty substantial fashion over the coming years. Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company : Thank you. Joel Marcus : Yes. Thank you. Operator : And this does conclude our question-and-answer session. Mr. Marcus, I will turn the conference back to you for closing remarks. Joel Marcus : Okay. Well, everybody thank you very much for busy time on one of the earnings day. Thank you for questions and attention and we look forward to talking to you on the third quarter call. Thanks. Operator : This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

Sheila McGrath - Evercore Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company Ross Nussbaum - UBS Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Operator : Welcome to the Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Matt and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Rhonda Chiger. Ms. Chiger, you may begin. Rhonda Chiger : Thank you and good afternoon. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Federal securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those projections in forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements as contained in the Company's Form 10-K, Annual Report and other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Joel Marcus. Please go ahead. Joel Marcus : Thanks, Rhonda, and welcome everybody to the third quarter call. With me today are Dean, Steve, Peter, Tom and Dan. So we've got a full house here. We are pleased to report the third quarter FFO of $1.21 a share and an increase in our narrowed guidance of $4.79 to $4.81, FFO up over 14% from third quarter of '13 I think characterized by strong demand as well as strength in our core operations. And I think the key to the success this year has clearly been our platform which is our Class A facilities located in our collaborative science and technology campuses and the best urban innovation clusters we've certainly benefited significantly from that. I think if you think about Alexandria at this point in time, maybe 10 kind of key strengths come to mind. First of all very strong core operations across all key metrics as set forth on Page 1 of the press release and accelerating FFO growth into 2015. Two, we've got 2.3 million square feet in current value creation development or redevelopment projects, 85% leased or in negotiations, Page 29 of the sup, I think this is a great testament to the teams in each of our markets, plus an additional approximately 1.8 million square feet in near term value creation development projects, virtually all of which are under active negotiations, again Page 29 of the sup. I think what's also important to note is the average initial cash stabilized yield generated from about 6.4 to 8.3 in value creation substantially exceed our implied cap rate base cost to capital, resulting in strong profit margins over the coming several years. You can take a look at Pages 30 and 34 for those updates. ARE clearly owns the best science and tech campuses in our urban innovation clusters of any REIT or private investor today. A very well run asset base at the asset management level. Five, very few challenged assets. Six, I think a deep long tenured and highly talented team which are fully integrated -- members of fully integrated teams in all of the key innovation clusters. As Dean has pointed out, the [indiscernible] a high level of liquidity, almost 2 billion, it is a strong balance sheet able to support strong value creation pipeline for the future. Nine, a low dividend payout ratio and increasing dividend, sharing growth in cash flows with our shareholders. And I think 10, continued sales of non-income producing assets as well as non-core assets while maintain accelerating growth into 2015. Just a few macro comments. There certainly is a strong trend toward the urbanization of the innovation economy and workforce and again we have been fortunate to take a significant advantage of that. I think also on our tenant base we see the strong confluence of structural factors with also positive cyclical factors which don't necessarily line up in time, but we are seeing that now really in the best of times for our tenant base. On the operations and internal growth side of things, we continue to beat our occupancy and rental rate increased estimates. And leasing in the key regions helped drive internal growth this quarter at about $871,000 square feet, Greater Boston contributed 35% and San Francisco 32%. On external growth, Steve will comment on the acquisition. The Mission Bay parcels in connection with the Uber joint venture, development of 422,000 square feet in the heart of Mission Bay. It's a superbly executed transaction to continue to drive our growth in San Francisco. ARE's goal is to maintain strategic optionality regarding its growth strategy. This is really kind of our mantra. And as such, due to the extraordinarily strong build-to-suite leasing demand for Binney Street development parcels and a corresponding reduction in the lease-up risk, we\u2019ve updated our strategy which we announced in the fourth quarter of '13 which was to sell a minority JV interest in the Binney land parcels and we will now seek to keep on balance sheet assuming their term leasing and all. So again, that\u2019s just an update on the strategic optionality approach. If we aren\u2019t successful in leasing, we wouldn't move forward with the joint venture. Clearly a key to this move on the assumption side of things is our desire to capture the extraordinary economics and the extraordinary demand for these three buildings versus an ability to move out our leveraged target somewhat. But Dean will deal with how we plan to address that through free cash flow, the growth in EBITDA, land sales, some asset recycling, et cetera. And we\u2019re very comfortable I think with our current plan regarding our overall leverage. Dean will talk about the balance sheet and I would conclude by saying on December 3rd at Investor Day we\u2019ll lay out the 2015 business plan which will confirm accelerating FFO growth into 2015 as well as what we expect to be a strong increase in our NAV into 2015. So let me turn it over to Peter Moglia for some comments. Peter Moglia : Sure. Thanks, Joel. So we had one notable Life Science trade to report in the third quarter which occurred in the Route 128 quarter at the Greater Boston region where GI Partners a private equity investor based in San Francisco purchased 850 Winter Street from Marcus Partners for a 6.3% cap rate. The price per square foot for this suburban asset was $404. The other notable trade involving Boston was BXP's sale of a 45% interest in two Boston and one New York City office buildings to Norges for what ISI calculated to be a 3.8% cap rate. This rate was noted by Green Street when they increase their NAV to $91.75 per share on October 1st. The Bay area continued to be extremely hot in the third quarter with 989 Market, 650 California, 50 BL and 60 Spear Street trading separately at a weighted average cap rate of 4.08% and a healthy $621 per square foot. In Seattle, 500 BL Avenue in South Lake Union traded at a 5.71% cap rate. The property is anchored by tech startups space provider WeWork. The buyer was Trinity Capital led by former speaker executive Richard Leider. A number of Seattle Office assets have hit the market this quarter and pricing guidance has been in the low to mid 5s as owners like Wolk Insurance, Brookfield look to capitalize on a diverse pool of buyers in the market including foreign funds German and Hong Kong based. Domestic funds such as Invesco, private equity investor GI Partners and a number of other public and private REITs. A number of these investors were bidders in life science asset 401 Terry purchased by Kilroy in March, which had a weak tenant credit anchor. The trend of cap rate compression is continued through the third quarter due in part of low interest rates, a lack of alternative investments and a deep pool of investors including foreign funds. It appears that the inventor market is only getting tighter as an analysis of comps that my core market shows the weighted average cap rate drop from 5.58% in 2013 to 4.8% through the third quarter of 2014 driven largely by a 100 basis point plus tightening in the San Francisco Bay area. As a follow up to questions we\u2019ve received about who is bidding on life science real-estate assets, we can give you some names of those who have been actively bidding on them in the greater Boston market. They include the related companies, Deutsche Bank Asset & Wealth Management, which is formerly RREEF; Korean fund Mirae Asset Management, JP organ, private investor the Rockefeller Group; Swiss fund, AFIAA; Clarion Partners; private REIT KBS, prudential and principal. To wrap up my comments, I want to acknowledge that with the end of [indiscernible] there\u2019s a lot of conversation about if, when and by how much interest rates will rise and the effects they will have on cap rates. Analysis of data from the first quarter of 1989 to the first quarter of '13 by Robert Charles Lesser & Company determined that the average spread between cap rates and the 10-year treasury yield is between 250 and 300 basis points. According to real capital analytics, the current spread for office product is between 400 and 450 basis points. So we believe there is room for cap rates to absorb increases in interest rates and remain at current levels. In addition, rising interest rates should reflect improving economy and real estate fundamentals, which should dampen a rise in cap rates driven by a rise in interest rates. With that, I\u2019ll pass it over to Steve. Steve Richardson : Good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019d like to take a step back today as we head into the final months of the year and frame the drivers for what has been an exceptional year for ARE's performance and the unique urban and science and technology clusters in which we operate. One, the deep and broad based demand in the critical science and technology sectors; two, the significant supply constraints in ARE\u2019s highly desirable urban innovation clusters; and three, the rental rate strength and pricing power in those sub-markets. These drivers have contributed to strong core performance again this quarter and year-to-date as we reported cash and GAAP increases of 6.2% and 14.1% year-to-date and 5.6% and 18.6% respectively this past quarter for renewals and releasing of space as well as historically high occupancy levels of 97.3% for North American operating properties. Very powerful global economic forces are intensifying demand for ARE's Class A product in its urban innovation clusters as they possess unique and mission critical attributes that simply cannot be replicated in other locations. Against the significant wave of demand is a set of political and geographic factors that are constraining supply. The ability to aggregate and deliver new product in urban settings is a very complicated and politically charged endeavor as well as the imperative for high quality design, technically capable and creative collaborative work environments. These two powerful forces, significant demand and constrained supply have created pricing power in the market. Alexandria's client tenants have therefore been keen to renew early to ensure stability of operations and more importantly, to seek trusted and long-term partnerships as they seek to establish unique and high quality urban campuses. A long term lease and joint venture between ARE and Uber has created a new paradigm and clearly illustrates the desirability of the ARE collaborative urban campus platform for its science and technology partners. Broadly, we've essentially resolved the rollovers for 2014 less than 0.5% outstanding and just 794,150 square feet remaining to resolve or just 4.29% of our operating asset base for 2015. Drilling down on ARE's core urban markets, the statistics reveal a very robust set of activity. In Cambridge, Boston, we've seen demand intensify during the past quarter in the Life Science market with 2.5 million square feet of demand and another 2 million square feet of tech demand. Most notable is the high quality demand from seven different potential client tenants seeking large blocks greater than 100,000 square feet. We've refreshed our mark-to-market analysis and across the entire operating ARE asset base we see solid cash increases at 9% and 13.2% on a GAAP basis and pretty amazing metrics for Cambridge, Boston. Growth of 18.2% on a cash basis and 22.4% on a GAAP basis. Occupancy is up by 230 bps to 98.6% compared to the same timeframe last year and lease rates are again being pushed to the high 50s to near $60 triple-net for existing product. And prospects seeking new large blocks of space at ACKS are anticipating rents in the low 70s triple-net. Vacancy rates overall continue to tighten and on a regional basis are just 5.7% on direct basis with 7.8% of total availability. Moving west, the San Francisco to Stanford clusters are also experiencing an intensified demand cycle from science and technology companies. Occupancy is up by 290 bps from the same period a year ago to 99% in the operating asset base. We're tracking nearly 900,000 square feet of Life Science demand and 9.3 million square feet of tech office demand with market highlights of several pre-leased large projects with tenants such as Google, EMC, Machine Zone and again, most notably, ARE's groundbreaking long term lease and joint venture for 422,000 square feet with Uber in the heart of Alexandria's center for science and technology at Mission Bay. Lease rates for new product are now in the mid to high 50s triple-net as the Prop M office allocation continues to constraint supply of new products in San Francisco. The mark-to-market refresh indicates impressive 8.6% cash and 14.4% GAAP growth trajectory and the market continues to tighten as vacancy rates drop to 100 basis points in the lab sector to 6.2% and a steep drop of 430 basis points to 4.1% in the SoMa tech district. Moving to south, we see that San Diego's market is again a similarly positive story. Demand in the market is up 300% to 2.4 million square feet compared with last year. Core performance is very solid with an occupancy increase of 340 bps to 96.1% and the operating and redevelopment asset base and market vacancy has dropped 140 bps to 9.6%. The existing tenant base growth trajectory is very strong and our key large campuses, Campus Pointe and Illumina's headquarters have more than 600,000 square feet under negotiation, a clear testament to ARE's underwriting team's unique capabilities and expertise and I'll pass along to shout out for their standout contribution. Finally, the long entitlement and approval process in San Diego continues to constrain supply in Alexandria's core clusters which in turn will continue to support rental growth which is reaching all-time highs in the mid to upper 40s triple-net. Finally moving north, Seattle has seen explosive growth in the tech sector during the past quarter with leasing in excess of 1 million square feet. Vacancy rates remain below 5% for lab and tech space with upward pressure on rental rates for new ground-up lab product in the high 40s to low 50s triple net. With that, I will hand it off to Dean. Dean Shigenaga : Thanks, Steve. Dean Shigenaga here guys. Good afternoon. I have got three important topics I want to cover. First, I will provide an update on our capital strategy and our ability to continue with the delivery of strong growth and FFO per share and then asset value. Second, I will provide an update on the positive impact of accelerating demand. And third, I will provide a summary of key guidance items for 2014, a few important thoughts for 2015 and our confidence in our ability to deliver solid growth in cash flows, net asset value and FFO per share from our Class A buildings and land parcels located in urban innovation clusters. First on our capital strategy. Our key capital matters for 2014 are substantially complete. In July, we completed our $700 million unsecured bond offering with weighted average interest rate of 3.5% and a term of 9.6 years. We updated our targeted sales for 2014 to a midpoint of 120 million, down 75 million from our prior guidance. And we have about 83 million of dispositions under contract and expect to identify additional sales in 2015. I will come back to this topic in a minute. Moving to leverage. Debt to adjusted EBITDA was 7.2 times as of the third quarter and forecasted to be 7.1 times by the end of the year based on significant growth in EBITDA and targeted dispositions of 83 million, both of which offset our estimated construction spend for the fourth quarter. Also, significant growth in EBITDA continues into 2015 and we will keep leverage within a reasonable range as we deliver highly leased projects and commence new development projects. Lastly, we expect leverage to improve towards the target range of approximately 6.5 times as pre-lease developments deliver significant growth in revenue, NOI and EBITDA. Briefly and importantly on our capital strategy, our capital plan focuses on funding all or almost all of our growth in 2015 and is aligned with our strategy to grow FFO per share and net asset value. Additionally we are very comfortable with our capital plan and credit metrics going forward and we will provide an update in detail on our Investor Day on December 3rd. First, we'll plan to invest cash flow from operating activities after dividends currently greater than 110 million per year into high value development projects. Second, we expect to issue long-term debt to fund Class A highly pre-leased development projects on a leverage neutral basis through significant growth in EBITDA. Combined with operating cash flows after dividends, these two items in 2015 should allow us to allocate 500 million to 600 million of capital to high value development projects. Third, we expect to supplement our sources of capital by identifying real estate to dispose off over the next one to five quarters including operating properties, both non-core and core like in addition to land parcels. We are in a great position to continue to deliver solid growth and FFO per share and net asset value from 2014 to 2015 including the impact of dispositions and the related reinvestment of proceeds. Moving next to the positive impact of accelerating demand on our asset base. As Steve pointed out, tenants clearly looking to tie down early renewals in anticipation of increasing rental rates in a very supply constrained environment. Occupancy reached 97.3% as of 930 and now exceeds our upper end of our guidance. We expect to end the year with very strong occupancy at the top end of our range of guidance of 96.9% to 97.3%. Same property NOI growth has strengthened throughout the year. Year-to-date same property NOI growth was solid at 4.5% and 5.2% on a cash basis. Our guidance for same property NOI growth for the full year \u201914 remains strong at a range from 3.5% to 5% and from 4% to 6% on a cash basis. Rental rate growth on lease renewals and releasing the space has also been very strong year-to-date, up 14.1% and 6.2% on a cash basis. Our guidance for rental rate growth for 2014 remains very solid at a range from 11% to 14% and from 4% to 6% on a cash basis. While we're on core performance, let me briefly comment on operating expenses. Operating expenses for the third quarter increased approximately 9.7 million or up 20% compared to the third quarter of '13. One half of the increase was driven by increases in variable expenses due to the increase in occupancy in our same properties. Occupancy was 96.9% and 93.6% as of September 30, \u201914 and 2013 respectively within the same property pool. The reminder of the increase was driven by the completion in delivery of highly pre-leased development and redevelopment projects. Operating margins remain very solid at 69% for the third quarter due to our triple net lease structure with 95% of our leases providing further recovery of operating expenses. Lastly on guidance. The completion of highly pre-leased development projects will drive a reduction in non-income producing assets to 13% of gross real estate by the end of the first quarter. There are no significant changes in prior ranges of guidance for straight-line rent G&A expenses capitalization of interest and interest expense net. Now that we only have one quarter remaining for 2014, we've provided guidance for these items specifically for the fourth quarter. Capitalization of interest for 2014 is targeted at 46.7 million for the year based upon a midpoint of our guidance. This represents a significant reduction of about one-third from our capitalization of interest for the year of 2014, driven primarily from the completion of high pre-leased development and redevelopment project over the last couple of years. The decline in capitalization of interest is expected to continue into 2015 again due to the completion of additional highly pre-leased development projects. Really from September 30, through March 31 of 2015. High quality science and technology entities continue to drive strong demand for our Class A assets and AAA urban innovation clusters and drove improvement in our outlook for 2014. We updated our guidance FFO per share diluted to range of $4.79 to $4.81 or a midpoint of $4.80. This represents a solid increase over 2013 of 9.1%. Our guidance earnings per share diluted is a range from $1.65 to $1.67. Briefly let me provide a few key thoughts for 2015. We will not comment further on 2015 beyond these brief comments since we plan to cover 2015 in detail during our Investor day on December 3 in New York City. We expect to continue to execute on our strategy to deliver solid growth in FFO per share and net asset value including the impact of reinvesting capital from the sale of operating assets, both non-core and core like and also certain land parcels. Core performance is accelerating and we expect cash run regroup on renewal and re-leasing the space to be significantly stronger than 2014 and cash same property NOI growth should be very solid and in the general range of growth as 2014. We are occasionally asked about the mark-to-market for rental rates on current in-place leases. We believe the mark to market for cash rental rates for in place leases are on average north of 10%. More importantly, we are expecting growth in cash rental rates to be very solid in 2015 for lease renewals and releasing a space. Construction spending for 2015 is fairly fluid at the moment with various build-to-suit negotiations in process and we expect to finalize our construction budget for 2015 over the next few weeks. As you know, 2014 is turning out to be a very strong year with FFO per share forecasted to be up 9.1% over 2013 and we anticipate 2015 FFO per share growth over 2014 to be very solid as well. We look forward to providing our detailed outlook for 2015 at our Investor Day on December 3rd in New York City. With that, I will turn it back to Joel. Joel Marcus : If we could go to Q&A, operator? Operator : Certainly. (Operator Instructions) At this time we will take a question from Emmanuel Korchman with Citi. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Dean or Joe, does common equity play a part in your capital strategy at all? Dean Shigenaga : Well as we've said earlier, it certainly doesn't for this year. And based on I think our comments to date and we will certainly give you a full detailed business plan update on December 3rd. Our goal would be to try to eliminate or minimize any common equity for next year based on the factors we talk about. Land sales and recycling of assets together with clearly cash flow and growth in EBITDA. So that we hope to kind of do what we did this year if possible. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets Inc.:  You spoke earlier about strategic optionality. You had 50, 60, 100 planned to be in a JV. Now it's wholly owned unless it gets, unless leasing is already expected to be and then it will be back into the JV. How do sort of a -- how does a partner think about that given sort of the unsurety of leasing and what they will be coming into and also if you do it at 100% now, is there a potential for that to become a JV in the future? Joel Marcus : When we announced the intent to go down the JV path last year fourth quarter, we had no tenants in hand for 50, 60 or 100. We thought it would be prudent to make a sale of less than a half interest in that set of parcels. It certainly would help us in a variety of ways and we didn't know how long the leasing would take on that. And we did one-on-ones with more than I think 15 high quality joint venture partners. I don\u2019t think there was a single one of which said we\u2019re not interest. We ended up boiling that down to a handful and then ultimately one and reached the term sheet in the \u2013 or at least a general term sheet in June. But during the summer months when the kind Tsunami of demand reared its head and that's what Life Science and tech in Cambridge, it was pretty clear to us that if we could -- again the tradeoff being if we could take advantage of this very unusual and extraordinary demand in the market versus the desire to joint venture, we would do that. But we clearly want to maintain flexibility. And if the lead joint venture partner were we to go back to them many time decided not to, we know there is a handful of other high quality partners who would covet being our partner with this land. This has got to be ground zero land in the best certainly life science market and one of the best sub markets in the entire country, if not world and so we are not too worried about that. So I am sorry if I didn't, what other part of that question didn't I cover. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: If it would potentially become a JV in the future once they\u2026 Joel Marcus :  I think if they turned out that we are not able to sign substantially all of the demand that we are getting at the moment, we certainly would look to go back to a joint venture. And, as I said I think, there are numerous partners that would be willing to go forward with us. Peter Moglia : I think that if we weren't successful in 100% leasing these projects like we expect to do, then a joint venture partner\u2019s hurdle rates will make more sense for the risk profile that we would be bringing back to them. I mean right now, with the type of returns that they are looking for and we are providing very little risk, it is not a big match. So I think we'd be returning an opportunity that is more to a JV. Operator : At this time, we will go to Sheila McGrath with Evercore. Sheila McGrath - Evercore: Yes, Joel I wonder if you could talk about how far long in the process are these leases and are they all life science or tech at 50, 60 and 100 a Binney. Joel Marcus : Yes. Well since we have Tom here, I will let him comment but the suffice it to say we have letter of intent that we are working on and coming very close to an agreement on which would then move to a lease pretty quickly on 50. We are trying to tee up the parameters of the economics on 60 and we are deep into LOI negotiations on a 100, but Tom do you want to maybe characterize it even more globally than that. Tom Andrews : Yes, that's accurate Joe. I think the, we have some companies, some of the demand is pure growth from existing Cambridge based tenants including the couple of life science companies, there is one which is a consolidation of an existing Cambridge tenants have leases in multiple locations in the city and wants to be under one roof. There is another one that's to me and from an out of market life science Company. So, we have a number of ongoing discussions and we are quite confident that we will be able to lock down one or more of these probably soon for summer and perhaps all of the spaces available which totals over 950,000 square feet. Joel Marcus : Yes, at the moment all of these are life science companies but there is a significant demand from tech and there is one large tech RFP that's out there that we will clearly respond to as well. We are looking at multiple back up offers as well. So it\u2019s not just one shot on goal here, so we feel pretty comfortable with that. Sheila McGrath - Evercore: And if we look at the potential cost, is it accurate to look at the cost per square foot of 75 to 125 Binney to estimate or is that higher? Joel Marcus : So I think we in some cases here we are looking at tenants who are more office and lab use within some of these buildings you recall when we did 225 Binney we had a life sciences tenant that took office use in that building. So he cautioned that the lower in total I would say the range could be up to as much as the 75/125 Binney that's kind of a higher cost project in terms of the a model lab space in that in that tenant requirement and it could range down somewhat from, but it wouldn't be too far off the total that 75/125 [indiscernible]. Sheila McGrath - Evercore: Okay, last question on funding, Joe you mentioned asset sales, these projects will be coming online till '16 and '17. Are the asset sales going to be mostly concentrated in '15 or stretched over a longer period? Dean Shigenaga :  We are working through number of assets that will identify here over the coming months. So it's a bit fluid on the dispositions but our bogie at least for solving for our capital needs for '15 will be to execute a number of transactions that fit the capital plan in our business. Really, that will allow us to reinvest the capital into these really high value development projects. But I would say we would likely continue with this broad strategy i.e. invest cash flows that we retain from operations, use EBITDA growth to debt fund without impacting leverage and then continue to identify asset selectively for a recycling and reinvestment in to the business and like we mapped out, there is not a whole lot of land left but we\u2019ll do some lands, but there will be some non-core assets and we will identify some that are more core like which should represent some high value opportunities to monetizing and reinvest. Joel Marcus : I think Sheila with that though different than happened in the past; I think you can still expect that we would have an increase in FFO per share during this time period. So that\u2019s something we\u2019re keeping firmly in mind as well. Operator : And now we\u2019ll take a question from Jim Sullivan with Cowen and Company. Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company : My question for you in terms of just how strong this market is in Cambridge, it does seem to be a level of demand growth which is exceptional and I think in the prepared comments you talked about low 70s is the rent per foot triple net for high quality built to suite. And I wonder if you could just remind us back in first half of the year I think we were talking about low 60s to mid-60s, is that right? Is that how much the movement has been? Tom Andrews : The movement is on that order. I would say that we\u2019ve certainly seen in proposals that other landmarks have been sending out to tenants and our own proposals we\u2019ve seen significant movement from earlier in the year on the magnitude of $10 a square foot or more. Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company : Can you give us a handle on what might have happened on construction costs, for the same period? Dean Shigenaga : We project construction cost increases currently in the range of 6% NOI. Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company : And then finally from me, can you give us an update on what\u2019s happening with the Volpe site? I know this is some time off, but there was this I guess RFI. Maybe I don\u2019t know if there is another date certain for the next step in the process but if you could just give us an update, if there is another step and number one and number two. What Alexander\u2019s posture is here in terms of partner or not and the scale and the size of that project. Joel Marcus : So there was and RFI which was due in early October, we know there were significant number of respondents to that RFI were told that the federal GSA is working on an RFP, we\u2019ve had some folks tell us I think it might be out as early as sometime in Q1 of next year. We would imagine there would be probably a multi-month response timeframe for that. And that many development companies and operators would likely pursue that property which under proposed disowning in Cambridge accommodates if my recollection is correct over 2.5 million square feet of commercial space, over 1.5 million square feet of proposed residential zoning. So Alexandria certainly is following this closely, we made a response to the RFI. We expect that once we see the RFP then we\u2019ll work carefully to evaluate how we ought to pursue what will be a very interesting opportunity. Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company : And in terms of, you have a partner I believe with this working with you on this? Joel Marcus : We have spoken with multiple partners; we have not selected a partner. Operator : This time we\u2019ll move Graham with [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst : Just wondering if you could sort of approximate the returns on joint ventures versus just going in company owned route? What order or kind of spread are we talking about? Peter Moglia : This is Peter, I mean from a yield on cost standpoint that\u2019s not -- it wouldn\u2019t dilute what we\u2019re going to achieve, it\u2019s just going to -- the amount of investment we have would be obviously diluted by the amount of partner capital we bring in. We would be in a position to earn a promote, so it\u2019s possible that we could actually leverage that partners investment and increase our own return. But what it does as it gives up upside to the future because we take that capital. Unidentified Analyst : Take that capital -- possibly are you yielding assets in the future? Peter Moglia : I am sorry you cut out, could you ask that again? Unidentified Analyst : I mean employee capital being that you can employ the capital at higher rates in the future that you anticipate at higher lease rates of because they are the properties that you see with higher potential returns. Peter Moglia : Well the reason that we might employ other people\u2019s capital is an alternative to raising equity through common stock sales. So it\u2019s just an -- the opportunity cost for doing that is up side in our own developments. Unidentified Analyst : Have you figured what the blended cost to capital is for ARE currently versus those alternatives? Joel Marcus : We have but we\u2019re not prepared to share though. Unidentified Analyst : The land sale inventory. Joel Marcus : I think we need to move onto another questioner. Operator : Next question will be from Ross Nussbaum. Ross Nussbaum - UBS: Couple there's some questions. Joe is there anything you can say at this point about the press reports that you're acquiring Memorial Drive and Cambridge. Joel Marcus : Yes I can tell you that similar to the press report that we were joint venturing with somebody for an apartment building in Boulder, Colorado you can't always believe everything you read but I think it's fair to say that we don't comment on speculation and when we're prepared to announce if that happen to be an acquisition or whatever it is we'll announce it when the time is appropriate so I'd have nothing more to say. Ross Nussbaum - UBS: Okay, second question is back to Binney Street. How would you characterize your discussions with the tenants you're having today versus where you were three months to six months ago, because I know when we've spoken and met all year you've been I'd say similarly extraordinarily bullish on the leasing prospects there. So are you finally at the point where you're pretty darn confident this is getting over the finish line ASAP? Joel Marcus : Yes let me say this and then I'll ask Tom to come in. When we go back to 4Q of '13 when we announced kind of on our strategic optionality, strategy if you will that we were assuming, we were going to joint venture and we put into play a pretty intense process to accomplish that I'd say the level of demand and forward movement of that demand in Cambridge probably didn't come to a head until the summer. And so maybe that's the really operative time then I\u2019ll let Tom kind of characterize it. Tom Andrews : Yes look I think it's really number of transactions that we would characterize it in the pipeline and a handful of them are getting to be very-very real in terms of the trading of proposals the frequency of discussions with brokers and with principles and these feel very much like they're moving toward completion and of course the answer, the truth is that they're not complete until they are complete and we don't have anything signed yet, but we're very positive negotiations ongoing and they feel it's been a compliment since specifically they feel like they're moving patients quite soon. Joel Marcus : And I would say that in all three circumstances the lead party in all three of these cases we've had our prior relationships with so these are not parties that we have that we have not had a prior relationship with in other words we don't know each other so that's also I think a very helpful factor. Ross Nussbaum - UBS: Okay and then finally for me, I guess I'm wondering a little bit why you'd wait if you will for proceeds from potential asset sales to come in ex-quarters or ex-funds down the road rather than just hang up the phone from this earning's call, pull the trigger and issue equity aid handle on the stock price given that we're in and uncertain and increasingly volatile world why take the risk that you'd be able to transact on asset sales couple of months from now then just take the equity now and get the balance sheet down toward your goals. Joel Marcus : Yes, well that's certainly a relevant question and certainly one part of an argument that one could conceive of. In reality though Ross, we have enough confidence in the demand going forward here for a while, I think Peter articulated we also feel that we're in a pretty decent environment on the recycling of both land and some assets that I think we can look forward to I don't know how long that will last but I feel good about at least as we look at a few quarters. Our leverage, let\u2019s face it, we\u2019re operating in a better leverage level than we ever had before and better than a number of other companies that are really in great shape and have strong stock prices. And we just had meetings with the rating agencies in July. So we feel comfortable with where we've come over the last couple of years we've made dramatic improvements on virtually every single credit metric one could look at. And I think we feel good about where we are. And I think we'd like to protect our growth and earnings by minimizing the equity issuances and looking at those assets that we could sell. So I think that's our current game plan at the moment but I mean the situation you passed is related certainly one that reasonable people could look at but I think we're going to try to repeat what we did this year and in '14 and try to do it in a way that I think makes the most sense all around and minimize this dilution. But again, if there was a big change in the equity markets then we'll deal with that. Operator : (Operator Instructions) At this time we will take a question from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Can you talk about what was the other income in the quarter, looks like you are a little bit higher than usual? Dean Shigenaga : Jamie, Dean Shigenaga here. Other income was $2.3 million. Actually I call it a little tad light from our run rate rather than higher, it was just higher from the second quarter. Second quarter was down less than 500,000. So that was an usually low quarter due to very small amount of investment gains in the quarter. So I would suggest from onward purpose as you should expect about a $3 million run rate for quarter. Joel Marcus : Which is been historically pretty much worth enough. Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, and then can you talk about your any of the largest 2015 expiration been any that may not be covered or you think might be moving out of this point? Joel Marcus : Yeah the two big ones that I will let Steve deal with that but the two that strike me we have one full building user in a suburb in Route 128 that is moving out and that\u2019s a building that we are looking to release or potentially market. And then another one that rolls a full building user, government user in North Carolina and we have already got good re-leasing prospects on that. Those are the two standout full building users but as Steve said we've got unresolved paired down to three quarters of a million feet in \u201915 which we think is really at this point in time pretty great. Steve Richardson : You know that, that\u2019s right. Jaime just a add to that. That\u2019s just about 4% of the asset base and when you take out those two pieces that takes out about another third, got a block of space in tech square, so we think that will be an opportunity rather than a concern that\u2019s in the 60,000 square foot range and then potentially in the ETC market and San Diego as well. So, no other real large blocks other than the two that Joel cited and spread out pretty uniformly with smaller pieces. Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, and then I guess for the 2015 expiration schedule. Give the sense of where you think those are those rents are versus market? Dean Shigenaga : Well that\u2019s kind of a mix, but if you want to go back, Jaime its Dean here again. If you want to go back to my prepared comments. I didn\u2019t give specific guidance for \u201915 but I did comment that cash rents on lease renewals and releasing a space should be meaningfully stronger than our performance in \u201914 and we will layout the plan on Investor Day for you in more detail. Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, so just higher at this point. And then I guess just finally on San Diego, we have seen market conditions are getting stronger there generally across many sectors. What are you guys seeing in terms of your portfolio and maybe opportunities to do more non-life science leasing? Just how should we think about your business plan there going forward given the conditions seems to be exciting? Dan Ryan : Yeah hi Jaime, this is Dan Ryan. So, word on usual situation at San Diego that we basically are out of inventory like most of the other regions, and we are now actively employing what land bank we have. As Steve mentioned earlier we are in discussions of an excess of 600,000 square feet of new build in our region. So it\u2019s a rigorous mark right now, lot of what we responding to is internal portfolio growth. The question about whether we are crossing over into seeing some tech demand, we do have a couple of things. We did a Barnes Canyon project which we leased to a tech user; they have come back after having moved in for three week and asked if they can lease the next building over which is about 45,000 square feet, so we are working through that.  So we are seeing probably not as vigorous as Steve\u2019s market, but probably 80-20ish kind of life science and tech demand. Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And do you have a preference one versus the other in terms of your return? Dan Ryan : I think we are generally agnostic about I think it\u2019s a matter where you are in the risk level with life science tenant fee versus the tech tenant fee. And we are generally agnostic about it, just really trying to target the best return in the overall risk adjusted capital investment. Operator : That does conclude question-and-answer session. I will turn the things back over to Joe Marcus for closing remarks. Joel Marcus : Thank you everybody. We did a well under an hour and that is great. So we will see many of you at Marriott and look forward to Investor Day or year-end call. Thank you again. Operator : Again that does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation.",

Fourth Quarter and Year End 2014 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jenifer and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Rhonda Chiger. Ms. Chiger, you may begin. Rhonda Chiger : Thank you and good afternoon. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Federal securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those projections and forward-looking statements, additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements as contained in the Company's Form 10-K, Annual Report and other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now, I would like to turn the [Audio Gap]. Please go ahead. Joel Marcus : Thanks Rhonda and welcome everybody to our fourth quarter and year end 2014 call. With me today are Dean, Peter, Steve and Dan, and I want to start out with a couple of macro comments and first of all, really very proud of what our amazing Alexandria team collectively accomplished in 2014, our 20th anniversary year. We are really blessed to have a great business, an outstanding opportunity set and a business which passionately and positively impacts the quality of human health each and every day. We had an exceptional year with strong core growth and significant growth from completion of highly pre-leased value creation projects. Important to our success this year was Alexandria\u2019s class A facilities and our collaborative science and tech campuses and really the hot urban innovation clusters, characterized by rising ramps, giving us pricing power, rising occupancy and constrained supply in our core urban cluster markets. 2014 also saw the U.S. FDA hit a 18 year high with drug approvals, 41 novel medicines versus 27 the year before and we\u2019re very proud that 56% of those 41 companies were ARE client tenants. And there were a number of very significant breakthrough treatments for a variety of cancers and rare diseases. Dean will comment on guidance in a few minutes, but the midpoint of the guidance as we go forward for 2015 as you know is 510, which is an 8.3% growth and when combined with our dividend we're predicting a double digit return for this year. Internal growth operations in leasing really are characterized by very strong year end occupancy at 97% for North American operating properties. We have very solid same store or same property NOI growth and the fourth quarter witnessed solid leasing, particularly from North Carolina and San Diego. Let me just comment on two markets for the moment. One is the Cambridge, Boston market. The mark-to-market analysis that we\u2019ve done internally indicates this is a continuing durable market, our so called greater Boston cluster and we\u2019re expecting growth of about 17.5% on a cash basis and 21.8% on a GAAP basis. Occupancy is up 200 basis points to 98.8% compared to 4Q '13; lease rates were in the $60 plus range, triple-net for existing product; and prospects seeking new large blocks of space at our Alexandria Center at Kendall Square are anticipating rents in the low 70s triple-net on a GAAP basis. In the San Francisco cluster, occupancy is up by about 120 basis points from the same period a year ago to 98.9% in the operating asset base and worth noting that we resolved the remaining vacancy last week. So we\u2019re now fully 100% leased. Lease rates for new product are in the mid to high $50 triple-net as the proposition allocate -- office allocation continues to constrain supply of new product in the Bay area. The mark-to-market refresh indicates further growth to about 11.7% cash and then somewhere between 17% and 18% on a GAAP basis. And as I'll mention in a moment, we\u2019re advancing the entitlements and lease negotiations at 510 Townsend and anticipate completion in the near term as well as finalizing the design this month for what will prove to be an absolute world class and iconic tech facility for Uber at Mission Bay adjacent to the amazing league leading warriors arena and we\u2019ll disclose yields on those in the 1Q supplement once our construction cost and so forth are finalized. Moving to external growth briefly, again we had good leasing progress on our value add development projects, both at Longwood and the Alexandria Center for Life Science in New York City, and I want to comment a little bit on the near term value creation development pipeline, Page 31 of the supplement. At Campus Point, Dan's been very successful. He expects to have the lease for about 75% of the project, the new building finalized hopefully this month, entitlements following shortly thereafter and then construction starting probably by the second quarter. At 50 Binney, we look to finalize the lease for the full 50 Binney project in the first quarter here and hopefully to finalize a lease in the second quarter for 60 Binney and that construction is fully underweighting and then our plan. When it comes to a 100 Binney we\u2019re trading paper with at least five substantial space users. Construction will depend upon significant pre-leasing but we expect that to happen in the relative near term. Coming back to 510 Townsend Street for a moment, we expect the lease to be finalized this month, entitlements to follow in March and probably kick off a construction by the end of the second quarter. And as many of you noted, we did make a number of acquisitions over the past quarter, including the remaining 10% interest in the Alexandria\u2019s Tech Square Center, which we purchased from MIT, the remaining 10% interest half paid this year and half paid next year, and as we indicated in the supplement and in the press release, we see very significant upside in the lease rolls and that project is really kind of the -- probably the single best located project in all of Cambridge. And then also we did acquire another project from MIT, their 640 Memorial Drive. Dean may make a comment or two. We did have a 5.9% initial cap rate, moving to 6.4% at 116 when the rental phasing is completed. This purchase in the mid-Cambridge market really ties to our 780 Memorial Drive and 790 Memorial Drive clustered development that have been very highly leased and very successful. So now we\u2019re starting to build a cluster in the mid-Cambridge market. It is subject to a ground lease with MIT and MIT in -- for their decision to use our capital for future development decided to put this market out for sale. We have a very unique relationship with MIT, and also the two tenants that inhabit 640 Memorial Drive. I won\u2019t get into any details on the balance sheet. We\u2019ll try to make this presentation somewhat shorter than normal. And I\u2019ll ask Dean to kind of comment on a number of subjects, and then we\u2019ll open it up for Q&A quickly here. Dean Shigenaga : Thanks Joel. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon everybody. I\u2019ve got four important topics I want to cover today. First, obviously our strong performance in 2014 and continued focus on growth and FFO per share and growth in net asset value. Second, I want to touch on our quality cash flows and disciplined allocation of capital in the high value urban innovation cluster sub markets. Third, I\u2019ll touch on and update on our significant progress on our capital plan for 2015, and key considerations for net asset value, and lastly I'll close out some comments on guidance. Jumping right in, the fourth quarter was a very strong quarter of performance with FFO per share of $1.23, and really the wrap up of an outstanding year with total shareholder return of 44.7%. Our FFO per share for the full year was $4.80, up 9.1% over 2013. Our strong performance in 2014 is projected to continue into 2015 with our mid-point of FFO per share of $5.20 or 8.3% over 2014. Our strong cash NOI growth from value creation deliveries throughout 2014 is driving significant growth in NOI and cash flows in 2015 with further increases from significant value creation deliveries in 2015. We continue to focus on growth in FFO per share and net asset value in 2015 and beyond. One of the key drivers of growth in FFO per share and net asset value in 2014 was the significant quarter-over-quarter growth in net operating income and cash flows and we expect this growth to continue into 2015. That will drive continued growth in net asset value. The quality of our ABR has improved significantly in recent years, supporting high quality and strong cash flows, the three key areas driving quality, ABR, and cash flows include; first 56% of our ABR is derived from investment grade rated client tenants, and again this represents an industry leading statistic. Second, 83% of our ABR is generated from high value urban centers of innovation, including Greater Boston, primarily the submarkets of Cambridge and along with Medical Center, the San Francisco Bay area, primarily Mission Bay and Suma, Palo Alto and the Stanford Research Park, New York City, San Diego, again primarily Torrey Pines and UTC and in Seattle, primarily in Lake Union. 83% of our ABR R&D's high value centers of innovation reflect a significant focus of our capital allocation over many years in our urban innovation cluster submarkets. And third we remain disciplined in our allocation of capital going forward. 85% of our capital allocation in 2015 is projected to be in the same high value urban centers of innovation that drive 83% of our ABR today. Additionally over one half of our capital allocation for 2015 is projected to be invested in two of the top destinations for science and technology innovation in the Cambridge and Mission Bay/Suma submarkets. Let me briefly clarify our initial cash yield for a purchase of our ground lease hold interest at 640 Memorial located in Mid Cambridge. Our release disclosed an initial cash yield of 6.4%. For clarification one of the two leases we acquired with the property has about one year remaining before a rent concession burns off. So our cash yield, as Joel had mentioned on day one is approximately 5.9% to 6%, which increases to about 6.4% in about 12 months. Moving next to the great progress on our dispositions and our capital plan for 2015, we have $235 million in dispositions identified to-date, of which about $113 million was completed in the fourth quarter and January of 2015. We have an additional $122 million of properties held for sale, and these proceeds from the sales will be invested immediately into substantially leased Class A value creation development projects. Our mid-point of our 2015 guidance for asset sales is approximately $390 million with $178 million completed or identified and held for sale. The remaining of our mid-point of our guidance is about $212 million, which represents our sale proceeds. At a very high level, a portion of the $212 million in proceeds from remaining asset sales really will provide a benefit or a reduction of leverage, so reduces our debt to offset a reduction in EBITDA. The exact mix of land versus operating asset sales will be determined in the next couple of quarters. While we\u2019re covering capital, let me briefly touch on approximate pricing for unsecured bonds. At a very high level we believe pricing for 10 year unsecured bonds in the last month would have been roughly about 180 basis points over 10 year treasuries or approximately 3.6%. In 2015 we have the flexibility to execute a 10 year bond deal with a maturity in 2025, providing us the opportunity to both extend their weighted average remaining term of outstanding debt and continue to ladder maturities. Next I just want to touch on some very important NAV considerations. For your reference on Page 4 of our supplemental you\u2019ll find a brief outline of key considerations for NAV models in our Company from recent dispositions and assets held for sale. The key point here is that various important items included in our fourth quarter results will drive a meaningful overall increase in net asset value due to the following : continued significant growth in cash NOI in the fourth quarter of $4.6 million or $18.3 million on an annualized basis. This is on top of the cash NOI growth for the third quarter of about $5.8 million or $23.4 million on an annualized basis. We expect significant growth in cash NOI quarter-to-quarter to continue, which has been and will be a key driver of growth in NAV going forward. We have increased our developable square footage by approximately 416,000 square feet, 88% of which represents increases for near term development projects located in University Town Center, including 214,000 square feet at 5200 Illumina Way and about 103,000 square feet at Campus Point, and we continue work on finalizing these entitlements. Page 4 of our supplemental package highlighted other key NAV considerations, including the sale of real estate located in Toronto. The key highlights of this transaction are that we had an operating property classified in rental properties generating operating losses due to operating expenses of about $1.4 million per year related to ground rent expense. As such we believe most NAV models had no value or negative value attributed to this investment. We completed this sale in January 2015. So if you update your model for the fourth quarter NOI, remember to make an additional adjustment to increase NOI in order to eliminate the annual operating expense of $1.4 million. Additionally, since most NAV models likely attributed no value to negative value for this asset, remember to add the proceeds from the closing of the sale of $54 million as a positive adjustment to NAV. Also because of factors I just described, we believe the impairment of $16.6 million for this asset had no impact on most NAV models. I should also point out that the impairment is primarily related to foreign currency exchange rates, taxes and other closing costs for that property. The next item to consider for NAV is the impairment related to the sale of nine land parcels with seven old industrial buildings located in South San Francisco. The buyer of these assets operates, redevelops and develops industrial buildings. These parcels were previously classified as land held for future development. The impairment charge was about $24.7 million and will slightly offset increases in NAV I just described. Further details on this sale are also included on Page 4 of our supplemental package. Briefly on 500 Forbes, this is a high quality core like asset located in South San Francisco that we acquired in 2007. However we did recognize an impairment related to the write off non-cash items, including both net book value related to an acquired below market lease and improvements we received from the prior tenant. We expect to complete the sale of this property at a market cap rate reflective of a high quality asset with quality improvements and an investment grade rated tenant. Since most NAV models value at this property based upon cash NOI and a market cap rate which is consistent with our expected sale, we believe this non cash impairment of $9.6 million has no impact on most NAV models on our Company. It's important to also note that the proceeds from these sales will be in immediately invested into highly lease value creation development projects at very attract cash yields relative to current market capitalization rates. Additionally these sales, an immediate investment into value creation projects is well aligned with our overall strategy to continue to grow FFO per share and net asset value. In closing on this topic, the key here is that we believe there are several drivers in our fourth quarter results that will result in a significant increase in net asset value, including significant growth in cash NOI, additional FAR that we are adding to key near term ground up development projects, and a net positive impact from completed and pending sales including any end back from impairment charges. Briefly I want to comment on our 7% series D preferred stock. You may have noticed during the quarter we purchased about 513,000 shares or roughly 5.1% of our outstanding 7% series D preferred stock for an aggregate price of about $14.4 million or $27.98 per share. This results in a preferred stock redemption charge of about $2 million or about $0.03 per share. Our guidance assumes that we do not repurchase any additional shares of our outstanding 7% series D preferred stock in 2015. Lastly on guidance, the detailed assumptions underlying our guidance for 2015 are included on Page 5 of our supplemental package. We are extremely pleased with the solid execution by our team in 2014, with the delivery of strong growth and cash NOI, FFO per share up 9.1% over 2013 and significant growth in net asset value. We remain focused on continuing this growth into 2015 with FFO per share forecasted up at 8.3% over 2014. A key driver to our growth in net asset value as been and will continue to be the significant growth in cash NOI quarter to quarter. We believe we have the right assets, in the right locations, and the best to roster our client tenants and we remain focused on continuing to build our best in class franchise. With that I'll turn it back to Joel. Joel Marcus : Thank you. Operator, let's open it up for Q&A please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Smedes Rose from Citi. Smedes Rose : I wanted to ask you on your Technology Square purchase. Was there any decision around -- buying the 10% now versus at some other point, was there some sort of trigger that you needed to buy that now; and if you could give maybe a little more color on the 100,000 square feet that you could potentially out there as well. And then just more broadly, are there additional opportunities with MIT, where you would be kind of the natural buyer I guess? Joel Marcus : Well let me -- this is Joel. With respect to the timing, it really is driven not by us, but MIT's Management Company's decision to sell certain assets so that they can invest them in development projects both on and off campus. So that really drove the decision for timing on Tech Square and 640 Memorial Drive. When it comes to other opportunities, certainly those would be very interesting. That given, Cambridge is one of our most important markets. When it comes to the 100,000 square feet, we're working on the design and entitlement of that. And so I'm not sure I could say much more than that. Tom is unavailable today, but I'll make a note. We'll comment in our next conference call and give you some updated details on that. Smedes Rose : Okay. And then could I just ask one more about the land bank that you've talked about, potentially selling pieces from -- and you mentioned the Forbes Boulevard and South San Francisco, but is there more or much more from kind of the 2006, 2007 sort of vintage if you will that you would look to bring to market this year? Joel Marcus : Not particularly. We did use a set of parcels there for the development of the Onyx campus, which when Onyx got acquired by Amgen, they succeeded to those assets. We do have another set of parcels for development, but I think that's something we'll continue to look at as time goes on. So it's possible but nothing certain at the moment. Operator : And we will go next to Jamie Feldman from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jamie Feldman : So if you look at your acquisition guidance and what you've already done year-to-date or scheduled to do year-to-date, you've kind of hit that number. So what does the acquisition pipeline look like from here? Joel Marcus : I don't think we have anything that is in the near-term, but we look at everything that comes to market that we feel is in the sweet spot of either the nature of the facility, and certainly the nature of the location. But I don't think we have anything in the near-term that we're looking at. And as I just said to Smedes, the timing of the Tech Square acquisition or really the sale by MIT and the decision to market 640 Memorial Drive really driven by their own capital needs and on decision making timing had nothing to do with ours, I can assure you. Jamie Feldman : And then you had meant -- you had commented that you are starting to build -- you could start to build a cluster in the mid Cambridge market. Can you talk a little bit about what might be different about that segment of Cambridge, whether it's tenants or building type or if that becomes a real investment for the future for you guys, what's different about it? Joel Marcus : Well I think if you look at a map, it's directly west of East Cambridge. It encompasses, kind of circles -- it kind of touches MIT and circles around towards Harvard Square. There are a number of owners and developers in there. MIT certainly has an important toe hold. Some years ago we actually owned a property next to 640 Memorial called 620 Memorial that was ultimately leased to Pfizer and then I think we sold it to them and they -- I think they turned around and sold it just a year or two ago. But back about 10, 12 years ago we built 790 Memorial Drive and 780 Memorial Drive. Tom really managed that development right near the Polaroid building. And so that's been a real important anchor for us in that mid Cambridge market. So we like that market, and when this opportunity came up we decided to move on it. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then I guess a similar question in San Francisco. As Mission Bay is filling up, what's kind of the next cluster you could create there? Will you go further south or you just try to keep penetrating the CBD? Joel Marcus : Well I think you will see naturally it move out -- you can't move east from Mission Bay, because you'll be in the Bay, but you can move south, you can move west, and you can move north. So I think those would be the natural extensions at Mission Bay. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then finally on the land sales in the quarter, any impairments? If we look at our current land bank, just what level of impairments you think you still need to see if you did sell some of that remaining land? Or is it finally now more of a mark to market? Joel Marcus : Yes that's -- well it's always difficult to speculate what land will trade at Jamie, but I think if you turn to Page 37 of our supplemental, bifurcate the land holdings into two buckets, we have 2.3 million square feet in near-term and that product that you know is heavily under negotiation. So I'll skip over that. That's all going to yield very nicely, very attractive returns. The future bucket, you have about 2.9 million square feet, and if you go through that the larger components -- where the largest component 1.7 million spread across multiple markets is $32 a foot, I don't -- I am not really concerned in any meaningful way with that. It's $56 million. Everything else? If you\u2019ve got, Technology Square, just some residential and Cambridge, Grand Avenue, which is adjacent -- the fourth side at the Onyx, Amgen campus, plus some other land on Grand Avenue. So great locations. We can make money on those deals. If we sold we'd be close to that depending on the buyer. If you compared it to the trade we just did we traded out of San Francisco to an industrial buyer at about $80 a foot. So maybe a slight haircut, but these are pretty small dollars, Jamie. So I think all in we're in really good shape. Operator : And we'll go next to Sheila McGrath from Evercore ISI. Sheila McGrath : The GAAP cap rate on 500 Forbes looks to be about 5%. I'm just wondering if the cash cap rate is going to be close to that and could you describe the level of interest from buyers for that asset? Joel Marcus : The GAAP cap rate is shown on our disposition page on the supplemental, probably at about 51, Sheila as you stated. I think the cash number trails that just a tad, maybe somewhere in the 30 to 40 bps behind that. Sheila McGrath : Okay, and were there a lot of potential buyers interested in that asset? Joel Marcus : Let us not comment about the transaction itself, other than to say that you have a very high quality asset, that I think will be very attractive and we feel you can get a sense for our approximate price point that we expect to complete on the transaction. So I think it's an attractive trade for us. Sheila McGrath : Okay and then on 50, 60 and 100 Binney, the supplemental says 2016 and '17. If they are complete in '16 it would be very, very late in the year and not contributing or how should we think about timing in '16 for those projects? Joel Marcus : Yes, I think -- it's hard to speculate on timing too specifically because there's a lot of negotiations ongoing and it ultimately will depend on the terms of the lease, but I think it's safe to say that if it contributes into '16 at all, its fourth quarter. That's probably the earliest. But the exact timing for each of those buildings will depend very specifically on the lease negotiation. So we can provide better color as we execute transactions. Sheila McGrath : Okay, and last question on investment page, you did have some unrealized gains. Was there an IPO or two and should we assume that there will be some sales from that bucket in 2015? Joel Marcus : Yes, we had -- actually over the past two years I think we've had '14 IPOs. So yes, there will be I'm sure sales over coming quarters and years. Operator : And we'll go next to Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll : Hey Joel, can you discuss the demand you're seeing at the Illumina campus in the UTC. With a doubling of the size of the project that's under development, has the timing changed on the potential projects that are in the near term value creation pipeline? Joel Marcus : Yes, Dan is here. So I'm going to let him comment. Dan Ryan : Yes, good morning. So when you ask about the demand, in terms of Illumina's growth it has been extremely robust. The delivery of this next filming basically taps out there existing entitlements. So we're in front of the city now to entitle for about now at 350,000 square feet of additional space and we have -- they have asked us to go ahead and progress on that additional square footage that we think we can get. Michael Carroll : Could you expect -- I guess could that break ground in the next few years also? Is there enough demand for that? Dan Ryan : Yes, I think that's a fair assumption. Michael Carroll : Okay, great. And then I guess my last question, can you talk a little bit about your asset sales in general? How much of the portfolio going forward do you want to sell? Is it that, that you just want to raise capital through asset sales or is there other assets that you want to dispose of? Dan Ryan : Well, I think for the moment you have our guidance on what we'd like to accomplish for 2015. So we've got a range -- call it at the midpoint of $390 million. Again $178 has been held for sale. So either it's been completed or pending, and that leaves us with $212 million to complete for the rest of the year. And again that number is a mix when we think about what remains -- a little bit of land and some operating assets, and again we'll bring more color in the next couple of quarters. And I think when you go forward it's hard to speculate what will look towards in 2016 but I think we'll look at our options as we manage through our capital plan like we have this year, a lot of -- how much will be debt funded and then is there an opportunity to recycle assets for reinvestment. I think those would be our two priorities. Operator : And we'll go next to Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Rich Anderson : What is your tenant retention percentage generally, and how has it trended over the recent past? Joel Marcus : I think we did a study about a year ago when we looked back probably seven years if I recall and the retention rate has been pretty consistent as you roll that forward. It\u2019s been averaging about 85% over that time frame. And the only qualifier I'd give -- as you know acquired a couple of assets recently that were development targets right out of the gate. It was leased. We acquired a lease in place but had generally maybe 12 months of remaining term and we\u2019ll exclude something like that because that\u2019s intentional targeted lease rolls that were planned for redevelopments. But it\u2019s a very solid retention rate. You could tell from our occupancy stats and our leasing performance that it's all very consistent, so very strong retention. Rich Anderson : Okay, and then looking at the leasing schedule, average lease term of 4.3 years for this quarter, it's kind of moved around that number over the past few quarters. What is your kind of desire, to make that a longer or shorter number, considering the strength of the markets? Joel Marcus : Yes, it depends Rich, so much on the nature of the lease, the nature of the location and multi-tenant buildings with companies that grow rapidly and need flexibility on space. Three, five, seven years are kind of where the sweet spot is and then you get into the development. You see this quarter was about over 10 years. So you see in the larger blocks of space 10, 15, 20. That\u2019s really how it's broken down for years, and years and we don\u2019t expect to change that. Rich Anderson : Okay. And then thinking of NAV, you\u2019re developing to 7% to 8% stabilized return. What you think -- if you were to turn around and just sell those assets upon stabilization, what do you think the market would purchase those assets for? Joel Marcus : Well, of course it depends on what market you are in. Rich Anderson : I\u2019d say Cambridge. So let's go high. Joel Marcus : Well, I think you\u2019re probably in potential sub five cap rate. Rich Anderson : Okay. And where do you think a range would be? If that\u2019s the floor, do you think it could be six of us at the top or depending on where you are in the country? Joel Marcus : Well again, it depends on the nature of the building. If you have an older multi-tenant building, it would be higher than five, but if you have a new Class A facility with a long term lease and the credit tenant you\u2019re not going to be above that. Rich Anderson : Got you. And then last question. You took Asia out of the occupancy statistics. I know you have a dedicated sheet for Asia on Page 47, but I\u2019m curious, is there anything symbolic about why you did that? Is there any change of strategy in Asia or if you can comment on that please. Joel Marcus : No change. There is really -- Asia is a such small portion of our business, and as you know we\u2019re really focused on our domestic growth opportunities here. So we continue to focus on the lease up of our properties there, but we have some work ahead. But again it\u2019s a small piece of the business. Rich Anderson : It is small, but do you think the long-term strategy is to be there at some point in five, 10 years or something like that? Joel Marcus : I\u2019d say -- it\u2019s hard to speculate. I think we yield nicely in India on the operating assets and you can tell from our disclosures, China has been a little tougher on the returns. But it\u2019s hard to speculate going forward. But I think it\u2019s clear we\u2019re not trying to put any significant new capital into those markets. Clearly investors and management and the board et cetera want us to focus on our core urban clusters here in the United States. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Michael Knott from Green Street Advisors. Kevin Tyler : It\u2019s actually Kevin Tyler here. You commented earlier on Mid-Cambridge then you just give some color as it relates to cap rates in Cambridge overall, but the lease yield reported -- cash lease yield was about 5.9 as you said on 640 Memorial Drive, and I guess I was just curious -- based on the activity in that market, what is an appropriate spread between Mid-Cambridge and Kendall Square let say? And if this was 5.9 and Joe you say 5.4 high quality in Cambridge, how do you kind of explain that differential. Joel Marcus : Unfortunately Tom is not here. So we\u2019ll make a note and ask that question during our next call, but let me give you my own view on that. There could be -- again, it so much depends on the nature of the facility itself, new versus somewhat data is at multi-tenant, single-tenant, made term the lease credit and then exactly where it is. So 640 Memorial Drive, I think it\u2019s encumbered by a ground lease. So that\u2019s one thing. It is Mid-Cambridge. It is a really developed fairly new facility but has two tenants, long term leases. So that was in the heart of Kendall Square. My guess is maybe 50 basis points. It may drop to a five, five. Dean Shigenaga : There is no upside on those rents as well. They are long term. There is no near term ability to try to mark-to-market. So it\u2019s more of the stabilized asset. Joel Marcus : It could even be -- maybe better said between 50 and 100 basis points between Mid-Cambridge and Cambridge. Kevin Tyler : Okay, thanks. On the development side you guys are continuing to talk about bringing development down. As a percent of gross investment I think the number you're quoting is 13% in the first quarter. But is there any broader read through on that number kind through a shift in strategy, acquisitions versus development going forward? And then how much of the reduction can you ascribe to portfolio growth or just recent deliveries. Joel Marcus : Yes, so maybe I\u2019ll talk to strategy and let Dean talk to the arithmetical calculation. And on strategy -- no change in strategy. We view ourselves really as best at creating value through development and re-development. We do take the opportunity on occasion to look at acquisition. 640 Memorial Drive was unusual for us. Tech Square was right up our sweet spot, because we've covered it. We've approached MIT for years actually and trying to buy that interest but they haven\u2019t been ready, because they didn\u2019t have a use of proceed. And then they kind of decided they were ready. So it kind of just depends, but I think it's fair to say that we believe we can create better value by creating value, not buying somebody else's value. Dan Ryan : Yes. And let me add some color. I would say that the land bank dropping down to 13%, or I should say non income producing assets as a percentage of growth real estate declines to 13%, and that's really through -- substantially through deliveries, offset a little bit increase in construction spend. If you want to put that into perspective though, that\u2019s still roughly 1.4 billion of non-income producing assets with 50% of that being active projects, which as you is highly leased, and about another 25% another of that number sits in near term which is in Cambridge 50 Binney, 60 Binney and 100 Binney. So I think we've got a good sized future pipeline but I think to put that number into further perspective, back in 2007 it was still about $1.3 billion. The Company was much smaller. So as we grow in size, that percentage will naturally become a smaller piece of our business, while still providing us great opportunities to grow respectively with build-to-suit opportunities. And I think our focus will be just being very careful and prudent on how much land we carry at any given point in time so we can minimize the carry and deliver product to the market as quickly as we can. Operator : (Operator Instruction) And we'll go next to Dave Rodgers from Baird. Dave Rodgers : Joel, one question for you with regard to the backlog of demand and interest in your four key hub market. Are you seeing -- or what's the breakdown maybe between tech office or traditional office and kind of lab demand? And I guess the gist of the question is, one, are lab tenants in any particular market being priced out by higher rents? And two, are there any particular markets where the lab demand has really ebbed as the tech office demand has been flowing? Joel Marcus : Yes, I would say maybe just taking around the country real quickly, I think Seattle tech demand and lab demand have been fairly steady there. I think again its very site specific. In San Francisco clearly tech demand -- I think as Steve has indicated, if you took a benchmark today, it's probably 10x of what lab demand is. But yet certain markets remain pretty key hot beds of laboratory properties South San Francisco, Mission Bay, even though Uber's coming in. But I think some of the other markets have gravitated or stayed much more tech. San Diego, I don\u2019t know, Dan, you could you speak to that. Dan Ryan : Yes, I think that we find that the life science demand is more significant than the tech demand. Joel Marcus : And then moving to the other side of the country, I think in Research Triangle Park, really the ag demand and tech is really dominated there. Maryland is pretty much kind of lab. We haven\u2019t seen a big tech influence there. New York, we're pretty much focused on life science there. We haven\u2019t really gravitated to tech for our center. But obviously Silicon Ally and what's going on in New York City, certainly some of the other REITs have been very strong tech demand. But we think that\u2019s -- we're creating a life science market there. So it's a little different for us. And then Cambridge -- clearly lab or office -- lab office or office by lab companies is still a main stay. But there is increasing demand by big tech users. So we're seeing both of it. So a little bit of different story in each of the markets. I don\u2019t think any significant lab tenant is getting priced out of the market, because if you look at the health of the bio tech industry and the pharma industry, it's the best it's ever been for those two industries. So they\u2019ve got more than $200 billion on balance sheet. And so if they want a site, they'll go after it and if they're competing against a big tech tenant, they can certainly go head to head. Dave Rodgers : I'm assuming that Uber building is not a lab ready building. Are there any other new construction projects of the major variety that you're looking at or you started there are not going to be kind of lab ready at some point in the future? Joel Marcus : Maybe let's say it's not lab ready. It would be -- lab capable would maybe be a better way to say it. Clearly Townsend in we are likely sign a lease here on the very near-term with a brand name tech tenant. And then Binney, it's kind of a combination of who is bidding on that between life science and tech. So we'll see what shakes out there. But generally if we build a building -- and I think Tom and Steve had gone through this in a prior call, we try to -- if it's in the sweet spot of a Cambridge or a Mission Bay, we would make it lab capable and it's just a few bucks a foot to do that. Dave Rodgers : Of your 20 tenants, I think AstraZeneca is the only one that comes up in the next two years or before the end of 2016 with a major maturity. I think its 350,000 square feet. Are you having any discussions with them or can you talk at all about that tenant and their desire to be in that space? Dean Shigenaga : Well, I think there's a few leases there. Some of it comes up early. The reason why it's got 1.7 remaining years is some of this comes up in early '15. Half of that space that does come up in early '15 I think has been resolved and has been leased. We're still working on the remainder of that and that's probably about a third of that ABR that I'm referring to of that $9.3 million.  I don't have the details Dave on the other stuff with me. Joel Marcus : But I think it's fair to say under the new leadership of Pascal Soriot, they obviously thwarted the Pfizer takeover. They've made a big presence -- continued significant presence through their MedImmune acquisition in the Maryland market. They have a big presence in the Boston market. So they are not retrenching in any of the locations that we've seen. Dean Shigenaga : Dave, I think the other two leases go out to '18 and '19. So it's really weighted by a near-term rule. Operator : And we will go next to Jim Sullivan from Cowen Group. Jim Sullivan : Joel, I wonder if you could give us kind of a top down summary of your view of East Cambridge and mid-Cambridge. And what I'm referring to is that obviously the Volpe site I gather is still under discussion negotiation, I guess with the GSA and we keep hearing about not just yourself but your peers in MIT looking to increase density where they can on sites that they control. And then of course I guess there's a local community pressure to increase the amount of residential space anytime any increased density is provided. And as you think about the value creation opportunities in East Cambridge, as well I guess those value creation opportunities in the adjacent market and mid-Cambridge, maybe you can kind of summarize for us how much square feet -- additional square feet might be entitled in the next couple of years in East Cambridge and kind of relate that to the demand that you foresee continuing or emerging over the next two years? Joel Marcus : Yes, that's a question again I would probably punt on that to Tom and will try to address that in the next call. But let me just say this. There is right now about 2.3 million square feet of demand from at least seven major potential tenants, seeking blocks greater than 100,000 square feet just in the East Cambridge area. And so if you just look at what's out there just at this moment in time the numbers are pretty significant. MIT has a big development that they are working. I'd suspect that some of the capital that we've provided them will go into that. It's a pretty large site that they will be able entitle and build on, I think probably over the next maybe over the next -- begin over the 18 to 24 months. The Volpe site is a large site that -- a couple of million square feet including both commercial and residential. Obviously probably every developer between Boston and New York is looking at that. There is the North Point site which is -- at the moment has not been in favor, a couple of million square feet up there both on commercial and residential. We understand that that actually is in play right now. It was owned by a private equity shop here out of Los Angeles and they're looking to market it. We've heard that there is a lot of foreign interest in that particular site. And then others are looking to add density, as you know Boston Properties et cetera. So there is a pretty big -- there's a pretty big movement to expand entitlements and capabilities and availabilities in that market. But there is somewhat tougher Cambridge council now looking at all kinds of issues including both residential and obviously traffic demands, and just demand on city services. So I think those are the kinds of things that will be balanced and be meted out over time. So I think there is great opportunity, but there is also timeframes. We happen to have hit a very sweet spot. Actually just you'd always like to think you're really smart but luck helps a lot with our 50 Binney, 60 Binney and 100 Binney. We hit a time when there is virtually nothing else that competes with us on a class A ground up construction basis in that market in the time went rents are at -- approaching all-time highs. So I think we feel very fortunate about that, but we're always on the lookout to make sure that our three and five year plans are cognizant of the growth in those markets. And we think both East-Cambridge and Mid-Cambridge makes sense. You have to remember too there is Alston [ph], which is a gigantic future development which Harvard manages over on the other side of the campus across the river, and that could provide huge amount of space and growth for the next generation of companies. But that's probably five to 10 year out project. So a lot going on in that market. Jim Sullivan : Yes. can you also just remind us when these sites might include as part of an increased density entitlement, the development of residential what your philosophy is and how you're going to handle that if you do get entitled to do residential? Are you bringing [indiscernible]? Joel Marcus : Yes, we've been required to build certain residential on the Binney street quarter. I think it's about 273. Dean Shigenaga : Yes, 273 is the first project. It's probably about 90 some odd units and it's probably an investment in the $40 million - $45 million range for that project. Joel Marcus : Yes. So that's part of the give and take that we had with Cambridge a number of years ago when we entitled and up-zoned our Binney street sites. So that's just part of doing business. In New York, a lot of developers are facing the same issue, how to address the housing issue. That obviously is front and center with the mayor. So I think a lot of -- and I think San Francisco over time, workforce housing is going to be a very important issue for a lot of companies in a lot of cities. Jim Sullivan : And in terms of doing that, your approach should be to do it on your own balance sheet, not bring in a partner? Joel Marcus : We talked to a partner but in our case in Cambridge it was small enough that it made sense. What our long term hold on it, we don't really know. We're not really a residentially holder for I think long term, but we haven't made any short term decisions. But I think part of being a commercial developer today in urban innovation cluster centers is the reality that residential is going to be front and center in some cases. Jim Sullivan : Okay and then finally for me, you've mentioned in the past digital health as a segment of life sciences where you thought we were in the early stages of maybe some material demand growth. And I'm just curious. There was a lot of capital formation in that. And I wondered if you could just remind us whether you anticipate digital health as a demand segment to be concentrated in any of your existing submarkets? Joel Marcus : Yes, so far we see it more importantly in the city of San Francisco. A number of companies who are really brand names in that area have grown up. They occupy at the moment kind of tech office space. I think the challenge with digital health -- and I do think it will be an important segment as time goes on is you have kind of a juxtaposition. You have the baby boom generation needing more healthcare services but less capable when it comes to social media and electronic kind of digital if you will tools to implement that health and then you have on the other end a millennial generation, highly sophisticated in the digital world but not caring a whole lot about health because when you're 15 or 20 or 25, your health, there are exceptions to that -- generally is in good shape. So this industry is still in the formative stages. There's a lot of venture capital going into it. But it will probably take three to five years to begin to kind of shake out and mature. But it is here to stay and this intersection between healthcare and the digital world will clearly make an important cost impact difference over time for sure. Operator : And it appears that we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the program back over to Mr. Marcus for some closing remarks. Joel Marcus : Okay, well thank you very much. We did it in less than an hour and we'll look forward to talking to you on the first quarter call. Thanks again everybody. Operator : And this does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

My name is Blesia and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note today's event is being recorded. I will turn the call over to Rhonda Chiger. Rhonda Chiger : Thank you and good afternoon. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Federal securities laws. The company's actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements; additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the Company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus. Please go ahead. Joel Marcus : Thanks Rhonda and welcome everybody to our first quarter 2015 call. With me today are Dean Shigenaga, Peter Moglia, Steve Richardson and Dan Ryan and Tom Andrews and we finally decided hold this call with investor despite what [indiscernible] said. The story of the first quarter is strong leasing in our development pipeline and needless to say very proud of our entire teams very strong first quarter performance across the entire company. Our long term strategic optionality planning is paying significant dividend, we\u2019re in the best sub markets with the best assets and operations and taking advantage of really timing of exceptional market demand giving us significant pricing power. There is really a perfect confluence of significant science and technology demand for our urban innovation campuses. It's really all about acquisition, retention of talent and 10 years and now 2025 [millennial\u2019s] will make up 75% of the work force. So companies are very, very attuned to location. What we just said about demand, the very limited supply coupled with our timing of deliveries of our embedded development pipeline which is highly leased and with very strong yields equals really a compelling internal and external growth story.  We're pleased to say that 52% of our ABR is from investment grade client tenants and when you combine that with our average lease duration of the top 20 tenants comprising 50% of our ABR more or less gives is about 9 years that gives us strong cash flow and high quality long term tenants. Dean will talk about guidance we updated the midpoint of guidance of 522 approximating 8.5% growth plus a 3% dividend which gives an investor double digit growth for 2015. Science & Technology entities are really at the four fronts of growth and leadership in this innovation oriented economy as I said competing for the best talent and best innovation sub markets. If we go to Life Science industry it's clear there are a number of pretty compelling factors that work including better and faster FDA approvals as we\u2019ve discussed in fact in the first quarter there were 10 new drug approvals and 50% were ARE tenants and in fact today Biogen CEO George Scangos, longtime friend and client of ours announced that Biogen was committing $2.5 billion to Alzheimer\u2019s research in their R&D budget. More NIH funding is coming, next generation big bio-techs have emerged and really have become really have become very dominant, very strong venture backed companies have emerged with much longer run ways than previously. Big Farma\u2019s in very good shape and migrating the urban cores, personalize medicine and effective targeted therapies have really come of age and increasingly the life science industry is turning to tech platforms to drive new insights and bolster business. Commentary on yesterday's sell off a bit bio techs were broadly down, especially the small and mid-cap about 3% to 5%. But the groups been up 15% year to date, 50% of the past year and it\u2019s tripled over the last three years so the sector remains a market leader, no specific catalyst and trading volumes were certainly not alarming. On the tech sectors, the tech sector PE is about 5% lower than the S&P market the favorable earnings growth certainly is a part of the tech sector, favorable long term secular trends driving growth including corporate networking security which is in everybody's mind, smart mobility, explosive e-commerce growth, adoption of cloud computing and importantly digital health to name a few. On the internal growth operations in the leasing side we had a very strong quarter of about a 1 million square feet leased with strong rental rate increases, of this square footage leased 40% was from Greater Boston and 31% from San Diego and 84% of the cash increase was from Greater Boston leases. Occupancy, Dean will comment on, will likely stay flatter or decline just a bit in the next quarter due to two move outs Dean will mention and we had very good same property NOI growth. On the external growth side it's clear to say we have more opportunities than we can undertake, our current pipeline 60 Binney 250,000 square foot, we really are now down to two prospective tenants and expect I think leasing progress in the second quarter hopefully above pro forma. A 100 Binney in the near term pipeline we are about to secure an anchor lease we've signed at an LOI for more than half the building and we expect to kick off construction here in the not too distant future. It's also important to remember our current future development opportunities plus additional SAR that may, been embedded there is worth noting approximately 3.2 million square feet, Seattle with about 452,000 square feet, San Francisco 1.1 million square feet, San Diego about 1 million square feet, Greater Boston about 150,000 and New York City about 420,000. I will leave Dean's comments on balance sheet and guidance and then finally on the dividend, we're clearly going to increase cash flows that will be shared with the shareholders so look for continued dividend increases through the year based on Board decisions and I will turn it over to Peter. Peter Moglia : Okay, good afternoon. I think I will make some comments on the investment market and cap rates. The national investment market has continued to be health through the first quarter of 2015 illustrated by a further compression in cap rate of 5 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2014 for a national average of 6.11% according to the PWC Korpacz Investor Survey. Alexandria's strategy to focus our allocation of capital into the innovation gateway coastal cities of Boston, Cambridge, New York City, San Diego, San Francisco and Seattle continues to drive our NAV higher as the year-over-year cap rate compression in those markets was two times that the year-over-year national average at 34 basis points. According to the PWC survey the office sector in particular is expected to lead the industry in terms of value growth followed by warehouse, lodging, apartments and retail which is mostly attributed to a continuation of improving fundamentals and the focus on office investment from foreign capital and pension funds. There was one notable lifetime stay to report in the first quarter which occurred in the Seattle region where 307 Westlake and South Lake Union traded for a 5.6% cap rate and a record price per square foot of $859. This acted very similar to another lab office asset at South Lake Union 401 Terry which traded in the first quarter of 2014 at a 6% cap rate and $755 per square foot. Given that the assets are within a couple of blocks from each other and occupied by similar non-credit tenant research institutions on long-term leases these trades are a good barometer for the cap rate compression that lab office assets have experienced over the past year.  During Investor Day we noted an office sales comp at 25/1st Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts also known as the Davenport building. That sales comp originally speculated at 4% has been confirmed at 4.55% and a price per square foot of $637. A follow on to that was the closing of One Memorial Drive at a 4.9% cap rate and a healthy $1,096 per square foot. Also noted during Investor Day but repeated here for those who may have missed it, was a comp that gave some long awaited price discovery in South San Francisco. 701 Gateway, an office building which is in close proximity to a number of Alexandria assets traded [indiscernible] at a 5.5% cap rate. There are a number of projects being keyed up there that were affirmed by this comp. Adjacent to Mission Bay tech office building 444 De Haro Place in Potrero Hill traded to Ares Management for a 4.5% cap rate and $669 per square foot. This asset had just been stabilized with major leases executed in 2014 for 75% of the building. To wrap up my comments I want to acknowledge that we continue to monitor the movements in interest rates and still believe that although recent days show that leading indicators appear to have turned higher on a month-to-month basis consensus investor sentiment remains negative on the rate outlook but appears to be validated 10 year treasury yields remaining near lows and the fed's lower rate cap forecast during the last FOMC meeting. With that I will hand it over to Steve. Steve Richardson : Thank you Peter and good afternoon everybody. The San Francisco to Stanford clusters theme is really one of broad and deep demand. As life science requirements total in excess of 2 million square feet which is up significantly from six months ago and another 8 million plus square feet of tech office demand of which 2.7 million square feet is in the City of San Francisco alone. Alexandria's leadership position in developing creative and collaborative urban campuses is creating tremendous interest in the market we are fully engaged with deep and trusted see sweet relationships across both the science and technology industries with at least five users seeking unique big blocks in access of 200,000 square feet. A deeper dive in the market shows the robust leasing activity in the mid-range side as well as past quarter. Uber leased 300,000 square feet at 555 and 685 market streets. Lending club is doubled its footprint to 252,000 square feet with a lease of 112,000 square feet comprise of eight floors at 595 market. [Advent] software renewed its lease of 129,000 square feet at 600 Townsend Street, just down the road from our 510 Townsend project. [indiscernible] leased 120,000 square feet at 221 Main Street. We Works has leases pending for 91,000 square feet at 995 Market and 1161 Mission, while [Mix Pana] leased 65,000 square feet at 405 Howard and Omnicons leased another 45,000 square feet at 600 California. With all this activity we anticipate lease rate for new product will be pushing beyond mid 50 triple net and into the mid 60 triple net given the mix of high demand and limited availability more particularly we have no availability in Mission Bay and just 3.4% in the SoMa district down 300 bips from 6.4% during 1Q, 2014.  At 510 Townsend Street we are on track for securing entitlement during late summer of this year and have signed a long term full building lease with a disruptive technology company, Stride. We expect to break ground later in the year and we'll provide further color in the coming months and timing and delivery. Mission Bay as we've noted is very health with continued in bound interest as well as existing tenant seeking expansion with Warriors breaking ground later this year and our JV with Uber on track this is become truly a unique Urban destination. Our regional teams 30 years of experience and relationships across the political governmental and brokerage realms as well as the science and tech industries has positioned the company for continued out performance in the San Francisco market. Moving a bit South we're seeing a quite bit of resurgence of activity in South San Francisco which is 1% vacancy we have seen our Amgen Onyx campus just brought some market for sub lease but we do have in place long term leases at the campus with an investment grade tenant there. Lease rates are now pushing well into the mid-40s and higher for existing product. And finally the 98.5% regional occupancy reported in the sub has already been resolved, so we're back in 100% and the mark-to-market of rent places leases provides for further growth with approximately 10% cash and 15.2% on a GAAP basis. With that let me hand it over to Tom. Tom Andrews : Thanks good afternoon everyone its Tom Andrews, I\u2019ll be talking about the greater Boston region. So the greater Boston life science market continues to enjoy very favorable supply demand characteristics in the highly desired East Cambridge and Kendall Square sub-market where areas that\u2019s a concentrated. Class A lab vacancy is around 3% and office vacancy is around 5% and overall Cambridge vacancy is sub 10% for all categories of both office and labs space. We're tracking about 2 million square feet of lab demand and nearly 2.5 million square feet of office demand focus in Cambridge and that\u2019s in an approximately 18 million square foot total market. Demand is coming from multi-national both life science and technology companies entering the market to newly public clinical stage drug companies, to well capitalize venture backed firms all are desiring a close proximity to MIT and the amenity rich Kendall square neighborhood surrounding the campus. Overall, areas occupancy in the region kicked up about 140 basis points to 98.9% occupancy in our 4.3 million square foot operating portfolio. As one would expect the tightness in the market has resulted in the substantial increase in asking rents for both laboratory and office. Class A lab asking rents have moved from the mid to high 50 triple net into and through the 60s and we're now seeing some offers in the 70s triple net. In the office market current asking rents for Class A Kendall square office space solidly in 50s and 60s on a triple net basis which equates to 70s and 80s on a gross basis. This has created a sense of urgency among tenants of all size and when possible we\u2019re using this market dynamic to lock down early renewals as with the 83,500 square foot office renewal with MIT at 600 Tech square were we are able achieve a near doubling of the net rent compared with expiring rent. We were pleased to welcome Santa Fe to our Alexandria center at Kendall square project as they have committed to a long term lease of 251,000 square feet at 50 Binney Street. We are now in active negotiation as Joel mentioned with multiple users for the approximately 270,000 square foot 60 Binney portion of that project which is now under construction. And also as Joel mentioned we've singed a letter of intent for about half of the approximately 417,000 square foot near term development project at 100 Binney Street which is the only shovel ready commercial development site in Kendall square at this time. So based on this we're expect to be able to announce one or more additional large lease deals in the coming quarters at Alexandria Center at Kendall Square. In March also at ACKS we delivered 388,000 square foot 75/125 Binney project which is 99% leased to ARIAD pharmaceutical. ARIAD as we've been tracking over past several quarters is entertaining a handful possible subway scenarios for up to about 40% of that project, they continue to work on design of their own tenant improvements and we expect them to occupy a significant portion of their space early in 2016. At Longwood Center in Boston which is our joint venture development project in which we are a 27.5% owner, we are in negotiations with prospects representing over a 103,000 square feet of additional space and if completed these leases would bring us to 63% occupancy in this 413,000 square project with three full floors remaining to lease in the nine story building. We are encouraged here by a modestly higher level of tenant activity in the sub market in recent months. And finally I would note that we are expecting an on time delivery in early May of the fully leased 112,000 square foot redevelopment project at 225 2nd Avenue in Waltham. And I am going next to Dean. Dean Shigenaga : Thanks Tom, Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon everybody. I just want to cover three important topics, first off our continued strong performance in the first quarter, second our disciplined allocation of capital in excess to diverse sources of capital and lastly and important NAV related matter. As you know our strategic focus on unique collaborative science and technology campuses and urban innovations clusters drove very strong results in the first quarter. We've reported FFO per share of $1.28 up 9.4% over the first quarter of '14 up $0.05 or 4.1% over the fourth quarter of '14. Our FFO per share results exceeded consensus by $0.02. We refined our range for FFO per share guidance for 2015 from $0.20 to $0.10 and increased the midpoint of our guidance $0.02 to $5.22, directly reflecting continuing strong rental rate increases on lease renewals and re-leasing of space. As Tom had mentioned we executed several leases in Greater Boston with significant cash and GAAP rental rate increases driven significantly by a lease for about 84,000 rentable square feet at Technology Square with a cash rent increasing from $25 triple net to approximately $53 triple net. A significant portion of this rental rate increase was anticipated in our guidance and we achieved a higher increase than anticipated which drove a portion of the increase in our guidance for 2015. We are well positioned with a high quality asset base located in key coastal gateway cities with high barriers to entry, extremely limited supply of existing cloud [based] space and very limited future development product in comparison to the significant demand. Our overall mark-to-market print in place leases today in San Francisco and Greater Boston generally range from 10% to 20% with opportunities for significant steps on a select number of early renewals. As noted at Investor Day in December of '14 we had two single tenant properties with expirations in the second quarter of '15, one lease for about a 128,000 rentable square feet at 19 Presidential Way in Woburn, Massachusetts expires on May 31st of 2015 at a rental rate of $25 per square foot triple net. We have another lease for about 82,000 square feet at 2525 NC Highway 54 in Durham, North Carolina that expired on April 24th at a rate of $13 per square foot triple net and we are currently marketing both spaces for lease. As Joel hinted this will result in a temporary decline in occupancy by about one half of 1% in the second quarter as these expirations are offset by lease up of some vacancy in our asset base and remain on track to hit our target range of occupancy from 96.9% to 97.4% by year end. Our balance sheet is in excellent shape and I will review our capital plan in a moment, we remain very disciplined in our development activities with highly leased development projects and non-income producing assets are now 12%. We continue to execute on our long-term strategy to deliver growth in FFO per share and NAV, while also improving our net debt to adjusted EBITDA so less than seven times by year end. Leverage as of quarter end was 7.5 times and represents the high point for leverage for 2015 and will decline in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. Moving on to our disciplined allocation of capital and access to diverse sources of capital, 86% of our capital for 2015 is focused on highly dynamic and collaborative campuses in key coastal science and technology gateway cities that inspire innovation including Cambridge, Mission Bay and SoMa, Manhattan and [Toir Pines] in the ETC market. Our capital plan for the year at the midpoint of our guidance includes approximately 1.15 billion with approximately 490 million or 43% expected from net cash provided by operating activities after dividends, incremental debt and a non-cash acquisition in the form of a tax deferred structure. The remaining midpoint of 655 million or 57% of the 1.15 billion is detailed on page four of our supplemental package. We have identified asset sales aggregating 475 million and are working on the remainder of our capital plan of approximately $180 million. We expect to expand our access to capital with the sale of an interest in 225 Binney Street to a top tier JV partner by near year end. We have completed or we have three dispositions for the year keyed up including two single tenant Class A buildings, one in South San Francisco and one in Cambridge and the residential project located in Cambridge. All three dispositions are at various stages of negotiations and are expected to close this year accordingly our comments on this transaction will be limited until each sale is completed. At the midpoint of our guidance these three sales are projected to generate roughly 370 million in proceeds based upon 16 million of cash NOI and this includes 80% of the NOI for 225 Binney Street at the midpoint of our target JV interest. The proceeds from the sales are waited toward the later part of 2015 as for the remainder of the capital roughly 180 million that we're solving for over the next quarter or so approximately 40% will be sourced from real estate sales to be identified over the next several months and the remainder of approximately 100 million maybe source through additional asset sales or through very limited use of our ATN program. We prefer not speculate on potential sales that have not been identified. But we will continue to focus on sales of both operating properties and land. More importantly we will continue to provide disclosers of specific sales when they\u2019re identified and classified its held-for-sale. Briefly our ATN program has about 150 million remaining and is scheduled to expire in early June. We do expect to re-file our program later this year and do not expect to utilize any significant amount under this new ATN program. This is the perfect time to remind everybody about our desire to utilize various options to fund our highly leased value creation development projects. In a manner that will allow us to deliver long term value to our shareholders while remaining prudent and disciplined with the issuance of common equity. Assets sales are at an important component of sources of capital and we will continue to focus in growth and FFO per share and net asset value while we fund our highly leased value creation projects. Briefly on debt transactions for the rest of the year really consist of the following partial repayment and extension of the maturity of our 375 million 2016 unsecured term loan. We expect to expand the maturity date to 2021. Our goal remains the same we will continue to reduce our outstanding term loan balances over the next few years. This partial repayment and extension of the maturity date provides flexibility for our capital structure while extending our weighted average maturity. After extending the 2016 maturity date we will focus on reducing the outstanding balance under our 2019 unsecured term loan. As noted in prior calls we do expect to issue unsecured bonds this year before any meaningful increases in all in pricing settles in. We believe all in pricing today for 10 year bond to be in the range of 3.5% to 3.7%. We are also considering a secured construction loan for 50, 60 Binney Street in Cambridge which will cover a portion of our funding for this project later this year. We're also considering a secured construction loan for JV development at 1455/1515 Third Street in Mission Bay and this loan will cover funding needs that really began in 2017 after both the company and our partner fund initial construction cost. Lastly on important NAV matter on March 24 we delivered 99% of 75, 125 Binney Street to ARIAD Pharmaceuticals. From an NAV perspective most models likely value this 99% lease property above our investment to date. But likely at a discount until placed in the service cash rents commence immediately upon delivery however about a year and half of free rent on a 15 year lease really we\u2019re spread over the first two years of the lease. As a result about 80% of the annual rents of about $30 million represent straight liner rent. Accordingly 80% of the value of this property will likely be eliminated in models that back out straight line rent in order to drive value based on the capitalization rate on in place cash NOI. Full cash rents of $76.50 began on April of 2017. So we encourage investor to carefully review the full valuation of this class A property and there NAV models as they update them. Lastly in closing the detail assumptions underlying our updated guidance for 2015 are included on page 3 and 4 of our supplemental package which really are in a unique position with strong demand for class A assets and key coastal gateway cities our capital plan is grown for value creation opportunities primarily in SoMa and in Mission Bay while we strategically fund our growth through additional asset sales. We also are continuing to focus on our strategy of generating growth and FFO per share and net asset value.  We believe we have the right assets and the right location and the best to roster of client tenants and remain focused on continuing to build our best in class franchisee. With that I\u2019ll turn it back to Joel. Joel Marcus : Thank you Dean. Operator, let's open it up for Q&A please. Operator : [Operator Instruction] We'll go first to Smedes Rose of Citigroup. Smedes Rose : I was just wondering if you could talk a little more about your rational for selling a majority interest to 225 Binney why that asset and maybe your thoughts around that? Dean Shigenaga : So I think as you look through capital planning being very fluid as you look at trends in the market place as well as different sources of capital. Given our needs to fund about 1.1 billion roughly, 1.2 billion of needs this year. We've laid out a capital strategy I think that has been somewhat dynamic but also prudent and discipline in tapping of variety of sources of capital to blend our cost of capital. And I think in prior calls we've mentioned as well as in the general market you get a good sense by pricing for high quality real estate is attractive capital for the company. And as a result JV interest in a project by 225 Binney fully leased modest steps in rents overtime will allow us to really tap the value we created on this project, which keep in mind was initially delivered a probably [7.5 to 7.7] initial yield when we completed this project. And if we can tap a market cap rate today which we'll described when we complete the transaction will be able to monetize some of the value creation and reinvest that capital under value creation projects. So hopefully that helps. Smedes Rose : And then I just wanted to ask I know you noted that Amgen space has just been brought back to market in South San Francisco. What's your thought I guess on demand for that and the kind of maybe the pace of sub leasing it? Steve Richardson : Again it's really resurgence of activity in the South San Francisco market you've got just 1% direct vacancy. So as we've got a number of second cohort companies that are maturing there I think the possibility of sub leasing looks brighter than perhaps it did on their other projects along [indiscernible] Cove. So we're in constant contact with the Amgen team as we have been for years and we'll see how it unfolds, but I'm encourage. Operator : We'll go next to Nick Yulico of UBS. Nick Yulico : Couple of questions, one on the sales the residential site, this plan in Cambridge. Can you remind us what the cost was -- is to build that project? Dean Shigenaga : We're probably in somewhere just around low $40 million probably at the point we will be completed with the project. Nick Yulico : So you expect to sell that some sort of premium to that, I imagine? Dean Shigenaga : I think the way to think about the residential site is that it was a component of a large entitlement effort, a component of our overall Binney Street development. There is a component they have lower price units within in the residential development. So I'd say that we expect to breakeven to a slight gain on the transaction. But keep in mind that it's a component of the larger development and since we don\u2019t want to long term holders of the Red B side we\u2019ve chosen to sell and recycle that capital. Joel Marcus : The numbers of buyers for it really is astounding, in the several dozen. Nick Yulico : Okay, so if we're tiring to figure out to put any possible cap rate on the stable cells if we allocate somewhere above cost or around that for the residential that would be good enough math. Dean Shigenaga : Yes that gives you a very good sense for an estimate on the cap rate on average for the two transactions that we're talking about -- looking at selling and as we mentioned we'll provide more color when we complete each of the sales. Peter Moglia : This is Peter Moglia I just wanted to add one thing, that the rents is being touched on are significantly impacted by an affordable component which was the part of the entitlement agreement we have with the city of Cambridge. So if you apply the market rent to the whole thing and then apply a cap rate to that you might be off and so I think roughly about 40% of it is limited to affordable. But we fully expect a market cap rate on that NOI. Nick Yulico : And then just turning to these possible acquisitions of additional sites in Mission Bay and SoMa. Can you just talk about it sounds like one of the deals in OP unit deal and then also one of these might be life science office projects possibly yields and whether these would you think with fall under Prop M allocations? Thanks. Dean Shigenaga : Yes, I think we'll not -- if you don't mind comment on that anymore, we\u2019ll comment in detail and obviously our disclosure will have by chapter reverse on that, when the time comes but I think, given pending transactions better to say nothing. I think, Steve could give you, 60 second primer on Prop M though. Steve Richardson : Yes, it's Steve Richardson. Prop M right now, there is supply in the pipeline, we anticipate that winding down with two large projects that will probably garner allocation and then certainly 5,000 to 10,000 in the summary as we've discussed. So really seeing the impact of Prop M in the later half from 2016 and then beyond into 2017. Nick Yulico : Okay, guys, thanks. Just when you talk about this non cash acquisition as a source of capital, is that an OP unit deal or is that something else? Dean Shigenaga : In essence yes. Nick Yulico : Okay, thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Jim Sullivan of Cowen Group. Jim Sullivan : Thank you. Back in December, at the Analyst Day, you had noted that you're leasing steps expectations for the year we're in the 14% to 17% range on the GAAP basis. First quarter was obviously well ahead of that. In that result I think you would attributed in part to the locations where the leases were made, you talked about Cambridge, of course in California and I just wonder if you could kind of update us on the -- on your expectations for the steps of the year, is that still that same range 14 to 17, number one; and number two, kind of is part of that, I wondered if you could kind of review your sense of the mark-to-market in the portfolio outside of Cambridge and San Francisco, San Diego. Dean Shigenaga : So Jim, it's a Dean Shigenaga, I think when you think of our leasing steps this quarter almost 31% on a GAAP basis and our range of guidance of 14 to 17. I would first highlight at the challenge with updating the range in an extremely healthy environment that we're in today with tremendous demand and very limited supply, is it\u2019s hard to forecast the upside that is off low and I'd also add that this is only the first quarter that represents only 25% of our activity for the year, it was home run quarter. I'd imagine that on average the rest of the activity is going to be closure line with our guidance with the [indiscernible] that we're in a very strong market that presents some upside on the leasing activity that we've execute on going forward and I forgot what the second questions was. Jim Sullivan : On that mark-to-market and other regions? Steve Richardson : Jim, its Steve Richardson, so if you look at Cambridge roughly at 59 cash, roughly 10% in San Francisco, San Diego we've got about nearly 5% in [Tori Pines] maybe 2% overall. Given some limited rollover there and then in New York we're at about 2% as well. We obviously have a lot of recent deliveries there so just hasn\u2019t matured to a point. And then Maryland we're in positive territory as well on a cash basis 2%, 3.3% on a GAAP basis. Then in Seattle looking solid on GAAP basis 10.6% and 2.0% on a cash basis, RTP similarly 12% on a GAAP basis and 7.8% on a cash basis. So across the board, we're certainly positive mark-to-market and I think certainly seeing Maryland and RTP recovers, stabilize and now moving the positive territory is an encouraging sign Jim Sullivan : Is it kind of fair to conclude Dean and Steve based on all of those comments that as we look over the expiration schedule looking out not just for '15 but for '16 and '17 given that the average base rent on expiring and I\u2019m talking in total here is fairly low either in the high 20s or below 30s, that very strong spread to your --not just to 2015 event or likelihood, but I'm sure you would have a good deal of confidence in succeed in '17 as well at this point, admitting that this is very dynamic market. Dean Shigenaga : Yeah I would say first of Jim, it is very dynamic market. I'd say it's hard to incorporate the speed of change in rental rates in a summary that we just -- Steve just rattles out. But if you look out this type of environment, very strong market should provide ongoing very solid leasing statistics going into '16 and '17. Jim Sullivan : Great, thank. Operator : We'll go next to Jamie Feldman of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jamie Feldman : Can you talk a little bit more about the actual requirements to get the permits and approvals done for the leases you've signed or I guess to start construction at 510 Townsend and 10300 Campus Point and 400 Dexter, [Nick] in press release you said, and with the press you signed the leases and then you have some huddles you need to get over to expect construction? Joel Marcus : Yes, so Steve will talk about the 5,000 to 10,000 and I\u2019ll ask Dean will talk about to campus point and then I'll talk about Seattle. Steve Richardson : Jamie its Steve. We've started the internal process a number of quarters ago, you've submittals, environmental impact review and then traffic studies, those three pieces have essentially been completed or nearing completion. We do have a target in August now with the planning commission and expect that we're right in the middle with the fair way with the project itself no variances, all of the underline traffic and EIR conclusions are consistent, so we would expect putting seamless move here to August and then we're receiving the entitlements at that time. Joel Marcus : And break ground, Steve Steve Richardson : Break ground shortly thereafter in the fall. Dean Shigenaga : Jim its Dean. So the way Steve describes is exactly where we are in San Diego on our campus point project. We have cleared all the hurdles, we're now up to public notice and we expect to wrap all that up in July. So we're targeting a final approval on July 4th. But everything seems to be going smoothly and ground breaking at the same time. Peter Moglia : This is Peter Moglia, at 400 Dexter our [indiscernible] as it's refer to in Seattle, it\u2019s expected within the next 60 days or so. But we're going full force on design and the city is very, very supportive of this effort because they wanted to capture Geno Therapy that's in the city proper. So we've got full support and we're running with it. Joel Marcus : And expected break ground potentially in the next quarter. Jamie Feldman : Okay and did you say for 5,000 to 10,000 you have Prop M approval or you need it? Steve Richardson : No, that will happen with the planning commission in the summer Jamie, August. Jamie Feldman : Okay, alright and then I know you didn't provide us total dollar amount for 50 to 60 Binney, but can you give us may a ballpark of how to think about the total cost to their project? Dean Shigenaga : Jamie its Dean here. You probably -- you\u2019re actually not too far from our recent project at 75/125 Binney, year and I say this cautiously let me just carry out this because the challenge with estimates for construction right now is, what we do know is, we have a lease with Santa Fe, we are working through terms to lease 60 Binney on the exact split between our investment and the tenant's investment, plus the design. Some design aspects will determine the ultimate cost but you're probably in that figure that's approaching all in about a $1000 a foot. Jamie Feldman : You're saying that the combination of your spend and their spend, or that's just your spend? Dean Shigenaga : That's our investment into the project. Joel Marcus : All in, that's fully loaded all in. And then rents you could imagine would be of the absolute upper end and then you can imagine what the yields would be. So nice spread to what cap rates are today. Jamie Feldman : And then my final question is more strategic, so it sounds like you pulled back on your disposition guidance. You increased your acquisition, but you spent a lot of time talking about how great the pricing is for sales. How do we think about that? How did you think about that rather than maybe you think you'd want to do the opposite, which is sell more and buy less, given where we're at cycle. Joel Marcus : Actually Jamie -- sorry to point that out, but that\u2019s actually what we are doing. We're selling, we increased our disposition program this quarter, so we have 200 million of incremental dispositions on a cash basis. Jamie Feldman : I thought you took down your sale guidance. No? Joel Marcus : No, dispositions increased. Net 200 on a cash basis over just the acquisitions. So we have about a net 65 million of cash increase on an outlay for acquisitions and about 265 million at the mid-point increase in dispositions, which nets about it. Jamie Feldman : Alright my confusion, I'm sorry about that. Thank you. Joel Marcus : Thanks Jamie. Operator : We'll go next to Sheila McGrath with Evercore. Sheila McGrath : Good afternoon. I was wondering on Tech Square that rent you mentioned was $25, was that a really old lease and are there other leases at Tech Square that are also well below market? Dean Shigenaga : That lease was a 2010, so just coming out of the recession. It was a renewal of an existing MIT lease at that market and it was a gross rent. And so that shows how much the office market in particular has moved since that trough in 2010. And there are not a lot of other well below market leases at Tech Square a lot of other well below market leases at Tech Square that a pretty minimal. Dean Shigenaga : Sheila it's Dean, just to clarify the original lease rate that rolled was gross, the numbers I gave you converted the gross rate to a net rate, so get apples to apples, it is a net lease today. Sheila McGrath : Okay, great and then on the auction property in the New York that seems to be moving more quickly now. I know the last time you negotiated the ground lease 429 Street it\u2019s quite a while, is this something that you think is years away or could this be near term and maybe you just comment on the potential to ups still in there? Joel Marcus : Sheila it's Joel, the city announced actually in the press release -- announcing the two venture fronts that they're essentially helping fund to the tune of about $150 plus million dollars and in that press release, so couple of weeks ago. They stated the need for additional lab space in New York because the demand there is emerging and they cited, the Alexandria center for life science is having the additional north parcel on which we have a long-term option as one immediate relief valve at least in the foreseeable future and the city has encouraged us, we\u2019ve had several direct meetings, they\u2019ve even encourage us to think about up zoning it. And so we will be working with them hands on and right now our thinking is we could break ground potentially by the end of next year with the delivery on 2018. So that's very realistic. The ground lease is negotiated, this is just an add-on for the development Sheila McGrath : The terms of this ground would be similar? Joel Marcus : It would be an amendment to the existing, for the development of the sights. So it's actually fairly easy to do compare to a brand new ground lease that we had never negotiated back in 26 and 27 when we're doing Sheila McGrath : And with pricing, even though amendment to this ground lease pricing could vary? Joel Marcus : Would you say pricing meaning? Sheila McGrath : Meaning the rent that you are going to pay on this auction parcel. Joel Marcus : Well, that's one of the key issues because obviously we want to make it as favorable to the tenants because that's a pass through, to induce them to make New York city their headquarters and city is aligned with that view. So that's not so much of area cost that's tenant cost and it's in the best interest of the city to make that affordable. Sheila McGrath : Okay, great, thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Michael Carroll of RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll : Hey Jeol, can you give us some color on the acquisition guidance, what's the breakup between stabilized assets and then you got increasing assets? That was kind of mentioned in the press release. Joel Marcus : Well that\u2019s Dean. Dean Shigenaga : I think, you should think of most of them other than what we've completed which you already have, the stuff that's pending you should think of as value added opportunities. There maybe a little bit of in-place purchasing cash flows, but for now just assume it's nominal. Joel Marcus : Yes, I think as we've said last time the MIT transaction involving at the Memorial drive property, really was kind of an opportunistic situation, we didn't really plan on, they brought it to market. They bundled that with the -- not bundled it but encouraged us to bid on it together with our repurchase at Tech Square. So, it's not something we had really planned on and generally we're aren\u2019t in the market to buy stabilized acquisitions in general. Michael Carroll : So the value and acquisition that you're looking at, then how much capital can you invested in those properties going forward? [indiscernible] 15 bucket. Joel Marcus : Lot of that depends on what the ability to build on, based on local permitting, et cetera. But I think we've laid that out in the pipeline chart on Page 30, if you go to that, that's the best way to visualize and think about each of the project, the ones that currently in development and the one that are really near term, I think if you look at the square footage there that's the easiest way to kind of think about it. Dean Shigenaga : Michael, I'd say, it doesn't impact and your question maybe longer term related but it doesn't really impact our construction spending for this year as you noticed that our guidance remains very consistent with last quarter. Michael Carroll : Okay, great, thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Rich Anderson of Mizuho Securities. Rich Anderson : So, I just have maybe potentially stupid question to start, is there anything about to 25 Binney have a lesser [indiscernible] as part of the broader Alexandria standards, is there smaller audience because of that do you think? Joel Marcus : No, I don't think so at all, actually was probably broader audience as you know that area of Binney is a very -- has great adjacency to Biogen\u2019s main cluster campus there that's why they choose that site down at 225 Binney if the peer office leases the headquarters it's a long term lease, it's a credit tenant. The tenant that has a market capital of almost $100 million doing great things. It's actually an ideal asset. Rich Anderson : Okay just wondering because within broader center there. Anyway moving on the mention of the two leases one that has vacated and the one that\u2019s going to on May 31st, is there anything in guidance with that release at this point? Joel Marcus : Modest assumptions, we do expect some down time, Rich to re-tenant these. Could go either single or multi-tenant we do have a number of showing. But nothing to reported at the moment. Rich Anderson : I was just going to say, where it is 25 from Massachusetts and 13 for North Carolina compare to market right now in your opinion? Tom Andrews : This is Tom Andrews. That property is [indiscernible] on the Route 128 inter belt way, North of Austin. We think that 25 is right pretty much were market is, so we'd expect to be and the building it was acquired as a sale leaseback10 years ago and the building was design to be a multi-tenant building and we think we'll have no trouble at all multi-tenanting it and leasing it up overtime. It will take some to lease up. But we've got good activity with multi-tenant prospect and a potential single tenant prospect. But we think it that\u2019s market, the roll -- the expiring rents are probably close to market. Joel Marcus : And in the North Carolina property it was a property we bought a quite a number of years ago the EPA was in the property they\u2019ve moved on and rents there are probably are in the low 20s on a triple net basis. So we see some good opportunity for a roll up there. Rich Anderson : Dean you mentioned the use of the ATM by my calculation you're trading right now below consensus, any comment on that with relates to strategy to deploy the ATM? Joel Marcus : I think we didn\u2019t actually say we were going to deploy the ATM per say, we have not used -- I think the last time we use that was back in 2012-2013 we haven\u2019t used it since 150 more and less remains that expire Dean said in June we're going to refresh that so we always have it available. But I don\u2019t think we have committed the use of it at this point. Dean Shigenaga : My comment is focus on primarily on sourcing sales but we wanted to make it clear that we would re-file the program just to have it available for other future. Rich Anderson :  And last question I don\u2019t if you have this on your figure tips. But do you have a number of percentages of portfolio that\u2019s back by VC funding? Joel Marcus : If you look at -- we have a high chart at page 21 of the supplement and in there you'll see private bio technology, had about 6.8%. By ABR that\u2019s a good kind of estimate. Rich Anderson : Okay so that\u2019s in the range of what the VC number would be. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Kevin Tyler of Green Street Advisors. Kevin Tyler : Just one quick one from me, high level question. How do you think about lab space fundamentals today? Rents, tenant, demand, et cetera versus the last peak in the 90s. Joel Marcus : I think it's fairly fundamentally different. If you go back to my opening comments I think that kind of says it all what we saw in the \u201899, 2000, 2001 era really was more a market driven peak where companies and valuation kind of emerged. But I think business model and drug approval and just sheer focus on drugs coming to market was not the same. This is truly I think an unusual renaissance that I think you've got a lot of legs and will continue to last for quite a long time. I think the better and faster FDA is fundamentally changed since then I think the new generation of bio-tech led by companies like Biogen, Cell Gene, et cetera they didn\u2019t really exist then, you just had Amgen and Genentech more or less. Big farma was really hiding out in it\u2019s -- in really campuses that were more suburban and really acquired and build over many years really with a different business model in mind. And then the kind of the focus on targeted therapy it didn\u2019t exit. So I think it's a pretty -- this is kind of renaissance period I don\u2019t think it's -- sure there is a lot of positivity on the bio tech side with the market valuations. But fundamentally the companies are incredibly way better position. Operator : We'll go to Dave Rodgers of Baird. Dave Rodgers : Just a couple ones from me. Joel couple of questions for you on the disposition pipeline or how you're thinking about it. I guess the first would be can you comment on India? The decision to sell the asset and impressed this quarter and anything that speaks to your long terms plans in India or Asia? And the second would be with regard to using joint venture capital in Cambridge, any other markets that you\u2019d consider really bringing in joint venture partners and how did you think about that as you went down the road? Joel Marcus : So quick answers, on India we have several assets that are really unproductive assets, land or land and some kind of structure that we -- this is pre Lehman, we had intended to essentially develop and bring the market. Those plans changed before of allocation of capital issues and so the assets that we sold were kind of a shell of a building in a very high quality location in Hyderabad. And we have not achieved permits for the MOB and so we felt by selling it to a MOB operator, who'd actually operate it and be able to secure those approvals, would be the best course and so that\u2019s why we entered into that transaction. And we're happy to have monetized the non-income producing asset. On the other question about selection of locations, our thinking there is driven by a whole bunch of considerations that Dean kind of covered in his remarks, but I would say that the ability to extract value from assets that we have created and really developed high value given today's cap rate environment seem to be best targets of opportunity. The Forbes assets -- 500 Forbes is an ideal one because of where it's situated, cap rate situation and the 225 Binney is one that also seems kind of ideal, again given that it's at the end of the Binney Street corridor. It's a pure office building and it's got all the attributes that really make a joint venture partner very excited about participating in that ownership with us. So those were kind of the driving forces I think behind them. Operator : And currently there are no other questions in the queue, I'll turn the conference back to management for any additional remarks. Joel Marcus : Thank you everybody we appreciate your time and we're just about one hour on and we look forward to talking to you on the second quarter call. Thanks again. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

Baird Rich Anderson - Mizuho Securities Jim Sullivan - Cowen Group Operator : Welcome to the Alexandria Real Estate Equities\u2019 Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Vicky and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Paula Schwartz. Please go ahead. Paula Schwartz : Thank you and good afternoon. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Federal securities laws. The company's actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements; additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the Company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I'll turn it over to Joel Marcus. Please go ahead, Joel. Joel Marcus : Thank you very much. With me today are Dean Shigenaga, CFO; Steve Richardson, Chief Operating Officer; Peter Moglia, Chief Investment Officer; Tom Andrews, Executive Vice President, and Dan Ryan, Executive Vice President, so welcome to our second quarter call. I think the second quarter has really two key storylines for our best in class office REIT, the first one is price discovery for ARE and its assets and I believe deserving of cap rate compression and multiple expansion and secondly would be the sheer historic leasing volume in the second quarter, testament really to the locations quality of assets and really the leasing team. Dean will go through the balance sheet and guidance in detail but we did increase guidance to 524 so when you take our projected FFO for the year plus the dividend we're looking at a low double digit total return.  On the science and technology front the industries themselves remain at the forefront of growth and leadership in our innovation economy seeking to attract the best talent and really the best urban submarkets where now as you can from the supplement ARE now derives 75% of our annual base ramp from class A assets and AAA locations and we're very proud of this really crowning achievement and coupling that with investment grade client tenants of about 53% of our ABR we feel that we really accomplished something pretty special.  The demand for our urban campuses have really never been stronger. On the FDA front again increases in the FDA approvals as I've said before have been driven by better understanding of the disease biology and very much improved regulatory process year to date for 2015 there've been 20 approvals and ARE client tenants have garnered 60% of those, again we\u2019re very proud of that. I think one big note on the policy side is that it has some representatives past the 21st Century Cures Act on July 10th now moving to the senate for discussion more likely in September. A couple of key provisions during that need for increased funding to the NIH and the FBA, which if the bill passes will be very welcomed; improved investment in certain areas of critical science the bill aims at removing barriers to increased research collaboration; it has certain guidance incorporating patient perspective into the drug development process; it also has guidance to ensure the patients can be treated based on their unique characteristics of their disease, so called personalized precision medicine. There is a section on modernized and clinical trials which will be very important, greater use of patient generated registries and biomarkers, the development of certain new medical apps and potential orphan drug exclusivity for rare diseases. On the technology side machine learning and Big Data have contributed greatly to the intersection of tech and life science. We see continued strong growth in the sharing economy and we\u2019re also pleased to mention that our new client tenants strike, our tenant at 510 Townsend raised the new round of financing value in the Company at approximately $5 billion led by Visa, American Express and Sequoia. And they also announced a new partnership with Visa. Moving on to the sale of the 70% interest in our 225 Binney. We\u2019re very pleased with a highly respectable cash cap rate. We believe that this was very attractive to a group of high quality institutional investors, it also monetize the core asset. And really evidence significant value creation. We hope it\u2019s meaningful on an NAV data point and it\u2019s certainly importantly raises significant equity type capital to help fund our development pipeline. The yield is reflective of what long term investors are willing to accept. And we won\u2019t speculate about the upside in 13 years, but we believe it\u2019s significant. The building, as many of you know, is 305,000 square feet in the heart of Kendall Square developed by our Greater Boston team in the Alexandria Center Kendall Square base quarter development and really the strongest life science submarket in the country, a lead goal building, 100% triple net leased Biogen through September 30, 2028 with two five year renewal options at 95% of our market ground. There was a significant pool of interest at buyers, and likely we will continue to look at monetizing select assets and Dean will talk to you about sources and uses in a bit. We\u2019re very pleased that a sophisticated investor like TIAA paid a low cap rate reflecting the high value they placed on the real estate and the residual value. Notwithstanding there is no chance to increase rents for the next 13 years. I think that recognize the value in Cambridge are more a function of extreme supply constraints, high barriers to entry and limited availability for space for the universe of life science, pharma-biotech and technology from separately want to and need to be Kendall Square versus simply a snapshot at current rent. I think our partner recognized there is minimal releasing risk in a submarket with low single digit vacancy rates and the demand that is currently substantially in excess inventory. Ironically there is obviously significant upside if Biogen were to vacate early and rents were to go to market. I am sure they took comfort in the dramatic leasing velocity in the Binney Street corridor and our transactions with Sanofi Genzyme, Bristol-Myers Squibb and the long term value of the Binney Street assets and the greater Kendall Square project that we\u2019ve done. Also think that capital values in Kendall Square clearly continued increase. I think our partner\u2019s confidence and the long term value of 225 Binney validates our laser focus on developing and knowing irreplaceable mission critical assets in the top innovation clusters. The end users are attracted to these markets are really highly discriminating in their location decisions. As you know, their need to hire and retain top talent who want to work in these dynamic submarkets, their need to collaborate on product development, scientific research, drives their real estate decisions unlike financial and professional service firms. For example, who view real estate more as a commodity, the life science and tech companies view their real estate location decisions integral to their operations that makes them somewhat more rent insensitive although they\u2019re clearly very focused and very diligent and willing to pay to be in AAA buildings in top locations with superb owner operators. And we\u2019re in the enviable position of owning that real estate that will experience this exceptional and sustained capital appreciation and rent growth. Moving on to the internal growth. We hit an all time high for any quarter over 1.9 million square feet of lease; really historic and a great achievement for the Company; 29% came from our Greater Boston, primarily Cambridge operations; 26% from San Diego and 22% from the San Francisco Bay region. Occupancy was down slightly due to two roles Dean talked about; again, same solid same property NOI growth for the quarter and strong margins. On the external growth side, we have an opportunity Dan and his team to acquire 10290 Campus Point Drive immediately adjacent to our current Campus Point project which added 304,000 square feet at a $105 million about $356 per square foot. Qualcomm is in for a short time than it's been entirely released Eli Lilly and want go some redevelopment and Dean can take you through the machinations. But essentially Lilly ends up netting leasing about 72,000 more square feet from us. Notable leasing achievements in the sub for the quarter 300,000 square feet of 510 Townsend Street as we just mentioned, our 208,000 square foot lease to Bristol-Myers Squibb at 100 Binney and 90,000 square feet to Juno at 400 Dexter. We expect to announce in the not too distant future the completion of a lease to a full building user at 60 Binney and we continue to be well leased, well preleased in a highly visible pipeline that now has visibility into 2016, 2017 and then 2018. As we mentioned in the sub capital allocation for this year, 45% to Cambridge, 22% to San Diego, 13% to Mission Bay, some 4% to New York and 16% to others. Dean will comment on the balance sheet but we expect to be at 6.9x net debt-to-EBITDA at year end. And on the dividend side with continuing low payout ratio and growing cash flows, we expect the Board to continue dividend increases sharing our increasing cash flows with investors.  So with that said, let me turn it over to Dean. Dean Shigenaga : Alright. Thanks Joel. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon everybody. I have got three important topics but really wanted to take a brief moment to express our appreciation for our team for recognition as the 2015 recipient of the NAREIT Gold investor, communication and reporting excellence award. It truly is an honor for the company to receive this award and our team will continue to focus on transparency, quality and efficiency of reporting and communication to the investment community. I have three topics today. First, I want to cover the continued strong performance from our Class A buildings in AAA locations. Second, provide an update on our solid balance sheet, access to diverse sources of capital and brief comments on key items for the second half of '15. And third, briefly on our disciplined allocation of capital and management of our value creation pipeline. So kicking it off with our continued strong performance, our strategic focus on unique, collaborative campuses and urban innovation, cluster sub markets continue to drive very strong operating and financial results. We reported FFO per share of $1.31, up 10.1% over the second quarter of 2014. Demand for our Class A assets in AAA locations also continues to drive strong leasing activity. We updated our guidance and increased the midpoint of our range of FFO per share from $5.22 to $5.24. FFO per share growth for 2015 is now greater than 9% representing our second consecutive year of very strong growth above 9%. We remain on track to reach our occupancy guidance range of 96.9% to 97.4% by year end. However as disclosed over the past couple of quarters, two lease expirations in the second quarter drove a temporary decline in occupancy. One lease was for a 128,000 rentable square feet at 19 Presidential located in the suburbs of Boston and that lease expired at a rate of about $25. And another lease for about 82,000 rentable square feet at 2525 State Highway 54 in Research Triangle Park expired at a rate of about $20. Both of these were single tenant buildings and we are marketing each building for multi tenancy at rental rates equal to or above the expiring rates. We remain well positioned with high quality buildings and tenancy. Cash same property NOI growth has averaged about 5% over the last 10 years and the midpoint of our guidance is above this average at 6%. This performance is driven primarily from a favorable restructure with 94% of our leases containing annual rent escalations, additionally strong demand for our Class A buildings in AAA locations has driven high leasing volume and pricing power in our key urban cluster sub markets. And for the second consecutive quarter has been the primary driver of the increases in our strong FFO per share guidance for 2015. Next turning to an update on our solid balance sheet, access to capital and some brief comments for the second half of the year. And first, our balance sheet is very solid with well laddered debt maturities and really limited maturities through 2018. Additionally our balance sheet liquidity is very strong at approximately 1.1 billion. Turning to sources of capital for 2015. Our guidance has decreased about 90 million at the midpoint to 1.05 billion and really consisted the following.  12% of our 125 million from net cash provided by operating activities after dividends. 15% or roughly 155 million from a net incremental increase in debt. And 73% or 770 million from asset sales and other sources of capital which I will touch on in a moment. Included in our net incremental debt for the year is the issuance of 50 million of unsecured notes offsetting this increase and there's a reduction in some projected proceeds from asset dispositions which results in a modest net increase in incremental debt for 2015. I should take a moment to highlight the recent volatility in the debt capital markets. In the month of July over 100 billion of unsecured bonds were issued driven primarily by M&A activity and it seems like the M&A activity will likely to continue and drive new issuance volume in the near term. All in pricing including new issue concessions is higher today versus 90 to maybe 120 days ago. Given the recent volatility in the debt capital markets we prefer not to speculate on pricing for our future transaction but suffice it to say that guidance can absorb the range of interest rates reflected at recent volatility. More importantly we have significant liquidity on balance sheet and have flexibility to be patient on the timing of the issuance of our unsecured notes. We are also working on two secured construction loans one of which will fund the construction in 2015 for 50 and 60 Binney Street in Cambridge, the other construction loan will provide funding beginning in 2016 for the construction of our unconsolidated JV development for Uber at 1455 and 1515 Third Street in Mission Bay. Both loans are expected to close this year will significantly increase our balance sheet liquidity to over 1.7 billion by year end. And we will disclose the key terms of each loan in the future. Asset sales are an important component of our sources of capital and we will continue to focus on growth in FFO per share and net asset value while we fund our highly leased value creation projects while also improving our net debt to adjusted EBITDA to less than seven times by year end. Our midpoint of guidance for dispositions and other sources of capital is 770 million and consist of the following. About 550 million or 71% has been identified and is working through various stages. This includes 94 million completed to date, a 190 million under contract related to the sale of a 70% interest at 225, Denny Street, roughly a 4.5% cap rate and about 266 million working through the process. The remainder is about 220 million, as a policy we do not speculate on potential sales that have not been identified but we'll continue to focus on sales of both operating properties and land. More importantly we will continue to provide disclosure of specific sales when they are identified and classified as held for sale. Additionally as mentioned last quarter our ATM expired in early June and we expect to file a new program. Turning to our allocation of capital and management of our value creation pipeline. Our investment strategy focuses on the allocation of capital and the class A buildings and AAA locations that really should translate into higher long term value for our shareholders. 84% of our capital for 2015 will be allocated primarily to four higher value clusters of markets including Cambridge, Mission Bay, plus SoMa, Manhattan and Tori Pines/University town center. We've been very disciplined with our value creation activities, we have a modest size pipeline undergoing construction today. Our value creation pipeline has declined to about 12% with about one half of our pipeline under active construction and the other one half representing near term and future projects. We tend to focus on minimizing our leasing risk over the past five years we have commenced about 4.1 million rentable square feet of ground up developmental projects with about one half of that representing 100 preleased single tenancy projects and the other one half representing multitenancy projects that on average were 36% preleased. Our value creation projects under active construction today aggregating about 2 million rentable square feet were 71% leased and 17% under negotiation. I think the other key attribute of our discipline is we really are on budget. Of the 4.1 million rentable square feet that commenced over the last five years these projects have been completed or the projects completed today are about 1.9 million of that rentable and have on average been completed under budget with initial cash yield slightly above our estimates at the commencement of these projects. Lastly on guidance and closing comment here, the detailed assumptions underlying our updated guidance for 2015 are included on page three and four of our supplemental package.  We are really in a unique position with strong demand for a class A assets in urban inundation cluster submarket. Internal growth remains very strong. We have a visible and highly leased multiyear value creation pipeline. We continue to focus our strategy of generating cash growth and cash flows from operating activities, FFO per share and net asset value. We are also focused on increasing our common stock dividends while retaining significant cash flows for investment into highly leased value creation projects. We believe we have the right assets, the right locations and the best roster of client tenants and we remain focused on continuing to build our best in class franchise. With that I'll turn it back to Joel. Joel Marcus : Thank you very much, so that's our formal comment. Operator, do you want to open it up for Q&A please? Operator : Thank you [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll take our first question from Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes Rose : I wanted to ask a little more about the San Diego purchase for $105 million. What do you expect to spend to upgrade the facility thinking about Lilly\u2019s new? And how do you think about the stabilized returns there? And then just want to make sure you were far along on the entitlement process for construction at adjacent building, that about to be put on hold now? Joel Marcus : So let me -- I am going to ask Dan to comment. But we haven\u2019t projected fully construction cost, so Dan is just going to give you rough estimate. Same thing with yields when we develop our full budget, we\u2019ll take them into the supplement but we hope it to be north of 7 broadly, but Dan can comment on the deal. Dan Ryan : So we expect that we\u2019ll be north of 7 in terms of cash and GAAP on that opportunity. You\u2019re mostly right about the -- so two, there are two components To Lilly; one is we have their existing space in 10300 Campus Point Drive plus we have executed a -- it's actually a built to suit building for them, which would have been adjacent to that 10300 building. So we terminated the built to suit in favor of this new acquisition. And we are reworking, basically reworking the site plan now to consolidate the entitlements into a new building which will be on the 10290 site. Joel Marcus : And Steve maybe construction of\u2026 Steve Richardson : I guess we\u2019re estimating maybe 300 plus or minus. Joel Marcus : Yes, exactly. Steve Richardson : Yes, so it\u2019s about 300 plus or minus on the redevelopment. Smedes Rose : And then I just want to ask you on 225 Binney, obviously is very attractive cap rate and you mentioned the number of potential buyers there. So could you talk about a little more kind of the range of buyers? I mean were they mostly institutional like TIAA or were they family office as well or foreign sovereign funds or anything on that? Joel Marcus : Well, we talked to quite a number of people. And I would say there was a large group of very interested buyers including a number of sovereign wealth funds. But because of certain investment restrictions for sovereign funds, as you know, if they were to hold over a majority of an interest creates tax issues for those and it is we finally ended up focusing on domestic high quality institutions that could own greater than 49%. So, it was a great mix and it was mostly high quality institutions and foreign sovereign funds. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Sheila McGrath with Evercore. Sheila McGrath : On the San Diego acquisition, I was just wondering if you could help us understand how that all slow through. Will it be like an acquisition of 105 million with the Qualcomm lease and then start capitalizing? Or how will that hit the P&L, or just teens? Dean Shigenaga : You\u2019re correct Sheila, there is a short lease back for about 90 days and then the project I think effective October will enter our redevelopment program and we\u2019ll commence the process of converting that to its assets lab use. So there is a very short lease back period. Sheila McGrath : And then on 505 Brannan Street, in supplementary you talk about -- it was pretty significant up zoning. And I am just wondering, how long that will take and your confidence level with achieving that zoning, up zoning? Steve Richardson : Sure, as you saw, phase one is fully entitled that first 135,000 square feet and then the phase two will be part of the adoption of the Central SoMa plan. So we have a number of thought about strategies to lock that down. But ultimately I think it will be a couple of years out before we do lockdown the propM allocation for that property as well. Sheila McGrath : So, you\u2019ll go forward with just phase one initially? Steve Richardson : Yes, we will. Sheila McGrath : And do you think that will be tech or life science? Steve Richardson : It could be either, and we have strong demand from both sectors. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jamie Feldman : I guess starting out on 225 Binney, are you going to receive a management fee on that 70%? And if so, what\u2019s the percentage rate? Peter Moglia : Yes, we are going to receive standard property management fees, but we have been asked by our partners not to disclose that percentage, so I am sorry I can\u2019t give that to you. Jamie Feldman : And then I think you guys had about an $80 million change in investments on the balance sheet to getting flow through earnings. Can you talk about what\u2019s in there? Joel Marcus : Not Company specific, but you\u2019re correct our unrealized gains are up to almost 140 million. It\u2019s handful companies that more initial invested in when they were private and they\u2019re not publicly traded companies with a significant after market. I think somebody asked the question maybe a year or year and a half ago about what the mark-to-market potential and I conservatively mentioned it was 2x. And so I think you get some sense for the upside in that investment goal. And I think from a P&L perspective we have been realizing some gains but they've been fairly modest time-to-time and that gives us a steady flow of other income. I think what we might consider overtime is selectively monetizing some of that portfolio and reinvesting that capital into our business. Jamie Feldman : And is any of that in your guidance in terms of source of capital or income or anything? Joel Marcus : Only from the standpoint of the normal run rate Jamie we typically have 1 million to 2 million of investment gains a quarter typically more like $1 million. So that run rate is in there but anything large we would try to carve out and identify for you. So the answer is no, there is nothing lumpy included in our guidance. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then I guess bigger picture, we've seen a lot of health insurer consolidation over the last month or so. Can you guys talk about what impact do you think that may have on the broader healthcare space and your business potentially? Joel Marcus : Well I think that chapter is yet to be written. I guess you could draw some analogy as to the airline industry that it's going to be bumpy and you can't always get deeps when you want. So I think that now with the Affordable Care Act having been reconfirmed in a number of specific areas by the Supreme Court I think what will shake out is you will have three or four, it looks like three, but you will have others dominant providers and they will be important in influencing how they insure under the law and under the ACA and obviously important in negotiating with the industry. So but that's yet to play out. Jamie Feldman : What impact you think it might have on just capital flows to pharmaceuticals, is there a talk of that CapEx? Joel Marcus : I don\u2019t think so. I think it certainly is as strong as we've ever seen it. If you just look at the M&A activity almost everyday, although a lot of that's in the generic space, certainly you look at the venture side and what's big in the venture side is not only venture but institutional crossover, investors putting large, large sums of capital into companies that are private and that ultimately go public and you see that both in life science and tech and then obviously the IPO market I think remains pretty strong. Remember something else that I think is going to be a huge benefit to this industry and nobody has really talked about it, is there is a bill working its way through Congress and I have a high degree of feeling that it is going to pass and that is a one-time tax Obama is in favor of it on companies that have large foreign cash overseas, a lot of in the tech sector, pharma itself has over $200 billion of cash, significant amount of that is overseas. So if there's a one-time tax or something they are projecting between 14% and 16% that will fund infrastructure in the U.S., that's going to mean that there could be 100 billion plus money flowing back to the U.S. for reinvestment. I think that's going to be a huge boom to this industry. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then just my final question. Good execution on 225 Binney, are you getting more assets you want to put in the market for sale? Joel Marcus : I think you will see us look at another core asset, there certainly we've been contacted by quite a few people, I wouldn\u2019t say there is alignment or door but there is quite a few people looking and so we're looking at a couple of core assets and then clearly we have a number of non-core assets and land parcels that we're working on. So the answer is yes. Operator : We will go next to Kevin Tyler with Green Street Advisors. Kevin Tyler : Hi guys. Policy on the tenant at 225, they've been in the news , stocks selling off 20% plus as drug sales slowed down. Can you comment a bit on the broader state of the market, the biotech market and then some of the read through on such a large company loses that much of its market value overnight? Joel Marcus : Yes, remember too that, that company has increased its valuation dramatically. I actually did an interview of George Scangos about a year ago at a I think it was an event in San Francisco and I remember asking him what the market cap of Biogen Idec was the name previously when he started and it was $14 billion and asked him what his worry was and he said he thought that market capital is going to go down in negotiating his contract. So you saw it go to north of a 100 billion and they did have a sell off.  Let me speak to Biogen itself, I think the management team is a great team. George is a highly seasoned professional. Obviously they lowered estimates for their multiple sclerosis franchise and that was not welcoming to the street and obviously significantly cut value and this is by analysts and others the value attributed to their pipeline. One of the really big potential value from that pipeline was their Alzheimer's drug and obviously the drug missed hitting a significant response on key measurements and it also demonstrated I guess some evidence of brain swelling among some limited number of patients but one believes that they still have a good chance of having good phase three results, it's difficult, expensive and risky but that's where they're headed. Anybody who can crack Alzheimer's really will be the beneficiary of just an unending number of patients unfortunately. I think you know you have to look at a lot of the tech and lot of the biotech companies and obviously their price based on their revenues and on their pipeline of products or opportunities and I think when somebody has to bring a little more reality to guidance than they had I think you see a pretty large sell off but I think some of that bounce back and I think the company over time will recover much of that valuation so it still is a very-very well valued company so we aren't worried.  But I think you know in any industry that has, mean look what happened to Google on the Plus side, their CFO came in and announced some really disciplined approach to cost cutting and the stock just popped dramatically. So that's the marketplace. Kevin Tyler : Okay, I appreciate that. In terms of, Dean this one might be for you, in terms of the acquisition guidance for the year I think you brought it down 50 million this quarter versus last quarter. Just wondering what might have driven that move, was it a capital allocation decision or was there something else driving it. Dean Shigenaga : There's some details on page three of our supplemental package for reference but in short we had one transaction including our guidance last quarter, was about a $135 million transaction and really at the seller's request timing has been moved back to the first quarter of '16, so that transaction's still there, it's just not part of 2015 anymore. Offsetting that reduction of a 135 was the purchase of the Campus Point building. Operator : We'll go next to Mike Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Mike Carroll : Can you guys describe what you've planned for 10300 Campus Point, when Eli Lilly decides to vacate, well, when they vacate to go to 10290. Joel Marcus : I'll ask Dan to comment. Dan Ryan : Hi, this is Dan again. We feel really good about the prospects of backfilling that. It's a barely, it's a very highly built out lab office space that really was in, they spent a significant amount of their own capital that we will be the net beneficiaries for . We are currently in paperwork with four plus tenants already. This is going to be some of our best phase in the portfolio. So we generally expect a significant you know 15% plus or minus increase in current rent at the release. We feel the downtime will be very short given where we are with current discussion and fairly modest amount of capital to get there. Joel Marcus : I should clarify that lease is about a 125,000 square feet and the contractual expiration is in the fourth quarter of '16. Mike Carroll : Okay then how your discussions I guess progressing with the city on the north tower land site option are those just a formality and that site is going to be yours. Joel Marcus : Well, I don't know that anything's ever a formality but we do have a legal option that lasts for 17 years so I feel good about that but we are in deep discussions we had several meetings with the city this week, we have a discussion going-on on increasing the FAR and how that might work and so that's where we are but we expect you know a resolution to that and some decision this year maybe within the next quarter or so. So that's moving along pretty intensively. Operator : We'll go next to Ross Nussbaum with UBS. Ross Nussbaum : Can we talk a little bit more about page four in your supplemental, I just want a little more clarity on the asset sales that you're targeting through the end of the year. I guess the first question is, where are you processalized with 500 Forbes in South San Francisco, I know that was listed last quarter in the south as well, is that, where are you in terms of getting that thing professionally. Joel Marcus : So, let me comment briefly and then Steve can add some comments. The, everything in the category of pending and targeted, the only transaction that is under contract today is 225 Binney which you're well aware of, everything else is not at that stage yet but moving through various areas I don't know if Steve wants to comment anything further. Steve Richardson : Hi Ross, it\u2019s Steve Richardson. Yes we've fully engaged the marketing team now. We've got packages out, we've been touring prospective buyers through the property so we're in the early innings of the overall marketing process. We'll keep you updated as time moves along. Joel Marcus : And then somebody asked before Ross about would with our success at 225 Binney would we look at another core asset sale and the answer is yes, we're in active, we're active on another core asset potentially so that, stay tuned on that. The 240,000 square feet with $8.2 million of NOI that get identified as other, what exactly is that? Dan Ryan : We\u2019re not prepared to provide more color on what we have. But let me just say that we have a number of assets that we\u2019ve targeted that could allow us to achieve our targeted dispositions. So we have flexibility in what we execute there, and we have a number of projects where our operating assets were looking at. Ross Nussbaum : And how does that other category defer from what you been laid out is projected remainder/asset sales, that additional $195 million $245 million, that stuff that\u2019s not on the market yet. I am trying to understand the new launch there. Dan Ryan : Yes, the stuff that\u2019s not quite as advanced as what totals up to roughly the midpoint of $550 million which includes the pending and targeted. So we have a little bit of work her to quickly resolve over the next few months. And we expect to be in a position to give you better color on this entire targeted disposition here for \u201915. Joel Marcus : And one asset in that other for example is a important project that we have gone to the tenants who has expressed interest in potentially acquiring it, so we have a discussion there. But we also are working on a sale package, so these are all not just imaging that we\u2019re going to sell something, but these are actually pretty active and trying to move them to an active sale position. Ross Nussbaum : And then my last question is really around the last footnote on that page, and you guys have made a pretty hefty profit being biotech investors over the past few years. What\u2019s preventing you from, just from a risk standpoint given the massive run up in biotech stocks in the last four-five years? Why not take pretty hefty profits sell down a lot of those positions rather than, I don\u2019t want to guess that we\u2019re gamble. But gamble those on biotech continuing to run up. Joel Marcus : I am going to let Dean answer that he did addressed it in a previous question to some extent. But I think to some extent we have taken some. There are a number of companies there that have achieved pretty nice valuation. So you have to remember too, these are -- a number of them are development stage companies. And to the extent they turn out to be future Amgen\u2019s, Biogen\u2019s, Celgene\u2019s and so forth, the upside is even far greater than one can imagine with the realization of that pipeline. But we get your question, so Dean can answer it. Dean Shigenaga : It\u2019s a balance there at the end of the day part of our focus over the next four quarters will be looking to monetize components of that so we can reinvest the capital. So we are looking at that. Couple of them recently had their Initial Public Offerings, so it\u2019s a bit of lock up period as well they can see. Joel Marcus : But we do see that as the source for our development pipeline as we needed. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Dave Rodgers with Baird. Dave Rodgers : Maybe just a broader question on the development pipeline, I think Dean mentioned that the value creation pipeline has come down and the size of the Company overall. But how do you envision that going forward? As you move into \u201916, are there sufficient projects and span that you\u2019ll be able to kind of keep that pipeline at a fairly large level, or do you see it coming down before you can kind of get entitlements and everything ready for another round? Dean Shigenaga : Well, I think....Yes, go ahead. Joel Marcus : I was going to say Mike there is two things to consider, our active projects under construction today are highly leased and are going to be delivered over the next number of quarters. Page two of our press release highlighted as well as page 30 or so in our supplemental 32, highlights the rough time line of near term projects. But the stuff that we\u2019re going to commence in the second half of \u201915 that fits in the near term pipeline today, 1.1 million square feet is 80% leased and 20% under negotiation. So we do have very good visibility into really high quality developments that will generate EBITDA and cash flows going out into basically \u201916, \u201917 and \u201918, in that time frame. So you got this visibility from a siding perspective. The overall value creation pipeline might grow and dollar value temporarily but it will sell back down as we deliver a number of projects call it over the next six quarters. Dave Rodgers : And then I guess with regard to and maybe more acquisition of redevelopment assets to get product to market little bit faster. Should we expect as you move late into this year, or maybe even early in the next year, that you start looking at a greater number of acquisitions to bring that product in line faster, or are you pretty happy just going ground up development and those discussions that you\u2019re having? Joel Marcus : Well, I don\u2019t think we have to, I think you get great value. If you just look at the pipeline that\u2019s being articulated and you look at the page 22 spreadsheet, it\u2019s pretty robust. There are too many people out there that have control on their balance sheet of future value creation and future cash flowing assets out 2016, 2017, 2018, and then overtime maybe beyond. And we only look at the acquisition market really opportunistically, we underwrite everything but look at it pretty carefully. And a lot of times you don\u2019t even see things coming up like the Qualcomm deal, if you were to look at that a year ago or six months ago, you don\u2019t even know some of these things happen. So we're not so focused on acquisitions. I don\u2019t think we need to do that as a elevated for this, the company as a mainstay. But we clearly look at it as a way to build our franchise where it makes sense and where we have great in-sale sites or projects. Dave Rodgers : Obviously a lot of asset sales in the pipeline and that's the primary source of funding for new development. The equity is still off the table and not something that you are considering for this year and early next year? Joel Marcus : Well as I think we've said before, it's our lowest priority as far as funding. And so we think that free cash flow obviously that, that we can generate by bringing on additional cash flow and then obviously asset sales, land sales are our primary focus. Operator : We will go next to Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Rich Anderson : Thanks. Good afternoon. Is it correct that the original discussion with 225 Binney was 80% not 70% of the value of the asset? Joel Marcus : Yes, I don\u2019t know that we had, we talked to a pretty broad range of people running from 49% to 100% depending upon what people we're thinking and then we came upon what we felt was appropriate for our continuing interest and the partner's long-term interest. So that's how we felt about it. Rich Anderson : Okay. So definitely. Dean Shigenaga : Richard it's Dean here. I would only add one other comment. I think our guidance last quarter gave a range from 70% to 90% \u2026 Rich Anderson : Okay. Dean Shigenaga : \u2026 when we were airing down the terms of the deal. Rich Anderson : That's fair. Very, very thank you. And as far as TIAA's perspective, what it is for them in your mind besides obviously high valuable asset until 2028 there is nothing going to happen on their 4.5% return. So is that purely just, they are just a believer in Cambridge for the long-term, is that where their mind is do you think? Joel Marcus : Well, I think in my introductory comments I spend actually quite a bit of time going through how I think they look at it and institutional investors looked at I won't go and repeat that at the moment but I think the investors we have talked to and they are quite a few certainly well more than a dozen, had a very, very positive and strong view of that market and wanted to have a strong foothold in a AAA location in a Class A building with a great tenant. I think that's where institutional money is certainly part of it is focused today. Rich Anderson : My, I apologize I missed the beginning of your call. So pardon. Joel Marcus : It's okay, okay. Rich Anderson : Okay. And. Peter Moglia : It's Peter Moglia, I just wanted to add one other very important factor that drove TIAA do this transaction which was they wanted to do something with Alexandria, I mean they work with the best operators in the best locations and they identified us as that and that was a very important aspect of this transaction for them. So we are very proud of that and we think that their brand and their acumen in examining our real estate and us is a great testament to our quality. Rich Anderson : I guess the question I was having was is this is going to be reoccurring relationship going forward with them? Peter Moglia : Very well could be. Rich Anderson : Okay. Regarding the investments in companies and Dean you spoke about. Is there any situation where you are both an investor and a landlord? Dean Shigenaga : There are I would say the investments probably 80% are non-tenant investments and probably 20% or so are that are fair number. Joel Marcus : That's correct, in that range. Rich Anderson : Is there any kind of restrictions about selling or buying stock if you are also, have business as a landlord tenant, I don\u2019t know if you would be? Joel Marcus : Not regulatory but I can tell you internally we ensure that we look at these transactions separately. In other words the lease is a separate transaction and if we decide to invest we handle that separately from that decision to lease space. Rich Anderson : Okay. And then last question. Joel you I think you referenced 20 FDA approval so far in 2015 I got that much detail at the beginning of the call. But is it true also that not many in the way blockbusters in terms of profitability of those drugs, is that, would you say that that's a fair statement relative to previous years? And maybe just some color around the profitability as opposed to just the straight on approvals of the drugs? Joel Marcus : No I don\u2019t think that's true, I think you're also seeing a new class of cholesterol lowering drugs which are likely to be kind of new era blockbusters, clearly some of the cancer drugs will be I think it remains to be seen if any of the CNS drugs get approval and become, they likely would become but that's something that remains to be seen. But now I think that the drugs that are being approved today, you have to remember too we're also in an era of as I said precision medicine, so a lot of drugs that are being approved are for various targeted rare and often diseased patient population, patients that you know haven't been able, haven't been responsive to mainline therapy so you see some of that so don't assume they're not profitable but you can assume that they're more niche drugs and that's a matter of just better biology and better science and better regulatory science as I was saying earlier. You know you do have some pretty big blockbusters like you know the Hep C curance of all the and others so this is the new generation of drugs I think is a very great set of promising opportunities so we view it as pretty highly positive. Operator : We'll go next to Jim Sullivan with Cowen Group. Jim Sullivan : Thank you, good afternoon. Joel I'm curious with the benchmark pricing here 225 Binney and continuing discussions in some other assets and some other markets. I wonder if you could give us kind of a handle if you will on how we should think about cap rates in Cambridge versus cap rates for the rest of the portfolio and particularly I'm thinking about New York City and San Francisco, San Francisco generally and to what extent we should expect differential cap rates, higher lower in either of those markets and then also if you could touch on to what extent kind of the ratio of general office space to lab space might impact the cap rates. Joel Marcus : So maybe take it one by one, so I think in, and Tom hearing can come in on that Cambridge cap rate beyond 225, but I think it's fair to say that we see continuing cap rate compression in that market, I think it's true. We may end up selling one or more assets in the San Francisco Bay Area that I think will bring I think good cap rate data to the table as well and so I think you're going to see again some cap rate compression in that market certainly vis a vis your assets. New York City we don't plan to sell the New York Center but I think Peter reported back a quarter or two ago I think FL Green sold an asset or bought an asset I can't remember not too far from our estate and it was on a long term ground lease I think at a\u2026 There was a seven cap rate, actually we talked about that at Investor Day. It seems like New York is probably the only major market that from first quarter to second quarter had a small uptick in their cap rate according to Corpax but all our other markets actually they stayed stable or even dropped. One thing that I really noted to Joel before this call when I was doing some researches that since the suburban Maryland market actually had a 22 basis point decrease in cap rate so found that to be very encouraging considering we do have holdings there but overall I think cap rate Jim are going to remain stable. You know the tenure has gone up about 25 basis points from the last quarter, there's still about a, close to a 400 basis point slack between the historical cap rate and the margin it usually has with the tenure, so if it goes up if interest rates go up even more I don't think it's really going to affect cap rates until maybe it starts to go up by a 100 basis points or so, I think we're going to have a long run of continued stabilization maybe even some more compression as the sovereign funds continue to pour money into these markets that we're in and as Joel alluded to we had a quite a number of investors looking at 225 Binney, I think we'll have quite a number of investors looking at the next project we have, so overall I think to answer your question I think the Cambridge cap rate that you saw was very healthy I would expect that assets of that quality will continue to trade at that level and I think we're probably looking at least another 12 months of stable cap rates and then we'll see how external factors affect that. Dean Shigenaga : I would say also Jim in thinking about our asset base as I mentioned actually in the second page of the supplement before the press release we start to try to highlight what we think are the important best in class office REIT attributes that we have and then highlighting 75% of our ABR now comes from these class A assets and AAA locations with the 53% of ABR from investment rate tenants so I got to believe that as people look at NEB and look at cap rates with respect to our asset base they'll take note and I think adjust them appropriately down. I think on the office lab side, not sure I can comment. Tom can maybe give you some color in Cambridge or in cap rate office versus lab. Peter Moglia : I think there's not been comparable prices covering Cambridge and I think that maybe the -- versus one of the ACP trade, but that -- for city interest that University part. But that had a lot of leases of their durations, building that were certainly older. I think the average age is 19 years old or something like that, and not quite the Class A new assets that are prevalent to Kendall Square. Tom Andrews : It was also a minority non-controlling interest as well, so that certainly could have discounted the price. So I think\u2026 Jim Sullivan : Okay, and then finally from me. Can you give us an update in terms of the demand for space in Cambridge, and what impact that\u2019s having on market rents? And maybe if you kind of relate that to your Cambridge portfolio, your 100 owned portfolio. How you feel about where those rents are versus the market? Tom Andrews : Yes, Jim. So we\u2019re observing obviously the very tight market conditions that are Cambridge right now. We have active negotiations underway and proposals going out for the balance of our space at -- and let me clarify, we have proposals going after the balance of our space. The 100 Binney as you know we committed about half of that building to -- leased about half of that building to Bristol-Myers Squibb. We are seeing significant upward movement and we\u2019re including our sales pretty aggressively increasing rent close to perspective tenants due to the scarcity of available space in the market and the number -- I think quantity, quantity of perspective tenants there in the market. Peter Moglia : And Jim this is Peter Moglia, one other thing I wanted to ground out is as Tom mentioned rents have been continuing to increase in Boston, rents are continuing to increase in San Francisco they\u2019re continuing to increase in San Diego. We\u2019re even seeing it in Seattle as well for life science space, and that\u2019s just going to continue to put pressure on cap rates, so I guess kind of round up your original question. Joel Marcus : So on Cambridge just to get back to one number, I think you could see something between 12% and 15% mark to market there this year. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes Rose : Dean just want to come back to the investment side, can you basically tell us the largest, not by name on who it is but by dollars, the largest public holding that you have of that $173 million. What does the single largest position amount to? And the on the private side, about $190 million or so, what would be the concentration in the largest investment there? Dean Shigenaga : There is probably -- we don\u2019t have that information instantly handy. But I would say there is probably about half of dozen companies that make up the majority of that, a good portion of that mark to market Michael. Smedes Rose : For the 140 million of mark to market that\u2019s about six companies you\u2019re saying? Dean Shigenaga : Yes, about half of dozen that make up a good majority of that. Smedes Rose : And how widespread is the $190 million of that, like 30 investments or 10 investments? Dean Shigenaga : Well, it\u2019s pretty widespread. Smedes Rose : So it\u2019s a lot? Dean Shigenaga : Yes. Smedes Rose : And then the increasing in terms of -- it looks like I guess some companies done public in the first quarter where effectively your available for sale cost downs have moved up from $22 million to $34 million, which stayed flat in the second quarter. So the big move in unrealized gains sequentially was just from the companies that have done public in the first quarter seeing in their stocks move up 50%-60%? Dean Shigenaga : Yes, the big increase had a lot to do with IPOs in the current quarter. Smedes Rose : But your cost base has stayed at $34 million. So I would have thought you would have had seen more transfer out of five bucket into the public, if they\u2019ve done public in the second quarter? Dean Shigenaga : Michael, our cost bases on these investments are really-really small. Smedes Rose : Really on the public securities? Dean Shigenaga : Yes, on the public securities. Yes, we probably had I think page four footnote five gives you a sense I think we\u2019re -- of the $172 million or $173 million, $140 of it roughly was unrealized gains in the public securities. Smedes Rose : And last quarter that was $83 million. And so I was just trying to figure out if you moved up sequentially $55 million, how much of that was stock just going up from the first quarter versus companies that went public is the cost base of the investments stayed flat? Dean Shigenaga : The majority of it relates to two investments that went public during the second quarter, that drove the majority of the increase in unrealized gains. Smedes Rose : And then as we think about this disposition of $195 million to $245 million, the projected asset sales have securities effectively versus hard assets versus land, because all of them have different sort of embedded cost to Alexandria? Dean Shigenaga : Yes. We are not prepared to get into that specific number right now, Michael. It is a component that you will see us reinvest over, call it the next four quarters or so. Just to give you an example, in July alone I think we monetized a little bit of our balance but it's relatively small in scale of the unrealized gains. So we are focused on it and you will see us get to it overtime. Smedes Rose : But most of the stuff is in progress, so it is 200 million to 245 million of other asset, remainder of asset sale? Dean Shigenaga : No, we commented earlier Michael that the stuff that's more advanced is included in the category right above that. I am turning to the page right now. So the category that's pending in targeted asset sales 225 Binney is under P&S as you know, the rest of the transactions in that balance in the disclosure is at various stages not at the P&S level yet but actively moving through the transaction process. And we have a number, so for, it's 220 at the midpoint that we're working on at much earlier stages. But we feel pretty comfortable with what we have to execute here. Again there is good interest in our core assets along with Joel mentioned we have a tenant interest in a specific asset. So we've got good activity going on right now. Operator : It appears there are no further questions at this time. So I'd turn the call back over to Joel Marcus for any additional or closing remarks. Joel Marcus : I just want to thank everybody for joining our second quarter call and we will talk to you on the third quarter. Thanks again very much for your time. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Paula Schwartz. Please go ahead. Paula Schwartz : Thank you, and good afternoon everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company's actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus. Please go ahead, Joel. Joel Marcus : Thank you, and welcome everybody to the third quarter call. Today with me are Dean Shigenaga, Chief Financial Officer; Steve Richardson, Chief Operating Officer; Dan Ryan, Executive Vice President; and Tom Andrews, Executive Vice President. And firstly, I'd like to start by congratulating the entire Alexandria team on a truly excellent third quarter; operating and financial results, really in all respect. Let me turn to the core to start the conversation. We had a very solid third quarter, 96.2% occupancy. We leased over 1 million square feet. And as you know, with the 4 million square feet year-to-date is for 2015 the highest in the company's history, with average lease term this quarter of about 8.7 years, very good. I think that really goes to the heart that the team has successfully executed and taken advantage of this great high-demand environment. Also 8.8% cash leasing spreads, 4.8% cash same-store property NOI growth, coupled with strong annual escalations in virtually every lease and triple-net lease structure in virtually every lease also has really driven our high margins. We're very proud of the core. Really proof positive, our client tenant user base wants to be on Alexandria campuses and in Alexandria owned and managed Class A buildings, because we are the brand. And we take the time and make it our business and solemn commitment to understand our tenants businesses, their space needs, growth as well as their challenges. And most of the facilities we deal with are really mission-critical facilities of our user base. Moving to demand, to give you a sense of what we see at the operating ground level. It's certainly true, there is a very supply constraint space availability in Alexandria's urban campus markets, particularly Cambridge and the City of San Francisco. This tightness of availability has certainly impacted behavior of some tenants in the market. Demand for Alexandria's urban campus and Class A buildings is the strongest in the company's 21-year history. And we're really blessed to be in the absolute best locations with the best assets at the intersection of the two most important successful industries, life science and technology. Increasing macro volatility, things like China, et cetera, have clearly had an impact on decision making by some tenants in the market. We believe that Alexandria's best-in-class campuses and facilities though will continue to maintain high occupancy and strong rental rates during such volatility. The window is open for biotech, but has become more selective regarding quality and valuation, and undoubtedly we'll have some impact on certain tenants in the market. Public sector, big tech at the forefront of mobile and cloud have had a banner year in 2015. Some and certainly not all of the private tech companies with $1 billion valuations and above, that are private, may have some challenges with sustaining recent peaks in private market valuations, which may have some impact again on decisions by some of tenants in the market. Moving to tenant strength and selection, something that's really very important here at Alexandria. I think it's great to note that 53% of our annual base rent is from investment-grade tenants, one of the highest in the REIT industry. And our duration of our top-20 tenants, comprising almost half of our ABR is 8.6 years. So we have strong, solid, durable and secured cash flows. Our very high-quality science and tech team coupled with our world-class advisors, provide us first-in-class research on our tenant industries and also our tenant underwriting, maybe two examples in point with leases signed this quarter. Let's go to Pinterest first. We signed a 150,000 square foot lease for 100% of our 505 Brannan Street campus project in one of the absolute best locations in the City of San Francisco for our first phase of development. We had multiple users looking at this spectacular location, but we chose Pinterest because of our longer-term relationship with the management team. Initial discussion started in kind of the spring of 2014, when Pinterest had raised $750 million with a valuation of $5 billion. Since then, Pinterest has raised an additional $1.3 billion on a valuation of $11 billion. So we try to be highly discriminating in our tenant selection. One of our key advisors is deeply connected to Pinterest, which also helped as well. We understand and like their user base and growth prospects. We feel that the B2B business will be even more potent than their historical B2C. On the multiple revenue stream aspect, we like the ad revenues, the approach they are using to buyable pins and partnerships with brands that can give them multiple stream of investment or multiple revenue streams. We also like the management team and the investors of first class, including Andreessen Horowitz, Bessemer Trust, Fidelity, Goldman and Wellington. The financial metrics are also important. We looked at cash on hand and ability of them to survive in the downturn. We also looked at their cash burn and the ability to cut it, in case they need to. And also critically important, all these companies a reasonable and methodical pathway to profitability. Moving on to bluebird bio. We signed a lease for 253,000 square feet at our 60 Binney Street property with bluebird bio. Overall demand in the Cambridge market at the time of selection of bluebird for the 60 Binney project was significant. There was a mix of demand both, credit and non-credit as well as life science and technology. Space needs and timing vary considerably for each requirement. IBM Watson was in the market and we were fortunate to capture them as a subtenant on a 10 years lease at the 75/125 Binney Street. That location and space matched their timing well, as 60 and 100 Binney developments would have been delivered too late for their requirement. Similarly, Alexandria was also able to fill the requirement for Bristol-Myers at 100 Binney, since we had opportunistically begun the project. We also had secured Sanofi-Genzyme as our anchor at 50 Binney. So bluebird bio was ultimately selected based on a number of factors, including timing, space needs, relationship and we have high degree of respect for Nick Leschly, the CEO, whose father also was CEO of Smithkline Beecham. The quality of the company, the profile, the quality of the technology and the prospects, their space need match well with the 60 Binney project, which will lead to significant construction cost savings, and given the ability to build both 50 and 60 Binney simultaneously. Alexandria has also had an important and strategic relationship both with the company and also its early investors and Board members. And we also see the overall mix within the ecosystem to be an important consideration for a long-term value. Similar to Biogen, bluebird is a few years away from potential regulatory, as Biogen was a number of years ago from potential regulatory approval of its first product. It would then commence commercial sales soon thereafter and continue to build out their product offering and grow the company. Both, the stage and growth potential of the company are critical to the overall ecosystem and fundamentally, while large pharma companies keep moving into Kendall Square today. At the end of the day, we have three publicly traded biotech companies looking at these Binney projects. And we ultimately chose bluebird for 60 Binney. bluebird has almost $1 billion in cash and marketable securities as of the end of the second quarter. Its current market cap exceeds $3 billion. I won't get into the drugs, but it is clearly the leader in the gene therapy area. And we believe that their clinical and preclinical programs as well as their partnership will lead to a very successful company over the years. The current demand is still solid in Cambridge and new requirements of both early and later stage as well. Remember too, we founded Alexandria 21 years ago on the basis that we could successfully underwrite a complex life science industry, because no one else up to that time had really been able to successfully do it on a national platform. And 21 years later, I'd say, we're doing a great job of it. On our highly prelease development and redevelopment, this provides very strong protection for future cash flows, Dean will highlight. The 1.5 million square feet at 89% leased to be delivered by the fourth quarter of '16, Page 35 of the supplement. And on Page 36 of the supplement, the 1.8 million square feet of development and redevelopment to be delivered in 2017 and 2018. We're building the budget with very solid yields and good margins to reasonable exit cap rates, as you can see. We're also very careful about any new starts and we'll look at each and every one of them very carefully. Steve will answer any questions on the new disposition announced, the sale of the partial interest at 1500 Owens. So together with 225 Binney announced last quarter, we've secured a very high quality and sophisticated buyer and long-term partner. Excellent price discovery, I think, for net asset value and now two of our top submarkets, San Francisco and Cambridge, and strong price per square foot. I think this demonstrates Alexandria's ability to create value through careful and prudent asset recycling and high value and high rental rate development. On final comments, couple of things, I'd say, the recent congressional budget deal, there will be about $1 billion to $2 billion additional for NIH per year in funding, which is a good thing and increasing the FDA budget, which is also good. There has been a lot of noise around a pharma. I think it's fair to say today, the five majors J&J, Roche, Novartis, Pfizer and Merck, all have met or exceeded their expectations and have broad-based new product pipelines, which are very sustainable. They're got multibillion dollar products in the pipeline as well. And I think the noise around pricing is clearly misguided. Specialty pharma, all of Valeant and Turing, where there is little R&D and very aggressive approach to the market built on M&A and other kinds of different approaches, I think is where the scrutiny should lie. Biotech continues to innovate, solving dreaded diseases, and that's really front and center. So let me finish, before I turn it over to Dean, by a couple of comments about biotech in general. 734 IPOs have been launched over the past 36 years, raising about $35 billion. That investment more or less has roughly yielded $850 billion of current value for the sector. The window is clearly open, but more selective on quality and valuation as I said. And I think something that's important, the sentiment, not fundamentals, have turned negative, as the noise factor is high in a political environment. Sentiment, not fundamentals. Science and medical advances and innovation are accelerating. Cures will clearly save large amounts of money in the future and there is only sector that can really address that and that's the biopharma sector. Bottomline is, the biotech and pharma sector, biotech in particular, is well-financed. Regulators are supportive, innovation is present and valuations are lower, leading to an optimistic outlook. Let me turn it over to Dean. Dean Shigenaga : Thanks, Joel. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everybody. I've got three important topics to cover today. First, growth in NOI and net asset value through highly lease value creation projects; second, prudent management of our balance sheet and our funding strategy; and third, key capital matters for the fourth quarter, including important comments on our self registration filing this morning. Jumping right in, growth in net operating income and net asset value through disciplined allocation of capital into highly-leased development and redevelopment projects really have highlighted nicely in our supplemental. And Joel referenced Page 35 and 36, I encourage you to take a look at those two pages. But for the fourth quarter of '16, we're expecting to deliver about 1.5 million square feet by then. It's fairly backend weighted. This is highly leased at about 89%. And we're going to deliver about $75 million to $80 million of annual incremental NOI upon stabilization of the square footage. Additionally, on Page 36 of our supplemental, we've highlighted another 1.8 million square feet, again highly leased at 71%. That is going to contribute another $105 million to $110 million of annual incremental NOI upon stabilization. And these are projects scheduled for completion really in 2017 and 2018. All this square footage, about 3.3 million square feet is targeted with average cash yield just north of 7%. In comparison, we recently announced the partial sale of two Class A properties with one located in Mission Bay and the other located in Cambridge at an average cap rate of 4.6%, really highlighting the tremendous value we have generated through the ground up development of these two properties. This also highlights the value creation in process on approximately 3.3 million highly-leased rentable square feet, again to be placed in service in 2016, 2017 and 2018. Moving on toward the prudent management of our balance sheet and our funding strategy. As we've highlighted, our balance sheet is solid with really well-laddered debt maturities and really limited maturities through 2018. Our debt maturities for 2016 were reduced subsequent to quarter end with the repayment of $76 million in October, leaving less than $235 million maturing in 2016/ Our balance sheet liquidity as of September 30 is over $1.2 billion on a pro forma basis to reflect the $350 million, and commitments available under the construction loan for 50 and 60 Binney Street that we closed in October. Liquidity by the end of the year is expected to be approximately $1.8 billion, as we complete an unsecured bond offering very soon in several important sales of real estate. We remain on track to meet our net debt to adjusted EBITDA goal of 6.9x by yearend. As you know, we focus on decisions that drive long-term versus short-term performance, including our leverage goal. We continue to execute on improvements in our credit metrics, including net debt to adjusted EBITDA in order to further enhance our balance sheet with flexibility. In order to provide transparency in various metrics, our disclosures include short-term trends with quarter annualized metrics and longer-term trends with trailing 12-month metrics. The longer-term metrics eliminate quarter-to-quarter volatility that may appear in the quarterly metrics. We believe our approach provides the investment community better visibility in the trends and various metrics that we disclose. Moving on to our funding strategy. You may have noticed in recent years, we have generated over $500 million to fund growth through development. The two drivers of this included roughly $125 million per year of cash flows from operating activities after dividends. And approximately $400 million, primarily from long-term fixed rate debt from the unsecured bond market through growth in EBITDA. Growth in EBITDA allows us to fund a significant amount of construction without increasing leverage. And we expect to continue to fund approximately $0.5 billion of construction in 2016 and 2017 from these two sources of capital. Demand for high-quality core real estate remain strong and has allowed us to sell on average of approximately $200 million per year over the past five years. We expect demand for high-quality real estate to continue into 2016. And accordingly, we anticipate real estate sales to remain an important component of our capital plan for 2016. Over the past five years, I think, you've noted that our capital strategy execution has been proven to be very prudent on the management of common equity, including our projection for 2015, the proceeds of the issuance of common stock has represented really only approximately 20% to 25% of our total sources of capital. As a reminder, there has been no significant common equity issuance in the past two years. Our capital plan on average for the last five years has utilized significantly less common equity than expected for leverage at 6.9x, primarily due to the benefit of retained operating cash flows, significant EBITDA growth and sales of real estate. In summary, we will continue funding our growth with the most cost-efficient long-term capital. Most importantly, we will execute these objectives, while we also focus on generating growth and FFO per share and net asset value. Turning to our capital plan for the remainder of 2015. Most importantly, sales of real estate, we have about $600 million in proceeds forecasted for the fourth quarter with approximately $300 million or 50% of this under contract to close in the fourth quarter. The other $300 million or 50% is moving along quickly and is focused on the sale of a partial interest in a core property, while we also continue to pursue the sale or sales of other core-like properties. As a policy, we do not comment or speculate on potential sales beyond the current disclosures. Next, on our shelf registration statement. You may have noticed our shelf registration was filed this morning. This filing is required, is effective upon filing and simply eliminates one additional filing in order for the company to issue unsecured bonds. The investment grade bond market has shown improvement in recent weeks, as you probably are well aware of, and we do expect to issue bonds very soon. We remain focused on tenure of 10 years, since it fits wells into our debt maturities. Additionally, as mentioned last quarter, our ATM expired in early June and we do expect to file a new program. Just to be clear, we do not expect to use the ATM program this year, as we are on track to complete our projected real estate sales for 2015. Lastly, we completed one of the two construction loans anticipated this year and we are focused now on closing the second construction loan in the coming months. Moving on briefly to guidance and some closing comments. The detailed assumptions underlying our updated guidance for 2015 are included on Page 3 and 4 of our supplemental package. We are in a great position today with the real estate strategy focused on unique campuses and AAA urban innovation cluster locations. We have one of the best teams in the REIT industry and a top brand that collectively drives demand from high quality and innovative companies. Internal growth is solid and is expected to remain solid in 2016. We generate high-quality cash flows with 53% of our ABR from investment grade tenants. Our cash flows are stable with 96% triple net leases. Our cash flow has increased contractually with 95% of our leases containing annual rent escalations, averaging up almost 3%. Demand remain solid for our high-quality buildings and AAA locations in very supply-constraint innovation submarkets, and is expected to continue to drive very solid cash and GAAP rental rate increases on leasing activity over the next year. We continue to focus on disciplined allocation of capital into our visible and highly-leased multi-year value creation pipeline. We will continue to execute on prudent management of our balance sheet and funding of our growth with the most cost efficient long-term capital. Most importantly, we will execute these objectives, while we also focus on generating growth in FFO per share, net asset value and common stock dividends. We believe we have the right assets in right location that will inspire productivity, efficiency, creativity and success for our highly innovative client tenants. Our team remains focused on continuing to build the best-in-class franchise. Thank you. And I'll turn it back to Joel. Joel Marcus : Operator, we're ready to go Q&A please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Manny Korchman with Citi. Manny Korchman : Just thinking about marketable securities sales as a potential source of equity, how are the changes in the biotech stock markets change the way you think about selling or holding on to your marketable securities there? Joel Marcus : I don't think they've had that much influence. As you know from this past quarter, we did have a number of sales and we'll continue that over the coming quarters. We still have significant built-in gains. So we're comfortable. And I think the quality of the holdings that we have is high. And so we feel very good about the position we're in. And we try not to be just pure market timers. Manny Korchman : Joel, you guys disclosed the amount of those gains. What was the underlying balance that you sold to get to those gain numbers? Joel Marcus : Bear with us, one second. I don't have the proceeds right in front of me, Manny. I think that's what you're getting to, right? Manny Korchman : Yes, the actual sale amounts, exactly. Joel Marcus : Again, I don't have the actual proceeds. I think the investment disposition this quarter probably netted out a slight positive in overall investing activity, meaning dispositions net of reinvestment. So it was a small net cash receipt at the end of the day for the quarter. Manny Korchman : I mean, can we think about it in terms of multiples, so was it 2x gain? Was it sort of flat to what you held? Can you give us some idea of just the magnitude? Joel Marcus : Well, to put it into perspective, Manny, what we are looking at is on the $104 million, $105 million of unrealized gains we have as of quarter end, I think we only have about a $30 million adjustment. Manny Korchman : My other question was, so there has been some recent news on Biogen cutting its work force. Has that impacted yours or do you think it will impact [technical difficulty]? Joel Marcus : Yes, so I'll ask Tom to speak on that. Thomas Andrews : It was reported that Biogen might cut about 800 heads in Cambridge, in Eastern Massachusetts. Recall, they lease or own about 1 million square feet in Kendall Square and they lease about 350,000 square feet in Weston 128, which is 50% subleased to another company. But we see no evidence that that's relatively small layoff in terms of the total headcount and space occupancy is going to impact Kendall Square at all. Joel Marcus : That may impact their future need for space here in the short-to-medium term, but certainly they're not abandoning space that they have. And we own their headquarters building together with TIA, so that were in great shape of that building. Operator : Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jamie Feldman : So you had commented that when you chose bluebird, there were several biotech companies that opted for bluebird. Can you just talk about across your major market, how many types of conversations like that you're having, like when you have a space, the multiples of tenants that are interested in that space? Joel Marcus : I think it's very common. I mean, both Steve and Tom can give you color on that, but I think in virtually every case these days there are multiple users for the same space, and obviously timing, rental rate, quality of tenant and a whole lot of things factor into that. Stephen Richardson : We do, we have more demand than we have supplies certainly in the market. We're tracking 22 different tenants in excess of 100,000 square feet in San Francisco alone and then another 6 million square feet of demand in the Greater Stanford area. So we are being very selective. And we do have a number of options that we choose from when we're selecting these tenants. Thomas Andrews : As Joel mentioned, we did have multiple parties pursuing the space that we ended up selecting bluebird for. We have multiple parties looking at the remaining space at 100 Binney where we're working to do some additional leasing on our remaining 180,000 or so square feet, which delivers in late calendar '17, so its not uncommon at all for us to have multiple prospects and we're managing carefully to try to optimize our tenanted growth. Jamie Feldman : And so those three tenants, I assume that's who you're talking to for some of the other space? Joel Marcus : One of them, yes. They're all three public. One is an existing tenant, while two were existing tenants, and one is not, but the answer is yes. Jamie Feldman : And then can you talk about, I think in the supplemental, there's still no total cost projection for 400 Dexter or 100 Binney. Can you talk about what those final cost on those and why it's not in here? Joel Marcus : Jamie, what we try to do is, as soon as we announce the new development to give as much information that's available at the time new projects commence. Occasionally, 400 Dexter, as an example is going through a few different iterations, but we do have a general sense of where we're going to fall out. But until we feel comfortable that the disclosures will be final, we prefer to wait until some of the moving pieces are resolved. I can tell you that generally speaking I think in Cambridge, we're probably looking roughly high level $900 a foot all-in at completion on 50 and 60 as an example. As a baseline, there is some different attributes in 100 Binney. And as we round out our budget, we'll disclose both the cost of completions and the returns, but I would say that you should keep in mind the returns are going to be very similar directionally with 50 and 60 Binney. And again, I gave you overall returns for all these projects that are delivering in '16, '17 and '18 and its just north of 7%. So I hope that gives you some comfort that we're building solid projects and we'll provide these disclosures in the near term. Jamie Feldman : So you said $900 per square foot in Cambridge, what about in Seattle? Joel Marcus : Let me not comment specifically, because it may not be applicable to that project right now, but suffice to say, Jamie, that our overall average yields on a cash basis are just north of 7%. Jamie Feldman : But I'm saying cost per foot? Joel Marcus : I know. Well, if we were prepared to disclose that, Jamie, we would have put it in the sub. So let us refine the budget and when we're prepared to provide that disclosure, we will. But it falls right down the fairway from a yield perspective. Jamie Feldman : And then I guess just thinking about next year, do you think your same-store NOI would be higher or lower than what we've seen in '15, based on what you have coming up? Joel Marcus : Well, Jamie, I think the way we'd like the community to think about same property performance, I think over a long term, cash same property performance is probably averaged about 5%. And I think the way you build up to that number is, keep in mind, you've got triple rent leases that would drive stable cash flows, but you've got annual escalations that are approaching 3% embedded in our leases. So your cash NOI will grow close to 3%. You're marking-to-market roughly, and I'm going to use simple math for the next step, roughly 10% of the portfolio being mark-to-market. And we're marking that close to 10% right now. So you get 1% drop and down to NOI on top of the 3% of the annual escalations. And then you've got the opportunity to early renew. And if you look at the leasing activity, the leasing activity is easily 2x, the expirations. And so we are getting ahead and capturing some rental growth, call it, somewhere between 1% to 3%. Dropping to NOI 3% would be just a home run year. But if you pick up 1% to 2%, now you built up a 5% to 6% base cash same property NOI performance. I don't want to get into guidance for 2016, which we'll do in December, but I think overall core performance is going to be very solid for '16. Operator : Our next question comes from Sheila McGrath with Evercore. Sheila McGrath : Joel, I was wondering if you could help us understand for newer companies like bluebird or Pinterest or Stripe, do you underwrite such that the development yields would be a little bit higher or higher rent for these newer tenants or do you charge the same as strong pharma, credit pharma, tenant? Joel Marcus : Yes. I think that depends on the -- and I'll ask Tom and Steve to comment. I think it depends a lot on the particular building, the particular rental rate in the situation, their particular program, because every tenant and every lease is actually different. It isn't vanilla like there is three vanilla choices and they're all pretty similar. They're actually somewhat different in each respect, but I'll ask these guys to give you kind of an on the ground comment. Thomas Andrews : I think, as Joel said, each of these transaction is different. So it's really hard, you really can't compare them, as if they're vanilla deals. There's always a nuance to them. And sometimes, for example, even a more creditworthy company, we maybe able to get them to pay more, because of the particular situation that they are in with respect to that particular deal. So I wouldn't say that there is any -- that you could consistently assume that we get more money from a tenant who might be less creditworthy than another tenant that might have been a candidate for the space. I mean it really comes down to specifics of the negotiation and the transaction. Joel Marcus : And certainly, security deposit is different. But Steve, you could? Stephen Richardson : Yes, just to add to that, Sheila, it is just a very dynamic environment. The tenants are moving very quickly to lockdown space. So I think what's really important when you step back is really the tenant underwriting and how we go about valuing the companies and looking at their long-term tenancy and partnership in the building with them. So that's where we really focus our attention. Sheila McGrath : Joel, also you have a well leased development pipeline for '16, '17, '18, should we assume that you're remaining patient on other land development opportunities, or because you have it enough on the plate right now, are or you in the market looking for additional development opportunities? Joel Marcus : Yes, I think in my prepared comments, Sheila, I mentioned that any new developments we'd be looking at pretty carefully. We've got the 1.5 million square feet that Dean mentioned on Page 35 and the 1.8 million on Page 36. That's a pretty robust pipeline for '16, '17 and '18. I think there are opportunities that will come to us whether they come through current campuses, for example, in San Diego or other locations. And certainly in New York we're in discussions on the new building. But I wouldn't say anything. We're not looking at kicking off anything imminently at all. And anything we do, we'd be mindful of the macro market environment, and then obviously the demand in the market and then just our overall cash usage for that particular year, so it's kind of a complex equation there that we look at. Sheila McGrath : One last quick one, just on construction cost. Any worry that construction costs or labor moving higher -- labor cost? Joel Marcus : Certainly, New York is a big worry. I think today, we're very fortunate when we kicked off the West Tower back at the kind of the end of '12 and early '13 we had a really great price point in the New York market. Today, I don't think that would be true. So that's certainly an important factor. And again, Dan and Tom, and Steve can comment on pricing. Up till now, I think rental rate increases have outstripped construction price increases, but it's something to pay attention to. Daniel Ryan : Yes, we're seeing some pressure on some construction material, particularly glazing. That has kind of been offset by savings and structural steel due to Chinese sort of drop off in usage. So on balance, we're cautious. We're trying to really primarily focus on some of these long lead items to be able to lock that in today. But we don't think it's a super material impact, but I don't know how you guys feel in your markets. Thomas Andrews : I'd say that we've got major projects underway, where we've done a vast majority of the buyout in prior months. So I think we feel very comfortable. As Joe was saying that the rental rate increases that we experienced in the market certainly outstripped the construction price increases that we were seeing when we were buying out these jobs. But we do watch it very carefully. Curtain wall, as Dan mentioned is a tough trade right now. There is so many projects going vertical in the eastern cities with curtain wall, so it's tough, but we've got that well managed on our projects in Cambridge. Stephen Richardson : I think we're seeing pricing pressure from subcontractors. I think they're very busy in the Bay area, in particular, with both the residential and life science and technology construction under the way. What we do though for each of these projects, especially as we get into '17 and '18 deliveries is have a very clear annual escalation in construction pricing. So that is well baked into their pro formas and the anticipated yields, so we don't think we'll be surprised beyond what we've already got already baked in. Operator : Our next question comes from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Rich Anderson : Dean, you mentioned that on a long term average on same-store, I know you don't want to get into 2016 guidance, but do you think that the 8% to 10% re-leasing spreads that you've been getting -- you're guiding to this year is a sustainable number for the next couple of years or you kind of see that, it kind of trailing down based on where the re-leasing is going to be happening in future years? Joel Marcus : I think Rich, what's important to keep in mind on leasing performance, at least going out for the next 12 months is that, we are dealing with some of the best buildings in the best locations in very, very supply constraint markets. And so we're in a good environment, where the best most innovative companies are looking to be in the best facilities in the best markets. And I would think that leasing activity is going to remain very robust going out for the next 12 months. And I would not be surprised to find guidance following fairly close to our expectations for '15. Rich Anderson : The reason I ask you is I'm looking at '16 expirations, and you have Research Triangle, Canada, Maryland whereas this year it was San Francisco, if I'm reading this right. So just wondering if the geographical footprint will play a role? Joel Marcus : Well, it's a little bit of that, but you also have to keep in mind that the leasing activity in a given year also benefits from renewals that you can't identify from the supplemental, which is I'd believe Page 24, which shows our expirations down by category. And that's also an important driver, so getting ahead of some expirations that are beyond '16 will also contribute. I would say, the big picture, the market drivers are fairly obvious that the two top markets are big drivers of leasing activity, but I think the top five all contribute very nicely to '16. Rich Anderson : You mentioned, and I understood the roadmap to funding development, and you kind of got it covered, so to speak, to $500 million, but are there any situations that you see where the funding of development would meaningfully exceed $500 million in any of the next couple of years? Joel Marcus : Well, that's kind of been true this year and it's been true last year and possibly the year before, so I think it's safe to say that it will. And we do have a fairly robust pipeline. So yes, Rich, it will exceed that. Rich Anderson : I mean, I'm looking at the guidance and it's in the $500 million to $600 million range, right, for development spending this year? Joel Marcus : Yes. And it's important to keep in mind the strategy that we've used over the last, call it, five years. And our approach going forward is going to be very consistent with that. We want to minimize the consumption of common equity to the extent possible and focus on asset sales in an environment when private market valuations are attractive capital. Rich Anderson : If you had a choice between the two, and you had to make a choice, would it be FFO growth or NAV growth as a guiding strategy? Dean Shigenaga : I would say, first NAV, but we can't ignore the investors that do focus on FFO. I think their bottomline both important, but we're not wed to one or the other in particular. We're looking for a long term -- decisions for the long-term that will drive both of those metrics, but more importantly hopefully total return performance. Rich Anderson : And then last question, maybe for, Joel. Do you have any comment about the BioMed deal? Joel Marcus : I think it's a very good positive for them. The truth be known, analyst like you guys followed both of us, but in most of the submarkets that we're in, we actually virtually don't compete with them outside of some assets in Cambridge. Seattle, very little competition; in San Francisco very little competition; San Diego, even though they're based there, it hasn't been a lot of competition. And New York, not the same thing, so as a macro company, yes, but on a submarket basis. But I think it's a positive for them. Rich Anderson : And do you think it could result in some activity coming your way vis-\u00e0-vis Blackstone or is it too early to say? Joel Marcus : You mean assets that we might be interested in? Rich Anderson : Yes. Joel Marcus : Yes, I could say publicly, we have no interest in any other onsets. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Sullivan with Cowen Group. Jim Sullivan : Just kind of a similar question to one that Rich asked, but a little bit differently. Joel, if we have entered a period of significantly weaker capital formation, are there any geographic markets in which Alexandria has a presence, which are likely to be more affected than others? Joel Marcus : That's a tough question to answer, because number one, we're as you know very highly leased both in our operating portfolio and then the development and redevelopment side. Each market is different. Seattle tends to be tech and institutional. San Francisco tends to be biotech pharma and tech. San Diego tends to be more biotech and pharma. Maryland has been kind of a broad-base of different of companies, lot of service companies and things. Research Triangle is turning out to be an ag tech Mecca. New York, we just landed Nestle, their skincare group. And Lilly up for another building, but it seems broad-based in the life science area and then Cambridge is heavily biotech pharma and tech. So each market really has its own dynamic, but at the moment, we haven't seen any dramatic change in any specific market that I could give you, but I try to characterize what we're seeing on the ground. There are some tenants that, because of lack of availability are sometimes giving up expansion or just looking maybe at different locations. But at the moment I'm not sure I could give you anything specific. Jim Sullivan : And it would sound like, and I don't mean to put words into your mouth, but what's happened over the last 90 days does not appear to really have had an impact in terms of your disposition strategy? Joel Marcus : No. not at all, but I do think that people are paying attention to the capital markets. Obviously, pharma doesn't need to, because they don't finance through the capital markets. Big tech also doesn't so much finance through the big capital markets, but obviously the private guys on the private side in tech, and obviously the biotech market are focused on the capital markets. So people are paying attention to the shift that's happened over the past couple of months. There is no question about, just board room talk. Jim Sullivan : And then final one from me. Alexandria has been selective investors in private funding rounds for various companies at early stages and you've been through a few cycles. Can you characterize the slowdown in activity over the last 90 days? Has it stopped or slowed materially? And if you have a guesstimate on where it's going to go in the next 12 months? Joel Marcus : So that's an interesting question, and the answer is, it has not slowed down appreciably at all. We tend to like big idea companies, big platforms, multiple shots on goal with products, great management teams, great syndicates. And I would say, we have not seen any slow down in the pace of new opportunities that have been presented to us at all believe it or not. What is slowing down is the exit of the pipeline not ours, but the biotech pipeline having gotten through that really high quality companies. There are some companies that haven't been able to get out, but there is also a new crop of pretty high quality companies that I think you probably see a file either have done seven filings or will be filling ahead of JPMorgan Healthcare. So I think you'll see a pick up in that, but we've not seen a slow down on the private investment on the biotech side at all. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Tyler with Green Street Advisors. Kevin Tyler : A high-level one for you, Joel, tying back to your opening comments. You talked about a sentiment shift and not really a fundamental shift towards the sector, biotech sector. But how does the fundamental shift, if there is one, affect the MITs, NYUs, data farmers, the more academic government-based tenants that are in your stable? Joel Marcus : Well, I think the budget deal that appears worked out between the Republicans and the Democrats, and it looks like both houses will be on board and ultimately the President is on board, I believe. I think it will be a net positive for the institutional side of things a bit, providing incrementally about $1 billion to $2 billion more annually to the NIH. Tom can comment on the ground, but I think one thing that surprised us, and I think we said it on past calls, is the slowdown in institutional activity like in Longwood, whereas Cambridge has been on fire. And a lot of Cambridge tenants won't go to Longwood. It kind of surprised us, there hasn't been more activity. Thomas Andrews : Just to echo what Joel said, I mean we expected more growth and more demand out of the Harvard affiliated Longwood institutions, where we're at about 63% leased I think on that asset. And we've got some groups kicking around, but not really moving very swiftly on the remaining 150,000 square feet or so that we have to lease there. We're hopeful that this potential budget deal that Congress is talking about could result in some additional NIH funding and instigate some additional activity. The other area where funding comes to these institutions commonly is through philanthropy. And there are some potential demand drivers from some foundation groups that are looking to invest over there, but we haven't seen any real estate activity out of that yet. Kevin Tyler : And then your guidance, Dean, suggested you're not really planning much more in a way of acquisitions for the current year. I was wondering if that's based more on a change in cost to capital of both, more on development at the current time or perhaps just more color or insight into the state of deal pricing currently in the market? Joel Marcus : So maybe let me just comment. I think, if you go back to our total acquisitions for the year, at the beginning of the year we probably couldn't have told you that this was the array of acquisitions we would be pursuing. The MIT acquisition, as we mentioned, came up really quite by circumstance. The deal that Dan executed with Qualcomm and re-tenanting that building with Lilly, again, came to market kind of serendipitously and it presented a great opportunity to expand our campus. But months before that, we didn't have any idea of planning for it. So I think our primary external growth platform has been focused on development, so we haven't really been focused on some kind of benchmark for acquisition. And I think that's probably true of without getting into guidance for 2016. I think that's probably true of 2016 as well. Kevin Tyler : The last one I had just, can you give us any insight into the inquiry that you may have received from other institutions interested in your properties. So I guess, hence, eventually your sales or dispositions. But has it increased at all since the BioMed news has surfaced? Joel Marcus : Well, I'm not sure. We did a pretty methodical set of meetings back about a year-and-a-half ago, when originally looking potentially for a JV partner on some developments, which morphed into a different kind of an approach. And I would say, I personally did like 15 or 16 101s. And I think virtually every single group we met with, all brand names, expressed high-levels of interest for the quality of the location, quality of asset, quality of management and quality of tenancy. And I think even today, we still do have a number of people that do approach us about getting involved in whether it's an asset sale or potentially partnering on development. So that's kind of ongoing. I don't know that the Blackstone deal either increased or somehow hastened it. I think it's been pretty consistent over the last two years, since we've been kind of moving in that direction. Operator : Our next question comes from Dave Rodgers with Baird. Dave Rodgers : Maybe for Tom or Steve, I wanted to follow-up on earlier question, particularly regarding any pushback you're seeing in Cambridge or San Francisco on rent levels. And I'm thinking particularly from biotech or pharma companies that are just getting priced out from some of the more tech office, heavy dense users of space. I mean are you seeing that in the market or is it just that many more tenants in the tech side taking space than on the lab side today? Stephen Richardson : No, not necessarily. We are actually seeing that converse. The tenants really want to be in these locations. It's kind of an essential must have business imperative for the life science tenants in Mission Bay to be surrounding UCSF for the technology tenants, be in the Mission Bay/SoMa cluster. And so to the extent rents have risen to the price level they're at, they are sustainable, they are acceptable. And we've seen just the opposite that the tenants are really prioritizing location over some potential price sensitivity right now at this level. Thomas Andrews : Yes, David, in Cambridge, as you know, much more of the demand that we've seen there has been on the life science side, but it's been both lab and office space, much more of the recent growth both lab and office space. And look, I think there certainly are some younger companies who are getting queasy at the rental rates and are looking elsewhere. But as I said, we've got multiple parties looking at the remaining space that we have. We have multiple parties looking at that 60 Binney, when we transact with the bluebird deal. We have multiple parties looking at 100 Binney. So we're not seeing a great -- we're not seeing people withdraw from the location because of pricing. Joel Marcus : Also in those locations, it's a fundamental question of recruitment and retention too that really underlies that. And that's almost like a cost of doing business as opposed to just a rent number. Dave Rodgers : And maybe with regard to, Joel, or Dan's on the phone too, the redevelopment pipeline I think is about 525,000 square feet plus or minus. It looks like some of that is going to go from lab to more tech office. Can you talk about the returns on that? And then I guess the second part of that is do you see more assets kind of moving into the redevelopment bucket over the next year or so? Joel Marcus : So I'll have Dean comment it for the moment. Dean Shigenaga : So I guess the redevelopment, I mean the bulk of -- the biggest project you have disclosed are there. The other two aren't quite as large. But you have $240 million, roughly at completion on Campus Point, which is probably the largest project there. Joel Marcus : Again, going from an office to a lab, and so all these are in a pretty good shape. We're working on lease up of 11 Hurley and 9625 just a bit -- I'm sorry 11 Hurley is under negotiation; 9625, we're working on. But it's just premature to talk about the status of those negotiations, but we do have ongoing negotiations. Again, I think the overall returns are going to fall on average here, 7%-plus on the initial cash yields. As far as the future pipeline, we do have a little bit that's disclosed in the supplemental and the expiration schedules. That's potential, but it's pretty small. So I don't see anything in the portfolio today that represents a redevelopment over the next, call it, year or two. Dean Shigenaga : So again, just to be clear, the Campus Point acquisition is going from office to lab. Hurley is going from whatever was before to a lab. It looks like we have a deal for that whole building. And then 9625, we're not certain it could go lab or it could go office, but that's remains to be same. Operator : And we have a follow-up question from Manny Korchman with Citi. Michael Bilerman : It's Michael Bilerman with Manny. Joel, I take it when the proxy comes out for BioMed, we will not see a REIT then in any of the disclosure, given your comments? Dean Shigenaga : We won't see a what? Michael Bilerman : A REIT, we won't see a company Alexandria mentioned in there? Dean Shigenaga : I don't think so. Michael Bilerman : Dean, and I'm sure you probably have this at your fingertips, just thinking about debt-to-EBITDA, as you're going to embark on this fixed income unsecured issuance, I'm sure the fixed-income investors are going to look at your 3Q numbers on an annualized basis. They'll back out the securities gains, they'll back out the FAS income, and they'll get to 7.9x debt-to-EBITDA and they're going to ask you if you have a target -- Dean Shigenaga : I'm not so sure about that. Michael Bilerman : Well, they may. Dean Shigenaga : I don't know. Michael Bilerman : Because they tend to be -- in fact they tend to be -- Dean Shigenaga : That's fuzzy math, Mike. Michael Bilerman : Well, it's not fuzzy math. I mean, they are going to -- see, they're not going to annualized securities gains, right? Dean Shigenaga : I think they're going to look at what our target is at yearend and is it achievable. Michael Bilerman : Correct. Dean Shigenaga : Yes. Michael Bilerman : And that's where I was going, right, because maybe you can in getting there, you got $600 million of sales, $300 million that are done, $300 million that are in the works. You also have $200 million of construction spend offset by $30 million of free cash flow. You get to 7x, but that doesn't take into account the lost EBITDA, right. The debt balance at the end of the year is going to be lower because you have $600 million of sales, but you'll still be earning income on most of the assets so there will be a slight tick back up. So maybe you can just bucket getting into 2016 getting down to that 6.5 target, the EBITDA from all of the development and redevelopment, how much is coming online next year versus the incremental capital spend that you will have in furthering the development pipeline for the '17 and '18 starts. And then what is the plug effectively, if any, in terms of sales to get you to the right 6.5? Joel Marcus : So Michael just to clarify, I mean part of my comments during the prepared section of the call was really focus on less quarter-to-quarter variations and metrics, which we all know are tend to be volatile versus more long-term metrics and we are going to hit 6.9% by the end of this year. And once we get beyond '15, we will start to migrate closer to 6.5. There is no expectation for us to hit it in 2016, just to be clear, but we will make the move towards that over the couple of years following 2015. There is a lot of moving parts as you've highlighted in our business, because we have a tremendous pipeline of development opportunities that are highly leased, but we have a very disciplined approach in funding that, as I outlined in our prepared comments. And so we'll provide as much color I think that makes sense at Investor Day to help investors navigate or at least follow our path on leverage, but beyond leverage our overall goal that we want to accomplish in 2016. So I don't think anybody will find it a mystery for us to maintain leverage sub-7, as we go into '16 and then continue that downward on average over the next two years. Michael Bilerman : And how much NOI do you have lost in the fourth quarter from the $600 million of sales? So if that $600 million is, call it, about a 4.6 cap, so about $28 million of annualized NOI, how much are you suffering from a dilution standpoint in the fourth quarter in your guidance? Joel Marcus : Well, Michael, why don't we wrap up the fourth quarter because we do have $600 million of dispositions; half is under contract, the other half is not yet, and so the timing of those transactions are still pending. But you're right, there will be EBITDA loss through the dispositions, but you're talking about very low cap rate transactions on average, which is attractive capital that's funding our business and because it's a low cap rate overall average disposition for the fourth quarter, it is attractive from a replacement to common equity. And so I think we're making, as you probably can appreciate, the math works out from the ability for us to replace the need for common equity in a manner that is cheaper. And we had the need to raise the equivalent of whatever the equity proceeds of that $600 million was, Michel, in common equity. It probably would have resulted in even more dilution, because it would had a higher cost of capital apply to that. Michael Bilerman : Just lastly, on the security sales. If I go back to last quarter, at least a lot of the conversation was of this $225 million of projected remaining asset sales. At least I was led to believe that a majority of that would have been the public securities that were sitting on your books. It sounds like the sales in the third quarter perhaps were only about $30 million, if it had the same book-to-gain ratio and doesn't appear as though there's anything set for the fourth quarter. So had there been a change in the way that you're looking at liquidating the securities book at all? Joel Marcus : No. Not at all, Michael. I think my commentary over the last two quarters, at least, the last quarter if not the prior to that, had indicated that it would probably take time for us to monetize the gains partly because some of its locked up for a period of time. So there wasn't any expectation of an immediate monetization of it. I think you'll see us continue to monetize some of those gains as we look at over the next 12 to 24 months, but we feel really comfortable with -- these are very short list of companies that generate the $100 million-plus of unrealized gains and they are solid company. So we're not concerned about the gains vaporizing overnight, but we do plan to monetize some of them. Michael Bilerman : And I guess you'll put that back in the sup next quarter in terms of the sales proceeds, so that we can track it a little bit, that would be helpful. Joel Marcus : Yes, we can definitely help you guys with that disclosure. Michael Bilerman : It will be in the Q, but at least for the supplemental it would be good to have? Joel Marcus : It's been relatively small, so we haven't really highlighted it much, Michael, but we can think about that. Operator : It appears there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back to management for any additional or closing remarks. End of Q&A Joel Marcus : Thank you, very much. We're five minutes over, but we appreciate that and we look forward to talking to everybody on the fourth quarter and yearend call. Thanks everybody. Operator : This does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation.",

My name is Pauline, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Paula Schwartz, Rx Communications. Please go ahead. Paula Schwartz : Thank you, and good afternoon. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus. Please go ahead. Joel Marcus : Thanks Paula, and welcome everybody to the fourth quarter and year end 2015 call. With me today are Dean Shigenaga, Peter Moglia, Tom Andrews, Steve Richardson, and Dan Ryan. I wanted to first of all start off with really huge kudos to the entire ARE family for an excellent fourth quarter and year end 2015. I think the results and accomplishments are highlighted well in our press release and in the supp and they really speak for themselves. But on the other hand, we actually mourn the loss of an Alexandria's family member, Jeff Newton who passed over the last week or so and will be sorely missed in the family. Moving to the core and Dean will highlight some of this, we had strong fourth quarter and year end 2015 results and I think evidenced by the strong continuing guidance of our core for 2016. I think it's important to keep in mind we have a very high quality tenant base which provides stability in a volatile market which we're clearly in. 54% of our ABR is generated by investment grade tenants and 81% of our ABR is generated by our investment grade tenants, from our top 20 generating almost half the ABR. For the top 20, we have 8.3 years of average lease duration which gives us a nice long run-rate, almost half of our annual base rent. We also have a strong and diversified tenant base with only 3% exposure to really pure office or tech office on our operating properties. And 20% of our ABR is from the San Francisco region which has got a lot of headline news these days, but we are happy to say in our three strong sub-markets we're 100% occupied and we have very limited rollover this year of about 120,000 feet and below market expiring rent. So I think we are well-positioned. On the leasing side, on our operating assets, we have a very manageable 1.2 million square feet rolling this year which is about 7.6% of the operating asset base. 32% or almost 400,000 square feet is already been released. And our largest block is about 125,000 at Campus Point, when Lilly vacates San Diego on asset high quality space. On the development side, regarding leasing of our 2016 deliveries, 89% is leased, 91% leased during negotiation. We expect New York to become fully leased in the not too distant future. Longwood which is our joint venture remains at about 63% but we expect with the $2 billion in the NIH funding, that should help increase academic demand in that sub-market. And we look for multi-tenant users to populate the rest of the science project in San Diego which is about 81%. So of the 2016 deliveries, 1.5 million square feet add a average cash yield, initial cash yield of 7 plus. We feel that we are in very good position and we\u2019ve got approximately $75 million to $80 million, as you know, from the supplement of addition NOI to onboard. With respect to the 2017 and 2018 deliveries, we're 67% leased and 87% leased or under negotiation. At 100 Binney, we did have 1 floor lease request by an important tenant that actually now has been terminated. So lease of with 5 floors, we have 2 floors under active negotiations and several parties are discussing the remaining 3 floors and we look forward to resolving that in this year for sure. At 400 Dexter, the remaining 34% is expected to be picked up by Juno for hard options they have and if for some reasons they didn't lease it, we actually have demand today that would take that space. Our two new projects 9625 Town Center, we have 7 potential tenants looking at space there. And 10151 Barnes Canyon, we have 3 potential tenants looking at space there. On the tech side, our largest tech tenant is Alphabet which was up something like 5% today. They remain the anchor in our Mountain View project. Total ABR on tech today is less than 3%. I think it's important to note that really the financial model of the strong private tech company is really shifting from building platform to profitability and I think that's a good thing. On the life science side, we see strong continuing R&D numbers $100 plus billion, generated by or to be invested this year by both pharma and biotech which are not generally capital market dependent other than at the venture level for the smaller tenants. The NIH is receiving an increase of 2 billion and I guess, the President announced the Cancer Moonshot which may generate another billion if you can get that through Congress this year. With respect to the center for medicate services, the projections through 2024 show based on all we know today. And the predicted assumptions that the rate of increase in drug prices will roughly be in-line with the rate of increases in overall healthcare. Medicines, after all, certainly help to prevent disease in many cases, treat disease and avoid much higher cost downstream. Some drugs are costly but treatment of disease is a lot more expensive. Innovative treatments for diseases where there are few other options will still continue to command a solid pricing and innovative drugs that cure disease are clearly not the enemy as the political storm is out there. They really are the solution I expect that after the election this will essentially die down and it will become much more of an outcomes will bear more on pricing. The longer and healthier life will command higher pricing. And where you can prove offset to future healthcare expenses, which is in many the cases, again strong pricing will be expected. Part of the problem also is that you can't - drug manufacturers can't really discuss what payers information about our products before they're approved under current FDA guidelines and so there may need to be some further looking at that issue, because that would help I think start to - view this pricing discussion. By our demand for our ARE core assets as you can see from the press release and supplement is strong. We expect to tap this market with land sale and non-core assets sales during 2016 as well. On the balance sheet, we've guided to leverage between 65 and 69. So moving downward nicely for the end of 2016. For 2015 we maintained our strategic optionality with respect to the balance sheet and continue to manage our leverage down with our goal to get an investment grade rating upgrade overtime. As I said at Investor Day, generally we don't want to issue common equity below net asset value, but as we are negotiating the partial interest sale of 499 Illinois, we were able to really run across a great opportunity to sell some common equity in the fourth quarter without lowering either 2015 or 2016 per share earnings and that was an awfully nice thing. And at the same time, we are able to decrease the proceeds needed from the partial interest sale from the buyer Illinois, so all good results. Page 49 of the supplemental disclosure on investments evidenced continuing solid built-in- gains on our investment portfolio. And we executed some very good sales with good gains in December. And with that let me turn it over to Dean. Dean Shigenaga : Thanks Joel. Dean Shigenaga, here. Good afternoon, everybody. I've got three important topics. First is I want to highlight our strong results for 2015 and briefly comment on same property performance. Second, I want to highlight a few key points on the significant value realized through the sales of partial interest in three core Class A assets. And third, I want to cover our funding strategy and prudent management of our balance sheet. We've got about $2 billion of liquidity, very limited maturities and an improving credit profile. First on our strong results for 2015. The fourth quarter and the full year of '15, we reported FFO per diluted share of a $1.33 and $5.25 respectively and in line with the latest consensus estimates. Importantly our FFO per share for 2015 of $5.25 represented 9.4% growth over 2014 and our second consecutive year of FFO per share growth of over 9%. Same property NOI growth for 2015 was 1.3% and 4.7% on a GAAP and cash basis, respectively. And relatively in line with our solid 10-year average same property NOI growth of approximately 2% on a GAAP basis and 5% on a cash basis. Our same property NOI growth for the fourth quarter was 1.3% on a GAAP basis, 2% on a cash basis and was lower than our run rate due to a couple of non-recurring items. On a recurring basis, same property NOI growth for the fourth quarter would have been about 1.8% on a GAAP basis and 3.9% on a cash basis. This growth is more consistent with our 10-year average of same property growth and relatively inline with our very solid same property growth projected for 2016 in a range from 2% to 4% on a GAAP basis and a range from 3.5% to 5.5% on a cash basis. Occupancy was strong at 97.2% as of year-end and overall occupancy is expected to remain strong in 2016 due to the solid demand and lack of supply of Class A space in our core urban markets. While we do expect overall occupancy to remain solid, we also expect to temporary decline in occupancy in San Diego and Research Triangle Park, which are both expected to be offset by occupancy gains in other markets, primarily greater Boston. In San Diego in the first quarter of '16, we have two spaces that will be temporarily vacant at ARE Nautilus and 3985 Sorrento Valley, which aggregate about 60,000 rentable square feet related to two tenants that expanded in the larger spaces. Also in Research Triangle Park in the first quarter, we expect to receive back about 20,000 rentable square feet that is relatively lower-rent space generating about annual cash rents of about $225,000 per year. Again, overall occupancy is expected to remain strong and in line with 2015 year end occupancy of 97.2%. Quickly on our JV transactions, the sales of partial interest in three core Class A assets really highlighted the significant value creation we were generating from our development of Class A facilities and key urban innovation clusters. The value we've created on a 100% of these assets was almost $250 million. The margins on the sales ranged up to almost 60% on 225 Binney Street, which as you know is a grand up development project under the long-term lease to Biogen. Each of these sales involved unencumbered properties and therefore each sale generated more equity capital than a typical sale of real estate subject to the secured mortgage. The aggregate sales price of these three transactions is approximately $453 million. The proceeds resulted initially in reduction of debt with about two thirds of the sales of price or approximately $300 million representing attractive cost of the efficient equity capital to fund our highly leased value creation growth pipeline. Moving on to our discipline management of balance sheet and our funding strategy, we continue to execute on our strategy with the disciplined management of our balance sheet. Our ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter annualized was 6.6x, excluding $7.7 million of investment gains in the fourth quarter and leverage was 6.9x. Timing of dispositions and deliveries of highly-leased development projects will also impact the ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA and we typically do not adjust for these partial quarter events since they occur from time to time. We remain focused on continuing improvement in our ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA with normal variances quarter-to-quarter during the year. Specifically for 2016, we expect the ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA to increase in the first half of '16 then decrease in the second half as we complete and place in the service approximately $1.5 million square feet of highly-leased development and redevelopment projects. Our range for the ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter annualized -- fourth quarter '16 annualized is the range from 6.5x to 6.9x. Ultimately our leverage goal remains to be less than six times, which will also improve our overall credit rating and reduce our long-term cost of capital. Our liquidity as of year-end was approximately $2 billion. This liquidity allows us to be patient and flexible in the timing of the issuance of senior unsecured notes. Additionally, we have very limited debt maturities in 2016, 2017 and 2018. Additional liquidity is anticipated as we finalize the construction loan for 100 Binney Street in the low $300 million range over the next few months. During the first half of '16, we anticipate amending our $1.5 billion senior unsecured line of credit and our 2019 senior unsecured term loan. The amendment will focus primarily on extending the maturity date of each facility from 2019 to 2021, which will ultimately further extend our weighted average maturity of our outstanding debt. During the fourth quarter, we raised approximately $75 million at about $90 per share under our ATM program leaving approximately $375 million available, while $90 per share is a below consensus NAV. We believe the blended cost or long-term capital we selected to fund our highly-leased development pipeline will generate significant value. Overall, our strategy is to remain disciplined and funding growth through our highly-leased development pipeline with various sources of long-term capital. In November 2015, we completed our offering of senior unsecured notes. These notes bear interest at 4.3% and matures in 2026. Again balance sheet liquidity provided us the ability to be patient and flexible for the appropriate window to execute a solid issuance of unsecured notes. Briefly on sources and uses of capital, as detailed on Page 3 of our supplemental package, we have complete disclosures on sources and uses for 2016. We updated our construction spend for 2016 resulting in a decrease of $100 million at the mid-point of our guidance. The overall decrease was driven by approximately dozen projects as our team refine budgets, timing of spend and favorably reduce the scope of certain projects. We also updated our disclosures to provide more visibility into internally-generated sources of capital representing 44% of our projected uses for construction. The 44% or $375 million consist of cash flows from operating activities after dividends of about 125 million, plus 250 million of debt funding from growth in EBITDA. As of December 31 2015, we had one small R&D building located in Maryland classified as held for sale. While we have dispositions targeted in our 2016 guidance, no additional assets met the criteria for classification as held for sale. We do expect to provide additional color on specific dispositions in the next quarter or so. But keep in mind we just closed on dispositions aggregating almost 600 million in 2015 with about 84% of this completed in the fourth quarter. There is still significant capital looking to invest in high quality, core assets and gateway cities. These locations provide great long term value. These locations are also highly sought after since it's difficult for real estate investors to reach their desired investment allocation into key gateway cities. Lastly on guidance and closing, the detailed assumptions underline our guidance for 2016 are included on Page 3 of our supplemental package. We believe we are well positioned with a high quality asset base of Class A assets in AAA locations that attract high quality and innovative entities. 54% of our total ABR is from investment grade rate attendants, again a REIT industry leading statistic. We have a favorable triple net lease structure with annual rent escalations which combined with our high quality tenancy drive solid and increasing cash flows. We are one of the most visible multiyear highly leased development pipelines that will generate about 180 million to 190 million in incremental annual NOI and we will continue our disciplined approach to fund in our value creation pipeline with a combination f long term capital including significant internal sources of capital. Growth in cash flows from the completion of our development pipeline and disciplined management of our balance sheet will drive further improvement in our credit profile including a reduction in net debt to adjusted EBITDA to less than 6 times ultimately improving our long term costs to capital. We believe we have the right assets in the right locations that will inspire productivity, efficiency and creativity and success from our highly innovative client tenants. Our team remains focused on continuing to build the best-in-class franchise. With that I will turn it back to Joel. Joel Marcus : We'll open it up for Q&A please. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And first we'll go to Manny Korchman with Citi. Manny Korchman : When you sat down and said, we think in ATM's and appropriate sort of \u2013 raise some equity right now, how did you come up with the $75 million sort of sum given that you had a significant amount of capital that you were going to have t raise this year. Was it a matter of whether the stock was trading or was there some other magic there $75 million number? Joel Marcus : Manny I would say, overall our capital plan is fairly fluid throughout the year and we remain flexible in our execution at any given point in time. I would say that facts and circumstances that we were looking at, at that point in time drew us through the conclusion with a variety of matters that we were considering. I guess it\u2019s also fair to say if you look back with hindsight today it\u2019s easy to say that you would have raised more capital but that\u2019s hindsight 2020 vision so. Manny Korchman : And then just in terms of disclosure just wondering why you guys sort of limited the amount of disclosure giving on future development projects. In the past year you'd given, at least a book value breakdown and sort of a list of deeper list of projects, now you have condensed that. Joel Marcus : Are you refereeing to future land opportunities? Manny Korchman : Yes exactly. Joel Marcus : We didn\u2019t intend to delete any meaningful information. As you know Manny, one of the best disclosure packages in the industry if there\u2019s information you find useful we can definitely look at adding that disclosures that you find relevant, so we will take a look at that for next quarter. Manny Korchman : That's it for me for today. Thanks guys. Operator : Moving on we'll go to Sheila McGrath with Evercore ISI. Sheila McGrath : Good afternoon. Joel, the construction spend in 2016 looks down by 100 million, I was wondering if you could give us some insight where those savings are coming from? Joel Marcus : Sheila no real magic there then in fact when we have a pipeline as robust as we have, when we have the chance quarter-to-quarter we take a deep dive and as these projects - look at the deliveries for '17 and '18 were on the front end of those projects. So diving deep into the timing of spend over roughly a two year timeframe has allowed us to adjust downward some of the - initially projected spend that would have been incurred in 2016. And then we also had a number of projects where the scope was refined based on the requirements that are looking at the project. And so we think the landlord dollars going into the project will be meaningfully less and the tenant will take the space with less dollars going in. Sheila McGrath : Okay, great. And then on the sale of the investments in the fourth quarter either that was a good surprise in terms of using those funds for the development, how should we think about that other investment bucket as a source of proceeds to monetize for the development in 2016? Joel Marcus : Well, I would say Sheila the thing to think about here with the equity securities that we have in primarily life science companies will continue to monetize our holdings because we have a tremendous amount of unrealized gains. And the number that will probably generate from a proceeds perspective, if I to guess today would probably be between north of $50 million in 2016 and ultimately what we monetize depends on future gains that might be realized from the private securities that we hold today as well. Sheila McGrath : Okay. Last question Joel you mentioned at a 100 Binney at tenant changing - changing their mind on locating there. Could you just talk about what the driver was at today go to a competitor building or did they re-think expansion? Joel Marcus : Yes, that\u2019s a sensitive question so let me ask Tom to answer it. It didn\u2019t go to a competitor building and I\u2019d say current plan but - Tom Andrews : Yes, there was a tenant that we negotiated - lot of intent to negotiate there - the anchor tenant of the building and they want to expand the exercised, give us a notice that they are going to expand and before the - lease on them was executed they changed their mind and withdrew. So it was an expansion of the existing anchor tenant building. Sheila McGrath : Okay, got it. Thank you. Operator : And next we\u2019ll go to Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jamie Feldman : Great, thank you. You\u2019ve talked about a target of leverage below six times, can you just walk us through the past to get there and how long you think it would take? Joel Marcus : Well, it\u2019s not 2016, our \u201916 guidance was 6.5 to 6.9 so it's definitely beyond \u201816 and a lot will depend Jamie as we make our way through 2016 but suffice to say that it\u2019s a 2017, its post 2016 event. Ultimately you got tremendous EBITDA growth being a primary factor, our ability to recycle capital from the proceeds of property sales will also contribute but keep in mind our goal is to drive that end result which ultimately will improve our long term cost to capital, so it's an important component of our strategy going forward. Jamie Feldman : So in your capital plan you talk about adding leverage to your growing EBITDA and what's your appetite to just avoid doing that and push leverage even lower in a faster timeframe? Joel Marcus : I don\u2019t know that - well just to clarify something Jamie I think I heard we don\u2019t expect to - our plan does not anticipate leverage going up other than normal quarter-to-quarter variations. We are looking at on average driving leverage downward and below 6 over time. Jamie Feldman : So I meant just no adding more debt, may be not your leverage level but if you don\u2019t add incremental debt your leverage will go down and in your capital plan you talk about adding more debt against your growing EBITDA. Do you think about just not adding more debt and that will get to the faster, you are just very comfortable with this number by year end 2016? Dean Shigenaga : Yes I would say Jamie let\u2019s focus on getting to the end of 2016. It's not a matter of driving our business with no incremental debt, I mean by definition with the EBITDA growth we have, we can support the incremental debt without impacting leverage. So what you\u2019re talking about it taking the mix of overall capital sources and taking advantage of the factors that drive leverage down whether that\u2019s saving some of the EBITDA growth to reduce leverage, recycling a few more assets that will allow us to further reduce leverage. We have a variety of leverage to actually pull the driver end result but it\u2019s not something that we\u2019re intending to execute on this year, it\u2019s something that over the next couple of years you\u2019ll see us migrate in that direction and ultimately get exchange. Jamie Feldman : Okay, thanks. And then for Joel, you had talked about the $2 billion of incremental funding in the NIH and then maybe the President plan. When you talk to industry leaders and looking at that side of the coin and then you look at what\u2019s happening with down BC funding at least in tech, just can you maybe tell us on just the latest thought process among your largest tenants and clients and how they\u2019re thinking about the world and their decision making? Joel Marcus : Well I think it\u2019s important to remember that when you get to pharma and big biotech, pretty good size publicly traded companies given our roster is heavy credit, those guys are not dependent on the capital markets and honestly haven't been for a long time. So the ups and downs in the capital markets don\u2019t really influence their decision making and I think we\u2019re still seeing a trend of moving from isolated silo locations to the core. In fact I think somebody just sent a supplier Bristol-Myers who is our anchor tenant in 100 Binney is now selling their amazingly gorgeous campus at Wallingford Connecticut. So I think pharma and bio are continuing to invest strongly. You get 100 plus billion dollars this year in R&D spend to a great host of great opportunities in cancer, neuroscience and a range of other metabolic diseases et cetera. So I don\u2019t see that people haven\u2019t looked at the market is interrupting that phase of R&D spend. And on the government side I think for the first time in a long time with the uptake of NIH we\u2019re actually seeing way more demand be in Maryland as just one benchmark than there is supply available, we haven\u2019t seen that in maybe a decade. So I think in general the outlook is stable and I think when it comes to companies that are going public, we will know in the next day or so but there are four biotech IPOs right now ready to price one of which we\u2019re involved with and I would say that assuming pricing goes well, this could be the opening of the - selected opening of the biotech IPO market for 2016 because as you know there were no IPOs in January. And I would also say that on the venture side, don\u2019t count out the phase of venture capital formation and investment. We know about handful of companies or entities that are raising a large, large funds this year, I know personally several are heavily oversubscribed by institutional investors and so I think the capital formation for venture capital and life science will be pretty good this year. Jamie Feldman : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Moving on we\u2019ll go to Dave Rodgers with Robert W. Baird. Dave Rodgers : Joel, just wanted to follow-up on that last comment a little bit. I think in your guidance for the year $125 million was available for sale securities. Maybe there was another attached to that too but how much of that comes out of either IPOs or some kind of capital transaction that you\u2019re dependent on to monetize those investments this year? Dean Shigenaga : Hi, David, Dean here. The question came up little bit earlier, I think it\u2019s for 2016 it\u2019s probably fair to say, we\u2019ll probably have at least $50 million in proceeds from those securities. Dave Rodgers : That was the dependency part of it, okay, got it. I guess with regard to 2016, Dean you made a comment earlier about where the stock is today or maybe Joel but at the Investor Day, I thought you talked about maybe using more ATM in equity capital in the coming year, but given where the stock is are you still feeling comfortable doing that in some of those other line items in your guidance sheet? Joel Marcus : I think the way to think about the ATM program, and this is probably true not just for Alexandria, but all companies and I think you'll all agree is that the ATM programs really represent a great tool that every REIT have in place. And when appropriate, it's prudent to use it because it's really cost effective. The fees associated with it is fairly nominal. It's generally 1% to 1.5%. It needs to be used prudently. And I would say that applies to Alexandria as well. We will be very disciplined in how we execute raising capital to fund our business, but keep in mind we've got a tremendous amount of growth in net asset value to generate in this high-leased development pipeline. So we'll remain disciplined in how we execute that. Dave Rodgers : Okay. On the accounting side, how did you account for the asset sales in the fourth quarter? Were those all now taken off balance sheet? Just wanted to be clear on that. Dean Shigenaga : Yeah. That's a good question. As some of you may know, the consolidation rules today are little more complicated than they were 10 years ago. The three joint ventures we executed on remain on balance sheet as consolidated JVs. So they were accounted as a more of an equity or financing transaction. So there is no GAAP gain associated with those transactions, but we did take the proceeds. The adjustment -- the amount is effectively the GAAP gain was booked through APEC, not through earnings. Dave Rodgers : Okay. That's helpful. Saw that footnote. Last question I guess for me maybe to Joel. Construction is spending about $850 million at midpoint. Two questions. One, how much of that is related to additional starts in 2016 or getting ready for additional starts? And I guess the second question is that how good do you feel today relative to 60 or 90 days ago about putting new shovels in the ground for new project? Thanks Joel Marcus : I think if you go back to Investor Day, I think, we said that we didn't have other than what we had in the pipeline at that point, which included both the Town Center and the Barnes Canyon. We didn't have any new projects in the pipeline to break ground on or to move forward, because our pipeline right now is a pretty stellar pipeline and our focus is full lease up on both the '16 and the '17, '18. So at the moment, we don't have anything new in planning. Peter Moglia : The only other project that we've talked is for Vertex, down in San Diego. Joel Marcus : Right. And that we disclosed at that time. Operator : Anything further, Mr. Rodgers? Dave Rodgers : No. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next we'll go to [Caron Ford] [ph] with Mitsubishi UFJ. Ms. Ford, if you will please check your mute button. We're unable to hear you. Ms. Ford, please proceed with your question. Joel Marcus : Let's move on. Operator : Next, we'll go to Jim Sullivan with Cowen Group Jim Sullivan : Thank you. Joel, when you talked about what's happening in terms of the color on demand variable for life science. Generally, you painted a picture of an industry where demand is really not cyclical, not really impacted by what's happening in the economy overall to a great degree. But I do have a question. We do seem to be seeing a higher level of M&A transactions among some of the larger life science companies. I'm just curious, as you think about that, number one, do you place your understanding and discussion with your tenants? Do you think we're going to see continued high level of M&A activity? And do you anticipate it would have a negative impact on demand at all? Joel Marcus : Yes. It's a good question. I think that historically, well, maybe 2015 is the high-water mark for M&A broadly speaking. And a lot of the M&A, as you know, has been in the payer sector, it's been in the generic space. It hasn't necessarily been purely in the ethical, pharmaceutical or biotech area, although there have been clearly some opportunities in that world. But I think when we've seen M&A in general, I mean it's not always the case, but in general, the target is usually looked at unless it's generally a single product purchase; in which case good example of that is when Onyx was bought by Amgen they were looking at - there were sweeter products, but primarily the main multiple myeloma product was the main target. And so - and Amgen also had a lot of extra space in South San Francisco city looked to sublease that. You know we're on the percipience of that being fully sub leased, but we still have Amgen credit for 10 years. I think that's more of the exception where we've seen M&A of companies that have a platform of opportunities with multiple shots on goal or they're looking to essentially get a cadre of very high-quality researchers, which often happens when a farmer buys M&A. Those locations are generally preserved and they're preserved, because they tend to be in the core locations where you've got the collaboration and the innovation at its bet. And I don't think that's going to change at all. Jim Sullivan : So if we think about that collectively, in your core markets, you have had this very favorable tailwind now for five years or so where you had a very strong increase in demand relative to the ability of the market to supply product. Is it your view in spite of a slowdown in the economy that's very favorable supply-demand condition will be sustained over the next couple of years? Joel Marcus : Yes. Pretty. I feel pretty good about it, because if you go to the best locations, you go to a New York City, you go to Cambridge, you go to a Mission Bay, you go to Lake Union in Seattle, there is virtually no new supply, there is highly constrained environment for new development - let alone things like Prop M or whatever. And I think that's going to be a big check. And I think even if demand moderates, because no one knows where this market is going, the macro market in the sense of how severe or not severe it is, but most people feel that it's not a replay of '08-'09. Well, I remember in one quarter, I think, it's kind of funny. I remember this quarter well. I think it was maybe first second quarter of '09, there was maybe a 40,000 square foot lease in all of New York side and actually we signed two leases in Cambridge during those first two quarters for well over 100,000 square feet. So we feel good about being positioned in a very defensive posture in the best locations where you have real constrained supply and the demand we still see in virtually all the markets is still good. Jim Sullivan : Okay and the final question from me. You obviously have some significant tech tenant signed up for space under development in San Francisco. And I wonder if you could give us an update on your views as to that source of demand in that market. What do you expect to unfold over the next year or two? Joel Marcus : Well, I guess the good news and the bad news is we've got 100% occupancy so we can't feel much in a way of demand. But I think when it comes to our tenants, the three that we've underwritten and spent a lot of time with, I think, Uber continues to be a just a transformational change in the way we do a number of things including transportation. But well beyond that and we certainly see that they're going to be a big force for many years to come. I mean look today, we started with Google back in 1998 in their first campus and they were at Series A and today they are now the largest company in the world, I guess by equity market cap. We also feel very good about Pinterest. Pinterest was just highlighted by Fortune as one of the three so called unicorns that are most likely to succeed. We think their business both on the personal side, but extending to the commercial side has huge opportunities. And then on Stripe I think we continue to use stripe as a great company and it continues to be the back bone of the medium size B2b business community. So I think we feel good about our situation. I think overall tech -- as I said, I think you're going to see some shakeup. Clearly there is evaluation transformation going on, but based on what I know and my conversations with venture guys up in the bay area, which we have all the time. The model, as I mentioned earlier, Jim, moving from building platforms to building profitable businesses and that's something - and that moves them from being less dependent on either the private or the public capital markets and that's by intentional design. So I think you'll see the really high-quality companies continue to do well and move away from the need to do private or public financings when the markets are not receptive and the ones that just simply can't do that will I'm sure go away. Jim Sullivan : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : And next we'll go to Mike Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Mike Carroll : Thanks. Joel, given the fall early in the capital markets, do you expect life savings companies will be more cautious making long-term real estate decisions or is this not really driving factor for these type of tenants? Joel Marcus : Well, I think everybody is - no one is immune to the larger markets. And people pay attention obviously, when a radical transformation in the economic environment like 08/09 happens, obviously, everybody pays attention to that, but I think in this market, people will make good decisions, good business decisions. Yes, they may be a lot more careful, but I think essentially their evaluations are based on in the life science industry, the quality of their pipeline. And I think they're going to make good decisions on that. And again, they are not by enlarge dependent on capital markets. Mike Carroll : Okay. And then can you give us some color on your plan to asset sales in 2016. Will these sales be similar to the ones completed in 2015 and are there any specific markets you're focused on? Joel Marcus : As my comments earlier, Michael, were that we're going to be looking carefully and provide more color in the next quarter or two on our dispositions. But keep in mind, we just completed a tremendous amount in almost $600 million this year, most of it in the fourth quarter or in December for that matter. So we've been active in the market and we'll provide more color here soon. Mike Carroll : And then you completed a lot of the non-core sales already right. So those would still be kind of like the core JV type fill? Dean Shigenaga : No. I think the simplest way to think of it is that we look through the asset base from time to time and I think almost any category of assets we hold is their gain. There is a little bit in every bucket that can be executed on. So stay tune there. Mike Carroll : Great. Thank you. Operator : And next we'll go to Manny Korchman with Citi. Michael Bilerman : Hi, it's Michael Bilerman from Citi. Dean, just a methodology sort of question as you think about your debt EBITDA, which you sort of just present sort of whatever your EBITDA is annualized and clearly this quarter with the amount of gains that you successfully liquidated some of your holdings that created a big bump in EBITDA, which is not really sort of recurring EBITDA creates a lot of capital, but it's not a recurring number. And I\u2019m just curious, in your targets that you have does that include some level of gain that you're annualizing? Is that - I guess you're thinking about also from a GAAP perspective not cash. I'm curious when you put out these forecast what's in and what's out? Dean Shigenaga : Well keep in mind Michael, for the fourth quarter of this year - at the beginning of the year I think we've stayed pretty close to target. We're anticipating to be sub 7% and we ended up at 6.9% as we reported without the 7.7%. So I don't think that 6.6% came about just because we executed some sales or securities. We're not looking for anything lumpy in our guidance and that's consistent with how we presented the numbers for this year. I think your question does provide a great opportunity to discuss one of the things that I think people should consider\u00b8 although we don't make this into our numbers is that we have a tremendous amount of contractual cash rents that have not commenced as a result of recent deliveries, development and redevelopment projects. And the contractual rents are under leases, so they will kick-in. A simplest way of looking at it is that if the world, not the world really, but if things came to an end and we stopped building product, the cash flows would kick-in and significantly reduce our leverage metrics. And so as much as we try to think about making pro rata adjustments for dispositions or deliveries is also that other component of contractual cash flows that aren't in place yet and that's really significant. And so there is a variety of things that move back and forth, Michael. We just try to keep it simple and report the numbers the way they fall out and be clear on what the number consist of so investors can make adjustments as appropriate. Michael Bilerman : And how should we think about that $75 million of equity, because it's basically 0.2 turns on debt-to-EBITDA and got here from 7.169 on a full-year basis. How should we think about when that was executed? Did it replace other cash that you\u2019re going to raise to get your debt-to-EBITDA down to that target below 7x level? Dean Shigenaga : Yes. I think, Michael, in my opening comments I alluded to that that it allowed us given the timing and given we were working with the kind of the sale of 409-499 Illinois allowed us to take less equity from that or less proceeds from that transactions by doing the ATM and also we didn't have to either lower 2015 or 2016 guidance so it turned out to be kind of a good thing even though however maybe. Michael Bilerman : And when was that equity raised during the fourth quarter just from a timing perspective relative to Investor Day? Dean Shigenaga : December, Michael. Michael Bilerman : So post Investor Day? Dean Shigenaga : Yes. Our Investor Day was early, early December so. Joel Marcus : After that and the transactions closed after that as well. So we were looking at all the interplay of those various things to get with the security sales. Michael Bilerman : And just last one. Dean, your referenced the hindsight 20/20. We wish you could have told more knowing what you know today in terms of where the stock market has gone and specifically your share price. I guess may be just walk us through the internal debate when you think about your company with obviously a very high released development platform, but it is development so it always carry risk even if its pre-leased; and certainly a tenant base that is high credit, but certainly a different segment on the market in terms of healthcare, biotech and technology; and then leverage. When you think about those three risks, how much did you - which provides opportunity as well, I'm not trying to demean the opportunity set, but I guess collectively was their discussion just sort of say and you look at what ACC did last night in terms of their equity raise, very large equity raised. How do you discuss internally saying, you know what, let's just do a large equity raise, it will be a little bit earnings diluted, it's not going to be that NAV dilutive given where our stock price is. Was that debated at all in December? Joel Marcus : Well, I'll tell you, the answer is we felt because one of the compelling factors, Michael, is with 2016 deliveries and a very large set of 2017 and that little bit ended 2018 deliveries as opposed to a lot of companies who don't have a development pipeline and on boarding NOI that would be literally may be 25% of what our current NOI is. That wasn't such a compelling opportunity. We felt that we could take a small slice of equity, meet all of our goals, continue to deleverage. And there are bunch of companies that are much higher leverage than we are so we feel good about our path. And we have options, because of those - because of the big pipeline. So sure you can always think about a big, rip the band aid off, but we didn't feel it was necessary or appropriate at that time. It's still in hindsight, don't feel that as well. Michael Bilerman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And next we'll go to Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities Rich Anderson : Thanks. I just want to clarify the ATM was announced the date after Investor Day, right? I think I remember that correctly. Joel Marcus : I think that's correct. Rich Anderson : Okay. I just wanted to make sure I understood that timing. My only question is to what extend, Dean, kind of alluded to stopping building if the world comes to an end or business comes to an end. Dramatic way to say, but I get the point. To what extend is delaying 2017, 2018 deliveries to further out years kind of on your mind right now. Given where the world is and your stock prices or is it just - that's just too far out to be considering at this point. Dean Shigenaga : I don't think we have to think about that, because I think we have path to fund them. We have a path to get to a sub six leverage number and those become important deliveries. They're also contractually required when you sign a lease, you perform under the lease and we\u2019ve got the brand reputation in the area and why we've been able to attract the partners we have for the leases we\u2019ve under committed to and under \u2013 put under contract. So I don\u2019t think that\u2019s part of our calculus and I think based on most economies view of the world, this is not a structural banking failure situation, there is tough times due to oil in China and may be the high yield market et cetera. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019re in the same position. I mean when we \u2013 I remember Dean and I when we after Lehman collapsed in September of 2008 literally within six weeks we had cut CapEx 50%, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re in that environment today. Rich Anderson : And so in some ways the continuation of the longer out development business is a necessary part of your de-leveraging process? Dean Shigenaga : I think it is especially given that it\u2019s a highly leased development pipeline. If it wasn\u2019t, I think we would be thinking very differently. Rich Anderson : Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : And there are no further questions. I\u2019ll turn it back to our presenters for any closing comments. Joel Marcus : Thank you all for your time and wishing everybody a Happy and Healthy New Year. Thank you again. We look forward to talking to you on the first quarter call. Operator : And that does conclude today's conference. We would like to thank everyone for their participation.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz. Please go ahead. Paula Schwartz : Thank you, and good afternoon everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The Company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the Company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus. Please go ahead. Joel Marcus : Thank you Paula, and welcome everybody to the first quarter Alexandria call and welcome everybody. And with me today are Dean Shigenaga, Peter Moglia, Steve Richardson, Tom Andrews, and Dan Ryan. And I want to open up as I always like to do to congratulate the entire Alexandria family for another strong quarter operationally and financially. Also want to recognize the passing of Rich Jennings a long time director of Alexandria, who passed on February 28th after our last earnings call. And Rich was such an important influent on the development of the company and we're going to miss him a lot. Let me start right away. At a recent investment conference, I presented kind of key three -- three key takeaways for 2016. The first thing that our markets are continuing to stay rock solid with strong demand, a little bit or no supply, rents up over the past year about 15% and continuing high occupancy. Secondly, our highly preleased value add pipeline, which will continue to drive growth in earnings and decrease in the leverage where we've also been able to achieve significant yields is really key takeaway two. And then number three would be fundamentals are really overtaking sentiment in the life science factor. And so far as the tactical ground level as I mentioned there are no cracks. Novel and innovative bio- pharmaceutical products will be the key to managing the cost of chronic disease. The core quickly continued very strong performance in our urban innovation cluster markets. We have a strong 6.2% cash same store NOI growth, strong occupancy of $97.3 and continuing strong margins. On the leasing side again, in virtually all of our markets, very tight and we're seeing strong demand and good performance. We leased about 390,000 square feet this quarter, down from other quarters because we're having less space to lease due to high occupancy, at about 17% cash rent spreads, contributed heavily by Cambridge, San Francisco, Seattle and Research Triangle Park. Important to keep in mind 52% of our total ABR this quarter from investment grade tenants, so very strong underlying credit to our cash flows. When we think about underlying tenant demand and tenant health, we see that that continues very strong. In the greater Boston area, 97.6% occupied and again very strong demand. We believe that 100 Binney and Longwood will be fully spoken forward here pretty quickly. On the San Francisco side, we're 100% occupied. We're continued to see strong life science and demand from credit tenants particularly, and also very strong tech demand and we're proceeding on our build-to-suites at various stages for Uber, Pinterest and Stripe, and as some of you know, Stripe was featured on 60 minutes on Sunday night. In New York City we're moving to a 99 plus percent occupancy. Again, more demand there than we have space available. San Diego, we've got some roll. We're about 94.5% occupied but the Nodulus [ph] campus availability of 77,000 square feet I think will be fully spoken for here pretty momentarily. Seattle at 99.2% occupancy, again strong continuing demand from both the tech and life science sector. Maryland 95.9% occupancy, solid demand, better than we've see over the last decade, and in RTP were 98.6% occupied, very strong demand and most of the remaining space will soon be spoken for. On the development asset side, we're pleased to be realizing NAV at this stage of the cycle on our 2016 deliveries. We're 90% leased, 95% leased or negotiating, and as we've indicated in the sup, we expect $75 million to $80 million of incremental annual NOI and yields generally, initial cash yields of generally 7% or north of that. Our 2017 and 2018 deliveries were up to 72% leased and 84% leased or under negotiation, and our estimated annual incremental NOI about 120 to 130. And that's been increased due to Vertex build-to-suite in San Diego, again initial cash yields averaging about 7 plus percent. With respect to the life science industry, a recent report by United Health Foundation concluded that an astonishing -- this number is truly astonishing, 72%, almost three quarters of American have at least one of the five most impactful unhealthy behaviors. So pay attention here; smoking, physical inactivity, insufficient sleep, excessive drinking or obesity. And these combine to be the primary contributing -- among the primary contributing factors to extraordinary rise and continuing increase in healthcare costs. Self-discipline and smart wellness and prevention could make huge inroads in managing these healthcare costs, also innovated by biopharmaceutical products which changed the face of disease, ease suffering, create happier and healthy lives and extent lives, clearly are part of the answer here. And then finally before I turn it over Dean, who is going to take a deep dive on the balance sheet, I'd like remind everybody that bio demand for our assets is strong and we expect to continue to recycle assets to fund our first-in-class development pipeline. I think you'll see continued announcements, probably in the June time factor and Dean can highlight a little more about that. So, I'll turn to Dean Shigenaga Dean Shigenaga : Thanks Joel, Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everybody. Again I've got three important topics to highlight today. First, consistent execution and strong results, driven by solid fundamentals, continued asset recycling, and then lastly our funding strategy and prudent management of our balance sheet. Starting with our consistent execution, quarter to quarter and year-to-year, really driven by our unique business strategy and solid fundamentals in our best-in-class team. As Joel had highlighted, fundamentals remain solid, both for our business and the life science industry. Rental rate growth was very strong, up 33.6% and 16.9% on a cash basis. Tenants continue to evaluate early lease renewals one to two years prior to their contractual lease exploration date. And as a reminder, we are operating in a very supply constrained and strong rental rate environment. Same property cash NOI growth continued its strong trend with cash NOI growth of 6.2%. Key drivers include our triple net lease structure and high quality tenant roster which drives quality and stable cash flows, and contractual annual rent escalations approximating 3% per year drives consistent growth in cash flows. Occupancy was very solid at quarter end at 97.3%. Continuing into our ongoing asset recycling program, we have three categories of funding for 2016, excluding debt funding from construction loans and the unsecured bond market. At the midpoint of our guidance for 2016, we have approximately $630 million of capital needs, primarily for our accretive development pipeline, and this is beyond debt, including $350 million of real estate dispositions, $154 million for acquisitions and $125 million of other capital and/or sales of equity investments. At a very high level, we have identified approximately one quarter of this $630 million, primarily related to the announcement of our plans to monetize our real estate investments in Asia. We also have identified another one half of our $630 million target, and these sales are at various stages, including one key joint venture deal that should be under LOI shortly. Since these transactions are in process and have not reached the criteria for classification as held for sale, we have limited information we can share today, but do plan to provide detailed disclosures as appropriate in the future. This leaves us with about one fourth to one third of the $630 million to identify ourself over the next couple of quarters. So we feel good about where we are in early 2016 with our funding outlook for the year. Turning to Asia, on April 22nd, the Company committed to the monetization of its investments in Asia over the next 12 months, and obtained approval from our Board of Directors to proceed accordingly. Our cash deals and our investments in India were reasonable and generally in the 10% to 12% range. However, we\u2019ve recognized impairment charges in March and April aggregating $181.9 million, including consideration of foreign currency exchange losses of $49.8 million. We believe this highlights a unique situation of real-estate generating solid yields with high quality multinational credit tenancy, the names of Novartis, Glaxo and others. However, valuations today in these developing international markets do not appropriately value these attributes. More importantly, we believe it's prudent to move forward with the recycling of this capital for investment into higher value Class A developments in our key urban innovation clusters. Our estimate of proceeds from sales is just north of $100 million, and we expect to complete these sales over the next 12 months in up to seven to 10 different transactions. As of today, we completed the sale of one land parcel at a price of approximately $7.5 million. While we have no other binding sale agreements today, certain investments are under review by potential buyers. As we advance each transaction, we will provide appropriate detailed disclosures. It's important to note that our detailed balance sheet and operating information disclosures on page 51 of our supplemental package. There you will find disclosures of our operating results that reflect our investments in Asia generated an FFO loss of approximately $53,000 for the first quarter of 2016. As a result, the sale of Asia is the equivalent of the sale of land, and will generate important capital for investment into our highly leased development pipeline with cash yields of approximately 7%. So moving on to our prudent management of our balance sheet, I just want to start with our at the market program, what we issued in the first quarter and our plans going forward. During the first quarter, we raised about $25 million under our at the market offering program and used the proceeds to improve our all in balance sheet leverage, including preferred stock. We repurchased open market transactions of approximately $23 million at par value of outstanding 7% Series D preferred stock. As of March 31st, we have about $214 million of Series D outstanding, down from the $250 million initially issued. Our repurchases to-date have been executed at prices of less than $28 per share. We believe the use of a modest amount of equity capital to retire a portion of this 7% convertible preferred security in the first quarter was prudent. While it's still attractive to retire additional Series D preferred stock at market pricing today, the price of Series D has been tracking the movement of our common, and lately has been trading just north of $30 per share. So our decision to use equity raised at $88.44 per share in the first quarter to repurchase Series D at $27.49 per share resulted in roughly 5% less common shares required versus executing the repurchases of Series D today at a price of roughly $30 per share with our common stock today trading in the low to mid-$90 range. Purchases to-date, over two quarters have been completed at prices roughly neutral to FFO per share and positive to all in leverage. Our 2016 guidance assumes no further purchases of our 7% Series D convertible preferred. However, we will continue to look for opportunities to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time. Going forward, our strategy is to continue to focus on ongoing growth and FFO per share and net asset value and remain disciplined in funding growth through our highly leased development pipeline with various sources of long term capital. Turning to leverage; our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 7.4 times for the current quarter annualized, 7.2 times for the trailing 12 and was in line with our expectation. We are on track to improve net debt to adjusted EBITDA and hit our range of 6.5 times to 6.9 times by year-end, and this is on a current quarter annualized basis. We are also focused on improvement in our net debt plus preferred to adjusted EBITDA as shown by our $23 million reduction in our 7% convertible Series C preferred stock, with proceeds from our ATM program. We also remain focused on the ongoing improvement in both of our investment grade credit rating and our long-term cost of capital. Lastly, a few other highlights. We\u2019ve had very limited debt maturities till 2018. We anticipate $150 million to $200 million reductions in 2016 related to outstanding borrowings under our unsecured term loan, with a maturity date in 2019. Additionally, we are in the process of extending the maturity date of our unsecured line of credit from 2019 to 2021, reducing pricing by 10 basis points and further extending the weighted average remaining term of outstanding debt. We have significant liquidity, which we believe reduces risk and allows us to be patient and flexible with the timing of capital events. As of quarter end, we had about $2 billion of liquidity including a $304 million secured construction loan that we closed in April of 2016. This loan will provide significant funding for the construction of 183 Binney Street in Cambridge, anchored by Bristol, Myers Squibb, again a very high quality global bio-pharma company. We executed additionally interest rate swaps aggregating $500 million, and we continue the disciplined management of our value creation pipeline and are on track to further reduce our pipeline as a percentage of gross real estate towards the 10% range by the end of the year. We also continue the disciplined allocation of capital into our value creation pipeline, averaging 90% leased for deliveries expected this year, 81% leased overall, inducing primarily deliveries in 2017 and one project that will be delivered in 2018. In closing with guidance, the detailed assumptions underlying our guidance for 2016, are included on Page 6 of our supplemental package. And just want to remind everybody, our unique business model focuses on class A assets and triple A locations in urban innovations clusters, and continues attract some of the most highly innovative and successful companies. Additionally with our best in class team, we look forward to consistently executing and delivering growth in FFO per share and net asset value, quarter-to-quarter and year-to -year, while we also improve our credit profile and long term cost to capital. With that I\u2019ll turn it back to Joel. Joel Marcus : Thanks Dean and, operator, you can open up lines for Q&A please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question does come from line of Manny Korchman with Citi. Manny Korchman : Joel, maybe I'll turn this one to you. There have been concerns about some of the higher technology markets, mostly on the West coast but sort of around the country. What are you seeing from tenants and maybe especially, what you're seeing from their financial sponsors and how they're thinking new space and expansions? Joel Marcus : Are you talking about tech tenants? Manny Korchman : Both on the tech, for you guys both on the tech and life science if you would? Joel Marcus : Well think on the life science side, we\u2019re seeing a continuation of what we've seen, certainly over the last number of years, and that is both high quality credit tenants moving into the clusters, establishing bases and continuing to expand. A great example is our Bristol Myers, at a 100 Binney bringing a footprint into Cambridge, IBM Watson recently coming into our, part of our 751-125 Binney, I think there is no shortage on the life science side. Because of the nature and the DNA and the ecosystem, they want to be in the best cluster locations. And I think it\u2019s clear that Cambridge, San Francisco and South San Diego, Seattle, New York city remain the top spots for those clustering on the tech-side. Maybe I\u2019ll ask Steve to give some off data, a bit in the bay area. Steve Richardson : Hi Manny it\u2019s Steve. We do continue to see a healthy, it\u2019s not historic demand. We\u2019re tracking about 6 million square feet in the San Francisco market. Right now we\u2019ve got six tenants looking for more than a 100,000 square feet, 23 tenants looking for more than 50,000 square feet. We\u2019ve got a vacancy rate in some of 3.7%. You had a number of sublease transactions that reduced the sublease space to about 1.6 million in the market, which is right where we were at the beginning of 2015, with great tenants taking additional space and expanding. So we see it healthy on both sides. We just add to the life science, in particular in a bay area, you saw the recent announcement with Stemcentrx bring purchased by AbbVie, in excess of $10 billion and a very public pursuit of medivation, which is in our Mission Day building in Illinois by Sanofi. So very healthy capital markets on the life science side for sure. Manny Korchman : Great thanks, and Dean, maybe one for you, when you think about sort of the volume of the ATI measurements in the press data, what criteria do you put out there to figure out how much ATM to do or how much pref to retire? Dean Shigenaga : Manny, the challenge I think with Series D is the -- it's a very institutionally held security. There is probably a little bit of retail in there but, I think what I've shaken lose to date has been primarily retail, and the institutional ownership is probably fairly sticky. And so as a result I thank most of the activity will be relatively small as we can unwind and in an institutional position. So it\u2019s more dependent on that Manny, and when we saw pricing dip into the sub $28 range, we felt it was prudent to try to tap some. It\u2019s still attractive as today\u2019s pricing. We'll see were we end up over time, because I think we'd like to unwind a little bit as we go. Operator : And our next question does come from line of Kevin Tyler with Green Street Advisors. Kevin Tyler : Joel, can you take us through the process a little bit, fall around Manny\u2019s question, when you're deciding between tech and life science tenant, if both are interested in one year spaces, do you find you get more of a network effect perhaps from the tech tenants today, given you have a higher concentration on the lab side? Joel Marcus : Well, I think the answer to that and maybe the Uber land at Mission Bay was a good example. I think we for many years believed that Mission Bay would become an intersection of life science and technology, in that campus area and certainly because of the synergies between the two, but it wasn\u2019t until Uber really intersected with us, did that really become a reality. And I think having done Uber really opened up the, I think what we, what our capabilities where as a company and the execution and skill and capabilities as we began to expand our Mission Bay into the summer [ph] area. So I think to me, that\u2019s a great example of that happening on the ground. Kevin Tyler : Okay. And if you were choosing like for like though, at this point, would your preference still be for life sciences or if you had similar terms -- maybe it\u2019s a difficult question to answer, but I guess if you had two high quality tenants, how do you think about one versus the other life sciences? Joel Marcus : Yes. Well good example is that very issue at Mission Bay on those parcels. There was a multi-national pharma that had -- that\u2019s actually current client that had expressed substantial need for space. But it's inability to take all of the space totaling almost approximately 500,000 square feet and moving at a very rapid speed, really I think hindered its ability to compete with Uber. So I don\u2019t think so much it's an either/or except in unusual cases, but where it\u2019s happened, I think you have to look to what you can get the best execution. Obviously you have to look a credit terms of deal and so forth. There\u2019s so many aspects. But I think that\u2019s a good case study comparison, because it actually happened in a life science dominated market at Mission Bay. Kevin Tyler : Okay, thanks. And then Dean, have you seen the market for construction financing? Based on recent experience in Cambridge, it looked like plus 200 terms for the construction loan at Page Street were bit wider than deals in the recent past, but I was just curious if you\u2019re seeing the lending standards tighten up a bit. Dean Shigenaga : I\u2019d say we've seen very good reception to construction financing, given the quality of the real-estate that we\u2019ve been putting to the market for construction financing. I think the pricing on this transaction is more reflective of the nature of the relationship we're establishing with the new lender. It\u2019s a pretty typical down the fairway of what they focus in on. There was an opportunity to tackle a very large financing opportunity. Typically, if we work within our bank group, I think pricing would be closer to what we achieved previously in the L plus 150 range. But I think we also have technology -- the regulatory environment today, it\u2019s changing and putting some pressure on pricing with financing from banks, and I think construction loans fall into that category. So I\u2019m a little off on the market there. We were really focused on building a new relationship with a premier lender to help provide large project financing. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Dave Rodgers with Robert W. Baird. Dave Rodgers : Maybe Joel, I just want to start with you and you can farm it out if you want. Two questions on leasing in the quarter. I think you indicated in the supplement, four leases really impacted the spreads in the quarter. I don\u2019t know if you can provide any details on that, in terms of who or where, but that might be interesting. And then I guess the second one on leasing in the quarter, did you contemplate going direct without the bet, or was there was something about that sublease that didn\u2019t make sense? Joel Marcus : Yes. So I\u2019ll maybe do the first one. I\u2019ll ask Steve to address the second. So on the leases that drove our leasing stats, Cambridge and San Francisco were the most contributory, as I mentioned and then Seattle and RTP also were contributory. But I think Cambridge and San Francisco certainly won that day. With respect to the sublease, Steve you can give a bit of background. Steve Richardson : Hi Dave, it\u2019s Steve. Yes, they had towards a market, we were certainly involved in every step of the process and really active in partnership with Amgen. But ultimately from a transaction structure perspective, it made a lot more sense to stay in a sublease situation. So we\u2019ve acted as a very proactive facilitator in the transaction, have a nice direct relationship but from a transaction structure, it just made sense to go the sublease rout. Dave Rodgers : Great thanks for that. And then maybe the 2017 expirations that now show up in the supplement, two bigger groupings of expirations for \u201917 I guess in San Diego and in Cambridge. I don\u2019t know if Tom wants to comment or Joel you can throw in there. And big or large blocks of space coming up that we need to watch for and a fairly low percentage so far of already negotiated or anticipated leases. So do we expect a lot more leasing activity that need to be done for those spaces as we go into \u201917. Joel Marcus : Tom, you could talk you about 400 tech and 200 tech square. Tom Andrews : Yes. So both 400 tech and 200 tech square, where we have some significant expirations, we're already very actively discussing pretty much all of what's scheduled to come available next year. In 200 tech it's pieces of the Novartis premises, and we are actually very close to batting up a lease transaction that will take that space out of play. And then in 400 tech square we have one particular tenant with a calendar 17 expiration who has an extension right and they've asked for a couple more months to exercise that right, because they have a significant milestone to achieve or not. If they achieve it, they may need more space, if they don\u2019t achieve it, they'll stay in the space and extend. So we're very comfortable, given the leasing activity in Cambridge with a near to zero vacancy rate that we'll have no difficulty at all releasing that space if the company actually exits. Joel Marcus : And Tom, do you want to comment on the other one, 215 first, we've get a role on 36,000 would come. Tom Andrews : Yes, that one we are in negotiations with the three or so different parties right now. In terms of who might fit best in that, it's very interesting in each situation. Cambridge right now, we have -- in virtually every space that becomes available, there are multiple perspective tenants and it's a matter of winnowing through the through the most suitable and then trying to strike the transaction that's most appropriate for the landlord advancing our [indiscernible]. So I think we again don\u2019t have any worries at all about getting that property re-leased. Joel Marcus : Yes, other that's of note, Steve again of 1,500. Steve Richardson : Yes, and Dave maybe to provide broader context at the offset here, we're seeing very active pipeline early renewals. We've completed about a 180,000 square feet of 2017 and 2018 renewals. The one Joel referenced specifically, we are trading papers. So it's beyond just discussions. We expect that to have that completed the next quarter. And we've got another 100,000 feet beyond that where we're in active discussions for early renewals as well. So pretty strong trend. Operator : And our next question thus come from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jamie Feldman : I guess just first housekeeping. When during the quarter did you guys raise the equity? Joel Marcus : It was overtime Jamie. I don\u2019t -- it was relatively small. Jamie Feldman : It was over the course of the quarter? Joel Marcus : Pretty much. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then can you -- looking at the investments on the balance sheet, it looks like the balance has come down since the last quarter. Is that a change in valuation or did you sell some? How do we think about the move? Joel Marcus : A little bit of both, but as you know, the valuation of Biotech and life science generally have been moving around quite a bit I would say that it did Jeff -- as of March 31st, it recovered about a month later and it's scaled back a tad. So net-net there has been decent movement, just from a valuation perspective, and it's purely the publicly traded securities we're discussing. We did realize about 11 million of proceeds during the quarter. So we did have some of the gains during the quarter, but the bulk of it had just to do with the changes in stock price. I would say as Steven mentioned there is healthy activity in the market, broadly, some of which includes our underlying investments and I would guess that in the near term you'll see some large mark-to-markets coming into the public portfolio soon. Tom Andrews : Yes, if you look at page 52 of the sup, you get a snapshot of what we have publicly, and at the moment our net unrealized gains are about 3x of our cost. And then out of the private side as Steve mentioned, we have made an early investment in a company called Stemcentrx which occupies East Jamie Court and that return could be as high as 25. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then as we think about your future development pipeline, any kind of early thoughts on what you might start relatively soon? Steve Richardson : Well I think if you go to page of the sup, we've kind of expanded at page 41, our key future projects and we try to give a little bit of context with some renderings et cetera. We don\u2019t have any plans at the moment I think as I said last quarter to initiate any new developments. We did obviously move vertex to active, but at the moment our pipeline is strong, it's full, it's highly leased and we don\u2019t see any reason to start any new projects. Jamie Feldman : Or as you think ahead to next year and your growth prospects and the strength of your markets, do you think you would start as many projects in 2017 as you did in 2016? Joel Marcus : If you come to Investor Day, I'll tell you. Jamie Feldman : Okay. You're going to make we wait that long. Joel Marcus : Of course. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then you made some pretty positive comments that 100 Binney, not a loose campus, pretty well committed. Can you just give some more color there? Joel Marcus : Well I think in Nodulus [ph], Dan, you could give a little color on what\u2019s the activity there. It's been very strong. Dan Ryan : Hey Jamie, it's Dan. Yes, we\u2019ve been really pleased. We just signed a letter of intent with a major Japanese firm to take roughly 30,000 square feet of a 35-65 building. So that will only leave about 10,000 square feet there. And we executed a letter of intent on Friday with an existing tenant to expand and take the 25,000 square feet of availability there. So we\u2019ll be 100% here in the next 30 days or so. Joel Marcus : And Tom maybe comment on activity on 100 Binney, which seems to be these days pretty extraordinary actually. Tom Andrews : Yes. We\u2019re down to the short strokes on approximately 110,000 square foot lease with a public biotech company that's in the Cambridge market currently. And it has a lease expiration that they need to deal with. So that\u2019s moving toward completion. And then we have on the balance of the space which is about 110,000 square or 2.5 floors, we\u2019re starting to see more and more activity, even though the space is going to be deliverable for -- until really or occupied until really calendar '18. And it's interesting that we\u2019re seeing 30,000 and 40,000 square foot requirements nearly two years out from occupancy date requesting proposals from us. So as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re sorting through and trying to figure out the best prospects to engage with and that will play out over the next several months. Joel Marcus : Yes. I would also put a footnote on that. Bristol-Myers has half the building. The other half is still uncommitted, in various stages of discussions et cetera. But we\u2019ve been told that we will have likely two credit tenant RFPs for as much space as we can provide them. So there is no shortage of demand in the market for that building. And there is no competitive first in class project coming to fruition at the moment. Operator : And our next question does come from the line of Sheila McGrath with Evercore. Sheila McGrath : Joel, I was wondering if you could give us an idea of how the rents at 75-125 Binney compare to 100 Binney now a couple of years later, and how the construction costs have moved? How the rents look then and now, and then constructions? Joel Marcus : Yes. So I'm going to maybe give an opening. Then I\u2019ll let Tom talk about it. But I think it's fair to say we did reach a high watermark when we signed ARIAD back a couple of years ago, and I think today we\u2019ll be reaching a new high watermark with 100 Binney. But I\u2019ll let Tom discuss the comparison of both and some of the construction cost situations. Tom Andrews : I think Sheila, the rents have moved. I don\u2019t have a figure directly in front of me. But about $10 a square foot on a GAAP basis so the average rent over the term from when we struck a deal with ARIAD to where we are right now, I would say that we have offered -- and able to offer somewhat less dollars in TI allowance for the -- in connection with that increased rent. So, again if you adjust it for TI dollar commitment, it's an even better move up. In terms of the cost, I think some people -- I saw some comment related to the extent of particularly 100 Binney, and one thing to recognize there is in the Bristol-Myer, situation where we have a landlord build, we do have to carry the cost of the tenant\u2019s investment over and above the TI allowance as part of the basis and the property. So I think you see high number there because of that, more than anything else. Although construction costs have been increasing, I would say they have -- they certainly have not increased faster than rents have. Sheila McGrath : And then just on 75-125 Binney, there was some talk in the market that ARIAD looks to put more sublease space back to market. Is there any update there? Tom Andrews : We have heard various things. They are building out nearly -- I\u2019d say over 75% of the space that they are leasing and they're nearing completion with that build out, leasing about 25% of their direct space, and this is exclusive of the IBM Watson space. So this is about 215,000 square feet that they have not subleased. They\u2019ve been building out that space. The current information we have from them is that they intend to occupy but they are -- we know that they are entertaining some discussion with sub-tenant prospects, particularly on the non-build out portion of the space. Sheila McGrath : Okay. One last quick one on, any thoughts on 1 Kendall Square? I think that was hitting the market for sale, if there is any update there? And if you had any interest in the property? Joel Marcus : Yes, we've seen the flier and that\u2019s all we seen. So we don\u2019t know much more than that at the moment. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question does come from line Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Rich Anderson : Just a quick one on San Diego. Has there been any additional thought about looking Downtown, or is there any the first kind of firm up the role, and point north before you would even consider that type of move? Joel Marcus : Yes, maybe I'll open that and then ask Dan to comment. I think we see that there is still a lot to do as you can tell by our activity up in Torrey Pines and University Town Center, centers the Alumina campus, the Campus Pointe campus. So we have our hands pretty well occupied with a lot of moving parts and that trying to capture as much as the quality demand in that market as we see. I think we've certainly paid attention to what's going on Downtown but I don\u2019t think that it is necessarily as ready for prime time as some of the other locations if you look at the Mission district in San Francisco or some of the early activities. I don\u2019t think you see them at the same level but Dan, you can comment on me ground. Dan Ryan : Yes. I think Joel summarized that pretty well. We have been looking around down there quite a bit. I email Joel every other week with a new idea, most of which I get a no, but we think that long term there is a probably natural extension for what we're doing down there but it's probably midterm out four, five years before we probably pull the trigger or something like that. Rich Anderson : Can you comment on the stuff where he said yes? Joel Marcus : I've never said yes. Dan Ryan : Mostly I just get a note back saying will you lease the Lilly space and quit bothering me. Rich Anderson : And then a broad -- a bigger picture question, talking about not adding to the development effort at this point, with kind of a to choose from later on. What is your comfort level in the next three or four years of the development pipeline as a percentage of your total assets? Joel Marcus : Yes, I think as Dean mentioned our target has been, and this also for our desire to upgrade to -- get upgraded to BBB plus rating, somewhere in the 10% to 15% range, and I think the Dean on your end our target is. Dean Shigenaga : Yes, we're hoping to be closer to the 10% number by the end of this year. Operator : And our next question is a follow up question from the line of the Manny Korchman for Citi. Michael Bilerman : Its Michael Bilerman. Joel, the Company's efforts to go global clearly didn\u2019t pan out, I think the way you sort of envisioned many years ago. Is there sort of any circumstances, or any scenarios that you could foresee yourself trying to do it again, or has this sort of experience now, sort of made you completely focus on the U.S.? Joel Marcus : Thanks Michael, I think that that\u2019s true. I think the U.S. market has come a long way in the decade since we started in Asia and Europe back in kind of the '05, '06 range. I think there was a feeling that India and China would hold half the world's population and could be really great markets. I think some day they will be, but they are still I think too early for prime time. And you can tell. As Dean mentioned, we have almost $50 million in currency losses. I think it's hard for companies in the real estate sector to focus heavily on overseas operations. I think that, that given our footprint, given our high quality, really amazing campus locations and tenants, there is no reason now to think about overseas, whether it be Europe or Asia. But if you go back pre-crash, those were pretty interesting markets and I think the markets here in the United States, we're still in the process of evolving, but they've come an awfully long way in that decade. Michael Bilerman : So what we need to change, either internationally in the U.S. for you to -- look there is currencies, there is political, there's so many other risks out there than going global, let alone just the time and the effort -- of your time and efforts, and your team's time and effort in making it matter. So could you envision a scenario where we could be talking about doing this again, or is it just completely off the table? Joel Marcus : Yes, I think it's completely off the table. I think that over the next medium the longer term we look at newer markets in the United States, because there are markets here that are interesting, but again maybe not ready for prime time. Think about New York where we won RFP back in 2005, and here we sit a decade later with a campus. But these efforts are literally a decade long effort, and we worked hard, not only things you guys see in the supplement, but an amazing amount of work at the cluster level, to really bring those clusters along. So I think there is no way that I could see, foresee going overseas again. I think it would be expansion in the United States. Michael Bilerman : Right. And then just I don\u2019t know if you have it handy, but outside of the impairment charges that were taken this quarter, do you sort of have, a sort of total U.S. dollars invested internationally, whether it was China, India, Scotland, Canada and any other R&D market, sort of the total expensed dollars that you invested, and ultimately what you expect U.S. dollar wise to get back just to sort of get at the financial sort of, go around? Joel Marcus : So well, I think in Scotland we acquired options on land, that we\u2019re able exit that land and recoup our investment, and I think make some money from that. In Terrano we obviously were involved in the March project early on and we structured that and we reported our exit from there and what happens. So I think that\u2019s -- those two have been fully disclosed. We haven\u2019t really done anything else outside of China and India, and I think China and India are pretty well documented in the supplement. So there is nothing else out there that I\u2019m aware of. Operator : And at this time, there are no further questions in the queue. I would like turn the call back over to management for any closing comments. Joel Marcus : Okay, thank you very much. We closed early and we appreciate your time and a busy earning season. We'll talk to you for the second quarter. Thanks everybody. Operator : Thank you very much. Ladies and gentleman that all concluded conference for today. I do thank you for participation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day and welcome to the Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc. Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Lisa and I\u2019ll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and please note that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Paula Schwartz. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Paula Schwartz : Good morning. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I now would like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus. Please go ahead. Joel Marcus : Thank you, Paula and welcome everybody to our second quarter earnings call. And with me today actually here in New York City is Dean Shigenaga, Tom Andrews, Steve Richardson, Peter Moglia, Dan Ryan and John Cunningham. And I want to extend a congratulations to the entire Alexandria family for a very strong second quarter performance really in all respects. I think the key themes for the second quarter revolve around a strong core internal growth performance, successful early deliveries of our development pipeline with strong yields, continuing strong health of our tenant base and really a truly superb execution of our capital plan. So let me move to a couple of macro themes if I can. It's hard to imagine, but today, there are approximately 10,000 diseases that we've identified that afflict humanity and we've only addressed about 500. So we're still literally in the very early innings of our quest for prevention, treatment and cure of dreaded diseases and this battle is mission-critical for humanity. Really an answer to that challenge, there is very significant R&D investment that continues to drive innovation and demand on a global basis, $145 billion of global biopharma R&D, $38 billion of US government funding heavily at the NIH, $11 billion of US venture capital and $30 billion of philanthropic money. So the total now exceeds $200 billion for R&D, quite a stellar dedication of resources, which in all respects end up really helping our business in a material manner. Our high barrier to entry urban cluster markets remain rock-solid. If you look at the continuing strong demand, we see that in virtually every market today with highly constrained supply, which is obviously a very good thing. Rents are up on average about 15% over the past year and we\u2019re continuing to see and maintain high occupancy. If you look at the Cambridge cluster market and Tom will be available during Q&A, current supply is about 429,000 square feet of vacancy for lab, today's demand is something around north of 2 million square feet, with about 40 tenants focused on Cambridge, and based on recent forecast of brokers in the market for laboratory, they\u2019re forecasting rents in 2018 for lab to be $80 to $85 triple net. Alexandria is blessed with a unique business model. Our strong internal growth in core is, I think, well known and driven heavily by 96% of our leases have annual steps and many of those are 3%. Our performance this quarter on rental rate increases 27.1 on a GAAP and 9.3 on a cash. Certainly were, I think, very important to the company and key drivers included Cambridge, San Francisco and Research Triangle Park. And as I said last quarter, we\u2019re seeing and Dean may comment further, in 2016, we\u2019re continuing to see tenants aggressively seek us out to extend their lease terms, which roll in future years where they have no options and that\u2019s something that clearly, it will start benefit for internal growth purposes. We\u2019re seeing slight occupancy gains since we\u2019re at pretty high occupancy today at 97% and we\u2019re seeing very -- solid same property performance, Dean will comment further, 4.9 and then 6.4 on a cash basis. One of the most important attributes every investor should note is that ARE\u2019s great current strength, 53% of our annual base rent is from investment-grade tenants, here in 2Q of \u201816, 82% of our top 20 are investment-grade with lease durations of approximately 8.4 years. So we've got a great runway for solid, consistent and safe cash flows. Turning to external growth, Alexandria's business model, a unique business model, has been simplified by strong external growth. We have, as you know, a strong, highly leased, development pipeline, driving that growth, and as set forth in the sub and in the press release, our CIP for the second half will deliver approximately 1 million square feet, which is today 90% leased, targeting NOI of somewhere between 51 million and 56 million and in 2017 and the early part of 2018, 2 million more square feet, approximately 74% pre-leased with NOI onboarding and at that point of about 130 million to 140 million. So a total of well north of 3 million square feet. We had three successful deliveries in the second quarter and Dean will comment on that, New York, Illumina and Longwood, with very strong yields and we've hit a 7% yield on our New York developments, so great kudos to the New York team. Leasing has stayed strong and we did indicate new starts far Vertex in San Diego and a parking garage for Illumina. With respect to our major acquisition during the quarter and Tom will be around to answer questions here during Q&A, we did sign a purchase and sale agreement to acquire One Kendall Square and we believe that the location of that campus and the attributes of that campus present exactly what we would want when looking for external growth through acquisitions, which we typically don't make many of, seven buildings aggregating almost 645,000 square feet, 98.5% occupancy. We think we can move those, the yield on this project to potentially the mid-sixes over the next couple of years. We think that allocating capital to the world's leading life science cluster sub market and Cambridge is a smart thing to do, and it gives us an excellent opportunity to expand our current campuses in close proximity at the MIT Technology Square and the Alexandria Center at Kendall Square. We think we can significantly increase NOI and cash flows. We think in place rents are substantially below market. More than 50% of the leases expire over the next three years and we've got a great opportunity to convert significant office space to lab space at significantly higher rents and we've got a great land parcel for development, about 172,000 square feet, which we will aggressively pursue and closing will be dependent upon loan assumption. And I guess finally, before I turn it over to Dean here, when we look at key future projects, we\u2019re currently evaluating for future development, the two projects in Cambridge, once we close on Tech Square -- I\u2019m sorry, on One Kendall Square, the 172,000 square feet, we will aggressively move that forward and we\u2019re looking carefully at the additional 100,000 square feet of development we have at Tech Square. We\u2019re also looking carefully at Grand Avenue in South San Francisco and the Illumina campus. So these opportunities in each of these locations represent where we have in hand or very strong tenant demand. So without further delay, let me turn it over to Dean for more color on the quarter. Dean Shigenaga : Thanks, Joel. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everybody. As Joel mentioned, we're taking this call from New York today. Just want to cover three important topics, first, our consistent execution and delivery of very strong internal and external growth, second, the disciplined management of our balance sheet and then lastly, key highlights on our updated guidance for 2016, accelerated timing of improvement of leverage goals and closing remarks. I just wanted to make a quick, but very important note, we wanted to take a moment to congratulate our entire team on their consecutive Gold NAREIT CARE award. We are very pleased to be recognized as the best in class REIT that delivers transparency, quality and efficient communications in reporting to the investment community. Moving on to consistent execution and delivery, strong internal and external growth, our team continued to execute on our differentiated business strategy, focused on unique collaborative campuses and urban innovation cluster submarkets, limited to no supply of Class A space continues to drive rental rate growth on re-leasing the space and lease renewals, including significant benefit from early lease renewals. Solid leasing activity in the second quarter of 817,000 rentable square feet, rental rates were up 27.1% and 9.3% on a cash basis. We delivered consistent and solid same property NOI growth for the second quarter, up 4.9% and 6.4% on a cash basis. One quick note on straight-line rent during the second quarter, we did receive a $9 million contractual cash payment that drove a significant reduction in straight line rent for the quarter. Looking forward into the third quarter, straight-line rent is expected to be consistent with prior quarters. Occupancy was solid at 97%. Moving onto external growth, our team continued our disciplined allocation of capital, 96% of capital for 2016 is targeted for investment in to high-quality facilities and urban innovation clusters, including very robust in San Francisco, New York City, San Diego and Seattle. We completed and delivered earlier than expected. The third build-to-suit on campus in University Town Centre in San Diego for Illumina, a global leader in genomics, we also completed and placed in the service the remaining 63,000 rentable square feet, including about 34,000 square feet of vacancy at our second world-class center of innovation in New York City. The key takeaway from this project is that we exceeded our initial forecast cash yields by 40 basis points for a very strong final cash yield of 7%. Moving onto the disciplined management of our balance sheet, I just think given the volume of events that we\u2019ve executed on during the quarter, I want to quickly highlight the key items. We repurchased 53 million of par value of our Series D. About half of that was in the second quarter and the other half occurred in July. We issued about 348 million at $95.31 per share under our ATM program and expect to file a new program. We announced 256 million in proceeds to be received primarily in 2016, from two separate joint ventures at 10290 and 10300 campus point at a 5.7% cash cap rate. We issued 350 million, 3.95% 10-year unsecured bonds, completed 304 million in commitments under a secured construction loan for 100 Binney Street, raised 165 billion in commitments under our recently amended unsecured senior line of credit, aggregate commitments available for borrowing increased by 150 million. We extended the maturity date to October 2021 and reduced pricing 10 basis points to LIBOR plus 1%. We executed 200 million in interest-rate swaps and interest-rate cap at 2% for up to 150 million of notional. We also executed 724 million in future proceeds from the issuance of common equity and the forward sale agreements. The goal of the forward was to lock in the cost of capital to fully fund the acquisition of One Kendall Square, while we obtain approval from the lender for the assumption of $203 million secured loan. We expect to complete the approval for the loan assumption over the next 2 to 3 months, then complete the acquisition of One Kendall Square and settle the forward sale agreements from the common stock offering. Second-quarter net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 6.8 times and I\u2019ll cover our leverage goals in a moment. Liquidity, as of the quarter end, was 2.4 billion. In summary, our team completed the majority of our key items for 2016 capital plan, accelerated the timing of the improvement of our leverage goals and extended our weighted average remaining term of outstanding debt. Lastly, turning to the guidance, the accelerated timing of our leverage goal and closing remarks, the detailed assumptions underline our guidance for 2016 are included in page 10 of our supplemental package. We narrowed the range of our guidance for FFO per share diluted from $0.10 to $0.06 with no change to the midpoint of $5.51. Key considerations for the midpoint of our FFO per share guidance of $5.51 after execution of significant debt and equity capital market activity, -- activities to date, in 2016 include. In recent years, we\u2019ve been able to meaningfully increase FFO per share guidance above our initial guidance at the beginning of each year. In 2016, we have held our FFO per share guidance at $5.51, since first announcing guidance at our annual Investor Day in 2015. We\u2019ve had very strong internal and external growth from solid demand for our Class A facilities. I\u2019ll touch on increases in guidance for rental rate growth and same property NOI growth in a moment. Early lease renewals continue to drive core operating performance and mitigate leasing downtime. Our value creation pipeline, we are ahead of our initial projections on completion and delivery of several spaces, including building six for Illumina, the space at Longwood and the execution and lease up and delivery of space as is versus redevelopment at Barnes Canyon in San Diego. We also achieved better pricing on capital market activity in the first quarter or actually in June, I should say, as we completed our unsecured bond offering at 3.95%. And this was inside of the interest rate that we had assumed in our initial guidance. Internal growth has been solid and continues to drive operating performance. We increased the midpoint of our guidance for rental rate growth on lease renewals and release in the space by 5% and 1% on a cash basis. Our ranges for guidance for rental rate growth are now up 19% to 22%, and up 7% to 10% on a cash basis. We also increased the midpoint of our guidance for same property NOI growth by 0.5% to 1% on both a GAAP and cash basis. Our updated ranges for same property NOI growth is up 2.5% to 4.5% and up 4% to 6% on a cash basis. We accelerated the timing of our leverage goals and are now targeting fourth quarter annualized net debt to adjusted EBITDA in a range from 6.2 times to 6.6 times or midpoint of 6.4 times. Our goal by the end of 2017 remains focused on improvement of net debt to adjusted EBITDA to less than six times. We have about 162 million of par value of our Series D convertible preferred stock outstanding as of today and we will continue to look for opportunities to repurchase shares. We continued with a disciplined management of our value creation pipeline and are on track to further reduce our pipeline as a percentage of gross real estate to the 10% range by year-end. Our differentiated business strategy focuses on Class A assets and AAA locations and urban innovation clusters and continues to track some of the most highly innovative and successful companies. With our best in class team, we look forward to consistently executing and delivering growth and FFO per share and net asset value quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, while we also improve our credit profile and long-term cost of capital. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Joel. Joel Marcus : Operator, if we can go to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Manny Korchman with Citi. Manny Korchman : Hey, guys. Thanks. Maybe we just think about the tenant environment, has there been any change in either the VC funding environment or changes in sort of IPL landscape and how your tenants are thinking about growth? Joel Marcus : So Manny, I guess two items. One would be with respect to venture capital funding in the first quarter, venture firms raised virtually an all-time record amount of funding for investment into life science entities, which we feel will be invested over the next year or two or three, depending on the length of the fund. So that's a very, very strong sign. The venture capital market remains robust. The IPO size has been a little tougher this year than last year. There have been, I think, more than -- 12 or more IPOs on the life science industry side. Devon performed nearly as well as last year, but the market still is open for innovative companies that have unique products. So there is funding and then the M&A environment continues to be fairly robust. I think we mentioned last time, or if we didn\u2019t, just an update, one of our tenants, Stemcentrx, that was in our South San Francisco portfolio got sold at fairly early stage cancer stem cell company to AbbVie for almost $12 billion. So we see that, as you look out on the landscape, things look pretty healthy. Manny Korchman : Thanks, Joel. And a couple of questions on One Kendall, the first, just what\u2019s sort of your development timing there and what are you thinking about doing. The second, the other part of the project and then sort of development piece, it's pretty well leased and seemingly stabilized. Are you thinking about holding onto that in its entirety or is there a chance that you partner that out to somebody? Joel Marcus : Yeah. So let me give you a topside view and then I\u2019ll ask Tom to be specific. So with respect to the timing of the development, I think we\u2019re going to be pretty aggressive once we close and then Tom can give you more color and then I think with respect to the after that sales, we don't have any current intent to joint venture that outside. Tom Andrews : Thanks, Joel. So the development side is about 172,000 square foot development site that is permitted with the city, have the special permit. Needs design completion, which we will begin promptly here after we select the design team and a group to go forward on the design. That will probably take about six months, which will coincide with some preconstruction activity that needs to be done in the site and work around the parking garage and movie theatre to make -- to repossession some driveways and things like that, so we can do development on the site. And then we expect the development to take about 18 months to construct. Manny Korchman : Thanks, guys. Operator : And we\u2019ll now take a question from Nick Yulico from UBS. Nick Yulico : Thanks. Hi, everyone. I was hoping you could just talk a little bit about the demand in the market for the San Francisco area for life science and then how are you thinking about what your conversations are like with tenants, because you don't -- prospective tenants because I guess your outbound portfolio is full, your development portfolio is fully occupied and you really only I guess have that tennis club project that still needs prop M. So I mean, maybe if you\u2019re just talking about demand in the market and then how are you thinking about how you might be able to accommodate from that demand? Joel Marcus : Yes. So I'll just make a comment or so and then I\u2019ll give -- let Steve give you the detailed color. Contrary to popular belief, San Francisco has not fallen into the ocean. It\u2019s actually remained extremely healthy, both on the lab and the tech side and demand has been robust and Steve will give you details. Steve Richardson : Nick, hi, it\u2019s Steve Richardson. As Joel just mentioned, I mean we\u2019re tracking over 2.5 million square feet of lab demand only and that\u2019s, in addition, to 5.9 million square feet of tech demand in San Francisco only. So you\u2019re right, it has remained very healthy. We are 100% leased. Year-to-date, we've actually done 158,000 square feet of early renewals and we have another 200 plus thousand square feet in negotiations. So big companies like Celgene who renewed earlier a few months ago, are identifying Mission Bay as a long-term destination and the discussions we\u2019re having with them are how do they secure and lock up their space. So we continue to see a very healthy broad market out into the future in San Francisco. And on the development side, again, we\u2019re 100% leased with three ground-up projects coming out of the ground with Pinterest, Stripe and Uber. So healthy on that side as well. And on the East ground site, getting to the activity there in South San Francisco, the vacancy rate in South San Francisco has now dropped to 4.8%. So that\u2019s about 440 bps lower than just last year. So very continued strong demand with upward pressures on lease rates there too. Nick Yulico : And then do you have any update on when you think you might get Prop M approval for that tennis club project in the city itself? Steve Richardson : Yes. So we\u2019re monitoring that very closely. We have what we think is a very, very robust package of community benefits, which is going to be high on the list of city requirements and so we are very bullish on that. You may have read, we came to an agreement with the tennis club members. So we have an absolute clear path now for entitlements there and everybody is moving in the same direction. So stay tuned over the next several quarters for an update on entitlements. Nick Yulico : All right. Thanks, everyone. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Jamie Feldman from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jamie Feldman : Thank you. Joel, you outlined potential projects where you\u2019re seeing good demand where you may start over the relatively near future, can you talk to us about the cost of some of these projects and how you guys are thinking about financing, especially after a large amount of financing you did to kind of -- to carry your needs through \u201816, and technically \u201817 and \u201918 based on your ability to raise debt, but just maybe help us think about the capital plan going forward, if you do need to start here? Joel Marcus : Yes. I\u2019ll ask Dean to comment on that. I think when it comes to the three areas that I mentioned, the two projects on Cambridge, one is the One Kendall Square which Tom just spoke to, potentially adding on to Tech Square where we\u2019ve got 100,000 square feet of entitlements, the Grand Avenue project, which Steve talked about, which that market has really become so tied in. And as you know, Verily has taken over the Amgen sub lease that the former on its space, it\u2019s pretty clear that there is pretty robust demand in that market and then Illumina on that campus, we literally got a built-in tenant who is clamoring for more space and almost we have to hold them off, but as far as the capital side of it, I think we probably wouldn't begin any starts over the next quarter too. I think we will evaluate where we are, but we clearly would look at where we are on a pre-lease base, where we are on the construction cost basis, on a yield basis and potentially we start something in the -- again, a lot depends on the macro environment potentially next year, but I will leave it to Dean to comment on funding strategy. Dean Shigenaga : Hi, Jamie. It\u2019s Dean here. I would say it's good to think about what we've done over the last few years in funding our growth, primarily construction and development projects. The key difference, I think in 2017 as an example versus 2016, Jamie, is that we\u2019ve got probably clearly as you look at our disclosures, a larger EBITDA growth in \u201917 over 16 as compared to \u201816 over \u201915. And the key behind that is that it allow us to debt fund more of our growth in 2017 as compared to 2016 through debt. So, in aggregate, as you recall over the last number of years, we\u2019ve had free cash flows of $125 million. You add on EBITDA growth and we\u2019ve been funding anywhere from 400 million to 500 million of growth from these two components, meaning debt funding through EBITDA growth and then the consumption of retained cash flows after dividends. Beyond that, we\u2019ll continue to utilize recycling of capital, Jamie, through asset sales and I think it\u2019s just an important technology that we will continue to be very disciplined in our approach, in looking at capital sources to fund growth and navigate through the markets as they unfold over the next few years. Yes, and anything we do, our focus is to maintain the lowering of leverage to 6 or less than 6. That is one of the highest priorities and nothing we do would alter that goal. Jamie Feldman : Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess as we think about the TIAA-CREF JV, maybe can you talk to us about that as a potential source of capital going forward, and then maybe additional JVs you might be thinking about? Joel Marcus : So we certainly have enjoyed a high-quality relationship, Peter and Dan led the joint venture on the -- joint ventures on the Campus Point assets. We view them as a long-term partner and I\u2019m not able to comment on anything in the future, but I think we both will look for opportunities to continue to work together. We think they represent a AAA partner of ours. Jamie Feldman : Would you look at additional JVs or do you have a... Joel Marcus : You mean other partners or additional... Jamie Feldman : Additional. Joel Marcus : I don't think we have that our radar screen so much. Jamie Feldman : And then finally thinking about \u201817 expiration, your expiring rents are 27.99 a foot. Can you talk to us about maybe current mark to market on some of those unmet group of leases what we might be looking at? Peter Moglia : Hey Jamie, it\u2019s Peter Moglia, I could run through the North American regions for you, kind of give you a sense of where the AVR is in the market rents are today, keep in mind that AVR I believe includes straight line rent, market rent I\u2019ll give will be the initial rents. So Greater Boston, we\u2019re got a $37.81 expiration ADR, rental rates range there from 40 to 76 in Cambridge, obviously our portfolio is heavily weighted towards Cambridge, so which should be a significant opportunity there. San Francisco at 17 we had a $32.78 rents expiring in \u201817 as market rent there ranges from $48 in the South San Francisco area to $65 triple net in Mission Bay, so again a pretty big opportunity in mark to market there. New York, we have market rents in the area of $80 to $85 per lab here, so anything that comes up I'm sure will be a nice rollup. San Diego we have a $30.25 expiration, market rent there ranges from about 33 in the Sorrento Valley Sorrento area up to $49.45 in the UTC, so another significant mark to market opportunity. Seattle we were at 45.10 that is fairly close to market today but I would say market is really 48 to 54, so I think there is still an incremental opportunity there. In Maryland, the expiration is 19.11 in \u201817 and there is literally 2% vacancy in Maryland right now which for a long time was a weak market and it added to push rent and so we are going out with proposals today in the $28 to $32 range, so possibly Maryland pretty significant growth next year. And then, at Research Triangle Park, at the 13.61, again we are at about 18 for the older product up to 30 for our newer products at it creek, so that should answer your question. Operator : And we will go now to Kevin Tyler from Green Street Advisors. Kevin Tyler : Dean, I might have missed it earlier but on the guidance for common equity and available for sale of securities, it looks like after you back out some of the ATM issuance and the forward sale, I couldn't tell for sure but did your up the guidance for either the equity sale piece or the additional equity issues or how do those pieces kind of play out going forward? Dean Shigenaga : Kevin, it\u2019s Dean here, yes, you are correct, our guidance was updated to reflect the capital market activities that we've announced to date, so on that front everything that we planned in our guidance has been completed on the debt and equity front. Big picture, I think from the first quarter to the second quarter guidance, equity related needs increased by about $950 million about 50% of that increase was attributed to the capital required to fund - fully refund One Kendall Square on a leverage neutral basis, yet about another 20% very roughly of the capital to reduce leverage by three tens of a churn, you had about 10% of the capital that cover series D repurchases that have been completed to date and then roughly 20% of the remainder or the remaining 20% was really related to timing differences on both acquisitions and dispositions and how the EBITDA interplays with your leverage metrics at the end of the day. So hopefully that color helps Kevin. Kevin Tyler : But just the equity security sales is that still on track for the 125? Dean Shigenaga : I\u2019d say broadly speaking we are monetizing a decent number of equity securities while at the same time some of the proceeds are being offset currently by other investment opportunity, so the gross proceeds are on track, our net reinvestment I think has increased a little bit offsetting the ability to retain some of the capital for 2016. Kevin Tyler : And Joel when the [indiscernible] deal came to the market the first time around a bit back in\u201913, you\u2019d said that you hesitated to pursue similar strategy, in part I think some of the challenges that you mentioned were government budgets and university credit profile. I just wondered today as we talk about more broadly university link strategy outside of the key clusters, does that investment model make any more sense for you or Alexandria if you could actually go out and build it organically? Joel Marcus : And the Westward opportunity came to us I think they were represented by Goldman Sachs back in 2013, we actually knew almost every site because we have looked at it broadly whether it be Miami, Winston-Salem, Baltimore, Saint Louis, Illinois a variety of places and we took a very hard look at their platform and what they were doing and certainly impacted us in the sense that it really condemns us once again that the urban innovation cluster model is really the one that we think is the best to pursue for us. I think coupled with the fact that we\u2019re always worried probably the biggest issue that we see in that model is the releasing downstream because if you're in a place like Winston-Salem we or in Baltimore, we are in Baltimore at one point, the depth of the market is such that or the lack of the depth of the market is such that you\u2019re really reliant on the institutional tenant base, now it\u2019s a good tenant for sure, high quality in general but it is in the deep one so if they decide to leave you got a problem and in a lot of cases they want to own so there is some times a requirement that you have neither sell it back or they want to purchase and I get the other thing which has been exemplified by our struggle with Longwood, government budget have been under pressure in the last couple of years with underfunding from the NIH and that seems to be turning around a bit which is a good news situation but a lot of times institutions referred to own rather than lease and we've certainly seen that in the Longwood area. So I think for anybody just go around and bidding and the ultimate buyer I think it represents a platform that works for their business but certainly relates to our business. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will go now to Richard Schiller with Barns. Richard Schiller : First question on New York City that the vacancy rate dropped there, the footnote shows that 62,000 square feet came online, could you describe the activity you\u2019re seeing on the remaining 34,000 feet that is vacant. Joel Marcus : Sure, I\u2019m going to ask John Cunningham who runs our New York City region to do that. John Cunningham : Hey Rich how are you, the activity we have on the remaining floor in the West tower which is the 14th floor which represents majority of that vacancy is actually real strong, we have leased out for half the floor right now and we recently had a press release about a month and a half ago for [indiscernible] we\u2019ll doing on the other half of that floor. That will pretty much use of all of the vacancy we have won small suite associated with the accelerator and still remains on the eighth floor precise on that we will be 100% full. Richard Schiller : And just a high-level macro question, in some of your prepared remarks you guys were talking about how tenants are relatively looking to renew leases with 2 million square feet of demand and 400,000 square feet of vacancy like in the Cambridge area, how do you balance tenant renewables versus trying to get higher rents later on in the future? Joel Marcus : That's a good question I will ask Tom to reflect on that. Tom Andrews : It is certainly challenging, I mean, we have lots of tenant relationships in our portfolio in Cambridge and we like to have a balance between really promoting those relationships but also knowing that there may be others who are prepared to pay higher dollars. So we kind of walk that tightrope and it is challenging right now and in the long run we think we make good decisions on that and I'm able to as you seen [indiscernible]. Joel Marcus : Again, I think in the remarks if broker estimates are correct, if rents in 2018 are in the $80 to $85 triple net range then that does give us cause to think about how we think about delivering space over the next year or two and how we charge for that space, so that analysis is certainly ongoing and something that is top of mind and certainly one of the motivations that we had for moving on the One Kendall Square acquisition. Tom Andrews : Certainly one things we\u2019ve done, it\u2019s Tom again, and certainly one of the things we tried to do in this part of the business cycle is really extent term and being gain higher rents for longer duration and also certainly reduce the TI allowances and really try to make sure we\u2019re spending sort of our own capital as possible in the spaces [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst : Hey Joel, [indiscernible] just to follow up on that comment and questions as well, I guess I wanted a little bit about, last kind of year or so or six months it sounded like on the lot of calls that you would become a little bit more cautious about starting development and I don't want to call it a change in tone, it\u2019s all that you kind of, address that how you want but seems like now we're talking about multiple development opportunities on among multiple sites, has there been a change in tone among your tenants, do you feel better, I guess maybe reconciled as to if I'm thinking about is correctly. Joel Marcus : That's a good question Dave, I think again we have a very robust pipeline set of deliveries \u201916, \u201817 into early \u201918 so there is no reason for us in the past to double down on that you know we've got to know why coming for over the coming quarters and we wouldn't get any additional credit for adding on to that but plus it complicates the capital rates but because we've I think had great success in advancing our capital plan are leverage goals and we are well into the second half of deliveries, in \u201816 I think we can afford to take a look at where we are with the future potential development so it is really a matter of too much change in tone at and where things haven't changed on either side we feel positive on both sides but I think is just a maturation of the plan and they look at what's going on in \u201818 and \u201919, so I think it still just a natural evolution. Unidentified Analyst : And just some of your earlier comments, I can go back and read if I have to but with joint venture in San Diego and what is that lively market or not and I guess if it was, can you talk about maybe the contrast in interest from potential joint venture partners between what you've done in Cambridge and what you just did in San Diego? Joel Marcus : So we always talk to a number of folks when it comes to joint venture but I think it is fair to say that we've developed an extraordinarily good and mutually respectful relation with TIA, we think they're very high quality I think they feel like we are the franchise they would like to invest with in the life science industry and the core urban cluster market. So ultimately we would talk to them and give them the best shot of things but we are always looking at market as a public company, our fiduciary duty is always test market, so when you have a great relationship you will always feel that\u2019s your first choice if at all possible and they've been extremely diligent flexible timeframe and so forth. Peter Moglia : Yes, this is Peter, I would say that we've actually used UBS to help us with some of these relationships and made some meetings with a couple of sovereigns and others just to talk about potential projects just to get a gate in what their interest would be so we have an idea of the market but the end of the day the TIA partnership was one of that we felt was the right choice for in these project. Operator : And we\u2019ll now a take question from Sheila McGrath with Evercore ISI. Sheila McGrath : Joel you mentioned in your remarks 3% annual increases across many of the leases, this appears to be have trended higher, I was just wondering if this is across all your market and this is the norm now and is it both for lab space and tenants base. Joel Marcus : On the lab side it is certainly our standard that we try to achieve given where we are in macroeconomic I mean if inflation ever came roaring at one point in the company's history we went to a min 3 max 6 on annual increases but we think that this represents a stable market and acceptable market annual rental excavation. There are sometimes some changes to that especially on the development side where you might get a quarter point lower or something like that but by in large we try to maintain that across the portfolio in each of the markets. Sheila McGrath : And then on just with the tightness in the market I was wondering if there is been improvement in trends on TI allowances that you would be giving tenants? Peter Moglia : Hey Sheila this is Peter, one of the things I do is review all of the major proposals that are going out in total rents, pre-rents, TI especially given our sensitivity to capital, I have been counseling our regional leaders to lower TIs and I think we've done a really good job of doing that comp probably the best set of all because it's leverage he has in the market but here at the end of the day if we can lower TI significantly even if we have take a little bit less rent that's the way we prefer to do it. Sheila McGrath : And last question just maybe Joel if you can give us an update on the Volpe process like where is that in the timeline and does that still remain of interest to Alexandria? Joel Marcus : Yes, I will ask Tom to comment on that. Tom Andrews : Yet we have a team putting together a response to the RFP which was issued a couple of months ago and we understand what we've planning to submit a response for the deadline of September 8 as the government is requesting proposals be submitted we believe that they intend to try to get a developer selected by year end approximately update on that one we learn more but we are planning to submit a proposal by September 8. Operator : We will now take a question from Karin Ford from MUFG Securities. Karin Ford : Can you please give us your latest thoughts on the potential impact of the upcoming election on your business and the business of the tenants? Joel Marcus : As Karin, so we think that the election if you read the cover story of Baron a couple of weeks ago that probably is the best prognostication that I have read I'm not a political person but I think that really is the one that I think we adopt and we believe is true that the real race is in the House and Senate the predicted that the Republicans would retain the majority in the House and that the Senate was pretty close but Republicans might retain it that if they don't you would have a split house in Senate. As you know the president doesn't have a legislative authority although I guess our current president may be believe he does a bit. But I think it\u2019s fair to say that the split government is a balanced government and I think we continue to see that moving forward. I think where it is important to us, we think there is been very strong support and that we've seen that in fact of supporting the NIH for basic biomedical research, really critical and this bipartisan Congress has supported that and we've seen over $2 billion increase over the past few months for the coming year and looks like that may go higher. We\u2019d like to see more funding for the Food and Drug Administration because that they are clearly underfunded and have hundreds and hundreds of slots unavailable to the fiddle with the for the funding so that tends to be an important area although they approved a large number of drugs in the past couple of years and they\u2019re on a pretty strong pace this year and then a good business pro-business or good quality business environment that we can see positive growth so that we get continued employment high ranks. So that's kind of the view that I think is the majority view on the street and I think we adopt that view. Operator And we will now take a follow-up question from Manny Korchman from Citi. Manny Korchman : If we go back to One Kindle for a second, how much of the cost basis [indiscernible] for development and how much do the income for properties are set differently if you were to take the lands out of the what would be the going in yields? Joel Marcus : The going in yields Manny are reflected in our disclosures in the supplement. Manny Korchman : How many value do you attribute to the lands when you came up the idea? There has to be some rent value... I just want to ask that\u2026 Joel Marcus : You are right, it is from a purchase accounting perspective man you are currently did allocate a portion of the investment to the development site on, 170 some odd thousand square feet at roughly twos approaching three a foot, 300 a foot which we believe is a market we will generate a very nice return on that investment and so the initial state voice you is reflective of the operating aspect today with the small allocation of the purchase price of the land side. Manny Korchman : I think Michael has on this one Unidentified Analyst : Hey Joel, I just had sort of curiosity you talked a little bit [indiscernible] about ramping developments and one of the things you talked about was the balance sheet in a much better position to be able to look towards funding that growth as well as a lot of government you have long target being released and curious if you think about One Kindle in market before much did your access and cost of equity capital play into the decision to buy One Kindle and how much of that is playing in increasing development and potentially looking at other acquisitions? Joel Marcus : Well I think it's fair to say that the well our cost of debt capital certainly has been very favorable in this environment and our cost of equity capital with the stock doing pretty well we are certainly an important factor that we'd want to go out and do a large offering whether forward or not with the stock price that would be in the 70s which it was in the February so that certainly weighed heavily on our mind and our goal has always been how do we balance a couple of things one is maintain our goal on earnings continue to increase our net asset value and at the same time achieve our leverage goals for ratings increase so those are the three things we are clearly focused on as we look at One Kindle, but as I said we looked at this a couple of years ago and Mr. Moglia is sitting here to my right, he told my desire to buy that a couple of years ago for variety of good reasons but I have always felt that asset was unique, the address alone speaks to with One Kindle, it is rare to be able to find an urban campus in the best life science cluster in the universe or galaxy maybe and also the factors that were attended to that if brokerage estimates are right and we can get 80 to 85 triple nets in 2018 that gives us even more upside than our base case projections would hold, we think we can do well on the development and we also think there is a huge opportunity to convert office to lab there. So that was kind of the constellation of considerations broadly that we thought about. Manny Korchman : And then as you think about where your stock sits today, I guess how many more opportunities do you and your team sort of trying to either aggressively uncover and I assume there is other assets like One Kindle that are out there in markets we would like to own, I'm just trying to get a sense of whether we may see more things come. Joel Marcus : I don't think so, if you ask us at the beginning of the year did we plan on buying One Kindle I would tell you that we didn't even know was coming to market there was another asset One Lab and One Building that 245 first I think that went out of the bid their assets somewhat older but they are adjacent to Alexandria Center at Kindle Square, I would have loved to probably owned those variety of reasons coupled with the One Kindle Square acquisition we didn't see the upside in the role we didn't bid on that but we clearly underwrote and follow all the assets so I would say that we are not in general aggressively pursuing things but we are where we see I guess the one opportunity or the one characteristic of an opportunity we look at is where we see a great asset and a great location that we like to own for a long-term and we short to medium term ability to add significant value, we wouldn't buy just a fully stabilized asset for the next 10 or 12 years, just probably no interest in that. So our main focus is on our development pipeline though that's where our key focus is. Manny Korchman : And just last one on the ATM so a perspective of how you can use it going forward how much of the significant ATM issuance was almost use of new One Kindle is coming and you want wanted it so you get as much equity as possible I'm just trying to get a sense of when you do the issue a new program how we should think about when you use it and the volume that you're going to use at a given moment can certainly the size of the issuance is as increased the equity deal was certainly sizeable in the quarter. Dean Shigenaga : Hey Manny, it is Dean here. At some point we\u2019ll refile the program only because it is a great tool they have an balance sheet, it\u2019s a very efficient tool as we all know, as far as usage goes going forward the only thing that is contemplated at the moment would be to the extent that we retire any amount of serious D convertible preferred. we'd like the time that and match funded some common equity and I think again we been pretty clear on that strategy. As far as your question on the ATM usage in the second quarter and refunding the One Kindle. One Kindle was funded through the forward equity offering and we just saw opportunities to utilize the program in connection with changes in the overall capital plan outside of One Kindle Square, the mix of dispositions as an example, the ability to get ahead on our leverage goals as well was interplant into that thought process so hopefully that gives you a lot of color Manny. Joel Marcus : I would say to the extent that we think about using that future and addition to what Dean said, we\u2019d always try to think about it in a leverage neutral fashion in the sense that we want to try to maintain our earnings trajectory obviously grow our NAV and at the same time use it in whatever way that we might but in an accretive fashion. So, that's how we're trying to think about it and we try to be over the past quite a number of years as disciplined as possible in the utilization of equity. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen with no additional questions I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for additional enclosing comments.

My name is Katherine and I\u2019ll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now turn the call over to Paula Schwartz. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Paula Schwartz : Thank you and good afternoon everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I now would like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus. Please go ahead Joel. Joel Marcus : Thank you, Paula and welcome everybody to our third quarter call. And with me today is Dean Shigenaga, Tom Andrews, Steve Richardson, Peter Moglia, Dan Ryan and Monica. Thank you, and congratulations to the entire Alexandria family for a truly strong operating and financial performance in the third quarter. A couple of key the things that we like to stress, one would be our continuing strong core, Dean, will speak to that. Secondly, our continuing strong leasing, bolstered by strong demand and a constrain supply in our urban cluster markets, and solid rent growth and we\u2019re pleased to say that in the third quarter our rent growth was heavily driven by our Greater Boston region; maintaining strong occupancy; strong tenant credit, also a strong pipeline with deliveries with increase in yields as you saw; and number five, superb execution of our capital plan. Let me give a couple of macro thoughts as I like to do each quarter. Alexandria\u2019s business is on two of the most important global issues facing humanity, disease and hunger. Life science fundamentals remain strong and as I stated in the last quarter, 10,000 diseases were identified to date and only about 500 of those have been medically addressed. We\u2019re seeing more patients to date, especially with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, about 36 million more here and we\u2019re likely to see quite a lot large growth worldwide over the coming couple of decades and the emerging markets growth have been double digits over the couple of years. We see more drugs, 19 approvals to date in 2016, 68% are Alexandria tenants, more revenue opportunities, multiple disease areas with large market potentials including immune-oncology, the hepatitis world, liver disease and eye diseases and clearly more innovation including cures and therapies that really address a better quality of life. Demand is driven really by three key factors, in our world we focus on the RND, which is research, 154 billion by biomedical RND worldwide which is very substantial, 34 billion NIH funding basic research and surprisingly $30 billion of medical philanthropy funding basic research as well. There\u2019s a lot of rhetoric these days regarding drug pricing and drug spending and it\u2019s pretty clear the rhetoric is much verse than the realty. Retail drug spending is not meaningfully exceeded 10% of total healthcare cost of the last 50 years. Real drug prices increases other than some abusive cases are much smaller than perception if you look at the rebates. Brand drugs that go off patent, they can get genericized typically see their sales drop 95%. Nine out of ten prescriptions filled in the United States are generic and the hysteria over un-stainability of drug spending is not new, there was uproar in HIV treatment cost back in 1989. President Obama has been quoted in his State Union Address last year, healthcare inflation has had its lowest rates in 50 years and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, better known CMS state in the Wall Street Journal recently that U.S. expenditures for most RX drugs grew by an average of 2.7% from 2007 to 2013. The three poster children for a bad behavior, valium, touring and mylan [ph] really none of those are driven biopharma companies. So what what\u2019s the reality and how does that play into the election. Well, two big reforms at the federal levels as we\u2019re talking about, one would be both supported by Trump and Clinton allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices directly. Basically it won\u2019t work because Medicare is legally prohibited from negotiating drug pricing and it would be wildly unpopular not to give the beneficiaries access to certain drugs due to price. On constraining price increases there is in the Clinton plan a request to try to justify price hikes for long available drugs, why that\u2019s possible but unlikely, it really applies to older drugs, but still would be a difficult pathway. Reforms at the state level, some of you have seen both in California and Ohio, there\u2019s an attempt for state drugs or drugs in states to be subject to caps and unfortunately it doesn\u2019t distinguish between and older impactful or marginally impactful drugs and it\u2019s not likely to work because they\u2019re tied at the prices that the Veterans Administration charges and those are public and VA has more leverage than Medicare or other state payers and even if states mandate more transparency it would be hard for them to regulate and implement the initiatives. And then secondly under state law, there\u2019s a move to get transparency which is kind of the naming and shaming and that certainly could happen and is happening. I think if you look beyond the rhetoric, I think there\u2019s some great near-term news for this sector, the 21st Century Cures Act. On September 28, bipartisan leadership from both the house and senate played support to move the 21st Century Cures Act to a bill during the lame duck session of congress and it would be the first long-term and sweeping biomedical research funding before the end of this year. And Mitch McConnell has been quoted as saying, it\u2019s the most significant piece of legislation that we passed in the whole congress in the last year. It provides for substantial increase in funding to the National Institute of Health and to the FDA and also a number of key initiatives, including Vice President Cancer Moonshot. The key to success in biopharma will be true cures and unique treatments which greatly increase the quality of life and even more recent to date to be in key urban innovation cluster markets to access the talent pool and the innovative technology and products. So moving beyond that to the number of concerns that are raised about the health of life science tenants, we\u2019re very pleased to say, you can see from the press release and the supplemental, 54% of our annual base rent are from investment grade tenants, 78% of our annual base rent from our top 20 tenants, which is a very high about almost half of our annual base rent and also coupled with an almost nine year lease duration which gives the company great long-term high quality secured cash flows and 77% of our annual base rent these days is from Class A properties and our AAA urban cluster locations. There\u2019ve been strong recent inflows in the life science insured capital firms, a number of firms, several - maybe up to about five or six are in the process of rising between $0.5 billion and $1 billion in funds. There\u2019s been a decent IPO window. It\u2019s been more selective this year and I think a good climate for M&A and if you notice that 65% of new drugs from 2011 to 2016 were really developed by the biotech industry, clear that Big Pharma will continue to be on a shopping spree. Before I turn it over to Dean, just a comment on external growth, we have three Cambridge deliveries substantially pre-leased in the third quarter including 50 Binney, 60 Binney and 11 Hurley were strong yields and we were able to save substantially on project costs which increase the yields. We have a number of fourth quarter deliveries including University Town Center in San Diego to a great company focused on the year and our 290 Campus Point lease redevelopment to Eli Lilly. Longwood, we\u2019ve got two floors left to lease or 27.5% interest and our progress for the 2017 and 2018 pipeline 100 Binney, we\u2019re negotiating a number of floors and we hope to conclude those negotiations in the not too distant future and as well on additional floors on Dexter. So with that let me turn it over to Dean for more color. Dean Shigenaga : Thanks, Joel. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. Alexandria is in a very solid operating and growth position with our unique business strategy and strength across three important areas. First, we have solid market fundamentals in our key urban centers of innovation including Greater Boston, San Francisco, New York City, San Diego and Seattle. Second, we have solid internal growth including same property net operating income growth and rental rate growth on lease renewals and releasing the space. Third, we have solid external growth as we build new Class A that meet the demand from some of the most innovative entities producing new and transformative therapies and solutions to improve quality of life. We\u2019re unique in the REIT sector today, with positive attributes in these key areas that allows our best in class team to deliver growth in earnings, cash flows, common stock dividends. Market fundamentals in our dynamic urban centers of innovation today generally consist of very limited suppliers available Class A space and limited capacity for developers to build new properties adjacent to key drivers of innovation. Solid internal growth, also known as our same property net operating income growth is on track to hit the upper half of our guidance range for 2016. 90% of our third quarter \u201816, net operating income is generated from a consistent pool of quality properties operating for the entirety of comparative periods, otherwise known as our pool of same properties. We pioneered our favorable lease structure that consists of, one, annual contractual rent escalations that average about 3% today and drive solid contractual growth in net cash, net operating income. Two, triple net leases that has allowed Alexandria to recover operating and expenses from our tenants and three, a unique ability to recover from our tenants major CapEx like roof replacements and major heating and cooling system upgrades. Solid market fundamentals consisting of limited supply of available Class A space and solid demand has driven continued improvement in our outlook for rental rate growth on leasing activity projected up 21% to 24% on a GAAP basis and up 8% to 11% on a cash basis and same property net operating income growth projected up 3% to 5% on a GAAP basis and up 4.5% to 6.5% on a cash basis. We continue to execute on our strategy to deliver new high quality Class A properties to ground up development and redevelopment. As landlord of choice, our team is working diligently to build inspiring real estate solutions to drive collaboration and innovation for the some of the top biopharma entities focused on making life better for people throughout the world. We\u2019ve made excellent progress on completion of our current pipeline consisting of new Class A buildings aggregating 3.5 million square feet, 81% highly leased and we are on track to generate approximately $200 million of incremental annual net operating income, representing a significant 35% increase in net operating income over 2015. Returns on our investment are solid and average approximately 7% on this 3.5 million square foot pipeline. We are very pleased to report strong improvement in cash returns on our investments by 40 basis points to 7.7% at 50 and 60 Binney Street in Cambridge due to 5% savings in total project cost. We also improved our cash returns by 90 basis points to 8.8% at 11 Hurley, also located in Cambridge and due to cost savings of approximately $4 million. We are aligning solid market fundamentals, solid internal growth and solid external growth with our balance sheet management goals. Our non-income producing real estate consist of current projects under construction and a great pipeline of well-located land for future ground up development of Class A properties was approximately 12% of gross real estate as of September 30, 2016 and expected to be in the 10% range by December 31, 2016. Our development sites have and will continue to serve the future innovation requirements of high quality biopharma entities focused on discovery of important and transformative new therapies. Our leverage goal; net debt to adjusted EBITDA remains firm and on track for the fourth quarter of \u201816 and also on track to be sub six times by the fourth quarter of \u201817. Additionally our debt plus preferred stock to adjusted EBITDA is also on track for significant improvement as we continue to repurchase our 7% Series D convertible preferred stock. In October 2016, we match funded open market repurchases of 1.5 million shares of 7% Series D convertible preferred stock with 53 million of proceeds from the issuances of common stock under our at the market common stock offering program. As of October 31, we had 125 million par value Series D preferred stock outstanding and hope to repurchase additional shares in the fourth quarter. In the 10 months to date, we\u2019re pleased to report that we have raised approximately $324 million from real estate dispositions that have closed or that are under contract today. This includes good progress on our disposition of real estate investments located in India including the sale of a portfolio of operating properties in October of 2016. We expect to complete the exit of the remaining investments in India consisting of two land parcels over the next couple of quarters. In connection with the progress on dispositions of these investments in India in the third quarter, we recognized additional real estate impairments. Briefly a quick update on our acquisition of One Kendall Square, we expect to obtain approval from the lender for the assumption of the $203 million secured loan and expect to close the acquisition and the forward sale equity offering agreements in the next few weeks. Even though we do not currently own One Kendall Square, our team has already advanced the efforts to significantly increase revenue and cash flows with early renewals and expansion negotiations. We\u2019ve also quickly advanced the design insight work for a fully entitled land part [ph] on this campus in order to capture demand for a new Class A 173,000 square foot property. I should point out that the weighted average shares outstanding for the third quarter included 751,000 additional shares to the obligation of the treasury method of accounting for the outstanding forward equity sale agreements. Lastly on our guidance update, we provided updated guidance for 2016 as detailed on page 7 of our supplemental package, our updated guidance for 2016 net loss per diluted share attributable to Alexandria common stock holders at a range of loss of a $1.13 to $1.19. This net loss reflects real estate impairments, a loss on early extinguishment of debt and preferred stock redemption charge. We narrowed our range of guidance for funds from operations as adjusted on a diluted per share basis for 2016 to a range of $0.03 from $5.50 to $5.52 with no change in the midpoint of the range of $5.51. As mentioned earlier we increased our 2016 outlook for same property NOI growth and rental rate growth from leasing activity as a result of continued solid fundamentals in our key sub markets. Key credit metrics remains solid in our forecasted as follows for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA very solid in the range of 5.9 times to 6.3 times, our fixed rate coverage ratio also very solid at 3.5 times to 4 times. Our value creation pipeline consisting of new Class A properties currently under construction through our development and redevelopment programs and LAN providing a future pipeline of new Class A properties aggregating 10% to 12% of gross real estate and we expect to be closer to the 10% range by year end. Few key remaining items for sources and uses for November and December of 2016 include the following, $142 million of real estate dispositions as highlighted on page 4 of our supplemental package, $140 million of acquisitions also as highlighted on page 5 of our supplemental package and this amount is related to purchase of 88 Bluxome located in south of market in San Francisco. We anticipate the selling differing closing of this acquisition into 2017 and $168 million of capital from our aftermarket common stock offering program or from additional asset sale. In closing we look forward to meeting many of you at our Annual Investor Day on November 30, when we will cover our business strategy, our outlook and provide detailed guidance assumptions for 2017. With that, let me turn it back over to Joel Marcus. Joel Marcus : Operator, we'll open it up for Q&A please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Sheila McGrath with Evercore. Sheila McGrath : Yes, good afternoon. Joel I was wondering if you could talk about the San Diego acquisition, how that opportunity came about if there\u2019s lot of competition on the acquisition? Joel Marcus : Yeah, let me turn it over to Dan and he might give you a little bit of highlight. Dan Ryan : Yeah, good afternoon Sheila. Yes, this was a three buildings that Pfizer had vacated approximately 4.5 years ago, it had been acquired by a private equity group that had substantially repositioned the asset with new leasing kind of I'd say, sort of got to sort of 75% completion level and as these things go the time ran out and they went to market to sell it, as you can imagine, Campus is a three [indiscernible] Torrey Pines highly desirable asset. All the expected players were heavily participating in the process. I think ultimately we prevailed probably, most notably because of our ability to close, I think there is great confidence, certainly if you look at the universe of other life science REITs and other private equity, Alexandria certainly has a reputation for being able to close and there is some disruption with these other REITS give us the opportunity if there been. Peter Moglia : Sheila, this is Peter Moglia. I just wanted to add a couple of things, currently the availability in Torrey Pines is only 3.5%. And rents have grown since 2011 by 32%, so with the low availability and the opportunity to get inventory with the trend that we saw it in rent it look like a really good opportunity and we are really excited about it. Dan Ryan : Yeah, I\u2019m coupled with the fact that there is leasing yet to do, there is mark-to-market on rents, they roll and conversion opportunities from offers for Lab, all those things were factored into our decision to go after this asset. Sheila McGrath : Okay, great, one last question on the South San Francisco market. Was just wondering if we could get a update, we see HCP is starting another project there, just want to get your view on demand there at this point. Steve Richardson : Sheila, hi, it is Steve Richardson. Yeah, I think as we reported for the past couple of quarters, we do see demand, very strong in south San Francisco, vacancy rates have dropped below 5%. The increases in rental rates have been very substantial, second generation space is probably increased 25% over the past 12 to 18 months. So we consider that a very health y market. We recently completed the big campus with [indiscernible] the Google subsidy area, so we are very bullish on South San Francisco. Sheila McGrath : Okay. Great thank you. Operator : We will go to Manny Korchman with Citi. Manny Korchman : Hey good afternoon, John appreciate the comments on drug pricing but it seems like headlines are becoming more prevalent just in general, is there any impact in just a way that both maybe all type of drug companies and even newer companies are thinking about their growth plans or how they approach the space given all the scrutiny and given all the negative price. Joel Marcus : Yeah, so we haven\u2019t really seen that on the ground. In actual practice, at this point I think yeah, as I said in my prepared remarks I think increasingly if older drugs are going to command less pricing power, there is going to be a much stronger need to bring new molecular entries where they be chemical and these are biological and these to the market, that really have cured facts of really positively impact , therapy or treatment and it seems to me that's going to even dry people more strongly in to the urban cores to access the talent and the innovation. So I think you are going to see continually more of that and people - if companies growth rates, if you look at Illumina, Illumina\u2019s growth rate is moving probably from a 30% growth rate to a 10% growth rate. I think you will see companies reach out and look at greater opportunities to bring, to widen their product portfolio and their technology platform and where can you do that, you can't do that and isolated campus and suburban locations, you really got to do it in the heart of innovation. So we are still pretty good about that but haven\u2019t seen any actual changes on the ground and in the markets. I mean you just look at our staff and the demand we haven\u2019t seen it roll back at all. Manny Korchman : May be that\u2019s a good segue. If we look at that demand and the limited amount of supply, are you at all changing the way that negotiations are growing and trying to get tenants to put in maybe only the people that are best facilitative of the cluster market and telling tenants don\u2019t take as much space as you want, take smaller space, don\u2019t put in the people there. The need to be in the cluster market or is that no something we are interested in doing. Joel Marcus : Well I think it is very company specific and I think it is very hard to generalize and I don\u2019t think we would be telling management teams or board of directors do this or don\u2019t do that. They can determine that factor based on their own analysis of their own G&A, their own requirements, their needs access innovated platforms or technologies but I think we just haven\u2019t seen on the ground yet. Some people want large groups of employees on the ground who might have opus uses or development side and other people are putting kind of key research facilities on these cluster but I think as a percentage of overall spend remember that rent is not a significant part of the spend in our world and our sectors compose as compared to say financial services, law firms, accounting firms and so forth. And remember two, if whoever wins the president and CEO, over the house and the Senate go, there is one thing that they could do that could absolutely generate growth in the economy and that would be to do a onetime tax on repatriation of overseas cash which I think if you look at corporate America, that something between two and three trillion dollars so if you could imagine, 15% or 20% one-time tax on that and use that tax for infrastructure that would really move this country in a pretty dramatic way and it can't be too controversial but we have seen positive impact on the ground and clusters not anything negative and I think we are giving advice to these teams. Manny Korchman : And Dean a quick one for you, it look like you had a non-real estate impairment this quarter, what was that related to? Dean Shigenaga : Yeah Manny, in the quarter we recorded an impairment of $3.1 million. It really was to recognize reduction in the net book value of an investment of a privately held bio tech company. The charge was classified in other income in the income statement and in this case Manny it is clearly a valuation matter, we expect this company to continue to execute on their solid business model. This bio tech companies widely recognized as a leader in the chemical industry and providing solutions to produce chemicals from alternative feed stock. Not a traditional bio pharma tenant. So good company and still but we had to reduce the value of our investments and so that it was recognized in the third quarter. Manny Korchman : Thanks guys. Dean Shigenaga : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, our next question comes from Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Tom Catherwood : Yes, thank you good afternoon guys. Question for Tom and Steve, can you guys talk a little bit about demand pipeline that you are tracking in Cambridge and San Francisco, are there any changes that you have seen versus last quarter? Tom Andrews : This is Tom Andrews, in Cambridge, we have, we are tracking right now about 3 million square feet of tenants in the market on the lab side and another million and half square feet on the office sides, these are tenants who are looking for space in Cambridge or in the market looking for space in Cambridge, some of them are in the market already but others didn\u2019t have explorations but other are growth requirements and that some, that\u2019s been pretty steady and stable. We have got new actors coming in who weren\u2019t there a few quarters ago both outside the market companies who are looking to enter into the market and we have got new company formation going on, Joel mentioned the fund raising that is going on in venture. We announced this week was a $600 million new fund for third rocks ventures which has been one of the most prolific companies forming new almost prolific firms forming new companies and very Cambridge and San Francisco focused so we benefited from new company formation there and again still a relatively reasonable IPO markets which has enabled companies to raise capital, continue their clinical progress, commercialize new therapy. So we feel very good about the level of demand that we continue using. Steve Richardson : Tom, hi, it is Steve Richardson. Similarly there are probably three different dimensions to the demand here. One is continued very healthy and robust demand, we have been experiencing about 2 million square feet of demand and not for just the past quarter but two or three years now we don\u2019t see any drop off about half of that is credit tenants out in the market looking for additional facilities. The second piece is that we are also seeing continued sense of urgency so the early renewable discussion continue, we have had good success with that past 12 months and we see that happening in the foreseeable future and finally we have very high profile entities coming into the clusters, most recently the chance [indiscernible] initiative which is pooling together the resources that UCSF, Stanford and UC, Berkley, so actually very continued exciting developments in our clusters in San Francisco. Tom Catherwood : That\u2019s great and one follow up on that, just given the fact that there is such limited availability and new supply in both of those markets. Have you seen any trends towards tenants looking beyond the kind of the core East Cambridge area over the core mission based lost my area, in order to find the space that they need or they really just staying in those core market? Tom Andrews : This is Tom, yes. We have certainly seen some of the companies who are in the ecosystem saying all right if we are really are going to take down space and there is none here and these Cambridge right now and we need the space right now, we are going to have to look in nearby sub markets and there has been a very limited number of companies who at this point committed to that. I expect that we will see some more because there are just not at the moment and out space in these Cambridge to accommodate all the who want to be there, but as we mentioned earlier but as we mentioned earlier we have got around 170,000 square foot development in the pipeline for One Kendall Square that we hope to start construction on next year and we actually have some real perspective activity on that space right now, we get some RMPS with corresponding to. So I think we will significant level of pre-leasing there, so that\u2019s a piece of supply that is not yet in the market but is expected to be created. Peter Moglia : Hey this is Peter, I just wanted to underscore demand in this Cambridge JLL just came out with the lab space report that said that the ratio of demand to supply right now is 9 to 1. So we have never seen anything quite like that in our history and that explains the very high increases that we are seeing in rents. Steve Richardson : Tom, it is Steve again, I would say 10 stores to the latter, these companies really do want to be in these clusters. So we are seeing continued demand which is leading us to be able to push rent, we registered a 9.6% increase in the mark to market for the rental rates that we have in San Francisco. Tom Catherwood : Great, I appreciate. One more for me, just in a kind of market where we were seeing construction costs increasing substantially in some areas how was the development cost came down this quarter in the two Cambridge deliveries and is there any read through therefore your remaining active pipeline. Dean Shigenaga : No, not really I think Tom, Dean Shigenaga here. I think you just got keep in mind on a very large project for 50 and 60 an example, you have to appropriately budget your cost of completion and ended up with conservative underwriting that realize the 5% cost savings and those opportunities do exist in the portfolio and in this case on a project of that size it has a meaningful impact. Tom Catherwood : Got it, thank you. Dean Shigenaga : Thank you, Tom. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions], we will go to Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll : Yeah, thanks. Can you guys discuss how the company is picking about breaking ground on new development and redevelopment project? What you need to see in those projects and what you want to deliver some of your in process, I guess deal before you start one is that coming to play? Joel Marcus : I think we have said Mike on past calls and in our commentary if you go to page 41 that the future project page and we are very pleased it is really high quality locations that I think will attract a lot of interest but I think given the size of our pipeline and we delivering this year, next year in particular and then into early 2018 at the moment, we don\u2019t need to really to match about the future we've got, I think great sides and shovel ready access to respond to really compelling opportunities and will do that as appropriate but at the moment we are not prepared to announce anything. Michael Carroll : Okay and then can you discuss your acquisition strategy going forward? What types of deals are you looking for that are more value add opportunities that you are currently pursuing? Joel Marcus : Well as w said in the beginning of the year, we didn\u2019t know that One Kendall Square would come to market; we certainly didn\u2019t know that Torrey Ridge campus would come to market. So we underwrite, Peter and his team underwrite everything that is out there, but we typically aren\u2019t aggressive acquirers unless we see something we think is just so compelling where we saw One Kendall and we talked about that last time. I think those are situations that we kind of pull together, our analysis and our view of the market and take a stock of that but those are really kind of at hawk situations got all over and developer rather than acquirer in most cases. Peter Moglia : Hi this is Peter and I just wanted to underscore that we are still pursuing value add even when we are doing acquisitions of existing properties I mean the property at One Kendall has 30% of the space rolling over the next few years with similar mark to market. Same thing with the San Diego property, but the thing that these two acquisitions have in common as that they are very height barrier market. If you look at Torrey Pines, you look at Cambridge, there are very few owners, so when something comes up, if we don\u2019t get it, somebody else that competes with us will and so it is so we do our best to find a value and we have done it so far. Joel Marcus : But if something there was I think it is 245 First that came to market which sits right next to our [indiscernible] project at 215 at first, we looked at that and decided there was really no immediate opportunity that add value to that project and offers power and lab building. And so we didn\u2019t enter the bidding so we try to be very disciplined and how we think about deploying capital and we think we would rather equate value as peter always says rather than pay somebody else for their value. Peter Moglia : And this is Peter, misspoke it is 55% of the at least start rolling [ph] in the next couple of years at One Kendall and 30% mark to market opportunity, thank you. Michael Carroll : Great thanks. Peter Moglia : Yeah, thank you. Operator : Thank you, we will now hear from David Rodgers with Baird. David Rodgers : Yeah, Dean I don\u2019t if you want to take this or maybe Tom and others can address it, but I guess on 100 Binney and 400 Dexter, you said you are negotiating number of floors just going to the kind of type of tenants that you are talking to, there is not that but they are smaller going to be multi-core users, but as these tech tenants, lab tenants expansions are kind of flags for the portfolio. Dean Shigenaga : Well I think in 400 Dexter we have discussions with the current occupant Juno Therapeutics, they represent probably the best of breed in the cancer immunotherapy area and at 100 Binney we have several companies including big pharma and bio tech. We don\u2019t have any offers or any tech requirements looking I think either of those buildings that I know at the moment. David Rodgers : Okay great that\u2019s helpful and then maybe I don\u2019t know if this is for Steve or for Dean, it sounds like $140 million acquisition included or was it inside the entirety of the 88 Bluxome site, is that going to be pulled on as land, as a building as redevelopment, I guess how do you categorize that if it is land that go in the land number that you quoted earlier Dean and if not then I guess it doesn\u2019t matter. Dean Shigenaga : It is in our future pipeline of project that we can build on page 41 of supplemental page. Here maybe a short lease back by the club on that sight, maybe up to a year but anyways it really represents important product for the future. David Rodgers : Okay, do you maybe think of maybe [ph] your plan for the secured maturities in 2017 and one those that are up. Dean Shigenaga : Sure that\u2019s scheduled on page 49 of our supplement package; we have about 290 million in total maturities in 2017. The bulk of it is in two loans one is $76 million secured loan that is actually scheduled for repayment in December of this year and that\u2019s included in our sources and uses on our guidance disclosures and then we also have another construction loan of $210 million, that we have an opportunity to extend it but we haven\u2019t yet committed to the extension or repayment. We hope to have more color for you on Investor Day. David Rodgers : Okay, great thank you. Dean Shigenaga : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Anderson with Mizuho. Rich Anderson : Hey thanks and good afternoon. First question Joel is there any sort of opportunity beyond these sides of Manhattan that you guys are looking into so clustered there, I just wonder if there is anything where we could see more expanded platform someday just in future. Joel Marcus : Well I think we look at New York city as a great market, each of these clusters takes about a generation, 25 years to mature, San Francisco, certainly after Genome Tech [ph] was founded and certainly the Cambridge cluster really hastened by some of the early companies and then highlighted by well obviously anchored by MIT and highlighted by Novartis\u2019 move of their R&D headquarters to Cambridge. Remember we are still kind of at the end of the first decade in New York so we think there is I think great opportunities for expansion. We view that market is a great market but to some extend it is going to be driven by a lot of early company formation out of the universities, I don\u2019t think you are going to see big companies move 1000 of people into Manhattan but we have been very successful in recruiting unique units, we did a Roche, we have done at Nestle, we recruited the key oncology group at Lilly, Pfizer's Centre of Therapeutic Innovation. So we think we can bring a number of unique research boutiques to New York city and we think that these type of medical coders at best location but we clearly would look at other, I don\u2019t think we go to the west side because the cross town traffic to the east side, to the medical corridors pretty tough, I don\u2019t know but that\u2019s how we look at it, but overtime I am sure will have a number of sites there. Rich Anderson : All right, great and then speaking to Cambridge and understanding this humongous demand opportunity as mentioned 9 to 1 ratio sound s great and likely we will continue to be a fantastic market for you but 40% of your portfolio now at what point does even grey grows like that become a concentration risk for the company longer term. Joel Marcus : Yeah that\u2019s the questions that certainly come up in a number of discussion and we pay close attention to that. We think that again Cambridge is the center of the universe on the life science industry and gives us good feeling when you are adjacent within a stone throw of MIT, we feel it is really long term great real estate. We do think that you will see continued growth in the bay area, Dean has done a fabulous job of expanding San Diego I think overtime we will see more activity in Seattle and in New York City so I think you will see those five clusters continue to grow. We hope that Maryland will with new injection of funds into the NIG and FDA we hope some of our key campuses are anchored by NIH and Maryland and then overtime we hope that Ag-Tech world will grow dramatically down in North Carolina, so we feel that we will manage that risk and we do pay attention to it for sure. Rich Anderson : In case 40% your ceiling or could you go higher? What do you think as a company at this stage? Joel Marcus : Well I don\u2019t know that we have any necessary target but I think as we look at capital allocation each year will pay close attention to that to make sure we don\u2019t have an undue risk in anything or market but we feel good about where we are and what is in the pipeline and I mean if you look at page 41 for example which I just alluded to we have got significant development opportunities in San Francisco obviously New York, San Diego and Seattle to name a few so I think we are pretty well balance in that regard. Rich Anderson : Okay, fair enough and then maybe final question for Dean, and more of a modeling thing, you raised same store by 50 basis points but FFO sort of reiterated. Was there an offset there or just not enough too much little bit of rounding or didn\u2019t move the needle at the FFO line. Dean Shigenaga : Two things to consider there Rich, one, as I mentioned the forward equity sale agreements actually brought in some additional shares into third quarter weighted average share count of about 751,000 shares, that\u2019s the equivalent of about $0.01 dilution to the quarter but importantly lot of leasing activity that we have executed on this year is capturing early renewals. As an example, the top six or so leases executed in the third quarter, none of the explorations related to 2016, most of it was 2017 or later, in fact two of the six went out to \u201821 and \u201822, so most of the upside in that quarter activity will be captures by mid \u201817. So it doesn\u2019t drop to a direct FFO impact for the third and fourth quarter. But again I think, keep in my mind the fundamentals remains solid, limited supply of Class A space and really strong demand and we\u2019re in a pretty sweet spot as we look forward. Rich Anderson : Okay, fair enough. Thank you. Joel Marcus : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And Mr. Marcus with no additional questions, I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to you for additional or closing remarks. Okay. Well, thank you very much for your time. We appreciate that. We\u2019ll look forward to talking to you in the early February timeframe for fourth quarter and year-end results. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference, thank you all, again for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz. Please go ahead. Paula Schwartz : Thank you and good afternoon everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The Company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the Company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I now would like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus. Please go ahead. Joel Marcus : Thank you, Paula and welcome everybody to the fourth quarter and year-end 2016 earnings call. With us today is Dean Shigenaga, Tom Andrews, Steve Richardson, Peter Moglia, Dan Ryan and John Cunningham. First of all congratulations to the entire Alexandria family on a truly stellar 2016 by all financial and operating metrics and executed with transparency, integrity and responsibility, we're very proud of our accomplishments. Our primary mission as you know is provide mission critical infrastructure in our collaborative and innovative urban campuses and capital to help solve disease and hunger. Looking forward to 2017, we will celebrate our 20th anniversary as a New York Stock Exchange listed company and very proud of you - that if you had invested $10,000 in ARE at the IPO in May of 1997, you'd be worth a whopping $10,980,000 with a 1098% total return far outpacing the RMZ at 524%, Berkshire at 468%, S&P 500 at 280% and NASDAQ at 282%, a track record we\u2019re all very proud of. I'm going to put my macro comments at the end, but I want to just highlight a few things in the quarter and year-end and Dean will do the same. As you know our revenues and earnings grew approximately 9%. We had a very strong fourth quarter and year - and full-year leasing despite minimal lease expirations and cash rents up about 12%. The fourth quarter was heavily and positively influenced by leasing in Cambridge. Same property results up strongly at about 6% and $90 million plus of NOI growth from our highly leased development pipeline. Operating margins ticked up and remain very strong. Occupancy stayed pretty steady. And we continue to have strong value-add acquisitions in Cambridge and San Diego during the year. We successfully exited India. Our rental revenues from investment grade tenants about 49% today. Dean will talk about the balance sheet which we're very proud of moving in a very strong and flexible direction. We have minimal exposure to interest rate increases due to the very low variable rate debt as well. As we look at 2017, 2017 is shaping up to be truly very strong year and we'll give updates obviously quarterly and I'm sure we'll have quite a few both as the internal and external growth as you know from the press release and supplement we closed on 88 Bluxome in the San Francisco South of Market sub-market and look forward to a highly successful future project there. We executed lease extensions which Dean will talk about with Novartis well in advance of their explorations at 100 and 200 Tech Square with strong rental rate growth. We anticipate onboarding over $100 million of NOI in 2017 from our highly lease development pipeline. We continue into 2017 and expect it to continue at a high record occupancy and strong continuing demand. The macro demand again is exhibited by limited supply continuing strong demand as I said and favorable rental rate increase trends and strong asset valuations as well. The underlying health of the tenant base is very good. The life science drivers continue to be very positive including positive government support, increased medical innovation, continued significant R&D investment and the continued move to externalization of R&D by big pharma to smaller companies. If you look at page 38 of the supplement, the 2017 deliveries include 100 Binney, our anchor tenant with Bristol Myers. We've certainly have a hard time getting another large tenant in there because the building is very now identified with Bristol Myers. So we've moved now to a floor by floor leasing approach and expect to have probably three, four floors leased over the next quarter or two. 510 Townsend, we're on target to deliver to strike. 505 Brannan Street on target to deliver this year [indiscernible] the spectrum on target to deliver to vertex and similarly with 400 Dexter to Juno. Page 39 of the supplement are probably nearest term starts as we gain good leasing traction will be 161 First Street in Cambridge which is part of our Binney corridor arrangement with the city for residential, 399 Binney at One Kendall Square. East Grand South San Francisco beyond the Merck building, a development start potentially in Seattle and 9800 Medical Center in Maryland where we've seen a significant tick up in demand particularly at the governmental level. Since Investor Day as many of you know the 21st Century Cures Act was signed into law on December 13 providing the NIH with almost $5 billion over a ten-year period of increased funding and the FDA about $0.5 billion as well. Let me move to a couple of macro comments and one would be the ACA, the Affordable Care Act, we expect a five-step process to take all of 2017. Number one would be a budget resolution giving congressional committees the authority to use the budget reconciliation process for ACA changes, I guess people refer to this as the nuclear option. Continuing, number two, executive orders on parts on ACA. Number three would be repeal. Number four would be replace including to the extent that it is defined a brand of universal coverage and certainly preexisting condition coverage. And then number five would be altering the taxes and other pay-fors including things like the Cadillac tax. The second macro item I'd like to focus on or a third maybe would be the pricing of medicines and therapies. And as many of you know who watch television today or reading both social media and the press, there was a meeting at the White House among the President and a number of CEOs from bio-pharma and I think there were a number of key messages from that meeting. Certainly the intent to reduce FDA regulations and timelines for approvals. Although the FDA over recent years has done I thought a pretty excellent job. Lower taxes and repatriation which for the life science industry would mean something in the range of $100 billion to $150 billion of cash brought back, easing of constraints on small innovative biotech companies, stimulation of innovation, a desire to bring operations back to the US and increase hiring in the United States both for R&D and manufacturing. And when you get to pricing, it was pretty clear that the President did not state or say that Medicare was going to that the law would be - he would seek change to the law to have Medicare set prices. There's a long history behind that the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 which established Medicare Part D specifically imposed a ban on negotiation of drug pricing by the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the reason that was because they did not want governmentally mandated price controls. There still is as part of Medicare Part D large private insurers which do negotiate drug prices. And even if a ban were repealed and they in fact did negotiate, the government must cover all drugs and fix protected classes which include and oftentimes expensive treatment such as the areas of cancer, autoimmune neurodegenerative disease, psychiatric conditions and a few others. And recently the Congressional Budget Office said that amending the Non-Interference clause meaning allowing Medicare to go and negotiate with the manufacturers would have a negligible effect on the federal drug spending. And they would not be able to leverage deeper discounts for drugs than risk bearing private plans. So I think it seems like that may not be in the cards and that\u2019s a good sign. The President did clearly call per price lowering without ruining margins is the goal. And he also mused about higher prices in the US versus overseas and that really brings up a trade issue. And as most of us there are the R&D driven firms versus the abusive firms and the abusive firms have gotten about 95% of the [indiscernible]. And a good example of I think responsible and we hope it's a throwback to the past, Merck recently released a pricing action transparency report last Friday and it showed over the last six or seven years the average yearly price increase of Merck medicines or therapies was actually less than 10%. They also did note that the average discount grew from something like 27% in 2010 to almost 41% in 2016. So pretty interesting history and a lot to be unfolding over the year and coming quarters here in 2017. I think the market has reacted favorably to that meeting and I think we're pleased with that. So without further ado let me turn it over to Dean for additional color on the quarter and the year. Dean Shigenaga : Thank Joel, Dean Shigenaga here, good afternoon everyone. Alexandria is very pleased to report another extremely successful year and consistent execution of our business model resulting in very strong operating and financial performance. Total revenues were up 9.3% to $922 million. Net operating income was up 10.5% to $643 million. During the past three years, we have generated tremendous growth and value for our stakeholders. FFO per share growth was 25%, consensus NAV growth was 61% and common stock dividend growth was 23%. Therefore important topics I will cover today, first, we have very solid market fundamentals continuing in our key urban centers of innovation. Second, we have solid internal growth consisting of stable high quality net operating income from a REIT industry leading tenant roster and an asset base of Class A properties located in urban centers of innovation. Third, we have solid external growth through development and redevelopment of new Class A properties to meet the demand from some of the most innovative entities producing new and transformative therapies and solutions to improve quality of life. And fourth, we have and we will continue to maintain a solid and flexible balance sheet with an important strategic goal of improvement in our credit profile and long-term cost to capital. We remain in a unique position within the REIT sector today with positive attributes in each of these three or four areas that allows our best-in-class team to deliver consistent growth in earnings, cash flows and common stock dividends. First, market fundamentals remain strong in our dynamic urban centers of innovation today including Greater Boston, San Francisco, San Diego and Seattle. Our key submarkets today generally have strong demand and very limited supply of Class A space and limited capacity for developers to build new properties. We continue to deliver solid internal growth also known as our same property net operating income growth. Our average same property NOI growth has outperformed the average of traditional office REITs over ten years. Solid market fundamentals and life science demand combined with our favorable lease structure continues to drive strong internal growth outlook. For 2017, our cash same property net operating income growth guidance is 5.5% to 7.5%. Takeda has recently announced the acquisition of Ariad Pharmaceuticals. This represents a huge win for both Ariad and Alexandria as we will benefit with an enhancement of the credit profile of Takeda and it will add Takeda to our industry leading tenant roster. Subsequent to year end, our team executed a ten-year lease extension with Novartis, one of our top five tenants consisting of 47,255 rentable square feet at 200 and 100 Technology Square in Cambridge respectfully. Rental rate growth on average for these two leases were up 42% and 20% on a cash basis and will be reported in our leasing activity for the first quarter of 2017. We're off to a very strong start with rental rate growth on leasing activity for the year. Leasing volume however will likely be light due to the limited contractual lease expirations of 985,000 rentable square feet for the year and our highly lease development of new class A properties. As a landlord of choice our team is working diligently to build inspiring real estate solutions to drive collaboration and innovation for some of the top biopharma entities focused on making life better for people throughout the world. During 2016, we completed ten new Class A properties. These properties were on average 96% leased and deliveries in 2016 will generate 92 million of incremental annual net operating income. This NOI exceeded our original NOI forecast by almost 15 million or 20% compared to the forecast that was provided this time last year. The significant beat relative to our original forecast is primarily related to the delivery of the site at 1455 and 1515 Third Street to Uber in November of 2016. Our best in class team continues to execute on our current pipeline consisting of nine new Class A properties, 1.9 million rentable square feet. That is 95% leased or negotiating and will generate significant growth in net operating income and cash flows. Let me provide a few very important comments regarding net asset value and cash flows. Contractual rental payments related to the recently completed developments at 75/125 Binney Street and 50 and 60 Binney Street, we have significant steps in cash rents commencing on April 1 of 2017 as free rent periods end. Cash rents of these two properties will increase significantly by 10 million per quarter or 40 million on an annual basis. As of April 1 of \u201917, 100% of the cash rents will be in place at 75/125 Binney Street and approximately 50% of the cash rents will be in place at 50 and 60 Binney Street. Let me also briefly comment on the new deal with Uber. Effective in November of 2016, we entered into a 75-year ground lease for the land at 1455, 1515 Third Street and we also leased Uber the existing parking garage. These leases commenced immediately in November. Our total investment in the real estate now is about 155 million and our initial yields are 14.4% and 7% on a cash basis. Cash rents will commence in November of 2017 for the ground lease. The initial 15 years of the ground lease provide for 3% annual rent escalations and then annual escalation at CPI with a minimum of 1.5%. NAV models should consider a positive adjustment to pick up the value of this transaction. Cash NOI today is zero and very nominal in the first quarter of \u201917 as the commencement of the parking garage lease. And therefore typical NAV models based on cash NOI will accidentally overlook the value of this transaction. Our balance sheet and credit metrics remain very strong today. By the end of this year we are projecting leverage at or below six times both on a net debt and net debt plus preferred to EBITDA and our fixed charge coverage ratio will also be very strong a greater than four times. We have no debt maturities in 2017, limited maturities in 2018 and expect to reduce outstanding term loan balances. 200 million of the 2019 term loan maturity will be repaid in 2017 and another 200 million of this maturity will be repaid in early 2018. Pricing of long-term fixed rate unsecured notes for ARE in recent months have been very solid and range from slightly below 4% to about 4% reflecting favorable tightening of spreads over ten-year treasuries offsetting the increase in ten-year treasuries. Remember our issuance of ten-year unsecured notes in June of 2016 was at a coupon of 3.95%. Our strategy for funding growth has been consistently executed year to year, we will continue to focus on investing significant cash flows from operations after dividends, fund a significant component of construction with long-term fixed rate debt on a leverage neutral basis with significant growth and EBITDA, continue to seek opportunities to reinvest capital from selected real estate sales, and remain very disciplined with the use of common equity. Our goal is to continue to remain disciplined in funding our business in a manner that allows us to drive solid growth in per share earnings and at net asset value and growth in our common stock dividend per share. We provided updated guidance for 2017 as detailed on Page 6 of our supplemental package. We updated the upper end of our range for uses of capital to reflect the retirement of the remaining outstanding balance of our Series E preferred stock aggregating about $87 million today, plus any premium necessary to retire the securities. More importantly, our guidance for 2017 reflects continued consistent execution by our best-in-class team, continued strength of our market fundamentals, solid internal growth, solid external growth through development of new Class A buildings and continued discipline allocation of capital and management of our balance sheet. Thank you. And I'll turn it back to Joel. Joel Marcus : Thank you. And operator we could open it up for Q&A kindly. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nick Yulico of UBS. Please go ahead. Nick Yulico : Couple of questions, first on the same store cash NOI growth guidance for this year of 5.5%, 7.5%. Can you go through some of the building blocks of how you get to that level because it seems a little high when considering that your occupancy is going to be either flat or down and your re-leasing spreads are less than 10%. Joel Marcus : Dean? Dean Shigenaga : Nick, it\u2019s Dean here. Two ways to think about this, let me talk a little bit more generally about what I see both for \u201816 and \u201817. I think fundamentally as you know our annual steps or structural rent escalations average about 3% and so there's always the baseline for cash same property performance. What you have at least in \u201916 I think we've got about 1% growth in same property performance with some occupancy gains. We do have opportunities to still gain occupancy in the same property pool. And so you can still get about 1% from that. And I think you're driving about 2% at least over the two years in that general range from mark to markets on leasing activity and as you know the mark to markets have been pretty robust. And where we're getting real upside I think is on the early renewals. But what you probably also have embedded in 2017 is some benefit from cash coming in as concessions burn off. Keep in mind redevelopment and development projects are excluded from same property results until the asset is in service for both comparative periods for the entirety of the period. But occasionally as a concession burns off during that period you might have a slight benefit. I don't have the details right in front of me, Nick, to go through the exact build up to the 7.5%. But we are ahead of our ten-year average which is about 5%, so it is a very strong same property year for 2017. Nick Yulico : And then I guess going back to the two Binney projects you mentioned with the cash NOI commencing. Are either of those projects being added to the same-store pool this year? Dean Shigenaga : Yes, 75/125 Binney Street is because it's been in service for the comparative period but 50 and 60 Binney was just delivered so that it\u2019s excluded from same property performance. Nick Yulico : And if I go back to - you had the footnote in the supplemental about 20 million of annual cash NOI, annualized cash NOI and it commences I guess in April. So you get 75% of that in 2017. That's about $15 million off your 2016 cash same-store NOI base, which was 497 million. That's about 3% benefit right there for your same-store alone. Is that - am I right in the way I'm calculating that? Dean Shigenaga : You\u2019re right in that general calculation, Nick, I\u2019d say the one thing that probably offsets that benefit this year is related to the move out of Lilly space at 10300 as we move Lilly from 10300 to 10290 in the brand new redevelopment we delivered to them. So we do expect a little downtime as we transition Lilly's former space at 10300 to re-tenant that space. Nick Yulico : Just last question for you, Joel. Can you talk about the ATM usage in the fourth quarter and whether it seems like it might have been done actually prior to the election and what was sort of your thinking on the ATM in the fourth quarter? Dean Shigenaga : Sure, Dean here again Nick. I would say the capital raise in the ATM program was always anticipated in the previously disclosed guidance assumptions that we have provided. So I would say that we pretty much hit our expectations in the capital raise for the program. Operator : Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Jamie Feldman : Joel, I was hoping you could give some more thought to - you'd mentioned a pick-up in demand in suburban Maryland, just kind of what you're seeing post election in terms of demand from the government, government type tenants in that region and then also as you're thinking about the Bay Area, whether tech has slowed or picked up versus life science given some of the things we're hearing about these activity. Joel Marcus : So let me - thanks Jamie, let me give you a little bit of thought on, we did issue a press release last week on Maryland. We've had pretty good success maybe excellent success over the last two years in leasing there and for a long time maybe the better part of a decade since the Internet bubble Maryland was really pretty languishing and we were unsure we lightened up, we certainly recycled assets out of that market. But over the last two years, we've seen a noticeable change part of that is a lack of new supply or even existing supply which is a good. Number of companies starting to grow up and take more space and certainly with the infusion of new money into the NIH not only the 21st Century Cures but there was an appropriation over the last year that injected another 2 to 3 billion. We're certainly seeing a number of government requirement, so we've gone from pretty negative to a more positive view on that submarket. And Steve, you want to comment on tech? Steve Richardson : Sure. Jamie, hi it\u2019s Steve. Certainly on the lab side we continue to see steady demand, we're tracking about 2.4 million square feet which is roughly the same that we were tracking last year. So steady demand and that's against the backdrop of really an increased tightening in the market and we've got really zero availability in Mission Bay, down to 3.5% availability versus 7.9% a year ago in South San Francisco and 0.9% availability in the peninsula compared to 2.3% a year ago. So you've got very steady demand on the life science side with a tightening market availability certainly. The tech demand is somewhat similar, we're tracking about 2.9 million square feet now that's roughly in the range of the 3-plus million square feet that we've been tracking in San Francisco for the past year or two. And then down on the peninsula a similar story of about 4.5 million square feet tracking, which is within 5% of what we've been tracking the last year or two. So demand stays very healthy both on the lab and tech side and I think particularly healthy given the various supply constraints on the lab side. Jamie Feldman : I guess going back to the ATM usage, did you guys debate at all changing your mix of capital needs through dispositions versus equity as you were thinking about your guidance going forward? Or how do you think about that balance given you've raised so much equity so far? Dean Shigenaga : Jamie, it\u2019s Dean here again. I'd say our programs have been pretty consistent over a number of years now and we actually want to continue to utilize selective asset sales as appropriate whether that it is a core asset with a nice cap - tight cap rate on it or whether it's a non-core asset that\u2019s just appropriate to put in the portfolio. So we'll continue to look at our options. I think in any given environment we're always evaluating different debt. And I'll call it the equity type capital whether it's asset sales, real estate assets sales or common equity and just remain very disciplined in trying to find the right balance of disciplined and overall cost of capital to fund these outstanding really high quality development projects. Great tenancy, great cash flows really well located real estate and so I think we've been very prudent over the years and will continue to act in that same manner. Jamie Feldman : And then just finally we know Pfizer is looking for space in New York. Is Alexandria Center on the list? I think it's mostly an office usage but is that something you guys would consider? Joel Marcus : I don\u2019t know whether we\u2019re on the list or not but my guess is there's a corporate office headquarters and one would imagine they would be looking in for additional office kinds of developments. And they're highly cost conscious on corporate HQ. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Carroll of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Michael Carroll : Yeah. Thanks. Can you just provide some details surrounding what led up to the recent transaction with Uber? Who approached to and what's the main reason ARE wanted to do that deal? Did you just want to reduce your concentration to the market? Joel Marcus : So maybe Dean, you can start and Steve wants to add to that. Dean Shigenaga : Oh, I\u2019ll let Steve chime in. Steve Richardson : Michael, hi, it\u2019s Steve. Yeah. It really evolved over time as Uber became more and more engaged in the design process and as time went by and the additional enhancements they wanted to add to the shell, I think it became apparent to both parties and we're still working very closely together in a partnership. We're managing the entire construction of the facility and we expect to manage the facility once it's delivered as well, but as far as the restructuring, we stepped back and said really, we both had Paramount objectives that we wanted to meet. One was, their continued design and investment in the shell and so this structure really gets to that goal certainly very well, and at the same time, we wanted certainty of delivery and to really resolve our investment in the project. We had been kept all along through the investment in the project. So what we've ended up with is a structure that met both parties\u2019 objectives long term, the economics remained identical, perhaps, they were enhanced a bit with the longer term ground lease there, but I think it's been a great outcome that everybody's very pleased with. Michael Carroll : Okay. And now what type, I mean I'm assuming the company is going to be earning some type of development fee, I mean, how close are you going to be helping them design that process? Steve Richardson : We are absolutely their development partner and yes, we are earning a development fee. Michael Carroll : Okay, great. And then looking at the sup, I know it says the company has about 1.7 million square feet of anticipated near term development starts, are those all 2017 events? I mean, how do you define near term? Joel Marcus : Yeah. So I think Mike when I went through my prepared comments, I tried to give some context to the ones we think could be more near term. I'm not sure we're prepared to give you a start date or year or time, but I indicated that 161 First Street which has to go resi, we are actually going to be moving out commercial tenants as part of our development agreement with Cambridge will be front and center, 399 Binney, we\u2019re already responding to proposals for that. So that we see as a fairly near term. We are looking at East Grand in South San Francisco, an additional start there as we have pretty high demand in that market. Similarly in Seattle and Maryland, but we'll keep you posted on when those may happen. Michael Carroll : Okay. Great. And then finally, John, I know you have just said historically that the key driver for life science real estate demand is the pace of FDA drug approvals, which has been strong, but there was a drop off last year. Has or will this impact tenant demand? John Cunningham : Yeah. I don't think I ever said it was, I don't know, maybe a key, not the key, but yeah, it\u2019s an important key for those companies that are before the agency and as you may or may not know, the reason for the dip was there were a bunch of rejections this year and there are also I think five approvals that actually got accelerated into 2016, I'm sorry 2015 that would have otherwise been in 2016, but I think overall, the year was a pretty good year and I think we garnered out of the 22 approvals I think we had almost 75% were ARE clients. So we feel pretty good about that and hard to say where the FDA goes from here. The president indicated that he has his APEC and he's looking to streamline timeframes and approaches. So who knows? I mean it can only get faster it looks like at this point. Operator : Our next question comes from Emmanuel Korchman of Citi. Please go ahead. Emmanuel Korchman : Hi, everyone. Good afternoon. Joel, just given sort of the intensity of things happening in Washington and like you said, we've got a lot of news flow coming at us today, how are tenants approaching their decisions differently than maybe they were a couple of months ago or maybe even a couple of years ago. Is it inspiring them to move more quickly, less quickly, are they waiting to hear something specific, just give us a flavor as to how those discussions are going? Joel Marcus : Yeah. That's a really interesting question and it is I think very company specific. Where companies are transacting matters and need additional space or they just got an approval on a big drug and they're needing to ramp up the infrastructure for that launch, they move ahead. I think if somebody is just sitting back and looking at what's going to happen for example as I mentioned, there's about $100 billion to $150 billion of overseas cash, that's a pretty telling amount and if all or part of that was able to be brought back, I think that will influence people pretty dramatically to do things, but I don't think people are ready to spend that money yet, but we still see in each of the markets, we're near all-time highs in overall occupancy and demands have stayed very strong. You can just see by Novartis re-upping a year ahead of time or more, Merck initiating a new development. We see quite a number of things in the queue. So I don't think despite the frenetic pace of what the administration is doing compared to past administrations, this is a business person without political experience. So it's a different environment. I think companies are pretty much going about their business, but I do think that those of you saw the roundtable discussion today, virtually every CEO who was in the room was talking about hiring more people, expanding in the US and clearly the President was encouraging them to do so. So we think that all augurs pretty favorably. The only downside will be is, the trade issue because obviously that's one of those things that people have to keep in mind. This is a worldwide market and it's important. Europe is an important market, even though, it's many markets and Japan is an important market as well as a burgeoning China. So we will see, but overall, pretty positive. Emmanuel Korchman : Great. And then gain on the impairments in 4Q, I guess you attributed part of that to the India exit, but it seems like it's probably more than just India, it\u2019s probably other markets as well. Is that a correct lead and then maybe you can give us an update on timing to get out of your other global markets you talked about exiting? Steve Richardson : Yeah. I think there was a small amount in the fourth quarter, Manny, related to domestic or US real estate transactions, including some costs we expensed related to [indiscernible]. But at the end of the day, we're beyond and out of India now, I think which is a huge positive in being able to reinvest that capital and we're working our way through two remaining assets that we own in China and stay tuned. I don't want to try to forecast on stuff we look to monetize in Asia, because timing is more difficult to predict than it is in the US, but we are working on that. Emmanuel Korchman : Right. And last question for me. It looks like the NOI expectations from development projects in 2017 is higher now than it was back in November at Investor Day. Can you just talk about what projects are either moves or accelerated to get that number sort of up in the presentation provided? Dean Shigenaga : Yes. So Manny, on the, I think this is in reference to the incremental NOI disclosed that we expected for 2017 has grown roughly 10 plus million dollars. I don't have the exact number right in front of me, Manny. We were at the upper end of our range at Investor Day as there were still some moving pieces and there still are today. We do still have some space that we need to resolve on the lease-up, but it\u2019s very little. And we also moved up a piece of 400 Dexter into 2017 as well. All in all, fairly small adjustments, it\u2019s a big number overall, because you're talking $100 million, but I think we move the number about maybe 10%. Operator : Our next question comes from Rich Anderson of Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Rich Anderson : Thanks and good afternoon. So Dean, gas rental revenue went up about $21 million third quarter to fourth quarter. Is that entirely, looking at development placement service for projects placement service, plus the Uber deal, does that explain all that gap path quarter-over-quarter? Dean Shigenaga : The biggest delivery would have been 15, 60 Binney which was delivered literally at the end of the third quarter. I'm starting to, I think the second largest delivery was Uber and that transaction. We also had the acquisitions close, which drove top line revenue and I think we also had enough parcel pick up possibly until another project at San Diego 10. All right. But those are the big, those are the big deliveries, Rich. Rich Anderson : There is nothing funny. I mean, not funny, but I mean these are just investments, there's nothing else in that that quarterly increase in GAAP revenue that we should be backing out or not thinking of as recurring? Dean Shigenaga : No, not at all, Rich. Rich Anderson : On the topic of CapEx, you mentioned relatively light in terms of lease expirations this year, high levels of occupancy, should we assume that your recurring CapEx number will be significantly down, I know these were dramatic, but significantly down versus 2016? Dean Shigenaga : It's really dependent, Rich, but I guess if you had to say apples-to-apples, right now, I would say would be down just because volume could be down from roughly 3 million square feet for 2016, but it should remain fairly consistent on a square footage basis for any lease renewals and release in a space. Those numbers, Rich, are fairly, they're fairly small to start with. So, it probably doesn't beg too much. Rich Anderson : But what could move that would be early lease renewal activities, tacking stuff in \u201918 and so on, which could temporarily boost up CapEx. Is that the right way to think about it, but for now, the number apples-to-apples might be lower? Dean Shigenaga : Yeah. But any upside on early renewals, Rich, I think to the extent you have a little CapEx with recapturing a significant mark-to-market, I think it's a home run. Rich Anderson : Yeah. Sure. Okay. Next, what is the office to lab conversion potential at One Kendall? Tom Andrews : Yeah. This is Tom Andrews, Rich. It\u2019s relatively modest office space in that complex and a little bit more than lab space currently on a percentage basis, but there are a number of -- there are several suites within the complex that we're evaluating for potential conversion when leases burn off. Rich Anderson : Okay. And last question, Takeda and Ariad, is there any kind of issue about a change in the amount of space that area would need. I guess, the credit enhancement, but what about just the pure need for square footage in the future? Tom Andrews : Yeah. This is Tom once again. We don't have that answer yet. It is encouraging to know that Takeda was out in the market looking for additional space prior to the announcement of the Ariad deal, which suggests that their existing campus in Cambridge is full and the Ariad acquisition may help them control space if they actually need it. Operator : Our next question comes from Sheila McGrath of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Sheila McGrath : Yes. Joel, on the Novartis extension, did they downsize some of that Novartis square footage in another location and was there any free rent or TI? And last question, was that early renewal already factored into your 2017 same store NOI guidance? Joel Marcus : Yeah. We\u2019ll come back to that. Let me ask Tom to come in on these first two questions. Tom Andrews : Novartis had been leasing up until a couple of years ago, about 425,000 square feet at the Tech Square Campus. Upon completion of this extension, I believe that about third, about 320,000 square feet. So they have downsized a little bit in the campus as you're probably aware, they've added their own campus down the street of about 500,000 square feet. So pretty modest downsizing within our campus. That space has all been re-leased to others at good rent bumps. There was no free rent offered and the TI allowance associated with was very modest. Joel Marcus : So Dean, you could comment on the same-store? Dean Shigenaga : Yeah. So Sheila, you probably were looking at for input on insight into two areas, one, same store and leasing. I would say Novartis in that early renewal was very significant. It was a key component of our assumption and I would say that we were cautious as we prepared guidance as well as updating guidance for this year. We held things firm where they were previously at Investor Day. So, Novartis puts us in a great position to perform well, both on same-store and leasing and hopefully as we make our way through the year, there's some upside as we attack other early renewals. Sheila McGrath : Okay, great. And just on 88 Bluxome, is that, I think you mentioned in the supplement that it's on a short term lease, how should we think about that in terms of, is that five years out, seven years out, how should we think about that say in terms of development timing? Joel Marcus : Yeah. Much sooner, but Steve, you can talk about the 2 in 2. Steve Richardson : Sure. Sheila, hi, it's Steve. We are actively pursuing entitlements and we have been for a while now. So as you've seen in the supplement, we've got design drawings. We've been into the city for a number of months. We have a really rich set of community benefits, so we think we're very well positioned. So we'll look over the next year or two for entitlements and have a sublease or a leaseback during that time. If we need to extend, we can go ahead and extend, but I think right now, we're thinking of a one to two your horizon. Sheila McGrath : Okay. And last question, Joel, you mentioned potentially a new start in South San Francisco. I was wondering has the Merck built-to-suit prompted more interest in that location and if you could remind us, how much remaining entitlement you have there? Joel Marcus : Yeah. So Steve, if you want to take it, but the answer is yes. Steve Richardson : Yes. Again Sheila, that market overall is very healthy. We've just got about a 3.5% vacancy and certainly with Merck taking our next to last large parcel, we are focused intently now on the 279 East Grand parcel. We've seen other leases transacted there as well, 5 Prime sits about 115,000 feet, and possible foods about 60,000 feet and about three other tenants taking 30,000 feet just in the past quarter here. So it's a very healthy market and we're just positioning ourselves to be absolutely ready for an anchor tenant and having initial conversations with a couple of different groups. Operator : Our next question comes from Tom Catherwood of BTIG. Please go ahead. Tom Catherwood : Thank you. Good afternoon everybody. Following up on the South San Francisco comments, Steve, hearing your thoughts on obviously low vacancy rates there and the potential development site, it looks like you sold off though one of your development sites at 560 Eccles. This had been kind of in your key near term starts previously. What was the change in strategy there that made you want to get rid of it now? Steve Richardson : Hi, Don. It\u2019s Steve again. Yeah, this was a parcel that was a little bit unique. It was part of an assemblage effort we had a number of years ago. So you had very challenging access through an easement along a large warehouse facility that ultimately will stay a large warehouse for a long period of time. There was significant site work that would have need to have been completed and it was a little bit of a one-off as a standalone parcel. So given the other activity, we certainly had in South San Francisco, we thought it made good sense to go ahead and recycle that capital and put it into projects like 213 East Grand that are well underway. Tom Catherwood : Got it. Also saw the note in there about looking forward to a condo sale at I believe it's 360 Longwood, can you talk a little bit about that detail, including how the value is set and how the management of that asset would work going forward? Tom Andrews : Yeah. Hi, Tom, this is Tom Andrews. So that condo sale came out as a result of a fixed price option that was negotiated back in 2011 when we had signed the anchor lease with Dana-Farber Cancer Institute for the Longwood center development at 360 Longwood. Recall that we were a 27.5% partner with two other investors in that development. And so the price, which is about $1,150 a square foot was, as I said, a fixed price option that was really integral to getting the anchor lease signed. I would note that the company has no other significant fixed price options in its entire portfolio. So you won\u2019t see this type of sale again. And we're not planning on doing any future fixed price options. It was kind of a situation when you deal with an institution like Dana-Farber in a market like Longwood, it was really integral for the deal and so they are getting a price, which is really below what we consider to be market there. Tom Catherwood : Got it. I appreciate that. And final one for me, Tom, sticking in Cambridge, on One Kendall Square. Obviously there's a significant amount of roll coming over the next two to three years. Is there any expectation that you could get back any large blocks of space there and is there any expectation that you could maybe like get that with Novartis, pull some of those leases forward into 2017? Tom Andrews : Yes. I mean, we're working towards those goals. You might have seen an announcement that Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, which is a largest tenant in the complex has sold a couple of marketed oncology products to Ipsen, which is a French kind of mid-size pharmaceutical company with about $6.5 billion market cap. They sold a couple of assets to them and Ipsen is going to sublease some space from them, Merrimack now with a lot of capital behind it is going to become a clinical stage biotech company with a much smaller headcount requirement. So there is a real opportunity there to potentially recover some of their space and also do term extensions with both Ipsen and Merrimack. So it's a little early to predict how that's going to come out, because there are a lot of moving parts associated with it, but we're definitely working towards trying to accelerate some of the potential rent mark-to-markets in that complex. Operator : Our next question comes from Dave Rodgers of Baird. Please go ahead. Dave Rodgers : Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. I guess on the asset sales and potential common equity as part of your guidance, can you talk about what assets or the volume of assets that you might be in the market with today in terms of getting toward that goal for the year? Tom Andrews : I don't think we want to identify anything at this point, Dave, publicly. Dave Rodgers : Yeah. And in terms of, are you actively marketing or is this something and I know there's two categories right, it's non-core kind of a core plus that you can sell at really good prices. And I can understand not identifying the assets. I guess trying to get a sense of what you prefer today relative to kind of your cost of capital, if there's kind of an advantage going one direction to the other? Dean Shigenaga : Dave, I think, stay tuned as we make our way through white collar as we can. Dave Rodgers : Okay. Thanks. And maybe Tom, just two questions in Cambridge, I think there were some comments about 399 Binney and maybe there's some activity about a built-to-suit or some development there. Is that tech, is that more biotech, how does that fit into the Cambridge landscape and I guess a similar question for the remaining availability at 100 Binney? Tom Andrews : At 399 Binney, which is a development side at One Kendall Square, we're designing that to go either way office or laboratory space. We've had discussions with both types of tenants, but nothing to report yet in terms of a deal that's imminent. With respect to 100 Binney, that that too is designed to be either lab or office space as you know, Bristol-Myers anchors that building with lab space, but we're actually actively talking to a tech tenant about a full floor and possibly two floors of the remaining spaces available there. Dave Rodgers : And then maybe last Joel, just rounding up with you, of the space that you talked about maybe commencing this year and I don't know if this is asset, I would apologize, what percentage of that is lab versus tech? Joel Marcus : Well, I didn\u2019t say anything about anything starting this year. I said, as a definitive, I said that we were, we believe that as we gain leasing traction, certain projects could come to the top of the list and I named five of those, particularly 161 First, which will be because it's resi, but yeah, I don't think we would want to speculate, but other than to say what Tom said about 399 East Grand is likely lab, Seattle could be either and 9800 medical center in Rockville would be lab. Operator : Our next question comes from Jed Reagan of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. Jed Reagan : Hi. Good afternoon, guys. A lot of my questions have been asked. I'm sorry if I missed this, but have you seen any evidence of cap rates changing for lab product in your markets or financing getting tougher for buyers? And I'm thinking especially on sort of the lower quality end of the spectrum? Peter Moglia : Yeah. Jed, there has only been a couple of trades from quarter-to-quarter that was the dry dock building and Seaport in Boston, a fairly large many tenant multi-tenant building, very low credit. I believe it's also on a ground lease traded at about 5.5 cap rate. That felt very normal to us when we saw that data. And then there was a trade in Maryland where BMR sold a building on Shady Grove Road to a investor that is placing CalPERS money. That was at 7.0 cap rate, actually right on the dot where Green Street looks at or how Greet Street values Rockville. So, so far, there has not been any more contraction nor any expansion in laboratory cap rates that we can see. Jed Reagan : Okay. And any ebbs and flows that you guys have been able to discern in terms of bidding tends or maybe new buyers in the hopper, especially maybe overseas investors? Joel Marcus : Well, Peter, go ahead and then I could come. Peter Moglia : Well I do know that, we\u2019re pinged often by people with ideas about or clients that would love to get exposed to our product type that include foreign entities, but as we've said, we're really not ready to disclose any plans about asset sales, but I would say we went pretty thoroughly through it at Investor Day. There is definitely a cadre of over 50 institutional investors that have participated in the bidding tends or have actually purchased things. Certainly, on the [indiscernible] deal, I believe that we had at least 16 to 20 initial bitters that was whittled down to about a final 8. All very high quality investors, obviously MIT ended up purchasing that. But, yeah, there's no change. Again, there's probably just like the cap rate answer, there's been no major expansion of that pool that we know of yet, but we don't believe there's any contraction either. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Seeing no further questions, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks. Joel Marcus : Thank you, everybody. We're about one hour in and we appreciate your attention. Look forward to talking to you on first quarter call. Thank you again. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz. Please go ahead. Paula Schwartz : Thank you and good afternoon everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The Company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the Company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I now would like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus. Please go ahead. Joel Marcus : Thank you, Paula, and welcome everybody to Alexandria's first quarter earnings call. With me today are Dean Shigenaga; Steve Richardson; Peter Moglia; Tom Andrews and Dan Ryan. So to open, I would like to congratulate the entire Alexandria team for a truly superlative first quarter. This month of May is Alexandria's 28th anniversary celebrating its May 1997 IPO listing on the New York Stock Exchange and what better way to celebrate than a great first quarter and also Alexandria's inclusion into the prestigious S&P 500. We recently mailed our 2016 annual report to shareholders and I'm proud to read the quote on the cover, which defines Alexandria in which we're both proud and grateful. Alexandria has achieved the three outputs that define a company, superior results, distinctive impact on lasting endurance; Jim Collins, renowned author and business strategist. In our shareholders letter, we highlight our variable strategic decisions in 2004, 2005 and 2006 to pursue the urban campus cluster strategy in Mission Bay Cambridge in New York City and that strategy and set of decisions over a decade ago presaged today's megatrend of urbanization, leading to the fostering of the innovation, collaboration and certainly is resulted in superior results and strong total returns for Alexandria's shareholders. In fact General Electric CEO, Jeff Immelt, said recently that he changed out his suburban office in Connecticut, where he saw dare for an urban office campus in Boston, where he sees engineers, techies, kids with big ideas and sharp minds out to change the world. And that\u2019s does describe it. I want to highlight a quick first quarter snapshot and Dean will then take a bit of a deep dive, as you know FFO beat the street by about $0.03. We raised guidance $0.02 at the midpoint, and as Dean will highlight realizing spreads up, early renewals and same-store growth were really very positive. Strong internal metrics, positive cash same-store property growth great releasing spreads and 1.3 million square feet of leasing, strong external growth was also a hallmark of the first quarter with continuing lease development deliveries and very improved balance sheet metrics. With respect to demand, I would say very solid continuing demand both for life science and technology companies, which really intersect in our core urban campus cluster markets. One of Alexander's biggest challenges today is, we simply don\u2019t have enough space to handle our own tenant demand as well as other non-tenant demand. On the supply side, we continue to see continuing constrained supply in each of our core urban cluster markets, leasing as you see from the press release from the sub 1.3 million square feet this quarter, our cash up about 17.8% on the back of really the Novartis, Genentech, Roche and Vir Biotech leases. And in fact, we do have a tenant ready to take all of Lilly's vacated space in San Diego and we are working through that negotiation right now. We are active on the acquisition front and as I stated at the frontend, we have more demand today than we have space available. So, we are active in Cambridge, Mission Bay/SoMa, Greater Stanford/San Diego and the Research Triangle Park. We really focused on unique and valuable locations where we can scale. We remain highly disciplined in our location selection and in our assumptions towards provide economically advantageous projects. On the development side, one of best and most highly leased pipelines in the industry we have fortunately and we will continue to be highly disciplined in all aspects of our development with respect to managing project cost, managing project underwriting, tenant underwriting, timeliness, leasing and yields. On the 100 Binney leasing front, I am pleased to say we afore signed Letters of Intent, which cover all of the remaining phase except about 22,000 square feet and although executed LOIs are not signed leased, we have a very high confidence level these will all get done and by the way we do have back up. I want to highlight a few other developments quickly, 399 Binney which was acquired at when we acquired One Kendall Square, we are working on this and preconstruction and already seeing really good demand. In Research Triangle Park, we acquired a redevelopment asset that we are redeveloping and have solid demand for both the labs there and the greenhouses. And at 279 East Grand, we are working through preconstruction issues and negotiating with several users as well. So, the prospects for future pipeline look pretty positive. On the help of our life science and tech tenant base, these tenants are strong and well capitalized with very strong continuing R&D funding, and on the life science side as we have said before about $150 billion globally, 39 billion added to that from the U.S. government and another 30 from U.S. philanthropy and another 11 billion on the venture side. This is in past year and this year, we expect it to be at or above those levels. The NIH was fortunate to get a $2 billion funding boost over the next five months under the bipartisan spending deal that was reached a Saturday night in Congress and a plus for the policy of strong government support for biomedical research. We have a very strong continuing tenant base, 51% of our ABRs investment grade, 78% of our top 20 tenants is investment grade and 79% of our ABRs from Class A properties in AAA locations. And finally before I turn it over to Dean, so far 2017 has seen a fast start for FDA approvals. We\u2019ll maintain new drug approvals today, five of which were approved in the past week and Alexandria has seven tenants down 37% of those approvals. So, we\u2019re looking at I think very positive backdrop to our operation. So, let me turn over to Dean for some deep dive. Dean Shigenaga : Thanks, Joel, Dean Shigenaga here, good afternoon everybody. As Joel, we\u2019re off to a great start in 2017 and have increased our guidance FFO per share for 2017 by $0.02 to $6.02 at the midpoint, really due to continued strong rental rate growth on recently executed early lease renewals. We are now on track to deliver 9.3% growth in FFO per share in 2017 and 36.7% growth in FFO per share over the four years ending on December 31, 2017. There are four important topics I will cover today. First, continued solid market fundamentals. Second, continued solid internal growth. Third, strong and disciplined external growth including very important comments about the potential significant understatement of net asset value. And four, continued discipline of allocation of capital management of our balance sheet. Market fundamentals remain strong and our urban innovation cluster markets demand remain strong and supply of existing Class A space remains very limited. We are in a unique position with a highly experience and regarded team with the strong relationships that positioned us well that would be the preferred partner to provide collaborative campuses and urban innovation clusters. We continue to execute and deliver solid internal growth also known as our same property net operating income growth. Cash same property net operating income growth was very solid at 5.5% for the quarter. Leasing activity for the quarter was also a very strong at 1.3 million rentable square feet through release renewals or generally unpredictable from a timing perspective since these opportunities are dependent on decisions by our tenants. However, executed early release renewals represented approximately 65% of our leasing activity for the quarter. Importantly, our team captured rental rate growth of about 28% and 18% on a cash basis on total leasing activity this quarter. In reviewing various sales side models for the quarter, we noted that most models did not capture the near-term impact of significant rental rate growth on leasing activity. The most models as many of us were built off the prior quarter NOI and adjust for acquisitions, dispositions and development and redevelopment projects and had a growth rate for typical same property NOI growth. Our rental rate growth on several recently executed lease renewals and releasing the space through significant and immediate growth in revenue and operating income and FFO per share resulting in our $0.02 increased in our mid-point of guidance for 2017 FFO per share. 60% of this increase was driven by executed leases with strong rental rate growth and 40% was attributable to a slight average occupancy pick-up throughout 2017 as compared to our prior guidance. EBITDA margins are very strong and have improved in recent quarters of 67% TIs and leasing commissions included in our disclosures of non-revenue enhancing capital expenditures for the quarter were 18.4 million, up about 6.7 million, 4.5 million of this increase was driven by leasing commissions on the recently executed 10-year lease extension on 303,000 renewable square feet with Novartis located in Cambridge. As anticipated, our occupancy declined slightly in the quarter to a solid occupancy of 95.5%, the primary driver of this slight decline in occupancy was due to the expansion of the Eli Lilly from 125,000 rentable square feet to 305,000 rentable square feet at our recently completed Class A redevelopment project at 10290 Campus Point Drive. Lilly vacated a 125,000 square feet at 10300 Campus Point, and as we Joe mentioned are in negotiations with tenant for the most of the space. As we look forward over the next two quarters, we expect occupancy to improve into the 96% range and closer to where begin the year. We are in a very unique position to provide inspiring real estate solutions to drive collaboration and innovation for some of the top biopharma entities, focused on making life better for people throughout the world. Over the past four quarters, we have completed 10 new Class A properties and we have another seven new Class A properties that we expect to complete in 2017. The deliveries in 2017 alone are projected to generate another 100 million of incremental net operating income. Additionally these deliveries are weighted toward the backend of 2017 and we\u2019ll drive significant net operating income growth in 2018. In order to maintain a high quality engineering and asset management services among other services, G&A expenses have grown with the growth in new Class A properties and cash flows and it's important to highlight the G&A expenses has improved slightly in recent quarters to approximately 0.6% of total assets. We are also in a very unique position with well located land parcels to decide, if appropriate to address the demand from high quality and innovative entities with ground up development of new Class A properties. This quarter our supplement package includes a new disclosure on Page 38 of certain development and redevelopment projects aggregating 1.5 million rentable square feet that are undergoing marketing and preconstruction with potential delivery dates in 2018 and 2019. The project start date and initial occupancy date for each project is subject to leasing and or market conditions. These potential developments and one redevelopment are on average targeting about 7% cash yield. We also added a new disclosure on page 39, for other potential near-term projects aggregating another 2 million square feet that could also address demand in the market with potential delivery in 2019, 2020 and beyond. Let me provide very important comments on the potential understatement of net asset value as of March 31, 2017. Most entity model start with the gap, net operating income and back out straight line rent to derive cash, net operating income; and then most entity models divide this cash NOI amount by a market capitalization rate to determine the value of the operating portion of our asset base. As of March 31, 2017, our recently completed development and redevelopment projects have approximately 95 million of annual free rent that will result in significant understatement in most NAV models. At a reasonable market capitalization rate on this 95 million of rent concessions NAV models could be understated by $20 to $25 per share. Importantly, approximately 40 million of annual cash rents commenced on April 1, 2017, and this is primarily related to 75/125 Binney Street and 50 and 60 Binney Street. So, we encourage investors to carefully review NAV estimates for important valuation considerations. I would like to congratulate Steve Richardson, our COO and our San Francisco team for their outstanding relationships and reputation in the market, which ultimately developed into an opportunity to work in partnership with the Golden State Warriors and Uber. We recently entered into an agreement to purchase a 10% interest in a joint venture with Golden State Warriors and Uber and expect to close this JV in 2018. This joint venture would develop two high quality office building and lease the buildings to Uber. Alexandria will manage the development of these buildings and also earn a development fee. Our balance sheet in credit metrics are very strong today and provide a significant flexibility. Importantly we continue to focus on improvement in our credit profile and long-term cost to capital. By the end of this year we're forecasting the following strong metrics, leverage in the range of 5.3 times to 5.8 times both on the net debt to adjusted EBITDA and in net debt plus preferred to adjusted EBITDA basis. Liquidity of 2.2 billion today combined with low balance sheet leverage really provides significant flexibility with the disciplined in patient with capital market activity. Our fix charge coverage ratio is greater than four times. Our development pipeline is approximately 10% or will be approximately 10% by the end of the year and this includes projects under vertical construction as well as future projects and that provides us optionality to address the demand from some of most innovative entities. We have not debt maturities in 2017, very limited maturities in 2018 and a very manageable set of maturities in the three years better after. And we're very limited on hedge variable rate debt of about 5% of total debt today. Our strategy for funding growth has been consistent and consistently executed year to year, we will continue to focus on investing significant cash flows from operations after dividends, fund a significant component of construction with long-term fixed rate debt on a leverage neutral basis with significant growth in EBITDA continue to seek opportunities to reinvest capital from selected real estate sales and remain disciplined with the use of common equity. Our goal is to combine our discipline management of our development pipeline with the strong and flexible balance sheet and continue to remain disciplined in funding our business in a manner that allows us to drive solid growth and per share earnings, net asset value and growth in common stock dividends per share. Closing the guidance here we provided an updated guidance for 2017 as fully detailed on Page 6 of our supplemental package. Again our 2017 guidance FFO per share with the midpoint was increased $0.02 to $6.02, again driven by strong rental rate growth and recently executed early lease renewals. We remain in a very unique position within REIT sector today with solid market fundamentals both life science fundamentals and exciting innovation focused on improvement in the quality of life. We were also well positioned with long tenured and a highly regarded senior and executive leadership combined with a unique science and technology team that allows us to be an important partner to some of the world's most innovate entities. Thank you and I'll turn it back to Joel. Joel Marcus : Operator, if we could go to Q&A please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Emmanuel Korchman with Citigroup Global Markets Incorporated. Please go ahead. Emmanuel Korchman : Joe, you talked about earlier that the lack of space within our developments for both new and existing tenants. I was wondering, how that impact the way you think about doing redevelopment doesn\u2019t make you a little bit more aggressive on whether the timing or lease up or location properties to help take advantage of that basic delivery between demand and supply? Joel Marcus : No, I think if you go back to my prepared remarks I think what I said was, we would continue to be I think quote highly disciplined in all aspects of the development with respect to cost underwriting, timeline, leasing yields. And so I don\u2019t think anything is changed, but it is frustrating in some cases where we are unable to handle requirements for especially tenants who have certain needs, but we are doing the best we can to overcome that. But I don\u2019t think it will change our philosophy or the way we are doing things. Emmanuel Korchman : And then Dean on the Warriors, Uber venture, what type of role do you think Alexandria will play and what is sort of 10% seen at the table get you there? Steve Richardson : Manny, hi, it's Steve Richardson. We are playing a very active role in the project management over side of the vertical construction of the two office facilities. Neither of the entities have development experience, so they are relying on us primarily to execute on that. We are thrilled to be right in the middle of that partnership; right in the heart of Mission Bay, we think it\u2019s a fantastic attribute and amenity overall and kind of a unique one of the kind destination. So, we are very excited about it. Joel Marcus : Steve has visions of holding up the NBA Championship. Emmanuel Korchman : Are there any development or other fees that come your way because you are taking that role in the project? Joel Marcus : Yes, Manny. No, it\u2019s a formal development management agreement and we're busy. The teams done a fantastic job and we certainly do have development management fees there, yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Sheila McGrath with Evercore. Please go ahead. Sheila McGrath : Joel, in New York, you're about 98% leased, so essentially full. I was just wondering when you think about moving forward on the option parcel, where does that stands? And are there any other opportunities in the New York market for Alexandria? Joel Marcus : Yes, Sheila. The option parcel we are having in that discussions on that both with the city and with potential users, we do have demand internally. But that\u2019s I would say an elongated process because of the nature of negotiating the nature of side due diligence and then ultimately constructing the tower. So we are looking forward to moving that forward. But I think over the shorter medium term we are certainly looking at opportunities in New York City to accommodate the tenant base there. So, I think overtime you will see us do some things in the city for sure other than the Alexandria center. Sheila McGrath : And then 100 Binney, that\u2019s good news with the four LOIs. Just wondering as these are life science tenants or tech tenants? Joel Marcus : Three of the four are life science. Sheila McGrath : And then Dean, can you just remind us on the forward equity commitment, how those additional shares ramp in the balance of the year? Dean Shigenaga : Sure, Sheila. It\u2019s Dean here. So, the forward is about 6.9 million shares, if I recall correctly 2.1 taking down and closing. So call it roughly third at closing. Two thirds on a forward basis and the concept there was really to match our funding needs, so we added a number of transactions that closed in the first quarter that was required for the immediate funding. Second quarter consisted of closing one of the acquisitions. The second partial installment on the Uber payment for unwinding the joint venture and then capital required for the retirement of our Series A preferred stock. So, when we recently put forward and place for our outlook was to bring some of it in quarter-to-quarter to match our funding needs. Operator : And our next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Jamie Feldman : Can you mention -- it looks like six projects potentially delivering in \u201918 or \u201919 or beyond of future starts. Can you maybe handicap or maybe just give us some more color on discussions for those and are there any that you would start to back at this point? Joel Marcus : Well, I think, I mentioned three that we\u2019re pretty active in marketing and preconstruction which is 399 Binney, which assuming we turn the four otherwise into actual leases that 100 Binney that would leave virtually no space available there. So, the 399 Binney becomes important, we do have one-time in particular. But several tenants looking at summer all of that space. So, we\u2019re certainly looking hard at that and working on everything we need to do go vertical on that one were ready. We did close and acquisition in Research Triangle Park and we\u2019re redeveloping that as we speak and there is existing demand that we\u2019re trying to need and then the 279 grand as we said, we have several users were negotiating with and we\u2019re moving that forward in preconstruction and marketing before we go vertical. We\u2019ll make decisions based on how we think the market is and where we think our leasing is. Jamie Feldman : And then I guess just thinking with San Francisco. Maybe just talk about your appetites take additional development risk outside of Mission Bay and markets obviously filling up -- filled up pretty quickly. Just in terms of moving life science around that market, where you think the best odds right now for spillover? Steve Richardson : Jamie, hi, it\u2019s Steve Richardson. Yes, I mean as we look at Mission Bay all the way down the Stanford, you\u2019ve got the vacancy right probably in the 2% range. Demand is actually picked up year-over-year and we\u2019re tracking 2.8 million square feet now versus 2.2 million square feet. And it is distributed Mission Bay, South San Francisco and a Greater Stanford Cluster. I think you did see in the discloser, the acquisition of property in that Greater Stanford Cluster. So, we\u2019re working hard to make sure we\u2019ve got adequate supply to meet the demand that is in the market today. Jamie Feldman : Okay. Thanks. And then finally, Joel, you mentioned the budget in life science funding. Anything else we should be watching in the pipeline here in terms of budget discussions or any of builds or funding opportunities that might be out there that maybe helped hurt the business? Joel Marcus : Well, I think that the R&D side of the business is funding along. I think it is strong, it stayed strong year-to-year from both pharma and bio. The NIH as you know will have some addition 2 billion, the FDA has some incremental additional, they actually need probably more. But they've done a great job of approvals this year with 19 to date, which is almost a record. And I think we\u2019ll just wait to see how the broader healthcare issues that\u2019s out. It's kind of interesting because if you think about healthcare in general, the one thing that\u2019s not talk about that could actually help saves significant cost is tort reform. And that adds gigantic amounts of cost to healthcare because as you know the medicines only are about 10% to 15% part of that budget whereas doctors, hospitals and all the other services and products really make up the bulk of the 85% to 90%. And if we were able to achieve tort reform that would be I think a huge, huge benefit to the healthcare system on a cost basis. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Michael Carroll : Joe, can you a little bit about land side that you purchased this quarter. What's your current thought on banking lands and what's the timeline we should think about these projects maybe having groundbreaking? Joel Marcus : Well, I think the fact that we have a record number of highly leased pipeline deliveries, as Dean has updated every quarter up pretty robust schedule from deliveries Page 3 of the press release in sup obviously showed the first quarter at 0.3 million square feet. And second through the fourth quarter at well over million square feet, it's pretty clear that the current pretty intense development highly leased development were getting to the -- towards the end of those deliveries and over the next year or so and so we\u2019re looking at opportunities to continue to expand to meet that need. And I think that\u2019s what you see in the acquisitions both the expansion of our campus at One Kendall Square, as Steve has reported the SoMa acquisition, this joint venture that Dean and Steve have talked about with the Warriors and Uber, the greater Standford acquisition and a number of pieces of puzzles in San Diego and a redevelopment like Research Triangle Park. So, trying to be thoughtful, we certainly want to maintain a prudent amount of non-income producing assets on the balance sheet so that we maintain strong and flexible balance sheet. I think we\u2019re at a great point as Dean shared with you. So, I think you'll continue to see us just try to be as I said a couple of times super discipline here. Michael Carroll : And then what other type of opportunities that you're tracking at there I guess in purchasing land sites. Should we expect more purchases throughout this year and possibly next year or is this just kind of like onetime thing? Joel Marcus : I think it so much depends on I mean cycle back 2004, 2005 when we bought 3 million square feet from [Catullus], it's not like we wanted to buy it all it once, but it became available and it was take it all or nothing, I don\u2019t think will have that situation again. But you never know, One Kendall Square, it's not land, but there was a land site there. We didn\u2019t see it coming to market when we started 2016. So, you just never know when sellers may decide or owners may decide to achieve liquidity it's so hard to tell. Operator : The next question comes from Dave Rodgers with Robert W. Baird & Co. Please go ahead. Dave Rodgers : Hey, Joe, good afternoon. Maybe talk a little bit about you comfort level today, just given the demand that you've seen first starting more projects on spec? And to the extent that you would do that, how would you think that in the context of capital risk or the balance sheet? And is there any change in kind of the tenant mix that you\u2019re seeing, there are small or larger tenant full build to suit or just smaller users that would make you want to go that route or avoid that route at this point? Joel Marcus : Well, I think both on the prepared remarks and the answer to previous question, I think we've said, we're pretty focused on maintaining the discipline and the underwriting that we\u2019ve maintained whether it would be cost, underwriting tenants, inhering to timelines, leasing, yields et cetera, maintaining our balance sheet and as the shape it is today. So, I think it really as a one-by-one decision, and I think we will continue to vigilant disciplined and really careful. But I think the good news is, we're delivering a really a massive amount of highly leased development through this year with substantial NOI being said, approaching about a $100 million, so that makes a huge difference. So, I don\u2019t think you'll see us do anything that we haven\u2019t kind of you haven\u2019t that we been doing over the last few years. Dave Rodgers : Sure, okay. And then Dean your comment about 95 million of annualized free rent that was as of the first quarter and then 40 million of that such to go away April 1st. What's the remainder of the rollout this year and early next, if that\u2019s correct? Dean Shigenaga : I think the one other large number is probably Uber brand lease that I commented on last quarter. I believe that\u2019s October and November, roughly $11 million of cash NOI that will commence at that point in time. I think the rest are just the number of projects. But as we go through, I think you will see the next color at 2Q and really 2Q being the biggest run off of free rent, the biggest step in cash rents. And then 3Q earns a little bit more of the bump but its relatively modest, I think it's really just important to say at the end of March 31 that was the free rent from the deliveries and again on April 1, 40 million of annual cash rents would commence. It commenced and all we ask is that everybody carefully look at their NAV model to be sure we\u2019re not loosing valuation there because this is all real contractual and it has been delivered so. Joel Marcus : Yes, so Dave, following up on your question, one a way to think about -- another way to think about your question is, 213 Grand which we put into the development pipeline, we really haven\u2019t plan to do it. But when Merck decided to open a West Coast research headquarters, it became pretty clear this was an ideal fit. And so that\u2019s a good example of where we took a solid land site in a market that\u2019s come back nicely to meet need of a long time tenant and relationship. And so at 399 Binney, which is the land parcel of One Kendall, we have quite a number of companies. In fact, I don\u2019t want conversation with one CEO on Friday and Cambridge literally like begging us to have space they wanted the 100 Binney, but they can't. So, they are likely to go to 399 Binney. So, those are the kinds of things that would move us to go forward with vertical construction. Same thing at 279 East Grand, we've got a number of pretty hot users that are in deep discussions with us. And if one of those matures, we would likely push that forward, but again we are trying to be very careful about managing all aspects of meeting that demand, but against the back drop of maintaining our great balance sheet position as well. Dave Rodgers : And maybe lastly for me, you've done a good job addressing some of your recent roles in the portfolio, your tenant rollover, anything that we are watching now through middle of '18 that\u2019s coming up? Steve Richardson : Dave, hi, it's Steve Richardson. When '18 is pretty well distributed we have only got four projects in excess of 50,000 square feet. The largest one is in South San Francisco, that market is rebounded nicely. We are actually engaging the tenant today in discussions and that\u2019s later half '18. So '17 looks like it's in very good shape and as we start looking into '18 I think we are pleased with the ways those were distributed and probably a solid two thirds or more are in core clusters as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Rich Anderson : Dean, I didn\u2019t fully get the timing of the settlement of the forward. Do you think ratably over the course of this year and maybe you said asked differently? What is your guidance assume in terms of fully diluted share count for 2017? Dean Shigenaga : Yes, ratably over the three quarter so we took down the immediate close Q1 and then the plan is Q2 and Q3. As far as total shares outstanding I don\u2019t have it in front of me but you can just roll that forward I think. Rich Anderson : I think that answered my question. Thank you. Question, on the Golden State Warrior joint venture and Uber to be the lessee, I mean what is the stop Uber from going down wind to go down Uber design path like they did it 1455, that\u2019s not many correctly how I am describing it, but resulted in you nevertheless is sort of restructure that arrangement. Is there anything embedded in this joint venture that will preclude that from having to happen again? Steve Richardson : Rich, hi, it's Steve Richardson. Yes, we are under construction on that site, so the design is locked in. They are working on the interiors but from an exterior perspective fully improved fully entitled no changes to the exterior design and actually ground has been broken and under construction. Rich Anderson : Another quick one for, Dean, and maybe I should noticed, but I don\u2019t so. When is the timing of that installment at $56 million for really to the Uber JV purchase? Dean Shigenaga : Well, it's somewhat contingent on construction milestones, if I had to guess over the next call it six to eight months. I wouldn\u2019t suspect it will be spread over evenly over the timeframe, but it is contingent. So, if they don\u2019t hit the milestones we set out in the payment plan. But if I had to guess Rich, I think it will be paid this year. But I think it works to advantage, if we don't pay them, if they end up deferred it's just hard a modeling perspective for you guys. Rich Anderson : Okay. Last question kind of bigger picture. Acknowledging that the cash to same-store number is more important one in midpoint of 6.5% still the gap number lag that pretty substantially in your gap lease role is spectacular still. I\u2019m curious what's one of the dots that connect that difference? And when do you start to see the gap same-store number actually catch-up and maybe even surpass the cash number from a total same-store NOI growth perspective? Joel Marcus : I think the simplest way to think if it is long-term call it over a 10-year average. Our portfolio is generated about 5% cash same property net operating income growth and that\u2019s not unusual based and what we\u2019ve been doing lately. I think what may surprise most is that the gap 10-year average is closer to 2%. And I think there has more to do with the high and stable occupancy that we operate at slightly over 95% for 10 years. And that drives a very consistent same property pull and it leaves you with only leasing activity to mark-to-market. And the gap number, we do get significant growth, but you\u2019re only drawing 10% of that at best in any given year into the portfolio. So, it\u2019s -- the cash increases are contractual, and so you\u2019ve got much stronger cash same property performance over the long haul. I think when you see occupancy declines or volatility, I should say in traditional sectors, you tend to see much stronger gap performance, because they\u2019re losing tremendous gap NOI just from occupancy and then they read down on the upside when occupancy is growing. You can gain same property performance faster on occupancy than you can on annual steps. Rich Anderson : What your average escalator? Joel Marcus : We\u2019re really close to 3% contractually today. Rich Anderson : And that\u2019s set escalator on CPI escalator? Joel Marcus : Yes, most of them are fixed steps. Most of the escalators are fixed contractually. Operator : And we have our next question from Tom Catherwood with BTIG, LLC. Please go ahead. Tom Catherwood : Steve, just, now you've partially addressed this in a previous answer by one of the drill down a bit. Last quarter, you referenced 2.4 million square feet of lab demand that you're tracking in San Francisco, about 2.9 million square feet of tech demand and then another 4.5 million square feet in the Peninsula. How does that kind of attract today? Steve Richardson : Hi, Tom. It\u2019s Steve. Again, the markets are healthy across the Board from Mission Bay down to the Greater Stanford Cluster mostly seeing an uptake in activity. We\u2019re tracking 2.8 million square feet of lab demand today. A year ago with that 2.2 million square feet and I think you reference, it was 2.4 million square feet a quarter two ago. And a number of those are large investment grade, high quality tenants out there in the market. Tech demand, we\u2019re tracking again and uptake there as well 4.1 million square feet versus 3.7 million square feet from Q1 2016 at San Francisco alone. And maybe a little flatter down in the Peninsula, we\u2019re not seeing Google and Apple in the market with quite the same large block apatite at least right at this very moment. But across the Board, it continues to be very, very healthy and in fact somewhat of an uptick from a few quarters ago. Tom Catherwood : Appreciate that. And we take a look at new development site down at 960 Industrial Road. It looks like the surrounding areas heavily industrial kind of even by South San Francisco standard. What is it about the submarket and the specific site that you think makes it fit for your life science portfolio? Steve Richardson : Yes, it\u2019s really a combination of things Tom and historically what we\u2019ve seen are the large tech tenants in the Standford Research Park, the Mountain View, Shoreline Business Park and now the Menlo Park area really drive out the life science tenants from those markets. Standford themselves are currently underway building a million square foot campus in Redwood City. Facebook continues to expand in Menlo Park, placing a lot of pressure for tenants there. And then ultimately Google controls nearly all of the Shoreline Business Park in Mountain View. So, when you take a look at that the boundaries of the Greater Standford Cluster really being pushed further north and further south, and life science tenants that we continue to have discussions with do have a desire to be in that Greater Standford Cluster. So, we think that this is going to be a great opportunities. It is real served with the Caltrain Station within walking distance. We do have downtown San Carlos right there. So, we think it's actually a pretty unique location. Tom Catherwood : And then one quick one for, Dean. You've addressed how the TIs jump this quarter partially because of the early lease renewals, but there was also note here just about some tenant funded improvements as well. Can you talk a little bit more on the making of those? And also in general how tenant concession packages are trending in your markets? Dean Shigenaga : Well, responding to the CapEx disclosure specifically, I know one of the R&Ds talk about trends on incentive packages. But the CapEx alone I think the Novartis lease is a good example, not only did we have leasing commissions that drove a big step quarter-over-quarter, but I think they've been in the space well every sense we acquired the asset back in 2006. So, there was a little refreshing capital and the renewal in there. So, the comments we\u2019re just focused on specifically more than anything else. Tom Catherwood : Got you. And then as far as overall? Steve Richardson : Yes, Tom, it's Steve again. Maybe overall at least for San Francisco, I'll let Dean comment as well and Peter. If you take the two examples in the supplemental, the Genentech renewal there, they were looking to lock down space. So, we have note down time, minimal TIs, really no concessions. And then the Vir technology space in Mission Bay was actually very competitively sort after space. So, it was the complete office, there were really no concessions, it was a very competitively built space. Dan Ryan : Yes, we\u2019ve seen similar -- it's Dan Ryan. For San Diego, we've seen a softening of the free rent concessions, so that's confirming us. I think TI allowances have been above the same as they have been since above the past 12 months. Peter Moglia : This is Peter Moglia, just to add on what Dan has said about free rent, that\u2019s probably the biggest things that I've noticed. The lease underwrite about a month per year for a long-term lease deal in that turned into a half month. Otherwise, that\u2019s everything else is pretty been stable. Operator : Next question comes from Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. Jed Reagan : If I can just follow up on that question, curious if you could just go around the whole and talk about the magnitude of rent growth you're seeing in your markets at this point? Steve Richardson : Jed, it's Steve Richardson. On a mark-to-market basis as well as a rent growth basis, we're at about 22.9% on a mark-to-market basis in the exiting portfolio. And Mission Bay for example now with the most recent lease, we saw probably in the mid teens rent growth over the past year. So, continued pricing pressure, I think we've said early in the year that we expected that rate of growth to moderate, but ultimately there is still very healthy growth in upside there in the market. Dean Shigenaga : Yes, I think the most two most recent renewals that we\u2019ve had in new lease in our new lab corp went up significantly on their renewal that was probably a plus 20% increase. And similarly in our sounding locations, we're seeing pretty healthy increase of about mid teens percentage in cash yields. Joel Marcus : Tom, you could comment on Cambridge? Tom Andrews : I would say similar we have, we're still seeing rent growth here in Cambridge maybe a little moderated over the pace of last year and the year before but definitely still growing rent and concessions are flat to down in another more favorable to the land lord. It continues to be a tight market sub factors on availability rate and clearly that\u2019s positive for rent growth and concessions reductions. Jed Reagan : And I think some of the number you guys recorded, sounds like you're more sort of mark-to-market on new leases, I guess I was looking at montages kind of base rent growth in a year-over-year basis just kind market trends. Steve Richardson : This is Steve. I mean just to be clear that two examples I cited were actual deals in the market. They weren't mark-to-market adjustments. Sorry, if I confused that with the mark-to-market comment at the outside. Peter Moglia : And Jed, it's Peter Moglia. One thing I just wanted to note because we're doing a lot of land acquisitions right now, as that when we underwrite these acquisitions, we're using un-trended rents based on today, even though we have significant rent growth we're not counting on that to make our numbers in the future. And when than when we do trend rents we typically hold it at a CPI level, we don\u2019t try to underwrite spike something like that. So, I just wanted everyone to be clear that when we're speculating on future returns, it's based on what we see in the market today. Jed Reagan : And then something like the San Diego the 15%, would that be a current market rent trend? Steve Richardson : Yes, that was with our renewal on the one case and new rent on the other. So, it's one of each in that case. Jed Reagan : Just on the separate topic, you are recently in acquisitions I think you land banks about 7% or so of your operating asset base and just curious if you have feeling for how high you feel comfortable growing that number to? Dean Shigenaga : Hey, Jed, it's Dean here. I think the numbers that we typically look at is the overall pipeline both active and future is actually about 11% of gross real estate as of march 31, by the end of this year it's expected to be just inside of 10% call it in that 10% range. So I think our pipeline is actually very modest for the size of our balance sheet and we are trying to be very disciplined in that area. So, it may move around from time-to-time, but it's more related to deliveries and construction of certain assets that grow that pipeline. Jed Reagan : And then of the recent land acquisition I know you got the entitlements, you've got to work through at the tenant's club site. Is there entitlement you still have to achieve anything the other sites? And are those all lab sites on the stuff you acquired in last quarter or so? Dean Shigenaga : So, if we go through -- just turning the page here-- sorry -- I got the long supplemental. Peter Moglia : Jed, it's Peter Moglia, it\u2019s a 303 Binney Street. We are going through entitlements there. Obviously, we mentioned blocks some about that of course the Warriors project is already entitled at 916 Industrial Roads, we will be -- where we have commenced entitlement there. And then the Callan Road, Vista Wateridge acquisition in San Diego is undergoing entitlement and then the East Cornwallis Road in RTP is actually has existing entitlement. So, we don\u2019t need to do anything there. Jed Reagan : And the first three you feel pretty good you being above to achieve those? Steve Richardson : Absolutely, I think we have probably most seasoned entitlement team of any REIT. Jed Reagan : And just last one if I may I can. Maybe a question for Joel, I think you guys talked about the congressional deal reversing the proposed budget cuts from spending on the '17 budget. I guess just looking ahead to the '18 budget. How do you see that playing out? I know that the President of the new administration is still calling for a significant cost to NIH funding is part of that budget? Joel Marcus : Yes, I think the budget cuts are not really specific to the NIH per se. They were proposed to try to achieve a line of side on the deficit that with probably tax reform in line. So, I don\u2019t think most people are too worried about it. I think the members of the administration and certainly both parts of Congress, both the Democrats and the Republicans, I think for sure have bipartisan views of maintaining or increasing the NIH budget. I am not really particularly worried about that. Operator : Our last question comes from Tony Paolone with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Tony Paolone : Thanks. On 303 Binney, if I just put your entitlements now against the purchase price like $380 a quarter something. And it looks like, if you do get more density there, you\u2019ll pay, there is earned out or you pay more. What would about look like do you think when it\u2019s done? Joel Marcus : Tony, I would say that any additional density would obviously improve the yields, but the underwriting just as -- we based our decision to this transaction on what there is today. And as Dean alluded to, we are looking at our historic performance or to achieve our historic performance, which is around 7% yield based on whether today. If we\u2019re able to get more entitlements in the future, which we are fairly confident we will. It will level that up a bit. Tony Paolone : But I mean, if I'm just reading a footnote and suggest that more entitlements you get there at to the purchase price. So, executive deal leverage on the 380 a quarter, is that correct? Joel Marcus : Yes. The costs per foot goes down more that we -- for the more square footage that we\u2019re able to get, it will blend into a lower costs per foot. Tony Paolone : Okay, got it. And just apologies for not knowing this Uber, Golden State deal and what\u2019s kind of going on there now? But at the -- again your price at about $600 a foot, what exactly does that get you? And what would be you think the all in when it\u2019s done? Joel Marcus : That 35 million of our contribution at closing the joint venture is not just that you\u2019re talking about significant side work of parking structure. So call it, it\u2019s a land plus significant improvements and that skews the costs per square foot. I\u2019d say all-in, as I mentioned earlier in my prepared commentary. All the projects that we actually have queued up under marketing and pretty construction right now generally average of about a 7% cash yield and so that\u2019s where we\u2019re expecting to be in all-in on all these new projects. Tony Paolone : And then in terms of proceeds from dispositions and equity this year for back up the equity, it looks like you have 200 million to 450 million left. And apologies, if you cover this, but where do you expect that to come from at this point? Joel Marcus : Yes, what we have left saw on that line time in our guidance, which is still able to equity and dispositions. It\u2019s roughly 400 to solve 66 million, 67 million or so is from the sale with the condominium interest on the Longwood project. That lease is called at roughly 330 million to saw far beyond that and we\u2019re working through that over the remainder of the year. Tony Paolone : Do you have any assets in the market right now? Joel Marcus : Nothing too significant. Tony Paolone : And then just last question for, Dean. The other income line is looking the last five quarters it\u2019s been anywhere through change 1 million to over 10 million. What\u2019s in the 2017 guidance for that line? Dean Shigenaga : I think it\u2019s fairly modest on front half of the year and it might be a little more normal on the back half of the year. But I think every year it\u2019s averaged in aggregate at a fairly consistent level. The quarter-to-quarter, you may see some variations. Tony Paolone : But full year total pretty comparable to say like the last couple of years? Joel Marcus : Yes, except the last couple of years had some large one-off quarters, if I recall correctly. So, I think if you have ignored some of the larger volume, there may have been one or two quarters that were a little larger over the last two years and you got it almost ignore those. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks. Joel Marcus : Thank you, operator, and thank you everybody for taking time to join us for the first quarter call. And we'll look forward to talking to you for the second quarter. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz. Please go ahead. Paula Schwartz : Thank you and good afternoon. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company\u2019s actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company\u2019s periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I now would like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus. Please go ahead, sir.. Joel Marcus : Thank you, Paula, and welcome everybody to the second quarter earnings call. With me today are Dean Shigenaga; Steve Richardson; Peter Moglia; Dan Ryan; and Tom Andrews. I want to first of all congratulate the entire Alexandria family on a truly excellently executed second quarter against a backdrop of continuing economic growth. We\u2019ve been fortunate to have continuing strong demand in our key cluster markets with very limited supply, continued help and growth of our tenant base, continued strong leasing activity with solid rent spreads. And I guess, this quarter the prize goes to San Diego for 34% of the rentable square foot lease, Greater Boston at 32%, San Francisco at 18%. We also had continued very strong same-store growth come in on a number of these items in a moment or two, continued strong rental rate increases in occupancy, continued strong operating margins and continuing strong and flexible balance sheet. On the macro side, the biotechnology sector has outperformed the broader markets and now sentiment has moved closer to sector fundamentals and help generally buy an industry-friendly draft executive orders, legislation and political appointments. Venture funding for life science companies remained strong and stable and 2017 is on pace to meet or exceed the historic funding levels of 2015 and 2016. The FDA has approved 27 new therapeutics, both chemical and biological entities so far in 2017, exceeding 2016 and on pace for potentially a five-year approval average of 35 to 40. The new FDA Commissioner, Scott Gottlieb has announced a number of initiatives that help improve the FDA and encourage and support innovation. And with the attention turning to tax reform, biopharma could benefit from cash repatriation and reduce corporate taxes freeing up additional capital to invest the top nine-based \u2013 U.S.-based biopharma companies have over $130 billion in cash overseas, so quite a significant cash store. When it comes to healthcare, it\u2019s pretty fair to say that innovation, primarily technology innovation will ultimately be the big disrupter of the healthcare system. The economics, the healthcare will be the challenge of our time for many years to come and there are no simple and clear solutions. There\u2019s a great deal of need for payment reform for continuing to fund in innovation and for healthcare to be dealt with on a more regular basis rather than every seven or eight years. The therapies and drugs in general are not the burden, there\u2019s only been a 3.8% increase over the last number of years and only about 14% of total costs, it\u2019s patient access to drugs being the critical issue and bill bags, meaning co-pays or deductibles. 30% of the price of therapies now go to middlemen who don\u2019t create any value, primarily the pharmacy benefit managers. A comment or two about the ACA. You hear about it all the time. But interestingly enough, the exchanges only affect about 4% of the U.S. population, about 10.3 million people separately Medicaid expansion included about another 11 million. The industry is \u2013 has a number of different interactions with the ACA. I think it\u2019s fair to say that, insurance has turned into a utility on the exchanges and many insurance companies have really dropped out the marketplace or the exchanges truly are broken and that will be the challenge. For now, the ACA, which was passed in the long 2010 provides insurance, as I said, to have between 11 million and 12 million people and will also keep in place Medicare expansion, I\u2019m sorry, Medicaid expansion coverage in 31 states, including the District of Columbia. Right now, there are 40 counties on federal exchanges, which have no insurers. And next year, over 1,300 counties are projected to have either a single insurer or no insurers. Nearly 3 million people may have only one insurer and companies like Athena, Anthem, Signal, Humana have pulled out of many of the exchanges. Americas total Medicare \u2013 medical cost hit a record $3.4 trillion, 18% of GDP. But it\u2019s fair to say that, 5% of the population accounts for 50% of total medical cost, we call them, kind of super utilizers. And it\u2019s basically treatment in the end of life span or medical costs created by bad behaviors, the ones I mentioned in the number of quarters ago, including bad dietary habits, smoking, drinking, drugs, lack of sleep. So with that, let\u2019s move it to some comments on external growth. As you see from the press release and supplement, we\u2019re on track to deliver in the second-half fully leased of projects at 100 Binney, 510 Townsend and then 505 Brannan all had very solid yields, and we\u2019re now focused on pre-leasing at 399 Binney, 279 East Grand Avenue, and 5 Lab Drive. With that, let me turn it over to Dean for some detailed comments. Dean Shigenaga : All right. Thanks, Joel. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everybody. We\u2019re very pleased with our continued strong execution and delivery of strong earnings growth by our entire team, and importantly, by our senior leaders that are now approaching 17 to 20 years with Alexandria. We\u2019re in a great position today and remain on track to deliver 9.3% growth in FFO per share in 2017. I would like to briefly highlight one important topic before covering four other key topics. We have over many years now realized significant gains from our equity investments, primarily in life science and technology-related entities. We have also established important industry relationships through these investments. The depth of our life science technology and real estate industry relationship has and will continue to provide our team with important leasing and real estate opportunities. While we have done very well in our investments, we\u2019re required to recognize impairments when appropriate. In the second quarter, we recognized $4.5 million in impairments on our non-real estate investments, about 1.5 of this related to a publicly traded investment in a biopharmaceutical company focused on liver disease. The other half of the impairment related to an investment in a privately held life science entity. Keep in mind both entities are still in business and continue to execute their business strategy. We remain in an excellent position in four key areas that I\u2019ll highlight today. First, we have continued solid internal growth. Second, we have strong and disciplined external growth. Importantly, we\u2019re in a unique position within the REIT sector with the third and very strong attribute, solid real estate in life science industry fundamentals. Fourth, we have a very strong balance sheet today, which will continue to improve and we will remain focused on our disciplined approach in our allocation of capital to drive growth into the future. Leasing volume was very solid at $1.1 million square feet this quarter and rental rate growth was strong and up at 23.2% and 9.4% on a cash basis. Year-to-date, we executed $2.4 million rentable square feet of leasing, of which 56% represented early lease renewals on lease expirations in 2018, 2019 and 2020. Fundamentals in our submarkets remain solid, which translates to a landlord favorable environment and minimize rent concessions and tenant improvement allowances. Our great asset management team combined with our unique triple net lease structure drove very strong EBITDA margins of 68% for the second quarter. High occupancy of 95% over the last 10 years combined with operating performance, I just mentioned, has driven continued strength of same property performance at 2.2% and 6.2% on a cash basis for the first-half of 2017. We\u2019ll remain on track for solid 2017 same property NOI growth of 2% to 4% and 5.5% to 7.5% on a cash basis. We\u2019re pleased with the consistency and level of our cash same property NOI growth that is as it is amongst the strongest in the industry. We\u2019re on track to deliver on the commencement of another $100 million of incremental net operating income in 2017, 75% of this will be recognized in 2017 and the remainder will benefit NOI growth in 2018, oops, 25% of that will be recognized in 2017, 75% of that will benefit NOI growth in 2018. New Class A buildings that are targeted for delivery in 2017 are on average, 85% leased. Our cash returns on our total investment are very solid at about 7% for projects targeted for delivery in 2017, 2018 and 2019, with individual projects above and below this average. As Joel mentioned, our team made great progress on five tenant prospects of our development side at 100 Binney Street in Cambridge, and we anticipate being fully resolved on leasing on this projects in the third quarter. As mentioned on our call last quarter, $40 million of contractual rents commenced on April 1, related to recently completed development and redevelopment projects. As of June 30, we have another $55 million of contractual rent commencements spread relatively evenly over the next five quarters through the third quarter of 2018, again, solely from recently completed development and redevelopment projects. Our acquisitions to-date in 2017 have been primarily focused on disciplined allocation of capital to urban innovation cluster submarkets that will drive growth through selective development of Class A buildings. As a reminder for modeling purposes, these acquisitions generally provide enough of a benefit close to 4% in the intermediate term, or in the immediate term, I should say, representing the weighted average interest rate required for capitalization of interest. Peter Moglia, along with our highly experienced team remain very disciplined in the underwriting of acquisitions and selective final decision to proceed with an acquisition. We are one of the few REITs in the \u2013 in a great position to describe solid internal growth; solid external growth; and importantly, continued solid real estate and life science fundamentals. Our submarkets across the country continue to have limited supply of Class A space generally also characterized by a limited ability for developers to bring new supply of Class A space over the next couple of years and continued demand for our Class A buildings. Life science fundamentals also remain solid. We are pleased to report one of the top tenant rosters in the REIT industry with 51% of our annual rental revenue in effect as of June 30, from investment-grade rated tenants. Additionally, the weighted average remaining term of our top 20 tenants was 9.7 years, excluding the long-term ground lease with Uber. The quality and stability of our cash flow is a truly unique within the REIT industry. Our balance sheet is in an excellent position today and will continue to improve. We remain on track to achieve our leverage goals of 5.3 times to 5.8 times, both on a net debt and net debt plus preferred to adjusted EBITDA. Our fixed charge coverage ratio is strong and north of 4 times and we continue to maintain significant liquidity at $1.8 billion. Our goal remains focused on continuing to improve our long-term cost of capital to support our strategic goals. Our capital allocation strategy will remain disciplined and will focus on adding significant value through selective high-quality development and redevelopment projects at solid returns on our total investment. Our goal is to be in a position to decide project by project to meet the demand of some of the most innovative entities in the world. During the second quarter, we issued 2.1 million shares through our \u2013 at the market common stock offering program at about $119 per share. This was a very efficient capital that will fund significant value creation opportunities through the development of new Class A buildings. Our current ATM program has been completed and we expect to file a new program soon. We still have 4.8 million shares under our forward equity offering from March of 2017 that we will settle over the next two quarters. Our equity capital for 2017 will be spread relatively evenly over the year with slightly higher amounts in the second-half of 2017 versus the first-half of 2017. The equity capital that we are solving for in the remainder of the year is approximately $230 million, including some proceeds from the sales of non-core assets. As a reminder, this assumption along with our usual detailed assumptions included in our guidance for 2017 is disclosed on page five of our supplemental package. In closing, we thank our team for their continued and strong execution quarter-to-quarter. Each of us are excited about the tremendous pace of innovation today and it\u2019s an honor and privilege for each of us to be an important partners to some of the world\u2019s most innovative entities. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Joel. Joel Marcus : Thank you, operator. Let\u2019s go to Q&A please. Operator : All right. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Sheila McGrath with Evercore. Please go ahead. Sheila McGrath : Oh, yes, good afternoon. Joel, I was wondering if you could give us a little more detail or insight on the recent development site acquisition in the Greater Stanford market? Does that require additional entitlements and what are your thoughts on timing? Joel Marcus : Yes, let me ask Steve to comment on that. Stephen Richardson : Sheila, hi, it\u2019s Steve. Sheila McGrath : Hey, Steve. Stephen Richardson : We\u2019ve got \u2013 hey, we\u2019ve two parcels there. One of them is fully entitled, ready to go 500,000 square feet, the other adjacent parcel represents another 500,000 square feet, and we\u2019re estimating it will take about a year for entitlements. And we\u2019re just very excited to be in this cluster. As you know, we dive very deep into these core clusters. We\u2019re tracking just a 1.9% vacancy rate right now there in the lab side, just about 8% on the tech side, very strong demand with about 3 million square feet of lab demand, 3.3 million square feet of tech demand, recent transactions both by lab companies, such as Grail, taking another 47,000 square feet, Amazon\u2019s leased 200,000-plus square feet, as well as Facebook another 200,000 square feet, and very constrained supply with no availability of lab space at all in the near future and really just one other project. So when we put all of of those together, we think we\u2019ve got a really unique offering, where we can provide Class A product in really an urban-type setting at scale, which is again very unique. Sheila McGrath : Okay, great. And as a follow-up, just you did put out a press release during the quarter on increased focus in the Research Triangle market. I was wondering if you could talk about that opportunity there? And are development yields expected to be higher than the 7%, given land costs are lower? Dean Shigenaga : Yes, Sheila, the press release we issued on July 5th talked about the site on Cornwall, as we\u2019ve now renamed that five laboratory way, I guess, and it\u2019s made up about 70% lab and about 30% greenhouse. We\u2019ve got \u2013 right now we\u2019re both marketing and trading paper and proposals with a sizable amount of quite a number of entities that could, in fact, fill the whole thing, obviously, too early to tell, but we\u2019re very optimistic. We think yields are pretty strong in that market. But remember, although, land costs are lower, rents are lower. But we do think, as the press release mentioned, there really is nowhere in the country that has become a hub for the second part of human health disease you\u2019re well focused on in our core clusters. But the issue of food and hunger, we really haven\u2019t dealt with in any market in a constructive way. And so we\u2019ve felt based on what we\u2019ve seen over the last five years, we try to be trend makers rather than trend seekers. And our work over the last five years has indicated that the Research Triangle Park region will be the kind of the center of the universe for AgTech and new innovation in ag, because feeding and increasing population is going to be really tough. Peter Moglia : Yes. Hey, Sheila, it\u2019s Peter Moglia. I can tell you one of the things that was really appealing with this transaction was that, we were able to buy an improved campus. So we\u2019ve got a lot of infrastructure that was already there. Our investment will be in a more reconfigure it and modernize it, and I think our basis is roughly around $50 a foot going into it. So it gives us an allowance to really create a great place for the AgTech industry to center around in that area and allow us to make returns that should exceed our 7% goals. Joel Marcus : Yes, and as we said, we own and operate about 1 million square feet in that market today and have about another 1 million square feet for future development, we\u2019re about 98% leased and we have a pretty nice roster of both life science, but particularly agricultural technology kind of companies. So\u2026 Sheila McGrath : Okay, great. Thank you. Joel Marcus : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Manny Korchman with Citi. Please go ahead. Emmanuel Korchman : Good afternoon. Just wondering what sort of the increase in potential development or growth in the pipeline, how you\u2019re thinking about speculative development if you have any sort of pre-leasing goals in mind before going ground up on any of these projects? Joel Marcus : Yes. So we haven\u2019t done any speculative development since the financial crisis. Our view of the world is so far we don\u2019t really need to do that. We are working in a number of locations to prepare sites and the foundation work and so forth. But in hopefully, all cases, we want to have a level of pre-leasing before we go vertical. We did that in New York with the West Tower, I think, there we only had 15%. But that was important, because we had a time, where costs were very favorable to the developer and we had a chance to snag gross. So I think it\u2019s so dependent in each market at a level, so I don\u2019t want to give out some onto this level for the overall markets. But I think it\u2019s fair to say, we look at each market and feel like, we\u2019ll develop kind of an approach based on the demand and supply in that market. Emmanuel Korchman : Great. And then, Joel, just switching to New York for a second Any updates on the conversations on the city about the North Tower? Joel Marcus : We\u2019re still continuing those conversations and we\u2019re very optimistic, but don\u2019t have anything to announce at this moment. Emmanuel Korchman : That\u2019s it for me. Thank you. Joel Marcus : Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Jamie Feldman : Thank you. You guys put out an 8-K in early July talking about April 2018, Joel moving to an Executive Chairman position. Can you talk about \u2013 Joel, can you talk about what that means for the day-to-day for you, and what you think will be different in that role? Joel Marcus : Yes, so\u2026 Jamie Feldman : And then how we shall be thinking about backfilling your spot? Joel Marcus : Yes. So I think, if you think about, I don\u2019t know what your work week is like, but I\u2019m a kind of a 24/7 guy. And if you take just hours focused on daily work plus travel, that\u2019s probably very much an 24/7 effort. And I think it\u2019s fair to say that, I would continue with more than full time at \u2013 on and after April 1, 2018 and heavily laser focused on growth, we\u2019re putting together a five-year growth plan 2018 through 2022, and to be able to realize what we think will be a tremendous growth period implementing our very unique and special strategy is, what I\u2019m going to be spending my time. So I think, if you think about me, I\u2019d be moving from player to player coach. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then what \u2013 do you expect to join more Boards, or do more things outside the company? I know in recent years you\u2019ve been a little bit more active on that front? Joel Marcus : I think, I assess limits the outside Boards, you\u2019re on a public sense and I\u2019ve been on two biotech Boards for quite a long time. I don\u2019t plan to increase that. And I\u2019ve been involved in a number of Boards historically that i.e., ebb and flow, but I go with what is our moniker is people, passion and purpose. I did join this year the Board of Robin Hood and Mayor Bloomberg asked me to join the Board of the 9/11 Memorial and Museum. So those are two new ones, but I gave up two other nonprofit Boards I was on. So I\u2019ve got a good balance and I\u2019m fully engaged and don\u2019t plan to be any less engaged, I can promise you that. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then when should we expect to hear about any other management changes? Joel Marcus : Probably by year-end. Jamie Feldman : Okay. Joel Marcus : We\u2019ve started just so you know, we started this process at the Board level early last summer actually kicking it off with a full day with Jim Collins, and we\u2019ve been involved both at the Board level and at the company. So we\u2019re \u2013 the process is seamless. It\u2019s fully embraced, and I think it\u2019s excellent. So I\u2019m wholly confident that the company will continue to operate in a fabulous way. Jamie Feldman : Okay. Thank you. Joel Marcus : You\u2019re welcome. Jamie Feldman : And then just shifting gears to the impairment charge, Dean, can you just talk about, I mean, is this something that, if the stock comes back, you take a gain or just how do we think about the permanent of these impairments and then the more we may see just I think this is the first large one we\u2019ve seen so far? Dean Shigenaga : Yes, we\u2019ve actually had a pretty good history of really solid performance on the portfolio of equity security investments. So \u2013 but GAAP requires that you do recognize them from time to time. The impairment write-downs are permanent. But if we do find a liquidity event, Jamie, you could end up in a game downstream. These companies are still in business, which is the important message. This was a valuation adjustment, not a company that died and they\u2019ve roused. So we think we\u2019ll get our money out of these investments at the end of the day. But we have to adhere to the GAAP requirement to take a write-down. Joel Marcus : Yes. And if the stocks go up then, obviously, there would be gain that we would recognize, because the basis is written down. Jamie Feldman : Okay. All right. Thank you. Joel Marcus : Yes. Operator : Next question comes from Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Please go ahead. Tom Catherwood : Thank you. Good afternoon. Switching over to external investments, this quarter you bought an operating asset on Page Mill Road in 3Q was that you closed then two assets in the Route 128 Corridor, all of those deals were done at \u2013 what looks like some pretty strong valuation. How do you get comfortable with the pricing on these? And then what do you see is the upside from these deals? Joel Marcus : Yes, if I\u2019m going to ask Tom to comment on the Suburban Massachusetts just kind of broadly how we think about that? Thomas Andrews : Sure. This is a Tom Boston office, and we acquired earlier, I guess, the last month A two building asset of about 200,000 square feet, which presents an upside opportunity to couple of factors. One is, we think the existing leases in the operating portion of the asset, it\u2019s about 70% leased at the moment. We think those leases are somewhat below market and expect that plan will roll over those leases we\u2019ll have fast and material upside to market rents. And then, about 30% of the building is \u2013 of the asset is currently vacant office space. We have a plan for conversion of that office space into laboratory space. We\u2019ve given market conditions \u2013 relatively tight market conditions right now. We expect that we\u2019ll be able to convert that office space to lab space at a pretty good upside in rents to yields. This property happens to be immediately adjacent to one other 100% lease property that we have in this submarket, both is probably the best suburban sub-market in Greater Boston. It\u2019s with most central, it\u2019s with the most amenities in the area. So we\u2019re very comfortable investing there. Boston Properties is by far the largest landlord of commercial space in Boston and we\u2019re comfortable investing in this location with our number of other life science companies. So we definitely see upside. Joel Marcus : Now I\u2019m going to ask Steve to comment briefly on the Palo Alto acquisition. Stephen Richardson : Tom, hi, it\u2019s Steve. The Stanford Research Park has done exceptionally well over a number of years. We have both a growth of existing companies plus a pretty intense influx of large Fortune 50, Fortune 100 companies coming into the Research Park as their industries are being disrupted. They are absolutely seeing an imperative to be close to Stanford\u2019s engineering talent and the entrepreneurial activity there. So as we look at this asset, we\u2019ve got an investment grade quality tenant on a long-term basis. And for the future, we see upside there as well. So it was a nice blend of a nice accretive acquisition immediately and then long-term upside as well in probably one of the best submarkets in the country. Peter Moglia : Hey, it\u2019s Peter Moglia. I think I\u2019ll add onto Steve\u2019s comments by mentioning, I mean, it\u2019s a 5.5 cap rate on the Palo Alto deal. And if you look at what\u2019s been \u2013 it\u2019s not been a lot trading around the country. I think activity has certainly slowed down. But we do see a lot of things trading in Seattle and the cap rates there for buildings with much lesser lease or credit behind some of these deals in the four category. So to pick something up at a cap rate of 5.5 in the Stanford cluster, we thought even though it might historically be a low cap rate relatively, it\u2019s a pretty good transaction for us. Tom Catherwood : That\u2019s very fair, I appreciate that. And Peter, kind of sticking with your comment on Seattle, when we look at your developments, it looks like 1818 Fairview in Seattle has picked up that extra 9% of potential square footage. You moved 1150 East Lake into the intermediate development projects. This indicate that you\u2019re even more positive on Seattle and kind of trying to put more money to work there? Joel Marcus : So let me maybe just give you a perspective. Yes, we think that the Seattle market, I mean, there isn\u2019t a day goes by that you don\u2019t hear the word Amazon right, and not that we\u2019re focused on Amazon per se. But Amazon\u2019s growth has really impacted many other companies in that market looking for space. And back in 2002 and 2003, when we moved up pretty aggressively into East Lake Union and South Lake Union, in those days, we didn\u2019t have so much capital. But we had made a decision that that was going to be our focal point in the Seattle market. It turned out to be a huge correct call. It\u2019s pretty clear that given our occupancy in that market, the pretty big historic demand in that market that we\u2019re trying to position some of our land bank to move into income-producing over the next few years. Tom Catherwood : Got it. Thank you. Joel Marcus : Yes. Operator : Next question comes from Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. Jed Reagan : Good afternoon, guys. Just a quick follow-up on the Page Mill acquisition, you mentioned some longer-term upside. Is that \u2013 you see a lab plays there eventually and then on the 1 million square foot site in Research Park, is that envisioned that as lab or office? Stephen Richardson : Jed, hey, it\u2019s Steve Richardson. On the Page Mill asset, potentially we could put light lab in that facility, it\u2019s a brand new Class A facility right at a very prominent corner along Page Mill there. But their rent is somewhat below market. So just from a straight mark-to-market basis over time, we expect we\u2019d have upside in a renewable releasing, but that\u2019s certainly down the road. And then shifting on the million square foot campus, we absolutely will be designing robust laboratory shelves, and we\u2019ve been initially chatting with both life science and technology companies. So, stay tuned, we\u2019ll see how we do with either sector. Jed Reagan : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And I guess, sticking on acquisitions, I mean, with some of the deals you\u2019ve struck this year, I mean, it is generally off-market, or are they marketed deals? And for the marketed deals, I mean, how deep are these bidding pools and what is your competition look like? Joel Marcus : I would say, every situation is so different, every market, every deal. And at the beginning of the year, you don\u2019t know generally what may come to market. We\u2019re not typically a \u2013 in the market to acquire assets. We\u2019re a primarily a developer of Class A assets in our urban cluster campuses. But when interesting opportunities come up, we obviously look at them going back to One Kendall, which was pretty heavily marketed. The pool of buyers, I think, we\u2019ve showed, Peter, has a slide on Investor Day that has some 50-plus buyers who\u2019ve invested in somewhere in or around the U.S. in life science assets. So it depends by deal. Peter Moglia : Yes. Hey, Jed, it\u2019s Peter Moglia. I won\u2019t go into the specifics, but out of the five acquisitions, three of them were competitive bids and then two of them were done through relationships that Alexandria had with the principals and we just went directly to them. And in one case, we actually just convinced someone to sell it, and they weren\u2019t really thinking about disposing it at the time, but we made a compelling offer and we\u2019re able to get the asset. Jed Reagan : Great. I appreciate. May just last one for me, just in terms of your disposition plans, can you talk about how much you expect to sell the rest of the year? And maybe any color on which markets you\u2019re targeting? Joel Marcus : No, not a whole lot of color other than these are non-core and we\u2019re working through handful of opportunities. We\u2019ll provide more color as we can over the next quarter. Jed Reagan : And sort of magnitude-wise, dollar value? Joel Marcus : Call it, definitely sub $100 million. Jed Reagan : Okay, great. Thank you. Joel Marcus : Yes, thank you. Operator : Next call \u2013 next question comes from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Richard Anderson : Thanks. Good morning out there. No, good afternoon. So I probably ask a form of this question every quarter. But if there\u2019s any \u201cflaw\u201d to the story, it\u2019s the geographical concentration risk, 61% in two markets. Do you ever give increasing thought to pursuing more of a balance there one way or the other, whether it\u2019s, maybe breaking up Cambridge and San Francisco a bit more, or entertaining a bigger exposure to some of the smaller markets, or is that just too good right now and you\u2019re not inclined to sort of make a move in those directions one way or the other? Joel Marcus : So I think how we look at it is, we\u2019re putting together a five-year growth plan from 2018 through 2022. And I think, as you look out or as we look out in 2022, I don\u2019t want to reveal what the numbers are. But it\u2019s pretty clear that the Greater Boston market will not be as dominant in our asset base as it is today. I think, we see good growth from places like San Diego, Seattle, San Francisco, particularly New York. And so,we\u2019re not too worried about that. And it will self-correct, I think, over the coming five years, and we\u2019ve got a fabulous plan to implement to make that happen. So we\u2019re not obsessed by that. Richard Anderson : Okay, no need to be, obviously, it\u2019s a good problem these days. The other question is, to what degree do you get reverse inquiries from outsiders looking to buy assets from you? And has that been a part of any of your dispositions to to-date, whereas you weren\u2019t necessarily doing it, marketing it, but someone came to you initially? Joel Marcus : Well, we do get, I would say, what we get more than anything, and I\u2019d say, it\u2019s quite often is entities with a lot of capital wanting to team up with us. Richard Anderson : Okay. Joel Marcus : In various locations. I think, that\u2019s more the inquiry as opposed to, do you want to sell some assets? I\u2019d say, that doesn\u2019t happen \u2013 that often. But given our strategy and our game plan and our history, but teaming up with us, I can tell you there are many, many entities that would cherish the thought of teaming up with Alexandria and our brand. Richard Anderson : Okay. And then last question, recent inclusion into the S&P 500, so congratulations for that. And I\u2019m curious if you had any differentiated conversations with investors, new people looking at the space, one thing that\u2019s \u2013 you don\u2019t have much of a comp in the U.S. REIT market. So I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re \u2013 finding yourself educating a wider swath of of investors these days? Joel Marcus : Yes, I\u2019d say, the two types of investors we\u2019ve seen, I think, Dean and I have seen and others have seen over the past three months, six months, 12 months would be one non-dedicated investors certainly looking at this space and particularly our company, which offers a combination of both growth and income, which is attractive, given the market is a bit frenetic and certainly has been led by the technology sector. And I think, the other is, foreign capital looking to buy not so much even direct assets, but stock in the company, because they see it in a very strong growth sector. So I think, those are the two groups that we\u2019ve seen over the past probably six to 12 months. Richard Anderson : How about inquiries from biotech investors that are looking for a proxy to their space? Joel Marcus : Yes, we\u2019ve tried that approach for many, many years. We present at JPMorgan, we present at Cowen, we present at \u2013 we did at UBS recently. But it seems to me, those are probably a handful of people as opposed to a wave. So I don\u2019t think those have turned the needle. Richard Anderson : Okay, great. Thanks very much. Joel Marcus : You\u2019re welcome. Thanks, Rich. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Next question is a follow-up from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Jamie Feldman : Thank you. I just wanted to focus on San Diego. I think, you had mentioned it was your busiest leasing market in the quarter. Are you seeing a turn there, or a real pick up there? I now that you and others are really focusing your attention in that market, it sounds like [Multiple Speakers]. Joel Marcus : Yes, good afternoon, Jamie. I wouldn\u2019t say, there\u2019s a big shift in what\u2019s happened. We just had a couple big leases that took a while to consummate, one being Takeda, and then Lab Corp, the other one took a little while. I think, we\u2019ve been pretty happy, though, with a consistent steady demand when I look at our properties and availabilities. We basically have activity on every single one of them. So I think that\u2019s sort of the combination of both sort of our position in the marketplace and I think in overall pretty healthy circumstances in San Diego. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then finally for me, as you look ahead to 2018 and your lease expiration schedule, are there any large move-outs you know about, or any tenants that maybe moving out that we should be aware off? Joel Marcus : Yes, so the only two that we have and both are actually pretty nice opportunities of any moment would be 681 Gateway, which is Roche/Genentech, that\u2019s all office building. But when we built it, it\u2019s a lab-ready shell, as Steve knows well, and the team knows well. We\u2019ve got some ability there to add FAR under that site. So we think that would be a prime conversion to much higher yielding lab building, that\u2019s about 120, what is that? Dean Shigenaga : 126,000 Joel Marcus : 126,000-plus an additional 15,000 to 30,000, and the other one is in Dan\u2019s market 9880 Campus Point, which is a \u2013 an asset that we leased to Amylin back in the day and that lease rolls during 2018, and we\u2019re going to be doing a full \u2013 that was kind of a specialty building that they put together. So that\u2019s going to be a full lab redevelopment and lab rents today in that area. Dean Shigenaga : $48. Joel Marcus : Yes, $48. So we think we can make a pretty nice yield on those. Those are really the only two that are of moment, the rest are pretty ordinary course. And as you know, our run rate on leasing has been super strong. As Dean mentioned, we\u2019ve extended the leases now 2018, 2019 and 2020. So we\u2019re \u2013 we feel very good about handling the lease rolls for next year 1.3 million, 1.4 million square feet. So \u2013 and the average rents are about below $38. So there\u2019s, I think, very good upside in those roles. Dean Shigenaga : Yes, and Jamie, one additional comment. The largest lease after those two that Joel mentioned drops down to 60,000 square feet or less from that point. Jamie Feldman : Okay. How big did you say the Amylin leases? Dean Shigenaga : It\u2019s about 81,000. Jamie Feldman : Okay. Joel Marcus : Yes, so nothing of any big significance. Jamie Feldman : And will both of those projects go into your redevelopment pipeline so as long as you hit occupancy? Joel Marcus : 681 will be a conversion, because it is office currently, and 9880 would be a renovation project, Jamie. So no, it would not go into the same property, I\u2019m sorry, would stay in same property. Jamie Feldman : Both of them would stay? Joel Marcus : No, 681 would be a redevelopment would come out and convert from office to lab. And 9880 would be a renovation and stay in same property results. Jamie Feldman : Got it. Okay, all right. Thank you. Joel Marcus : Yes, but the demand for both those \u2013 in both those submarkets super strong these days. So we\u2019re pretty \u2013 we\u2019re actually happy to get 681 back and move from office to lab in the South San Francisco market and in San Diego, Dan has got more than \u2013 more demand than he can deal with at the moment in the UTC market. Operator : Next question is a follow-up from Manny Korchman with Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Bilerman : Hey, sorry about that. It\u2019s Michael Bilerman here with Manny. Joel, I\u2019m just curious that going down the valley, how much of that is sort of views on San Francisco Prop M entitlements, pricing in San Francisco and the desire to move further afield? Joel Marcus : Yes, I don\u2019t think we view it that way. I think we view it as we have \u2013 actually our view has always been that we wanted to get out of Alameda in the early days when we had space kind of our legacy pre-IPO. We have always focused kind of from the city down to Palo Alto. We\u2019ve always felt that that was kind of the sweet spot of life science in the Bay Area. And what\u2019s emerged, remember, when we started, there was no life science in Mission Bay. In fact, when we went out in 2005 to meet with a lot of people, they actually didn\u2019t believe anything would happen there. SoMa was never really in play in those days. It was Genentech South San Francisco, and then obviously, Palo Alto through spinouts outo f Stanford. So we\u2019ve always viewed the valley from the city down to the Stanford area as really core of what we do. I think, today, when you can assemble a big campus with large leasing opportunities there, you have to pay attention to those. So I consider those all pretty integral parts of that submarket or set of submarkets. Michael Bilerman : And where does Prop M entitlement stand in relation to $88, I mean, and how you think that\u2019s going to play out? Joel Marcus : Yes. Stephen Richardson : Yes, Michael, it\u2019s Steve. Yes, the expectation now is the city did receive a lot of comments on the initial draft, i.e., our plan for Central SoMa. They expect to bring that to the Board during the spring of 2018 for certification. So at that point, the projects that are in the queue would start receiving allocation. Our expectation is that politically it\u2019s going to make a lot more sense for a number of projects to receive a phased allocation. Most of these projects can be phased. So Phase one for a number of projects brings community benefits on the front-end to the city, which is critically important. So we don\u2019t think that any one project will receive all of its Prop M allocation. But instead a number of projects starting later in 2018 will start receiving their Phase one Prop M allocations. Michael Bilerman : Okay. And then just last one, just Jeol, as you transition next year to Executive Chairman, I guess, is that set in stone or could that be sort of pushed further in? And then you talked a lot about how you will continue to be actively involved in Alexandria and being in that player coach. I guess, how will your time shift in the public market activities role that you serve? Joel Marcus : Well, we\u2019ll see how it plays out, I think, unless my Corbett asked me to take over research at Citi, I\u2019ll probably stay here and beat 777. But I don\u2019t think it will shift that much. Although, I think I will have less facing with investors and analysts. But now I do some of that, but Dean, and Steve, and Tom, and Peter, and Dan, and a number of other people do certainly a big bulk of that anyway. But I think where my time will be super invested in my 24/7 style will be on this growth plan and making it work and executing it. So, \u2013 but I don\u2019t think, you\u2019ll see any huge demand \u2013 dramatic shifts. Michael Bilerman : And this growth finally would be put out to the street at Investor Day in December? Joel Marcus : I wouldn\u2019t say for all five years. You\u2019ll see the first-year and a little peek of what\u2019s to come after that. Michael Bilerman : Okay. All right. Thanks so much. Joel Marcus : You\u2019re welcome. I don\u2019t think, we\u2019re ready to give 2022 guidance yet. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks. Joel Marcus : Thank you, everybody, for your time today. We appreciate it and we\u2019ll look forward to talking to you on our third quarter call probably the end of October. Take care. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz with Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Paula Schwartz : Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I now would like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus. Please go ahead, Joel. Joel Marcus : Thanks, Paula, and welcome everybody to our third quarter call. With me today are Dean Shigenaga; Steve Richardson; Peter Moglia; Dan Ryan; and Tom Andrews. The Harvard Business Review, September/October 2017, had a really great quote that seems to exemplify this quarter's performance and it is neither great leadership nor brilliant strategy matters without operational excellence. And so to the women and men of the Alexandria family, thanks to each and every one of you from the bottom of my heart for a truly great third quarter 2017, a truly operational excellence. Some of the notable accomplishments this quarter, we're pleased that the Green Star designation by GRESB was granted to Alexandria. It's actually quite hard to achieve for laboratory property type that operates 24/7 as opposed to traditional office. And we were given the number one in the United States for health and wellbeing module, a very great kudos to our team in that regard. We're also very proud of our total return to date from IPO through the third quarter of 1211% compared to the RMS of 546% and the S&P 500 at 334%. Common stock dividend is up 8% over last year at this time and the balance sheet as Dean will talk about is in the best shape ever in the history of the company. Revenues for the third quarter and year to date were up about 23%. 50% of our annual revenue is from investment grade tenants, really an industry-leading standard, not standard, but industry-leading stat. Our average lease duration is about 9.4 years, coming from the top 20 tenants which are about 45% of our annual revenue. We made significant progress in bringing down our preferred stock outstanding to now less than about $75 million in the aggregate and we're working hard to achieve over time an upgrade in our investment grade rating. Importantly, our margins were up 200 basis points to 71% from a year ago at this time, Cash same store NOI at 7.8% and leasing spreads per renewal is up 24% GAAP, 10% cash, strong contributions from both San Francisco and Greater Boston. We see we have continuing and consistent strong demand in our key life science markets. On the industry side, the NASDAQ biotech index is up about 18.5% this year. On the NIH funding at about $34 billion is very strong and the Senate currently has a bill to increase that next fiscal year up to $36.1 billion, and the House has a bill, $35.2 billion, so we feel we're in very good shape. The FDA has a new really superb commissioner, Scott Gottlieb, who we hosted about two weeks ago. He's breaking old barriers, less time for approvals, and trying to decrease the cost of clinical trials. All of which will be very, very important for not only the industry, but patients. This year approvals to date 35 and we're on track potential to receive 40 drug approvals. About 46% are Alexandria tenants. Biomedical research this year will contribute on the philanthropy side, about $33 billion to overall funding which is a historic high. And venture capital funding this quarter were almost at $6 billion, the highest quarterly investment ever and on track to break $15 billion for the year for life science venture capital. Worldwide total biopharma R&D is about $160 billion, and according to most IMS stats, to increase about 2.5% per year through 2022, which is a good sign. And also for the first time, U.S. scientists working in a lab had edited disease causing gene mutation out of a human embryo, a real amazing breakthrough and promises to really revolutionize disease treatment. As you recall, for much we said before, there are about 10,000 diseases known to mankind and only about 500 have been addressed medically. So we're at a 5% level really in the early innings. On health insurance, keep the following in mind. About 67.5% are private insurance provided by employer or purchased directly by the consumer, 37.3% are government coverage and about 8.8% are uninsured. That's the playing field for 2016. On external growth, we're on track to deliver this quarter : 510 Townsend to Stripe, whose recent valuation is about $9 billion; 505 Brannan to Pinterest, whose recent valuation is about $12 billion; ARE Spectrum in San Diego to Vertex, one of the best NASDAQ performers of the year, market cap today is about $36 billion; and the balance, 400 Dexter, we hope to conclude soon to Juno Therapeutics, whose recent valuation is about $5 billion. On Page 36 of the supplemental, the projects we're delivering in 2018, 2019 are going well. 399 Binney, we're actually almost fully spoken for. 266 and 275 Second Avenue, pretty much fully leased, it was a tenant driven acquisition. Our Mission Bay towers for Uber, 100% leased there. Our 213 East Grand Avenue project, 100% leased to Merck. Our 279 East Grand Avenue in San Francisco, we're about 50% in negotiations with current tenant. 681 Gateway, which we look forward to getting back next year in South San Francisco to move from office to laboratory in a pretty hot market, so we're very much forward - looking forward to redeveloping that and re-leasing it. Our project at 9625 Town Centre Drive, 100% leased at Takeda. Our project at 1818 Fairview, before we go vertical, we're hoping to land an important tenant. Our 9900 Medical Centre Drive, a situation that we're trying to expand our core campus in the Rockville/Maryland location. And 5 Triangle Drive, we're about 40% in negotiations with a range of important tenant, so things are actually moving very, very well. On the acquisition side, we completed three acquisitions of note, one in Route 128 I just referred to, does specifically meet a tenant requirement. The acquisition in South San Francisco as well to specifically meet a tenant requirement, and Rockville acquisition do expand our key campus in Rockville. We will continue to make strategic acquisitions as appropriate, as we move forward through the fourth quarter and in the 2018. And let me turn it over to Dean. Dean Shigenaga : Thanks, Joel. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased with our continued strong execution by our team, again, quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. And remain on track to deliver 9.3% growth in FFO per share as adjusted for 2017. We are in an excellent position today in five key areas : First, continued solid internal growth; second, continued solid and disciplined external growth; third, solid real estate and life science industry fundamentals; fourth, solid execution supported by a strong balance sheet; and fifth, an exceptional team led by highly experienced group of senior leaders that continue to execute and deliver exceptional results. We've continued solid internal growth driven by the quality of our buildings, locations and strength of the real estate and life science industry fundamentals. In the third quarter, leasing volume was solid at 787,000 rentable square feet, in light of minimal contractual lease expirations. Rental rate growth was strong, and up 24.2% and 10% on a cash basis. The strong rental rate growth on leasing activity in the quarter will have limited benefit in the fourth quarter since most of the rental rate increases will commence in 2018. Year-to-date, we executed 3.2 million rentable square feet of leasing, this activity included 1.9 million square feet of lease renewals and re-leasing of space, 61% of which was represented by early lease renewals related to contractual lease expirations in 2018, 2019 and 2020. Fundamentals in our submarkets remain very solid and continue to drive solid growth in net effective rents. Leasing commissions and tenant improvements on lease renewals and re-leasing of space have remained minimal in 2017 as well as the prior year in 2016, and overall have remained very consistent year-to-year. Importantly, the growth in net effective rents in 2017 over 2016 reflects the growth in rental rates and it's not impacted by concessions. Same property NOI performance continues to generate consistently solid growth. Third quarter same property NOI growth was up 2.2% and 7.8% on a cash basis. Quarterly same property results may range a bit from time-to-time as compared to the results for a 12 month period. Year-to-date 2017 same property NOI growth was 2.3% and 6.2% on a cash basis. And we're on track to meet our guidance of up 2% to 4%, and up 5.5% to 7.5% on a cash basis for 2017. Key drivers of our solid and high-quality same property cash NOI growth include contractual rent escalations in 95% of our leases, averaging about 3%. High quality and stable cash flows from a REIT industry-leading tenant roster with 50% of our annual rental revenue from investment-grade tenants. And lastly, strong real estate and life science industry fundamentals driving continued rental rate growth on leasing activity. EBITDA margins are very solid at 68% and reflect improvement over many quarters, primarily due to the growth in the scale of our business and improvement in the quality of our asset base with recently completed development of Class A properties. We remain on track to hit our goals with our development and redevelopment projects in 2017. We are also on track with $91 million of our target $100 million of incremental net operating income commencing in 2017, with the remaining $8 million commencing in the first quarter of 2018 related to four recently executed leases, aggregating about 91,000 square feet at 100 Binney Street. Briefly on 100 Binney Street, 79% of that project was placed in service in late September. The returns are very strong and are up from our initial forecast. We're now expecting an initial stabilized cash yield of 7.4%, highlighting the significant value our team has generated from this Class A facility leased to some of the most innovative entities in the world. Improvement in yields were driven by both better-than-forecasted rental rates and a significant reduction in cost at completion. 75% of the cost reductions were driven by changes in the final design and use, and 25% from solid execution from our team on proactive management of a very high quality and innovative development project. Our development pipeline and redevelopment projects undergoing construction as of 9/30 consisted of the following. 1.5 million rentable square feet is highly leased at 81% and represents about 1.2 billion at completion, which includes about $540 million of cost to complete. We've got very solid initial cash yields averaging approximately 7% on our total investment and these amounts include 651,000 square feet that is 97% leased and on track for delivery in the fourth quarter. Our team is also working diligently on leasing, marketing and preconstruction on another 1.3 million square feet spread across four development projects and one future redevelopment project. We have not yet commenced aboveground construction on these projects that are on average 45% committed and are expected to generate very solid initial cash yields of approximately 7%. Turning briefly to net asset value. Certain of our development and redevelopment projects that were recently placed in the service have contractual rents aggregating $70 million that have not yet commenced. $60 million will commence through the next five quarters through third quarter of 2018 as follows about $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, and then $23 million, $14 million, and $13 million in the first, second and third quarter of 2018. Free rent periods on our pipeline of projects delivered in the third quarter and projects currently under construction generally range from three to six months with a few exceptions. Importantly, contractual cash rents will commence fairly quickly after these projects are placed into service. Our balance sheet is in an excellent position today, we remain on track to achieve our leverage goals of 5.3 times to 5.8 times, both on net debt and a net debt plus preferred to adjusted EBITDA. Our fixed-charge coverage ratio was also very strong and north of 4 times, and liquidity is very significant at $1.7 billion. We continue to focus on improvement in our long-term cost to capital and maintaining significant liquidity for flexibility to execute our strategic goals. In 2016 and year-to-date 2017, we redeemed or repurchased 293 million of preferred stock at weighted average annual dividend on those securities at about 6.7%. The retirement of preferred stock was part of our overall strategy to improve our capital structure and our balance sheet leverage. However, I should also mention that we believe, it's appropriate to utilize preferred stock as a source of capital. But for the moment, it was important to retire these securities. During the third quarter, we issued 2.1 million shares through our aftermarket common stock offering program at about $120 per share. This efficient capital will be utilized to fund significant value creation opportunities through the development of new Class A buildings. Additionally, we also will settle our outstanding forward equity sale agreements that represent about 4.8 million shares, and we'll settle that in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, our usual detailed assumptions included in our guidance for 2017 is disclosed on Page 5 of our supplemental package. We narrowed our range of guidance for FFO per share is adjusted to a range of $6.01 to $6.03 with no change in the midpoint of $6.02. Briefly let me point out couple of comments for certain models out there, common shares outstanding as of 9/30 was 94.3 million shares. And we have about 4.8 million shares under the forward equity sale agreements that we anticipate settling here in the fourth quarter. And that will be added to the outstanding share count. Also, G&A expense as a percentage of total assets and total revenues have been improving and was approximately 0.64% and 6.8% respectively. We will provide guidance for 2018 earnings per share and FFO per share, along with detailed underlying assumptions at our annual investor day event on November 29. And therefore, we're unable to comment on details of our 2018 guidance until then. Keep in mind that real estate and life science industry fundamentals remain very solid, providing for a great operating environment going forward. In closing, we are pleased with the continued strong results. We remain on track with our current pipeline of projects that are highly leased and have a great balance sheet to support our strategic goals and have an excellent team and senior leaders that drive strong execution. With that, I'll turn it back to Joel. Joel Marcus : Operator, we'll go to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will begin the question-and-answer session at this time. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Sheila McGrath with Evercore. Please go ahead. Sheila McGrath : Yes, good afternoon. Joel, I was wondering if you could give us some insight on the revisions upward on the leasing spreads, how much of that was driven by tenants wanting to renew earlier than expiration? And do you see this trend continuing? Joel Marcus : Yeah, let me have Dean comment on that, Sheila. Dean Shigenaga : Hey, Sheila, it's Dean here. Yes, the key drivers of the growth in leasing or rental rate growth in the current quarter was driven primarily by early lease renewals. Like I said in prior quarters, it's pretty difficult to project early leasing activity on renewals. It's really contingent on the tenants' needs. But 61% of our re-leasing activity this year was driven by early renewals that go out over one to three years forward beyond the current year. Looking forward, I suspect we'll continue to have opportunities. But they're really hard to predict and project at the moment. Joel Marcus : But I think that underlines a - I think in a number of the key markets the tenants focus on trying to lock down space at current fair market rental rates and not kind of play the lottery for the future. And I think that bodes well for us. Sheila McGrath : Okay. Great, and then, just as a follow-up, on the - I think this is guidance related for you, Dean. On the 91,000 square feet to be placed in service in first quarter, for 100 Binney, is that part of the driver of the higher capitalized interest in fourth quarter that you cite in kind of the footnote on guidance? Dean Shigenaga : Yeah, Sheila, so the comment on our guidance page on Page 5, as it relates to being on the upper end of our range guidance for capped interest and on the lower end of the range for interest expense in net, which is the number reported on the income statement. It's actually really related to the acquisition of future value-creation opportunities. I think the way to think about it Sheila is, as we acquire future value-creation projects, we're required to capitalize interest while we entitle the project. But these projects are actually funded with long-term capital and because by and large there is very little to no income at the moment, we equity fund the acquisitions. So we have growth in capped interest, but no corresponding growth in interest cost. But the third point I'd probably make is that when you think about FFO per share, it's basically relatively neutral to earnings, because you're getting about a 4% yield from the capped interest on the investment. But you're having to equity fund that long-term for the moment. Sheila McGrath : Okay. Thank you. Joel Marcus : Thanks, Sheila. Operator : The next question will be from Manny Korchman with Citi. Please go ahead. Emmanuel Korchman : Hey, guys, good afternoon. Maybe going back to just tenant growth plans and so the way they're approaching space, given the tight markets you operate in, sort of how are tenants thinking about the space they're going to need? And in those situations where they look around and there is just nothing new coming, how are they solving for that sort of need without having new space to build into? Joel Marcus : Okay. So maybe let me ask Steve to address that. Stephen Richardson : Yeah, hi, Manny, it's Steve. Yeah, a good example is the recent renewal and expansion that we had in Mission Bay with an existing tenant. It was in fact an early renewal, but it was also in combination with an expansion. So where we had existing tenants in place adjacent to this one dominant anchor tenant, they've gone ahead and committed at the end of the expiration of the adjacent tenant's terms to go ahead and expand into that space and through the long-term lease. So we're seeing a combination of - as Joel mentioned, locking down space, but then also controlling adjacent space for expansion. Thomas Andrews : Yeah, Manny, it's Tom. Manny, it's Tom Andrews. I'll expand on that little bit too. I mean, in Cambridge, certainly, it's a very, very tight market. The current lab vacancy in East Cambridge is only about 1.5%. And so consequently, we're seeing tenants and their brokers get out into the market sooner than they normally would to look at their options for space. We're certainly seeing some tenants select different sub-markets, whether they're sub-urban or other urban sub-markets other than East Cambridge, because of the tightness of the market. And we see some tenants try to figure out growth strategies that involve maybe trying to do some of their work remotely and having multiple locations. Sometimes it's a suburban location and an urban location together. So, tenants are doing different things to try to solve, and we're obviously working closely with our group of tenants and the prospects there in the market to try to help them solve their - for their space needs. Emmanuel Korchman : Thanks for that. And then, Joel, maybe one for you, just in terms of succession, it's a topic we've spoken about on our prior calls. Can you give us an update on when we might find out more? Is it going to be at the Investor Day or do we need to wait until next year to find out sort of more on that plan? Joel Marcus : I think I've said, I mean, that's a board ultimately timing decision et cetera and sometime on or before March 31, but you'll see, it will be totally seamless, so it should be great. As I said, we've been in the process for over two years, been coached by Jim Collins and we're very comfortable with the kind of the process. Emmanuel Korchman : Okay. Thanks, everyone. Joel Marcus : Yeah, thank you. Operator : Our next question will be from Rich Anderson of Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Richard Anderson : Thanks. Good afternoon. When you have Pinterest, Stripe and Uber, including them I guess up and running, where does your tech exposure get you to as a percentage of the total portfolio? And maybe describe your level of comfort at that range. Dean Shigenaga : Rich, it's Dean Shigenaga here. The percentage will creep up a little bit as we approach the end of the year. But I think all in all, you've got so much growth coming on line over the portfolio that it will mute that impact a little bit. We're probably going to approach somewhere around 10%. I don't have the exact statistic in front of me, but it's in that general range, Rich. Joel Marcus : Yeah, in general, we meet with the - because they're all private companies. We meet with the companies quarterly, the senior management teams. Lot is written about each of these companies. They're well known. We think each one is a highly disruptive or disrupter in their space that is not a flash in the pan. These are not dot-com companies from the last generation. Stripe has proven itself to be an amazingly broad-based company with amazing talent. I think Pinterest as well. Uber, you read a lot about, I think once they get their self-straight at the board level, I think they brought in a new CEO that I think will be able to rationalize the company. It's certainly is an important company and one that - whether it's worth $70 billion or $55 billion, I don't think it's much of an issue. I think what they're doing in the marketplace and how they continue to execute, we see in their markets, I think is a testament to the company. But obviously, we pay a lot of attention to these companies and we have on staff several people who have our trained engineers and underwriters. So we're pretty good at understanding these companies be on the financial - I mean, any company obviously look at management, you look at financial strategy and you look at the niche, and so we pay a lot of attention to that. Richard Anderson : Well, Pinterest is definitely disrupting my household, I'll say that\u2026 Joel Marcus : Your wife's busy on that, right? Richard Anderson : This year, you combined asset sales and equity issuances as a one line item in your guidance, and most of that is come through equity channels, not to kind of tap you for in 2018 guidance number. But it seems to me, much to sell from a property perspective. Is that correct? I'm not looking for a guidance number, but just wondering, is there a non-core portfolio that's brewing behind the scenes that we're not seeing right now. Joel Marcus : Well, I think, there is always a few odds and ends that are some legacy assets. We do hope to extricate ourselves from China and few other assets. But I think, the joint venture route is one that always - we used that pretty heavily a couple of years ago. So I think, we have multiple options out there. And we feel pretty good about, where we are today. Richard Anderson : Okay. And last question. Drug company stocks have done okay, in terms of business, but their stocks have taken a little bit of a hit lately. I don't know if that's an Amazon risk about them getting into the business. I'm just curious, Joel, if you have a view about Amazon entering the business and being a disruptor, so to speak, and if that weighs on your mind at all at this point. Joel Marcus : Yeah, I think, that's focused. I mean, pharmaceutical sales at the end point retail pharmacy sales are kind of where they're looking to disrupt. And so that's different than research driven manufacturers. And I've always thought that current system is pretty inefficient, when you have PBMs, the pharmacy benefit managers between the manufacturers and the ultimate users and so forth. So I think, to me, I think, it's going to rationalize the system. But I don't think that's weighed so much on drug stocks, I think, each one has been somewhat individual. Celgene made a pretty major change in their 2020 guidance on overall revenues, Merck had an EU issue with Keytruda, their new cancer drug. I mean, each one is kind of the explainable. As I said, Vertex has kind of knocked the ball out of the park this year. A recent M&A transaction Kite, was purchased by Gilead for almost $12 billion, and just got approval on the second cancer immunotherapy. So I think, we're pretty comfortable, the index, at least, on the biotech side is up, it was at almost 19% year-to-date, which is certainly outpaced many of the other industries. So I think, we feel pretty good, I think, the regulatory side is super positive with Scott Gottlieb. I think, the tenor [ph] in Washington is constructive, and I think, there is a positive business climate behind it. And if the - whatever shape the current tax bill takes place and we're able to - the industry is able to repatriate both at the biotech and pharma level, hundreds of billons of dollars, maybe between $100 billion and $200 billion or more from overseas cash that's going to be a net positive for the industry. So I'm pretty bullish. Richard Anderson : Outstanding. Thanks very much. Joel Marcus : Yeah. Thanks, Rick. Operator : The next question will be from Jamie Feldman of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Jamie Feldman : Great. Thank you. I guess, just taking with Richard's question or a similar topic. Just to throw into that, how do you think about the risk of just pharmaceutical pricing and all the rhetoric around trying to take pricing levels down? And how that will\u2026 Joel Marcus : Well, the reality is, drugs account for only about 10% to 15% of total healthcare spend, and they're the only sector that actually can drive cost down. Hepatitis C is a great example that disease is now curable. The problem is, and the reason that there was a lot of concern about, when Gilead came out with their cure product, Sovaldi, was that insurance companies, they capture you as a patient for a year. And if they have the choice of buying a cure for you or just maintaining you, because you maybe in somebody's health plan next year, what do you think they're going to do? So it's less the price of the drug, because it's clear, if you can cure a disease, the downstream cost effect is huge. And then, if you translate that to metabolic diseases, you translate that to neurodegenerative diseases, imagine if we could cure, prevent or treat effectively Alzheimer's, dementia, the cost of the system way weigh down. So I'm not too worried that, ultimately, high-quality drugs are going to make measurable impacts, are going to be well received in the system. The system needs some changing and the intermediaries are part of this issue that disaggregate, because PBMs typically want to see higher drug prices, so they can increase their margins on sale, because they get a benefit of the difference between the drug price and what ultimately the list price and what they sell it at. So there's a number of misaligned incentives. And so it's the drug companies, the pharmacy benefit, managers and the manufacturers - the research manufacturers are able to kind of align themselves, and I think the system is going to actually work really well. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then the net effect is no dollar is getting squeezed out of - on your side of the business? Joel Marcus : Yeah. I mean, the problem with the industry historically has been a lot of companies have historically just had incremental products that they extend life three months, five months, six months, 10 months. That's not a real important drug. And I think those will fall by the wayside, as they should. Jamie Feldman : Okay. That's helpful. You guys mentioned net effective rent growth up year-over-year. Can you just talk through the major markets and how much you think it is up year-over-year and whether you think that growth is sustainable? Dean Shigenaga : Well, sustainable is always a fun one to talk about and predict the future, Jamie. So maybe I'll just say that fundamentals remain solid, which is a great backdrop to enter into and going forward. But if you think about Cambridge, Mission Bay, South San Francisco, and even down in San Diego, I'd say, on average, you're upper - you're almost at top of the single-digit range for year-over-year growth in net effective rent. But what I also mentioned in my commentary that's important is TIs and leasing commissions are fairly nominal on leasing renewals and releasing a space. So the net effective rent, you're seeing is really growth in rental rate, but they're one and the same as far as the growth year-over-year. So concessions are not impacting our markets today. Jamie Feldman : Okay. How much are construction costs up over that same time? I know, they're less of an impact for your TIs, but just generally? Joel Marcus : 6% on average. That may vary in New York, maybe higher because of Hudson Yards and some of the big projects. But by and large, I think, we've given that number before, I think, across the country, we'd say 6% would be a reasonable average. Dean Shigenaga : Yeah, unfortunately, Jamie, as we talked about on my commentary, the pipeline under construction and the pipeline that we have to lease right behind at about 1.3 million square feet that's really near-term stuff, we're still projecting about 7% overall cash yield on our total investment. So rents are definitely keeping up or outpacing the cost of construction for us. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then last for me, the 279 East Binney, you mentioned a tenant, I think, you said in the portfolio that's interested in that space. Would that leave some space behind? Joel Marcus : I'm sorry. You may have misspoke. 399 Binney or 279 East Grand? Jamie Feldman : I wrote it down quickly. Joel Marcus : I thought you said 279 East Binney. Jamie Feldman : I may have. The project where you said, you've got a tenant who's looking at 50% of the space and but be coming from the portfolio. Joel Marcus : Yeah, that's the current tenant, a Google subsidiary fairly whose in the campus. Jamie Feldman : So they'd just be expanding? Joel Marcus : That's correct. Jamie Feldman : Got it. Okay. All right. Thank you. Joel Marcus : You're welcome. Thanks, Jamie. Operator : The next question will be from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Michael Carroll : Yeah, Joel, how do you notice an uptick in competition, when acquiring and developing high-quality lab space, particularly from the other REITs, so just seeing that several REITs have recently highlighted the new focus on the lab space? Joel Marcus : Yeah, I don't think, it's any different that we've seen over the last couple of years. Every market, there's a different set of competitors for different reasons, doing different things. I think, our view of the world is, we try to do, what we do and be the best in the world at it, and not be distracted by outside issues. And in underwriting, if we can't get to where we are, we don't buy it or build it. And so I think, that's how we continue to operate. Michael Carroll : Okay. And you're not seeing any increased competition from outside the REIT pool has been pretty much the same over the past few years? Joel Marcus : Yeah, I mean, I think it varies from time-to-time. I mean, I think, we still see there has been, although, maybe less this year than last year a large pool of private capital, particularly from overseas or the pension funds, I think, that's waned a little bit this year. But, if you have - if you're an institutional investor and you have - you need to put money to work, you're going to gravitate to the great markets. So there's not a surprise about that. Michael Carroll : Okay, great. And then, Dean, off of Sheila's question earlier, I know, you have been highlighting over the past several years that tenants are electing to renew their leases early when they have an expiration in a few years out. I mean, has that started to wane? I mean, have you pooled a lot of those tenants forward already? Or is that still pretty strong? Dean Shigenaga : Well, I think, if you look at the mix of early renewals going back several years, Michael, it's typically our leasing activity for renewals and re-leasing a space has been about equal or to maybe a 50% greater number of volume wise relative to the contractual expirations at the beginning of the year. So typically, we're anywhere from 7% to 10% with contractual expirations. The renewals are doubling that number. So we're getting anywhere from 15% to 20% of the portfolio being attacked annually through leasing activity. So we historically have had this recurring volume in recent years. Hard to predict the future, but it's been pretty consistent. Michael Carroll : Okay, great. Thank you. Joel Marcus : Yeah. Thanks, Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. Joseph Reagan : Hey, good afternoon, guys. In terms of the mark-to-market rent spreads, the increased guidance gets you to about 12% or so - for this year at the midpoint. Is that a fair estimate where you'd say the overall portfolio sits relative to market today? Stephen Richardson : Jed, hey, it's Steve Richardson. Yeah, that's roughly in line the overall portfolio gap is a little north of 10% there, so that's pretty consistent. Joseph Reagan : Okay. That's helpful. And I think, you guys mentioned that 399 Binney is almost spoken for. Have you gotten incremental leasing done beyond the 73% of LOIs that was talked about in the supplemental? Joel Marcus : Well, I think almost all of the spaces under lease negotiation Tom can give you some further color. Thomas Andrews : Yeah, the 73% reflects the three signed letters of intent that we have right now that we hope to convert into leases over the next few weeks. Joseph Reagan : And then there are additional conversations beyond that? Joel Marcus : Yeah, I mean, I'll just let Tom speak in a moment. But I think what we were excited about is we saw pretty large demand for 100 Binney. And so, as we kicked off 399, we felt that there was enough momentum in the market that we would see a pretty receptive audience. Tom, you could give other color. Thomas Andrews : Yeah, and at the same time, I'll mention, the balance of the One Kendall Square development, where we have a number of opportunities to convert office space to lab space, also to take leases that are currently well under market and re-tenant them at market rates. We're making good progress on that right now. That is a very active corner of Kendall Square right now, between the 399 Binney new construction and which is just kicking off and the re-develop or the re-tenanting of portions of the balance of the One Kendall Square campus. Joseph Reagan : Okay. I appreciate that. And then, just last one for me. Your capital plan has about $850 million of development spend this year. I know you're not offering specifics on 2018 at this point. But kind of ballpark; is the $850 million sort of a reasonable range of development spend to think about as we go out over the next few years? Dean Shigenaga : No, I don't think it's fair to comment about each of the years going forward over the next few years, Joe. So maybe as it relates to 2018, stay tuned for Investor Day and every few quarters we give a little more color on what the pipeline is starting to look like, which will give you that visibility beyond. But it's a little early to talk about 2019 and 2020. Joseph Reagan : Okay, fair enough, thanks. Joel Marcus : Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Dave Rodgers with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. David Rodgers : Hey, Joel, just wanted to ask about Seattle, you did some leasing at Dexter this quarter. I wasn't sure if that was lab tenant or not. But I realized you don't have a lot of space left there. Are you seeing just the lab tenants pushed out of that market by what's happened in the tech activity or are you seeing any interest in kind of moving further South either into San Francisco or San Diego from that market and do you have any longer term discussions with your tenants there that might be pushing out of the market and looking for somewhere else. Joel Marcus : Well, we did sign a lease there with ClubCorp. I think we indicated that and we're down to a final about 31,000 feet which were in late stages of discussions, which we expect them to take that. They've had some good news based on the Kite acquisition. And the valuation of that company certainly puts in a pretty nice position. I think Seattle is a tough market. It's a super-low cap-rate market, as you know. It's a tight market. The behemoth Amazon obviously has lots of that their home base and lots of activities going on. So I think companies are always looking at opportunities. But I think we see, we have some unique land resources and locations inside Seattle in the best of locations in South and East Lake Union. So I think we're looking forward to meeting the demand of our tenants and maybe even some that are not tenants over the coming few years. I would say people are probably more migrating from the Bay Area to Seattle, then vice versa, given cost of living and tightness in the San Francisco Bay Area. Peter Moglia : Hey, Joel, it's Peter. If you wouldn't mind, I'd like to comment a little bit. One of the things that we have seen even though as Joe mentioned, it's been a slow growth market for lab, we have seen the entrance of Celgene and bluebird into the market and they have steadily increased their presence and they've brought basically the vacancy of Seattle lab to low single digits. There is also a number of large research institutions in Seattle. They've been fairly dormant growing over the past few years and that's been driven by a lack of NIH growth, funding growth. But we are seeing now some potential demand coming from the institutions as well. So I think it's stacking up that Seattle may restart itself a little bit better on the lab side and the fact that the tech industry is in there gobbling up space is probably only good news for rental rates on the lab side. That's it. David Rodgers : Thanks for that color. One more for Dean, Dean, looked like you used some ATM in the third quarter if I saw correctly. But you said, then you have the forward still to settle in the forwards, was that a function of pricing or just some form of execution. I just wanted to understand that better. And then with regard to maybe are you putting that timing around the remaining preferred that's outstanding? Dean Shigenaga : So a couple of questions I think embedded there, the current ATM usage really had to do with an opportunity to fund our needs this year. And so at $120, we felt the cost was attractive. On the forward timing, I think for your model, probably best to think about December and that is more to do with spending anticipated in the quarter. All things equal, those transactions probably simply will be funded mid-quarter. But then we also have earnings contributions from our project deliveries, which are on average about November - I'm sorry, mid to late November on average. So we're just trying to match the timing of the settlement with these other two considerations. David Rodgers : Okay. Thank you. Joel Marcus : Yeah, thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks. Joel Marcus : Thank you all very, very much and we look forward to talking to you about 2018 on Investor Day November 29. Thanks so much. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Also, please note this event is being recorded. I now would like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. Paula Schwartz : Thank you and good afternoon everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The Company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the Company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I now would like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus. Please go ahead, Joel. Joel S. Marcus: Thank you, Paula, and welcome everybody to our fourth quarter and year-end 2017 call. With me today are Dean Shigenaga, Steve Richardson, Peter Moglia, Tom Andrews, and Dan Ryan. So, I started off last call with a Harvard Business Review quote and I'm going to do the same from the January-February 2018 issue about culture; 'Strategy offers the formal logic for a company's goals and orients people around them, but culture expresses the goals through shared values, beliefs and guides activity through shared assumptions and group norms. Culture fosters an organization's capacity to thrive.' So, to the women and men of the Alexandria family whose idea meritocracy and mutual respect culture coupled with our solemn mission to build the future of life-changing innovation, thank you for an operationally excellent fourth quarter and year-end 2017 and thank you for the significant funds raised, funds contributed and countless hours of service to our philanthropic focus, the communities in which we live and do business, groundbreaking biomedical research and military families. And also thank you for the treasure trove of sustainability awards highlighted on Page 42 of our supplemental, which are nothing but really kind of astounding Nareit's Most Innovative award, California's Highest Environmental Honor, World's first WELL Certified Laboratory, GRESB's #1 Health & Well-being company in the U.S., and the first REIT to be named Fitwel Champion. So, I congratulate the entire team on those amazing awards and accomplishments. Alexandria, and Dean will talk more about the details, is positioned well for continued growth. We are projecting 9% growth for 2018 and we clearly have a very clear path, detailed on Investor Day, to potentially double the revenues of the Company over the next five years. The macro fundamentals stay strong, strong demand from highly innovative entities, limited supply, favorable rental rate trends, high occupancy levels, and continued asset valuation strength. The five fundamental pillars positively impacting life science demand continue to remain positive, strong life science venture capital investment, robust NIH funding, favorable FDA regulatory environment, strong medical research philanthropy support, and high levels, very high, all-time high levels of commercial R&D funding. For the first time, our revenues exceeded $1 billion for 2017 and our total market cap touched at the end of the year about $18 billion. So, starting with a $19 million [indiscernible] around 24 years ago, that's a wonderful accomplishment. Our total shareholder return exceeded 20% in 2017 and our total return from IPO through the end of the year was almost 1,350%. So, we're very proud of those accomplishments. Our total asset base in North America approximates 30 million square feet and our high occupancy continues at about 96.8%, more about strong and stable cash flows and the demand for our space in our key markets. We have continued to maintain high operating margins, which are very important, and strong retention rates over the last five years, exceeding 80%. Let me switch now to really focus on the continuing and consistent strong demand in our key life science cluster markets and highlight a little bit about leasing this year. It was our second highest yearly leasing volume ever, 4.6 million square feet, 39% in San Francisco, 26% in Greater Boston, and 18% in San Diego, and broken down about 55% were re-lease and renewals, about 20% previously vacant space, 20% development delivered space, and 5% redevelopment delivered space. We had 12.7% growth in cash rental rates and we expect to exceed that in the coming year. Moving to life science industry itself for a moment, Bill Gates at his keynote at the J.P. Morgan Conference talked about research in biotech and pharma and concluded by saying that the industry is the most important factor for the skills, experience and capacity they have necessary to turn discoveries into commercially viable products, and that remains our critical mission. The biotech index was up about 20-plus-percent in 2017, so another strong year. Venture capital reached a, really set some all-time highs, $20 billion in annual funding, exceeding $15 billion in 2016, which was a nice uptick. The IPO market remained open, 37 deals for about $3.5 billion, and we continue to see that this year will be another strong year for high-quality companies. And already in 2018 we've seen two large merger and acquisition deals announced, Celgene's acquisition of Juno, a tenant of ours in Seattle, and Sanofi's acquisition of Bioverativ, which was a spin-out out of Biogen, another tenant of ours in the Greater Boston area. The FDA really had a banner year. There were 46 new entities who were approved, and if you added those two additional approvals, they marked the modern day record for the FDA, and of the 46 drugs approved, 43% were ARE tenants. In 2017, the FDA approved a record number of drugs with orphan indications and eliminated the entire backlog of pending orphan drug designation requests. The FDA continues to be a world-leading gate-keeping agency. In 2017, 36 of the 46 new molecular entities were in the U.S. before any other country and 15 or 33% were first-in-class drugs, very important. Tax reform is I think going to be a significant boon to the industry. Certainly the reduced corporate tax rates for many of the biopharmaceutical companies will be very positive and the repatriation of earnings will also be very, very significant. So, moving on to additional comments, I'm going to ask Dean to highlight a number of key accomplishments and to give a bit of a roadmap for 2018, then I would come back and do a little bit of a follow-on before we go to Q&A. Dean? Dean A. Shigenaga: Thanks, Joel. Dean Shigenaga here and good afternoon everyone. The combination of solid execution of our unique business strategy and operational excellence led our highly experienced team to deliver on our expectations for a truly outstanding year of operating and financial performance in 2017. We reported FFO per share of $6.02, up 9.3%; really hit our expectations for strong growth for both the fourth quarter and the year; consensus NAV at the end of 2017 was up over 13%, capturing the significant high quality growth in cash flows; and common stock dividends for 2017 were $3.45, up 7%. Internal growth was very strong in 2017 and above our 10-year average cash same property NOI growth of 5%, and I'll touch on this and the next few topics in more detail in a moment. External growth, primarily through ground-up development, was well executed by our team. They delivered a number of great collaborative, innovative spaces on time, under budget and at great returns on our total investment. Our strong multiyear growth engine, when combined with a very strong balance sheet, continues to drive strategic per share growth, and I'll also provide very important and brief comments on our strong outlook for 2018. Touching on key comments on our high-quality, stable and increasing cash flows, as Joel mentioned, our total revenues exceeded $1.1 billion this year, up 22% over 2016. 55% of our annual rental revenue today is generated from tenants that are either investment-grade or have a market capitalization greater than $10 billion. This represents an industry-leading statistic and huge thanks to our science and technology team for their expertise underwriting key industry trends and leading life science and technology entities. Our technology-related tenants for the year, as of year-end represented 11% of our annual rental revenue, 74% of which is generated from either investment-grade or large-cap entities. Cash NOI was up $90 million in 2017 or 15%, driven really roughly by equal contributions from three key areas of our business, strong cash same property net operating income growth of 6.8%, also significant contribution from our pipeline of development and redevelopment projects which included 1.3 million rentable square feet of new Class A buildings that were completed in 2017, and contributions from recent acquisitions primarily One Kendall Square that we acquired in late 2016. All but one acquisition in 2017 was primarily focused on development and redevelopment value-added opportunities. EBITDA margins were very strong at 68%. As Joel mentioned, we had our second-highest year of leasing volume at 4.5 million rentable square feet. Rental rate growth was up 12.7% on lease renewals and re-leasing of space. We continued to deliver solid growth in net effective rents, really highlighting the strength of our real estate and life science industry fundamentals. Importantly, rental rates continue to support a disciplined approach to strategic and selective ground-up development projects, one project at a time. For NAV models, on Page 1 of our press release we continue to highlight significant contractual near-term growth in annual cash rents of $96 million, of which $78 million will commence through the fourth quarter of 2018. It's really important to recognize $26 million of this will commence in the first quarter, $31 million will commence in the second quarter. That's $57 million just in the first half of 2018. This $96 million in contractual rent growth is related to the development and redevelopment projects that were recently placed in the service and are currently generating GAAP revenue. Let me briefly comment on an impairment recognized in the fourth quarter. As required under GAAP, we recognized an impairment of $3.8 million as a result of an unrealized loss position for 12 months related to an investment in a biotech company. It's important to also recognize that we remain optimistic that our investment will be fine over time. However, we were required to write down the book value of this investment. Moving on to our disciplined management of our development pipeline, we are in a unique position today with very well-located land parcels in key centers of innovation that provides us with the option to meet the demand from highly innovative entities. We will carefully review each incremental opportunity before deciding to proceed. Over the past 10 years, we have proven our disciplined approach and ability to generate strong returns from our development pipeline. Let me just highlight a few of the great statistics over the last decade. 5.5 million rentable square feet of new Class A properties with significant pre-leasing prior to the commencement of vertical construction, with one exception this quarter that will be meaningfully leased shortly after commencement of construction. Investment-grade or large-cap tenants supported 81% of the annual rental revenue generated from ground-up development projects over the last decade. Our highly experienced team has on average beat our target delivery dates, completed projects under budget, and exceeded our original return expectations. In 2017 we completed six development projects on time, aggregating 1.3 million rentable square feet, at initial cash yields of 7.1%, including 645,000 rentable square feet that were completed in mid 4Q 2017. These highly innovative and collaborative spaces were built for some of the leading life science and technology entities, including Bristol-Myers, Facebook, Stripe, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Pinterest, Illumina, Juno Therapeutics which Celgene is acquiring, and several very high quality venture-backed biotech entities. We are proud to be an important partner to some of the world's most innovative entities and through our unique business helping them improve the quality of life through the discovery of new therapies and technologies. Today we have 2.3 million rentable square feet under construction, including one project undergoing pre-construction, that are on average highly leased at 80% and expected to generate very strong initial cash yields averaging 6.9% on our total investment. Our balance sheet today is in excellent position of strength and flexibility. We exceeded our balance sheet leverage goals this year with net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA of 5.5x with a very strong commitment for continued improvement year-to-year. Our fixed-charge coverage ratio was greater than 4x, we had $2 billion of liquidity at the end of the year, and we continued our disciplined execution of long-term capital to fund strategic growth. We executed an opportunistic second unsecured bond offering in November of 2017 and strategically repaid two construction loans and reduced unhedged variable rate debt to 1%. Pricing of long-term 10-year fixed-rate bonds for Alexandria remains very attractive at approximately 4% today. To put this into perspective, a 4% 10-year bond deal is about 35 basis points lower than the 10-year bond we issued a little over two years ago in November of 2015. This reflects the significant improvement in spread over the 10-year treasury for Alexandria, driven by the tremendous improvement in our credit profile over the last two years. Importantly, we are investing capital in the new Class A properties at very strong initial cash yields of about 7%. We have completed a significant component of our capital needs for 2018 with the execution in early January of the issuance of common stock under forward sale equity agreements that will provide net proceeds of $817 million. Our goal with this offering was to continue our prudent approach toward management of our balance sheet while our team executes on a very well defined set of growth opportunities for 2018 and beyond. We expect to settle these forward sale agreements as we match our funding needs throughout the year. As of the end of 2017, our balance sheet is the strongest it ever has been and will continue to improve year to year. A few additional key highlights include, we have no debt maturities in 2018, we have two loans maturing in 2019, and we expect to repay the outstanding $200 million 2019 unsecured term loan later in 2018, and we also look for an opportunity to repay a portion of our $325 million construction loan with an initial maturity in 2019, but it's important to note that we have extension options to extend the maturity to 2021. Lastly, I just want to make a few key highlights on our strong outlook for 2018. As usual, our detailed underlying guidance assumptions for 2018 are included on Page 7 of our earnings release and supplemental package. We are off to a great start this year and our team continues to focus on execution of another strong year, with projected FFO per share growth of 8.8%. We are uniquely positioned in the real estate industry with continued high quality growth and cash flows from a high-quality tenant roster and strong growth from our unique internal and external growth platform. In closing, in my closing comments before I turn it back to Joel, we are pleased with our strong results for 2017 and strong outlook for 2018 and our team continues to execute on a pipeline of new Class A properties. We have solid fundamentals and a strong balance sheet to support strategic goals and are led by an excellent team and senior leaders with key industry relationships that provide us access to some of the most important real estate and leasing transactions in the country. Joel? Joel S. Marcus: Let me make a few more comments and I'll turn it over to the operator to go to Q&A. So, on November 29 at Investor Day, I told analysts we would be announcing new officer roles during the first quarter of 2018. I am sometimes told that area of the deep bench. In reality, we have no bench. Every single member of our executive team, all nine of us, are first team 24/7 players. And since we are in the Super Bowl week, an analogy might be fitting. The New England Patriots are the best franchise in football over the last decade, and even longer. Their system is the best and has now the talented individuals into a real powerhouse team where the franchise, the team and the individuals are all about greatness of the organization. With respect to Alexandria, and as Jim Collins, renowned author and business strategist, was quoted on the cover of our annual report, Alexandria has achieved the three outputs that define a great company, superior results, distinctive impact, lasting endurance. Our executive management team will stay on the field of play and all of us will remain starters 24/7. We'll change positions in the second quarter, but all the players will remain starters and will continue to execute our five-year strategic growth plan with operational excellence in our system that is in idea meritocracy and a cornerstone is respect for each and every member of our 300-person strong first team. We'll continue to build the future of life-changing innovation through our four pillars, and let me end with before I go to Q&A with a quote I actually sent to our team about a year ago. If you develop a pure and sincere motivation and if you are motivated by a wish to help on the basis of kindness, compassion and respect, then you can carry any kind of work in any field and function more effectively, written by the Dalai Lama himself. So, with that, we'll go to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jamie Feldman : For Joel, I guess I just want to go back to the comments you just made. So you said, switching positions in the second quarter. Just thoughts on timing and what the Street should be expecting here? Joel S. Marcus: Announcement in the first quarter and position shifting in the second quarter. Jamie Feldman : Okay, all right, thank you. That's helpful. Can you speak more broadly about we've seen some M&A news in this space, specifically Juno and Celgene, I know Dean mentioned it on the call, can you just talk through the implications for the leases you have in your portfolio with any of the deals that have been announced lately? And then I guess also bigger picture, if you go back through cycles, M&A cycles in life science, what have been the implications for demand and maybe vacancy and subleasing in your portfolio? Joel S. Marcus: Sure. So, first things first, on Juno, as you know we built their corporate headquarters. They will be acquired by Celgene. Celgene actually already has an important presence in Seattle. This is really a pretty critical bolt-on to the business of Celgene. They already had a big investment in Juno, so they weren't strangers al all. I think Celgene had invested over $1 billion in the company previously. And so this really opens up Celgene, which has a magnificent cancer franchise, to the area of immuno-oncology which is in a sense one of the pieces of the future of human healthcare. So, they will continue to maintain the Juno presence, probably strengthen it, and I think you'll see that franchise continue to grow pretty rapidly. On the other side of the fence, I'll have Tom speak to, we had a company that spun out of Biogen, Bioverativ, which is a tenant of ours being acquired here over the last announcement over the last couple of weeks. And so, Tom, maybe speak to that. Thomas J. Andrews: Sure. So, Bioverativ spun out of Biogen I think about two or three years ago, and we put them in above 120,000 square feet of space in Waltham, Massachusetts just outside of Boston, and we anticipate based on what we know about the acquisition that Bioverativ will remain in place there as a Sanofi unit in that location. It happens there's a couple of Sanofi buildings immediately adjacent to the building that we own that Bioverativ is in. Joel S. Marcus: So we don't see any negative implications. Historically, M&A has really had really two flavors if you go back over the last decade or so. Where you see a strategic acquisition of a real franchise and a talent pool, the acquiring company tends to use that as a base, and most of those times those companies remain in the hubs of where they are located because the bigger company wants access to talent, hiring and retention. There are occasions where companies are bought really for a product opportunity or a unique one-off technology, and sometimes those are folded in, but I think historically we haven't had any significant negative implications on rentals from M&A. Peter M. Moglia: It's Peter Moglia. Just one anecdote would be Eli Lilly and Company. They entered San Diego, I can't remember the name of the company they had bought, but at the time they went into one of our buildings and they were in about 20,000 square feet. And they eventually grew to where they are today in San Diego at 300,000-plus square feet. So, those are stories that we've seen before. We've also seen ImClone come into or be purchased by Eli Lilly in New York and more than double their anticipated size once they stabilize their occupancy at Alexandria Center for Life Science. So, there's a few other examples but probably we have to take those off-line. Operator : The next question comes from Manny Korchman with Citi. Emmanuel Korchman : Dean, if we go back to the $3.8 billion charge you mentioned in your comments that you have confidence that over time everything will work out fine, just wondering what gives you that confidence if you can give us some more details on the securities [indiscernible]. Joel S. Marcus: So, we won't disclose what security it is, but it is a publicly traded company, and as Dean said, the rule is writing down, taking an impairment when you've got a duration of decline in value of about 12 months or so. We know the company very intimately, we know the founders, we know the pipeline, and I think we have I would say a super high level of confidence that the write-down will be recovered and probably more than that. That's all I really want to say at this point. Emmanuel Korchman : And Joel, maybe in a similar vein, if you can give us some more details on the Alexandria's chief capital platform and how much capital you are actually going to put up into that venture? Joel S. Marcus: We announced that we have essentially collaborated with one other large venture operation together with several strategic pharma partners and will look to make strategic seed stage investments. There is no limit. It really is a balance sheet limit. Each of the other companies are probably 5 or 10-plus-times our size. So, there is no limit. So we'll do what we think is useful and appropriate and strategic case-by-case. Operator : The next question comes from Nick Yulico with UBS. Nick Yulico : Just had a question on your same-store NOI guidance, specifically difference between cash and GAAP, last year you had cash NOI growth, same-store NOI growth was nearly 7%, your GAAP was 3%, just about a 400 basis point differential this year. Your cash is 10% at the midpoint and GAAP is 3.5%. So that's over 600 basis point differential. So, I'm just wondering what's driving that widening spread between cash and GAAP and whether it's solely the benefit from developments delivered in 2016 now entering the same store pool where free rent is burning off. Dean A. Shigenaga: Nick, it's Dean Shigenaga here. I'd say we probably commented historically that GAAP typically has averaged about 2% and cash has averaged about 5% over the last decade. So you've always had a differential in the performance, and I think our same property results are unique in the sense that occupancy never really has a meaningful impact. Specifically to 2018, when we have guided to a midpoint of 10% cash same-property NOI growth, you do have the benefit as we've talked on, on previous calls, the burn off of some rent concessions from the recently delivered developments. It's important also to remember though, if we back those out, you still end up at a very strong cash same-property NOI run rate of roughly 5%. I think going forward Alexandria along with a number of other REITs will continue to look at how to improve the same-property disclosures to facilitate a better understanding, but you still have really strong core growth after you back out the free rent concessions. Nick Yulico : Okay, that's helpful. And then Joel, just going back to your comments on the tax plan benefiting this sector and your tenants, can you just elaborate a little bit on that, how you think this may play out? Joel S. Marcus: Obviously reduced. I mean, if you take the past week [indiscernible] had a big pop and it was indicated that their internal plan provided for a 20% tax rate, and it turned out, they after-tax reform, it looked like it was going to be closer to 9%. So, the stock took a big jump. I mean that's on a simple immediate impact. Another one is, the industry probably has somewhere between $100 billion and $200 billion of cash overseas, and as that is repatriated, and interestingly enough, Celgene only had about $9 billion overseas. Amgen and Gilead have the most. You could imagine more M&A or big strategic relationships that would kind of fuel additional investment into R&D. Operator : The next question comes from Sheila McGrath of Evercore. Sheila McGrath : Joel, it looks like you made a leasing progress at 399 Binney and 681 Gateway. I just wondered if you could give us an update on the leases, types of tenants and how the rental rates were versus your expectations. Joel S. Marcus: So I'll ask Tom to do 399 Binney. Thomas J. Andrews: Yes, we signed three leases with tenants at 399 Binney. They are all well-capitalized venture-financed companies with strong pedigree and management teams. I believe they were all minimum 8 year to 10 year leases and the rents were right in line with our expectations for the property. The remainder of the space that we have to lease a little bit more challenging in terms of window line but we have some interesting activity and we'll see if we can get that leased up. The building is just coming out of the ground fast now and we'll be ready to deliver those almost three leases late this year. Joel S. Marcus: And current rental rates in [indiscernible]? Thomas J. Andrews: So, very high 70s to low 80s per square foot for [indiscernible] in good locations, good buildings, low 80s per square foot. Joel S. Marcus: Let me ask Steve to speak to 681 Gateway. Stephen A. Richardson: We are really pleased there. That lease actually doesn't roll until the latter part of this year, September of 2018. And because we've been 100% leased for almost two or three years now, we have pent-up demand in the existing portfolio. So without really any marketing campaign, we do have competition for this space. We're advancing the lease document with one tenant and we are essentially oversubscribed for the balance of the space there. So, very healthy dynamic continues. More broadly tracking, 2.5 million square feet, demand slightly up, this time last year was about 2.4 million square feet. So, just very pleased with the progress of 681 Gateway. Joel S. Marcus: Rental rates in the market? Stephen A. Richardson: Rental rates in the market are $60 net and room to continue to climb there as well. Sheila McGrath : Okay, great. And then, Joel, I think in the prepared remarks you've mentioned that doubling the revenues in the next five years. I just wanted to reconfirm that that's what you said and that also is that from just the existing pipeline in the supplemental or do you have some projects that are kind of in the works that we don't necessarily know about yet? Joel S. Marcus: So, on Investor Day, Sheila, I think we took a kind of a trip through each of the regions and gave a vision of if we were able to build out what we own, which really are pretty prime location parcels that we could in fact come close to doubling the revenues of the Company, and that's kind of the broad game-plan of the Company. It's not a guidance number at the moment but it is a path to get there and we feel pretty comfortable with that. And I think we mentioned that San Francisco had the biggest growth trajectory based on what we own. So, that is just what we own on balance sheet today, nothing else. Sheila McGrath : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors. Jed Reagan : Maybe a question for Dean, can you just give a little bit more color on potential timing for when you guys expect to draw-down the new forward equity raise? I mean should we think of that as more a back half of the year type of event and then how you'll balance that against further issuance of the ATM? Dean A. Shigenaga: It's Dean here. I think in 2018, maybe one way of thinking of it is, you look back to 2017, I think you would have found that we pretty much brought in our equity almost evenly through the year except the fourth quarter had tad a bit more, and that was primarily driven by uses through the year. We had a higher construction amount in the fourth quarter of 2017. We also had a handful of acquisitions that settled down in that period as well. So I think when you take all that into consideration, roughly speaking the equity in 2017 was kind of taken down evenly, and that included occasional uses of the ATM program through the year to round out our overall capital needs. I would add, in 2018, consistent with what we did in 2017, you will see us search for opportunities to continue to dispose off what I would call some non-core assets, and as we make our way through the first couple of quarters of the year, we hope to give you some additional color around dispositions. Jed Reagan : Okay, that's helpful. I guess separately, job growth has been slowing in San Francisco recently in a number of industries. Are you feeling that on the ground for your tenant base in that market? And maybe specifically for life sciences, are you seeing any signs of job growth or demand growth slowing? Stephen A. Richardson: It's Steve Richardson. No, we are not experiencing that at all. Conversely, just in the last 60 days, we've had three Bay Area IPOs raising over $500 million, Denali, Menlo Therapeutics and ARMO. So, we are seeing first-hand continued thriving market. I think it was very upbeat JP Morgan conference that was held in San Francisco at the beginning of January. And again, we are 100% leased and working to solve a high-class problem to continue to provide Class A facilities for our client tenants. Jed Reagan : That's helpful I guess. Just maybe just last one if I may, Joel, you mentioned some of the thoughts related to tax reform. One thing you didn't touch on with respect to this state and local tax deductions, I mean that all represent less of a tax cut for folks in high tax states like California, New York, Massachusetts, and maybe a benefit for kind of low tax states like Washington. Are you concerned that takes the wind out of the sales? I mean many of these cluster markets like the Bay Area or Cambridge, does it make you any more constructive on say a Seattle or potentially even an Austin, Texas down the line? Joel S. Marcus: I think the answer is, Silicon Valley is now moving to Texas or Nevada or Florida, and the state does, speaking about California, it does have I think need to get some of its financial act together but I think there are some people who have achieved fortunes who are moving to non-tax states. But the average person that's working and living, I think being in those markets and in those environments, I know when it was 2 degrees in New York, I think it was 89 here in Los Angeles, it's hard to imagine there would be huge numbers flocking to a lot of those states. So, the honest truth is, I think people in very high tax brackets are very sensitive to that, but the average person or the professional person who make up the bulk of employees that work with our tenants aren't doing that. I do think though that places like Seattle and certainly Austin do represent very nice opportunities for the future. Certainly Austin may be a cluster over the next decade, partially because Texas is a low tax state and partially that got a very positive business climate. Our original founding investor, Jacobs Engineering, actually amazingly we had throw-away space and we started this company in their basement, they just moved recently to Texas to take advantage of a no-tax environment, because they just did not want to pay the high taxes. But that's headquarters, their operations are worldwide, and so the bulk of their people stayed where they are. Jed Reagan : Okay, appreciate those thoughts. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Richard Anderson with . Richard Anderson : I apologize, I got knocked off the call. So if I'm repeating anything, just tell me. First one, Joel, do you have any concern at all or interest I guess, I guess we all have some interest about where Amazon's second headquarters end up and you guys now have 11% of your business in the tech business, just curious what your thought is on that or if it's not really occupying much of your mind at this point? Joel S. Marcus: We are not involved in that, but I would say, if I had to guess, I guess two places, one would be just outside D.C. which is rumoured to be a logical place because of the desire to maybe be more active in policy, or Texas which is a thriving no-tax state. So, I don't know, I don't have any inside information. I have talked to a number of groups in both the South and the Midwest and a number of people have actually frankly said, we're kind of bidding on it or trying to qualify, but the reality is we hope we don't get it because if it comes to our neighborhood, it's going to change our culture dramatically, which I thought was pretty fascinating from the Midwest and the South. So, that's all I know, which isn't much. Richard Anderson : Okay. A question maybe for Dean, again, stop me if it's been asked, but on the 10% same-store NOI growth forecasted for 2018, could you give me the roadmap just as a reminder? I know you have really sort of 9% mark-to-market, escalator is around 3% for a handful from older portfolio, occupancy up-ticking on an average, but how does that get you to 10%? Is there a free rent burn component, are there tenant recoveries that are embedded in that, how do we get all the way up to 10%, if you could help us with that? Dean A. Shigenaga: Sure. I'll briefly cover it again, Rich. Bottom line, our 10 year average has been 5%. If you were to back out recently delivered development/redevelopment projects that have free rent burning off, you'd get into that 5% to 6% range. If you recall, I think at Investor Day I highlighted that our average occupancy through the year, it might move around quarter to quarter, but when you compare 2018 quarter to quarter versus 2017, we're going to pick up about 1% benefit to the same property results in 2018. So, you still have very strong core, what I'll call core same property performance, and you really boost that to the 10% range in our guidance through free rent burn-off. Richard Anderson : Okay [indiscernible]. And then lastly, one very minor change from your guidance issued at Investor Day was now you have a debt-to-EBITDA below 5.5x. Is that just a reflection of taking down some of the forward equity or how would you characterize that minor change? Dean A. Shigenaga: I'd say, importantly we ended up ahead of our expectations. It's funny that we do pick up on the fact that it's 5.5 and it could have been 5.6 and that would have been outstanding as well. I would say, generally speaking, we've been moving leverage in the direction that it's headed and when you round out at a 10th of a turn better, it's just the way the things land. Richard Anderson : Okay, so it's just rounding error type stuff? Dean A. Shigenaga: Yes, and I think importantly, our objective going forward, Rich, is to continue to improve that. We got rid of the upper end of the range that was up to maybe 5.8 at Investor Day because it just didn't make any sense. We are not moving leverage up. It's only going down slightly from this point and that's why we cited, from this point forward it will be below 5.5. Operator : The next question comes from Dave Rodgers with Baird. David Rodgers : Maybe the first question on acquisitions or maybe a two-part question on acquisitions, first for Dean and then for Joel. Dean, can you tell us that the $720 million midpoint for acquisition, kind of what the plan is for cash flowing versus non-cash flowing or maybe average cap rate that you kind of anticipate as the year goes on? And second part for Joel, Joel, maybe talk about the competitive landscape for acquisitions right now? You guys have obviously closed some fairly high cap rate acquisitions just given where we are in the cycle and even this quarter. Looks like you're set to close on Summers Ridge [indiscernible] on a cash basis. So maybe just a little color on kind of what you're seeing, are you one of the few out there that's really still active in the market? Dean A. Shigenaga: So, Dave, it's Dean here. Let me just answer the high level question about expectations for 2018 acquisitions. There is still a pretty significant value-add focus on that pipeline. As a result, day one returns or yields are roughly slightly positive to bottom line FFO, and then at a stabilized basis upon completion of development or redevelopment activities you are going to hit right down the middle of our fairway long term, it's still about 7% on average cash yields. Peter M. Moglia: It's Peter Moglia. For what we have got in the pipeline, I would say it's definitely weighted to the development/redevelopment side but probably more balanced than we've been historically the last few years, where there are some stabilized opportunities that we are trying to get into. There is a number of people out there that want to joint venture with us that have good projects that we can get into and that would deliver fairly quickly but would be at yields that are typical of our own development. So, those are the types of things we're seeing right now. David Rodgers : On the competitive side, I don't know if Joel or any of the market heads had any commentary around that? Joel S. Marcus: I'm not sure when you say 'competitive side', meaning\u2026 David Rodgers : I guess what are you seeing out in the market as you are bidding for these transactions? I mean, are you finding more people, more companies bidding on lab assets, is that a cluttered space or are you kind of finding yourselves somewhat alone and continuing to be very active in that space? Peter M. Moglia: This is Peter again. So, on the redevelopment and development things that we are buying, I mean they are not necessarily exclusively laboratory. I mean they could be office product as well. So, we do see a lot more competition when we're looking at those types of opportunities. Obviously in the lab realm like Summers Ridge that we're doing in San Diego, there was competition there as well because it was a stabilized property and there is obviously more comfort for a lot of parts that would like to get into lab space to get into something that is cash line for a long period of time. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll : [Indiscernible] bit off of Dave's questions, Peter, can you talk a little bit about I guess your acquisition stance right now? It seems like the Company has been a little bit more aggressive recently. Is that mainly due to a lot of large development projects being completed and your cost of capital being improved or are you seeing better opportunities out there? Peter M. Moglia: Obviously our cost of capital has allowed us the flexibility to go after things that may have had whole periods that were longer than we are comfortable with before because we have got the lower costs enable to carry things longer. But overall, I don't really think things have really changed much. I mean we just have happened to get serendipity with a number of things that have fit our profile that have come along in the markets that we want to invest in. So, I don't know if it's really changed. It's just been by chance. Joel S. Marcus: I think I mean, if you go back a year in time when we bought One Kendall Square, you could never imagine that it would come to market. I mean, a lot of these things, as Peter just said, are serendipitous. They come when a particular seller or money partner decides to part with an asset, they believe it is a good time and we try to respond. We look at everything and we certainly don't go after everything, but we try to be very disciplined in how we think about what we want to do and how we want to do it. Michael Carroll : Okay, thanks. And then just a quick follow up, can you talk a little bit about the stabilized assets that you are interested in? Do they have to have some type of unique components, some location, or is that just a good opportunity that pops up that you are willing to pursue? Peter M. Moglia: This is Peter again. For stabilized assets, if we were going to pay a low cap rate for something, it would definitely have to be just in a Class AAA location and preferably have some mark-to-market opportunities in the future. But overall we tend to buy things that could have very little cash flow upfront but we can get to a 6%, 7%, 8% through leasing or mark-to-market opportunities within two to three years. Joel S. Marcus: And I would say on acquisitions, we are not interested in paying somebody else for their value, Peter always says. We'd like to help create the value. So, that kind of guides our acquisition philosophy. Operator : The next question comes from Karin Ford with MUFJ Securities. Karin Ford : A recent article said that the city of New York is soliciting proposals for a new life science campus and offering three city-owned sites. One of the sites I think is near the Alexandria Center and another is in Queens, close to Cornell's Tech Campus on Roosevelt Island and may have more expansion potential. Would Alexandria only be interested in expanding your existing site or do you think there is enough positive demand to drive a second cluster in New York? Joel S. Marcus: [Red] [ph] RFP is pretty unusual because they don't want real estate developers bidding on it. They actually want users to come in and try to occupy spaces and then bring development expertise with them. So, I won't comment beyond that but that's the nature of the RFP. Karin Ford : Okay. And second question, I saw that a large healthcare technology company, Royal Philips, had signed a large lease for about 60% of the space in the first building under construction at Cambridge Crossing. Do you have a sense for what the rent comparison is there versus Kendall Square and do you think it will provide some leasing momentum for that location? Joel S. Marcus: Remember that that's office, but I'll have Tom comment. Thomas J. Andrews: I think the rent there turned out to be pretty strong, not too much below Kendall Square level rents, maybe 5% to 10% below. And the balance of that building is available for lease. We're not certain if the developers are offering the balance of the building as potential lab space. I think they are in the middle of making that decision as the building is early in construction. But as Joel mentioned, the Philips lease is office space and a building that had been programmed for both lab and office. Karin Ford : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : We'll take our last question today from Tom Catherwood of BTIG. Tom Catherwood : Just one cleanup question, maybe for Steve. I know it's a small project but on 1655 and 1715 Third Street in San Francisco, the January 3 prospectus had listed this as under-construction with a closing I think it was January 5th for 39 million. The release yesterday indicated that it's more likely a February closing and a near-term start and only $31 million initial cost. What are the kind of moving parts and the pieces with this project that have kind of extended it out? Stephen A. Richardson: It's Steve. The horizontal construction \u2013 this is the GSW/Uber/Alexandria joint venture. We are a 10% partner there. What really needed to be completed was the horizontal construction or enable the vertical construction to start for the office tower. So, there was just a little bit of movement there over a couple of week period of time. But all is on track. You can see both the arena and the building starting to take shape on the site. So it's pretty exciting for Mission Bay. Tom Catherwood : Got it. Thanks guys. Operator : As there are no more questions, I would like to return the call to Mr. Marcus for any closing comments. Joel S. Marcus: Thank you very much everybody. Have a rest of a good day and we'll talk to you on first quarter. Thank you again. Operator : Thank you. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note today\u2019s event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz with Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Paula Schwartz : Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company\u2019s actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company\u2019s periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel. Joel Marcus : Thanks very much, Paula, and welcome, everybody, to our Alexandria\u2019s first quarter call. And with me today are actually much of our Executive Management team : including Steve Richardson, Peter Moglia, Dean Shigenaga, Tom Andrews, Jennifer Banks, Larry Diamond, Dan Ryan, and Vin Ciruzzi. Congratulations to the entire team on a really outstanding first quarter by all metrics and another quarter of truly operational excellence. In the November and December 2017 issue of the Harvard Business Review, they had an article entitled Turning Potential Into Success, and the article and the research on which it was based focused on companies that are overwhelmingly failing on one key metric of success, which is leadership development. In contrast, I\u2019m proud to say, Alexandria is not failing on this key metric for success. In fact, our intense focus on nurturing key chain training and developing unit leaders at each and every level has paid exceptional dividends in fostering our culture of mutual respect, idea of meritocracy, long-tenured and high-performance teams, dear friendships, all within a high \u2013 highly focused mission-driven culture. In July 2016, we initiated world-class intense leadership and management training effort under the leadership of Jim Collins. A new succession planning strategy was also begun at all unit leader levels, as well at the executive management level. As you know, some of these efforts culminated in a series of press releases in March and April and there are some yet to come. The same starting team remains on the field, as I\u2019ve said before, albeit at different position and not a single unit leader executive manager ever considered departing. When it came to the most senior executive leadership, the process was uniquely holistic and the outcome is evidence of the continuation of the Alexandria culture, vision and intended successful accomplishment of our five-year growth plan 2018 through 2022. Let me turn to our ecosystem for a moment or two. The five fundamental drivers impacting the life science demand, first one being basic research funding, the new Omnibus Spending Bill allocated an additional $3 billion to the NIH, up 9%. So for the fiscal year ending 2018, it\u2019ll be about $37-plus billion. On the regulatory side of the FDA, they\u2019re working very positively to expedite an increase drug approvals under the superb leadership of Scott Gottlieb and the Omnibus Spending Bill allocated almost a $0.5 billion, or up 10% in FDA funding. Medical research philanthropy sits at an all-time high north of $33 billion. Global commercial R&D funding sits at an all-time high approaching $200 billion. And on a very unique note, I\u2019m proud to say the U.S. venture capital funding in life science for the first quarter hit $6.7 billion, the largest quarter on record for life science venture funding. And among the life science companies doing mega rounds, two were TCR2, which did a $125 million Series B and is in our 100 Binney project in Cambridge, next-gen immuno-oncology company and Rubio\u2019s, a $100 million Series C, they are going to be at 399 Binney next-generation cell therapy. Also, San Francisco and Boston continue to garner the largest venture funding amounts, San Francisco at $1.7 billion and Boston at $1.6 billion. Venture funding is seeing a new wellspring in a diverse set of players that go well beyond the traditional venture firms, including public crossover investors, Asian venture fund, sovereign wealth funds and ultra high net worth family offices. Worldwide prescription drug therapy market is growing at about 6.5% compounded annually and will reach $1.06 trillion by the last year of our five-year growth and operational excellence plan in 2022. Companies, which were startups now account for an amazing 63% of all new prescription drug approvals over the last five years and it\u2019s no wonder that pharma has now established venture arms and incubators to invest in these promising start-ups working on new drug technologies. Finally, I want to make a comment about ARE investments and Dean will give you granular analysis of this. This effort and key pillar of our business was started when we were private in 1996. Our single best investment today was our Series A in Google in 1998. Today, this pillar continues to be strategically core to what we do at Alexandria. One recent investment focused on unlocking the secrets of ALS, a disease which killed which killed Lou Gehrig and remained shrouded in mystery even today. As I stated before, there are about 10,000 known diseases to mankind today and only about 500, or 5% have addressable therapy. So we\u2019re in the real early innings of the biology revolution. And with that, let me turn it over to our new Co-CEO, Steve Richardson. Stephen Richardson : Good afternoon, everybody. Let me talk a little bit about the vision for 2018 and 2019. As we continue building our dominant franchise well into 2019, the path is clear and compelling. Alexandria\u2019s business model based upon Michael Porter\u2019s cluster theory of creating dynamic ecosystems upon its Class A science and tech urban campuses is providing exceptional value for our client tenants and our investors. Let me take a step back and share a bit of the philosophy behind our strategy and exciting path forward as it\u2019s comprised of three essential elements; great people, a passion for excellence, and engaging with purposeful companies. The first element great people. The entire team at Alexandria possesses unique skills and talents to acquire, entitle, design, construct, underwrite, lease and broadly operate these technical and complicated mission-critical facilities and the following sentiments from our clients speak volumes about their dedication and passion for our mission. From a large pharma company, we\u2019re excited to be working with ARE. Integrated teams committed towards common goals and optimal design for our science and a high-quality facility. From an exciting high-growth life science company, ARE has been a great partner, as the company has grown from three founders to over 250 employees. And from a leading tech company, ARE has ensured our vision of a tasteful workplace environment was achieved as a wonderful partner. We could not be more proud to serve the company\u2019s mission of advancing human health, overcoming hunger and improving the quality of people\u2019s lives alongside one another together. So for us, job number one is, ensuring we continually enhance our differentiated and proprietary products and delivering high-touch unparalleled service to our clients. A passion for excellence. As we\u2019re building brick-by-brick, the ecosystems in our core clusters, it demands an intensity that can only be fueled by a passion for excellence in all realms. It\u2019s important to emphasize here that 2.3 million square feet in our urban campus development pipeline is 81% leased and the client tenants range from the best of the best tech tenants to investment-grade pharma companies to exciting emerging-stage life science companies. Bit of a deep dive here. During 2018, these Class A facilities include 164,000 square foot facility fully leased to Takeda in San Diego, an inspiring and cutting-edge facility. The exceptional pre-leasing success, we\u2019re now at 75% at 399 Binney, also 164,000 square feet, providing a platform for a well-financed emerging-stage companies. And in the southeast region in RTP, 5 Laboratory Drive, our very unique 175,000 square foot flagship ag tech facility, featuring state-of-the-art greenhouses. As we look forward well into 2019, the high-quality invisible growth continues and is well distribute across a number of key clusters. Menlo Gateway\u2019s Phase 2 comprised of 520,000 square feet fully leased long-term to Facebook, which just posted a strong earnings beat with $12 billion in quarterly revenue, up 50% year-over-year in a market cap of $510 billion. In San Francisco, Uber\u2019s 590,000 square feet at the championship Golden State Warriors, go Warriors, Chase Center in Mission Bay, a transformational urban campus and transformational company, featuring a bright future with its new well-regarded CEO. In South San Francisco 213 East Grand, cutting-edge innovation center totaling 300,000 square feet fully leased to Merck. And just down the road, a fourth building now totaling 211,000 square feet at 279 East Grand, anchored by Google\u2019s Verily division as part of their 600,000 square foot campus alongside East Grand Avenue in South San Francisco. At 681 Gateway, 126,000 square feet anchored by an expansion with an existing client, Twist Bioscience, as they\u2019re at the intersection of science and technology with its creation of synthetic DNA. Further north in Seattle, our spectacular waterfront 205,000 square foot facility at 1818 Fairview and importantly, in Maryland, a 49,000 square foot facility at 9900 Medical Drive and the remaining 58,000 square feet at 704 Queens Road. And finally, the essential ingredient engaging with purposeful companies. All of us here at Alexandria are honored to be a trusted partner and regarded as one to leading edge companies working to improve human health, including Juno Therapeutics, which was recently purchased by Celgene for $9 billion during the first quarter, our first \u2013 our anchor and full building tenant at the 290,000 square foot facility in Seattle, and our promising CAR T cancer treatment. Joel just mentioned, QurAlis, a company launched by notable Harvard professors taking a precision approach to treat ALS. In fact, on the West Coast, Vir Biotechnology, seeking to transform the care of people with serious infectious diseases. I can speak for our entire team, when I say that, we\u2019re energized by the absolutely clear and compelling vision of our future, as we continue to build dominant positions in these core clusters for the benefit of our clients, communities and investors. I\u2019ll hand it over to Peter now. Peter Moglia : Thanks, Steve. I\u2019m looking forward to working with you for another 20 years, really appreciate those comments. We\u2019d like to briefly touch on our acquisitions last quarter. And as a reminder, our investment philosophy has been and will continue to be a strong preference to add value rather than paying for another company\u2019s value creation. For acquisitions, this quarter reflect this philosophy and our historical track record of building dynamic communities to urban campuses. Alexandria Park is a multiple building generic office project in Palo Alto, the heart of the Greater Stanford cluster that will undergo a transformation to a fully amenitized life science and tech campus creating a highly desirable collaborative destination. 704 Quince Orchard Road in Gaithersburg, Maryland will create a highly differentiated set of laboratory suites from a generic office building. Summers Ridge in San Diego is a rare opportunity for Alexandria as you acquire a multi-tenant life science campus that is stabilized with credit tenancy, providing immediately accretive income, plus the additional opportunity to create value with additional FAR for future campus expansion. 100 Tech Drive in the Greater Boston market is a 200,000 square foot facility, leased by a fast-growing, high-quality existing Alexandria tenant, and also provides for future value creation with an additional 300,000 square feet to create a fully integrated 500,000 square foot campus. In addition to our acquisitions, it is important to note two recent laboratory office transactions that illustrate the property values and institutional demand for our product continued to be very strong. The Real Reporter in Boston reported last Monday that 4 black fan circle, a 270,000 square foot Life Science Research Facility in Boston\u2019s Longwood medical area sold to investment advisor Intercontinental Real Estate Corporation for $275 million. We understand that the cap rate was in the high 4s, which is particularly impressive since the real estate is held in a somewhat complicated condominium structure. The article mentions that the asset was \u201caggressively pursued by investors from across the globe\u201d. This is the first time we\u2019ve heard of Intercontinental being a bidder for a life science asset. But it\u2019s further proof that strong returns and credit profile of life science assets continue to attract Global Institutional Capital. We have also recently been made aware of a sizable laboratory office transactions in the Cambridge market that has recently closed at a mid-4 cap rate and expect details to come out shortly. A metric we\u2019d like to highlight this quarter is the continued strength of our cash NOI in leasing spreads. Cash rental rate growth increased by 19% this quarter, primarily driven by the successful execution of our strategy to re-release below market rents at our Alexandria Center at One Kendall Square Campus, where the team continues to outperform the expectations we set at the time of acquisition. To finish up, we\u2019d like to comment on the potential impacts of tariffs on the solid development pipeline Steve described earlier. With GMP contracts in place for all of our large projects to be delivered in 2018 and 2019, we will not have any exposure to increasing cost of tariffs, unless there is a scope change involving those materials, which is not anticipated. And although we source all of our steel domestically, our contractors have reported cost creep of 6% to 10%, or $100 to $300 per ton, as domestic providers have raised prices. This would translate to an overall 1% increase in total project cost, if applied to our current projects. We also have adequate contingency to cover anything that comes along. We have not seen price increases in aluminum yet. We source most of it domestically and the rest comes from Canada, which is currently exempted from tariffs. Overall, our conservative underwriting has historically factored in construction cost increases and we continue to monitor the trade policy closely. And with that, I\u2019ll pass it over to Dean. Dean Shigenaga : Thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. I just want to cover four key topics today : first or one, first quarter results; second, review of the new accounting rule for equity investments; third, venture value creation pipeline in our balance sheet; and fourth, our 2018 guidance. As you know, we are off to a great start this year on our strategic priorities, on track to achieve another solid year of FFO per share growth of approximately 9%, and our team continued to execute quickly and efficiently. FFO per share for 1Q was $1.62, up 9.5% over the first quarter of 2017. Net operating income was up $34.6 million, or 17.8% over the first quarter of 2017. Comparing 1Q 2018 to 1Q 2017, the key drivers of the 17.8% growth in net operating income included almost 70% from development and redevelopment deliveries, about 20% from internal growth or same property performance, and the remaining 10% primarily from acquisitions. Same property growth has been consistently strong and net operating income growth was up 4% and 14.6% on a GAAP and cash basis, and we\u2019re on track with our overall 2018 guidance of up 3.5% and 10% on a GAAP and cash basis, respectively. Continued constrained supply and strong demand drove solid rental rate growth of 16.3% and 19% on a GAAP and cash basis, respectively, on leasing activity for the first quarter. As Peter had mentioned, our One Kendall Square Campus located in Kendall Square was a key driver of leasing activity for the quarter. Cash rental rate growth was ahead of expectations, as our team executed on lease renewals and re-leasing of space at One Kendall Square, capturing significant cash rental growth related to below market leases that were in place at acquisition. However, GAAP rental rate growth was below cash rent growth this quarter since most of the GAAP rent growth was recognized in the initial purchase price of accounting at the acquisition date. As a reminder, at the beginning of 2018, we had very limited contractual lease expirations of approximately 5.8% of total leases in effect. As anticipated, we adopted new accounting rules around financial instruments, which applies to our equity investments, primarily in life science and a handful of technology entities. The new rule requires that we measure investments at fair value, recognize changes in fair value in net income, and prior to 2018, we did not recognize unrealized gains or losses in net income. As noted by Warren Buffett in his 2017 annual letter, this new accounting rule will likely generate $10 billion swings in net income that will swamp truly important numbers for Brookshire\u2019s operating performance. Buffett also stated that what counts most is their normalized per share earnings power. We agree and we will clearly disclose the impact of our equity investments on our financial statements and normalized operating performance. We have three categories of investments from an accounting perspective. First, we\u2019ve got publicly traded securities that we reflect at fair value based upon the closing stock price, which changes in fair value recognized in net income. There are two categories of privately-held entities or investments in privately-held entities without readily determinable fair value. First, there are investments in entities that report net asset value and are carried at approximately fair value based upon net asset value as a practical expedience required under GAAP, which changes in fair value recognized in net income. We also have investments in entities that do not report net asset value and are only adjusted upward or downward for observable price changes subsequent to 2017. These upward and downward adjustments are recognized in net income as well. Reflected in net income for the first quarter is $85 million of investment income, $72.2 million represents changes in unrealized gains, which was excluded from FFO per shares as adjusted. We also had a large realized gain of $8.3 million from an investment in the life science entity. And consistent with prior years, large and individual realized gains like this one have been excluded from FFO per share as adjusted. So only $5.1 million in realized gains in the first quarter was included in FFO per share as adjusted. Looking forward, some of our investment gains are event-driven, and therefore, it\u2019s hard to forecast for gains for the future. However, I do recommend looking back over recent years in order to have some sense of the amount of potential gains for 2018 and beyond. In most of the recent years, the run rate for investment gains and other income has generally been between $10 million and $25 million per year. In this quarter, the $5.1 million in ordinary course realized gains included in FFO per share as adjusted. When you look at it on an annualized basis falls within maybe on the upper-end of this historic range of investment gains and other income. From a balance sheet perspective, it\u2019s important to note the following under the new accounting rule. We hold $724 million in investments on our balance sheet consisting of cost basis of $511.2 million and unrealized gains of $213.1 million. Importantly, only $250.5 million, or 49% of our cost basis has been reflected at approximately fair value with unrealized gains aggregating $213.1 million or really an amazing 85% of unrealized gains on our total investment. Now the remaining $260.7 million, or the remaining 51% of total cost basis in our investments are still classified on our balance sheet at cost. So it\u2019s probably inappropriate to extrapolate the 85% in unrealized gains to this half of our equity investments. But we believe there is significant value embedded in these investments. And please refer to footnote two and footnote six of our 10-Q that we will file shortly, and pages 43 and 50 of our first quarter supplemental package for additional information. Now turning to our value creation pipeline in our balance sheet. Our pipeline for deliveries in 2018 and 2019 now consist of $2.6 million rentable square feet, including $2.1 million rentable square feet targeted for delivery in 2019. These are about 80% leased, represent about $1.8 billion in \u2013 at completion and $1 billion remaining to fund, and we\u2019ll generate very strong cash yields on our total investment approaching 7%. We also have a pipeline for potential delivery in 2020, approximating over 900,000 rentable square feet that our team is currently marketing for lease. As for funding, keep in mind, that our \u2013 in the first quarter, we completed our $817 million forward equity offering, including $714 million that will settle over the next three quarters. Additionally, in April, we raised $94 million under our ATM program and now have addressed 75% of our equity needs anticipated in 2018. Over the next three quarters, we will address the remaining $300 million of equity that we need for the year. Our approach with our ATM program is to remain disciplined, putting aside macro considerations for the moment, given the tremendous growth in cash flows, our stock price generally has grown on a relative basis to other REITs. While we take this into consideration, we also remain disciplined in our approach with our ATM program and generally have used the program over time through each year allowing us to blend our cost of equity capital. Turning briefly to credit metrics, we remain very committed to a continued improvement in our credit metrics each year, including net debt to adjust EBITDA, while we also focus on delivering solid FFO per share growth. Our goal remains focused on continued improvement in our relative long-term cost to capital. As a reminder, a detailed assumptions for 2018 guidance are included on page 5 of our supplemental package. We updated our guidance for EPS to a range of $2.88 to $2.98 and FFO per share as adjusted to a range of $6.52 to $6.62. The range of our per share guidance for 2018 was narrowed from $0.20 to $0.10 per share. Importantly, the midpoint of our 2018 guidance for FFO per share as adjusted was increased $0.02 at the midpoint. The key drivers for 2018 that we considered in our updated guidance included the continued strength of the real estate and life science industry fundamentals, which we expect to continue to drive strong internal growth in 2018 and then value creation opportunities for delivery beyond 2018. Our outlook is reflected in our 2018 guidance for same-property NOI growth. However, due to the size of our same-property pool today, which generates $700 million to $800 million of net operating income, $0.02 growth in FFO per share only move same-property NOI growth by about 30 basis points. As a result, our outlook for same-property performance remains strong and within the prior range of guidance for 2018. With that, let me turn it back to Joel Marcus. Joel Marcus : Thank you, everybody. We\u2019ll open it up operator for Q&A, please. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer-session [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s first question comes from Manny Korchman of Citi. Please go ahead. Manny Korchman : Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Peter and Steve as you sit there in a co-CEO role, how do you each think about the differentiation also overlapping your roles? And how you manage through those situations where it seems like there is an overlap and what the CEO should be deciding? Joel Marcus : Okay. This is Joel, and I\u2019ll let each of them comment. But I think that the fact that the team has worked together for almost two decades. And the fact that we don\u2019t have an org chart and we aren\u2019t bureaucratically organized, make it very easy to move between issues and manage in a way that is highly effective. So I\u2019m not sure they can give you or want to give you any granular detail, but it\u2019s a pretty seamless operation. Steve, you could comment. Stephen Richardson : Manny, hi, it\u2019s Steve. Yes, it is important for everybody to remember, Peter and I have worked together for 20 years. And frankly, that\u2019s the same across the executive team, as well as the number of people in the organization. In addition to that for seven, eight-plus years, Peter and I in the roles we\u2019ve had as COO and CIO have been involved with the breadth and depth of the company as we will be as Co-CEOs, and we\u2019ve actually been doing exactly this for a number of years. So there\u2019s nothing substantially different. We\u2019ve worked through these issues and we\u2019ll continue to work through them with Joel and with the team and with each other. Joel Marcus : I have nothing left to add. My distinguished colleague from San Francisco nailed it. Manny Korchman : That\u2019s what the color all is all about, right? Peter, while I got you there, the pending acquisitions that you guys have show in the supplemental. Joel Marcus : Yes. Manny Korchman : Are those similar sort of flavor as the stuff you\u2019ve identified as closed or closer? Joel Marcus : Yes, it\u2019s a combination of existing assets with value creation embedded in them and then development, redevelopment types of properties. Manny Korchman : And just likelihood of close on a $268 million? Joel Marcus : Highly likely to close all of that. Manny Korchman : Okay, thanks, everyone. Operator : And our next question today comes from Sheila McGrath of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Sheila McGrath : Yes. Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could discuss the other investments and talk about the strategic value of that arm for Alexandria, just the competitive advantages that it gives Alexandria either in underwriting or discussions with tenants? And then, Dean, if you can just clarify the $5.1 million in that flowing through that\u2019s just the realized gains and that\u2019 that the determinant? Joel Marcus : So let me have Dean address that for Sheila and then I\u2019ll talk about the strategy. Dean Shigenaga : So, Sheila, the $5.1 million that we kept inside of FFO per share as adjusted is realized gains and it\u2019s the normal realized gains that we have any given year maybe slightly higher this quarter compared to the last couple of quarters. But on average right down the fair \u2013 right down what we normally have. Joel Marcus : Yes. And the item that Dean mentioned the $8-plus million was the recognition on the sale of Juno to Celgene. So strategically, as I said in my comments, Sheila, going back to 1996, when the company was still private. We felt that it was important for us to do a couple of things in using our balance sheet to invest directly in entities that made a big difference and Steve alluded to these differentiators. And that is one to really understand maybe most importantly, where the science is going. And if you don\u2019t understand that, it\u2019s hard to even begin to think about the tenant base how you underwrite, who you underwrite. So that\u2019s number one. And I think number two is to be able to develop relationships with big winners and companies you can grow with over time, and so that becomes very important. Knowledge of the industry is critical. And so that\u2019s another bedrock piece of the investment strategy. Clearly, financial gains is also paramount. We don\u2019t do this as a hobby, we do it as a very serious financial, both I think, methodical and judicious approach that we always want to ensure we\u2019re making money on, on a net basis. And I think also importantly, it brings us a level of, I think, respect and knowledge in our ecosystem that we\u2019re not just a minor player. We are, in fact, one of the central players of the life science ecosystem. Sheila McGrath : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And one quick follow-up. New York is now 100% leased. What\u2019s next for Alexandria New York? How far long is the option parcel? And are there any other locations or opportunities on the radar? Joel Marcus : So we still have a little bit of space. We\u2019re moving people around there, but by and large, it\u2019s relatively fully leased. We are in late-stage negotiations with the city on the letter of intent for the North Tower. We hope to maybe make an announcement over coming period of time. And then, I think, we clearly are looking at expansion in New York City and I would say stay tuned on that. Sheila McGrath : Thank you. Joel Marcus : Yes. Thanks, Sheila. Operator : And today\u2019s next question comes from Tom Catherwood of BTIG. Please go ahead. Tom Catherwood : Excellent. Thank you, guys. Following up on Sheila\u2019s questions on the investment book, I know it\u2019s only 4% of total assets. But cost basis of this has increased roughly 40% over \u2013 each year over the past two years. What\u2019s the ultimate size of this book in your mind, Joel, or are there any restrictions on how large it can get as a percentage of total assets? Joel Marcus : Yes, I think you\u2019ll see the cost basis, however, in about 4% to 6% of total assets. I think that\u2019s where it logically is and probably will remain and will certainly continue to recycle investments they naturally recycle themselves to some extent. As Dean said, that really isn\u2019t a quarterly run rate that we\u2019ve had for a long, long period of time. So I think that\u2019s kind of where you should think about it. Tom Catherwood : Got it. Thank you. And then for Steven and Tom probably to you, thinking of Cambridge Kendall Square specifically in San Francisco, Mission Bay and probably even South San Francisco now. What are tenants doing in these tighter submarkets when they need to expand? And is there any material sublease space that can serve as a buffer for these companies? Joel Marcus : Tom, hi. Steve go ahead. Stephen Richardson : Hi, this is Steve. Why don\u2019t I grab Cambridge first? Joel Marcus : Sure. Stephen Richardson : Yes, in Cambridge, the companies are scrambling. I mean they are having some challenges there. There\u2019s not a lot of sublease space available. There\u2019s a little bit. And there are \u2013 there\u2019s not a lot of space under construction. We\u2019ve got a building 399 Binney, where we\u2019ve just finished negotiating a letter of intent for the balance of that building. We\u2019ve had some tenant reconfiguration happening at Tech Square. And on the one Kendall Square campus, we benefited from the tightness Tom by the \u2013 verge in the case of one Kendall Square, where we\u2019ve had a number of spaces, where we\u2019ve been able to early terminate some tenants or reconfigure their leases. So that we can access space for the many tenants who are looking for a space in the market right now. And there\u2019s been some movement to other submarkets as lease out space, Watertown, the Austin section of Boston and some under the 128 Beltway and a couple to the Seaport. But there continues to be very strong demand. We continue to take meetings with groups that are looking out three and four years now, because that\u2019s when the next delivery opportunities for new construction are occurring. And people are cognizant of the tightness of the market and therefore, they\u2019re planning further and further ahead. Joel Marcus : Yes, I would echo very much what Tom said. We see certainly a strong impetus for early renewals, that\u2019s just an imperative for these companies to lock down space oftentimes they\u2019ve invested significant capital into the space. We\u2019ve also seen that they are locking down adjacent blocks of space after the existing tenant lease expiration date. So forward committing to space two and three years down the road. And then finally, for the tenants that are ultimately displaced, we\u2019ve been able to relocate a number of them in other facilities. South San Francisco is a good example at 681 Gateway to relocate and expand companies. So we\u2019re in daily contact with these tenants through our operating teams and it\u2019s a high-class problem. But it is something we work hard at every day. I hand it over to Peter. Peter Moglia : Hey, Tom, it\u2019s Peter Moglia. Just anecdotally, when you ask that question, the Seattle life science market is super tight as well. And one thing that we\u2019ve seen is Juno continues to grow even after being acquired by Celgene and they actually have moved back into the building, they moved out of as a strategy to expand. So just another thing that you can do today with new product being delivered is reoccupy your old product. Tom Catherwood : Got it. Thanks, guys. Joel Marcus : Thank you. Operator : And our question comes from Rich Anderson from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Richard Anderson : Thanks. Good afternoon. So I might have missed this, but what precluded providing, at least, an estimate of return for a few of your first quarter acquisitions? If it was said, I apologize, but I missed the rationale there? Peter Moglia : The disclosures in our incremental package on acquisitions are included on page four. Richard Anderson : Yes. Peter Moglia : Most of the returns that are available have been disclosed. I can tell you that we\u2019re working up the returns on the greater Stanford asset, as well as Quince Orchard. They are in process. And I think the\u2026 Richard Anderson : What about those specific investments make them a little bit less visible at this point in time? Peter Moglia : We are looking at multiple scenarios in the Stanford asset, which could modify the returns just a tad\u2026 Joel Marcus : Lab or office\u2026 Richard Anderson : Okay. Peter Moglia : You\u2019ll find that the return is going to be in line with what you would expect for that market and then 704 Quince Orchard same thing. We\u2019re working through different alternatives there, but I think you\u2019ll find that the returns are solid. And we will publish them at the right time, so stay tuned. Richard Anderson : Okay. Dean you and I had a little conversation about this earlier in the week. But I thought I\u2019d just put on the record a little bit. In terms of the same-store pool, can you talk about how that that collection of assets is adjusted from one period to the next? And if you could provide any sort of data on how that might actually move the number around if it does at all by virtue of the fact that it\u2019s not a consistent pool from year-to-year? Peter Moglia : Yes, I think, this goes back to Manny and Michael in the report that Citi issued probably about six months ago talking about\u2026 Richard Anderson : I did not read that report no offense to Manny and Michael, so I just can\u2019t. Peter Moglia : Yes, so I just want to \u2013 it\u2019s\u2026 Joel Marcus : It wasn\u2019t that good actually. It was highlighting best practices around reporting and they did touch on the lot of great things we did. But what they did to highlight broadly for the REIT sectors that there is some disparity in same-property methodology. I do want to first say that we\u2019ve been very consistent on how we report our same-property pool, including a full reconciliation of the properties that are included and excluded. In fact, we did that one step further for multiple years. We actually showed the same-property performance calculation on three different methods just to give the investment community some sense that there are alternatives. And we think we\u2019ve chosen the most conservative, meaning, the less \u2013 the least inflated type of methodology, meaning, that will drive the least amount of spikes upward in performance. Now getting to your question those same-property pool, we\u2019ve looked at it consistently in the reporting period, Rich, and that period could be a quarter, or it could be a year-to-date or a full year period. And it\u2019s applied in a sense that the asset has to be operating consistently for the entirety of the full period. Richard Anderson : Okay. Joel Marcus : Now the way, I think, the investment community and Michael and Manny highlighted it in their report was there was \u2013 they were asking the question. If you take the sum of four quarters, if the quarterly pulls are slightly different than the annual pull, do you get the same results for the full-year? We looked back just out of curiosity to see that what would change. It turned out there would have been a slight difference to 2017 same-property performance, slight \u2013 very slight, directionally the same message. And coincidentally for 2016 and 2015, absolutely no change in the overall performance for cash and GAAP. So long way of saying, I think, we\u2019re looking carefully at the question you\u2019ve posed, Rich, to be sure that not only do we develop best practices in our disclosure here, but it also that the market evolves to a methodology that just makes sense for same-property performance. So we\u2019re monitoring it and stay tuned is the best thing I could say. Richard Anderson : Okay. Last question, Joel, you alluded to more announcements to come. I\u2019m not asking you to front run those announcements. But could you maybe give us a timeline and any kind of teaser on that at all? Joel Marcus : Oh, they will be probably over the \u2013 and let\u2019s see, we\u2019re in the second quarter, so during the second quarter would be a fair timeframe. Richard Anderson : Okay, great. Thank you. Joel Marcus : Yep, thank you. Operator : And our next question come from Jamie Feldman of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Jamie Feldman : Great. Thank you. I know you had commented on the management changes and you guys have all worked as a team for a long time. But can you just give a little bit more clarity on the division of responsibility across the different levels in the C-suite? Joel Marcus : So the \u2013 if what you\u2019re asking is and I think, we\u2019ve shared this with \u2013 probably we spoke to almost every analyst, I think, after the announcements came out. I think, we said that just generally speaking, Steve would take over the bulk of my responsibilities on the investor outreach and so forth. And team with Dean on that and he would be granular in certain specific regions beyond San Francisco, which he does now. And Peter would be focused heavily as he is now in his role as CIO with all of the leasing and much of the internal growth, as well as acquisition and obviously, on the underwriting. And so I think, that\u2019s broadly and he would be focused on a set of separate regions. So if you look at those things that take up the bulk of our time, that\u2019s kind of where the allocation of responsibility is. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And what about at the President level? Has anything changed there? Joel Marcus : Yes, I think we said that both Dean and Tom would broaden their responsibilities and spend additional time in other regions for Tom. And for Dean, who would be more granular with some of the regional teams than he has been strictly in his role as Chief Financial Officer. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then it sounds like there\u2019s more to come just as we think about this year and even next year just incremental cost from the plan by the time all the dust has settled and all the change certainly? Joel Marcus : Yes. So I think \u2013 yes, so I think we\u2019ve said we\u2019ve shared with the analysts and we\u2019ve certainly shared with a number of investors who followed up with us. And I think Dean has been very, I thought pretty good in trying to explain it. There\u2019s virtually no change in G&A for 2018. What I did was I reduced my long-term incentive stock comp by 50% and much of that was allocated between Steve and Peter. So that there would not be any direct increase or hit to G&A. And I think Dean has had a fair statement that literally there is no change. And I think G&A as a percentage of revenues today still remains in broadly the 8% range. So I think, Dean, you had something to comment? Dean Shigenaga : Yes, it\u2019s \u2013 G&A has been pretty consistent, guys. It\u2019s roughly in the 60 basis point range as a percentage of total assets as an example. And no real significant G&A impact from the announcements of the executive changes. So I think the way to think about it too is, if you have to go outside and bring in a CEO, that\u2019s where you actually load up and hire an additional executive to the team, which also somewhat suggest that compensation at the executive level for the front runners would be far off the mark for them even to step into that role. So we\u2019re uniquely situated here with highly experienced executives, as you guys well know. And so there wasn\u2019t a big step up on comp matters here across the Board. Joel Marcus : Yes. And in my case, I thought Steve was probably worth it and Peter was not, but that\u2019s just the way it ends up. Peter Moglia : The government already took mine. Jamie Feldman : All right, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Joel Marcus : You\u2019re welcome. Jamie Feldman : And then just to focus on some of the 2018 deliveries and even the 2019 deliveries that when you look at lease plus negotiation, you\u2019re still looking at kind of less than 50%. So 5 Lab Drive, 9900 Medical Center and 279 East Grand. Can you just give us an update on leasing there, at least, tenant interest there? Stephen Richardson : Yes, Jamie, it\u2019s Steve. Again, out of that 2.3 million square feet, 2018 and 2019, we are 81% leased. So may be drilling down on 279 East Grand, Verily has taken 49% of the project. We\u2019re fielding multiple offers for the property, so the demand is very high. I would expect we\u2019ll be very selective and throughout the year have that fully resolved 681 Gateway in South San Francisco, similar situation, Twist Bioscience has anchored the project, fielding multiple offers as well. And it\u2019s a range of small tenants, as well as additional pharma companies looking to enter the market. So overall, I\u2019d say, we\u2019re very bullish there. And then looking at 1818 Fairview up in Seattle, the negotiations are going well, as well as groups behind that kind of leading getting anchor there. Joel Marcus : And on 5 Laboratory, I would say, there\u2019s a fair amount of interest. We don\u2019t deliver that till the end of the year. And we expect it is unique in that part of the world kind of the center of ag tech in the United States. And there\u2019s virtually no available first-class campus for office lab and greenhouse. Peter Moglia : I\u2019ll finish up. 399 Binney has more demand than the space. We have that \u2013 the last 11% is highly competitive right now. So we\u2019re settling on who\u2019s going to take that. And then last one would be 9900 Medical Center Drive, a redevelopment that we have now 58% under negotiation. So we\u2019re progressing as we believe they would. Jamie Feldman : Okay. All right, Thanks and congratulations to everyone. Joel Marcus : Thank you. Stephen Richardson : Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. Jed Reagan : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Just a follow-up on Sheila\u2019s question from earlier. One of your office REIT peers spoke this morning about their plans to target life science tenants for a development on Manhattan\u2019s Far West Side near Penn Station. Just curious if you think there\u2019s a legs to lab demand in that part of the city? And are you studying expansion into that part of town? Dean Shigenaga : Yes, I think that you have to remember and the group probably is a very noteworthy developer. But I think the thing that you learn is, New York is really a \u2013 an early-stage life science cluster. It really originated out of academic and clinical expertise, but lacked really the \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have lots of management teams that have done this before. It\u2019s got much better risk capital, venture capital in the early-stage than it had when we started about a dozen years ago there, but still you can\u2019t compare it even in the world to San Francisco or Cambridge. So primarily the New York market as it turns out and we\u2019ve been at it now eight years and to build a cluster like that, to be a secondary cluster, it will never be a primary cluster, it\u2019s about a generation, it\u2019s about a 25 year process and the real thrust there is really very early stage seed and Series A stage companies spinning out of academic medical centers, those are the companies where there is activity. You aren\u2019t going to bring a big pharma like you do in the Cambridge with hundreds of thousands of square feet, it just will not happen in Manhattan. So I think that people may tell what they\u2019re trying to do, but unless they understand the market, unless they are able to handle the market, I think it\u2019s going be hard going for them, because it\u2019s just a very different market and a very different ecosystem in which it grows and that\u2019s why you find virtually no other places in the United States outside of the Seattle, San Francisco, San Diego, Cambridge, New York in its early-stage, the Maryland, North Carolina, a lot of places want to do this, but it\u2019s very, very difficulty, it\u2019s literally next to impossible and people want to be in clusters where they can actually ramp up and hire people and hiring in New York City is possible, but it\u2019s still hard. Jed Reagan : That\u2019s very interesting, thank you for that. And there were media reports recently that Alexandria was bidding for Santa Monica Business Park before one of your peers acquired it. To the extend you are able to discuss it, was there a potential lab conversion play there or were you interested in that asset more from a creative office perspective sort of tech office perspective and maybe in general what\u2019s your appetite to grow in LA and do you see any momentum in that market from a life science perspective? Peter Moglia : Hey Jed, it\u2019s Peter, look, that is a great asset and we definitely felt it was worth looking, and it\u2019s in our backyard, but to refute some of the press we were not in the best and final round. We dropped out and forgot that, but yes we were looking at it as a potential laboratory play for a portion of it. LA is an interesting market as Joel just said, it can take a decade to build something. We\u2019ve been working on LA actually since the 90s and we\u2019ve seen some positive signs that there could be something a foot. So just to be ahead of the game, we\u2019re going to look at things like that that especially in locations that we think our client tenants would like to be in. Jed Reagan : Great, I appreciate the comments. Joel Marcus : Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Karin Ford of MUFG Securities. Please go ahead. Karin Ford : Hi good afternoon. Can you update us on what the current space requirements are in the market in Cambridge, San Francisco and San Diego? Joel Marcus : When you say space required, you mean just what the demand looks like? Karin Ford : Yes. Stephen Richardson : Karin, hi this is Steve Richardson. Yes, in San Francisco right now we\u2019re tracking about 2.3 million square feet of lab demand, Cambridge is somewhat similar at about 2.5 million square feet of lab demand. Down in San Diego we\u2019ve got a 1 million square feet, up in Seattle about 650,000 square feet. In Maryland, as we\u2019ve been talking about for a while now has been recovering strongly, we have about 500,000 square feet of demand there. So, overall a very consistent healthy demand with prior years. Karin Ford : Great, thanks for that. Joel Marcus : And we would throw a footnote, in New York City for example, there is really no waiting line for lab space. It really is you have to take the spin outs one by one and if you\u2019re going to go after any more established companies to put outposts in New York, you actually have to go after them and pitch them, but there\u2019s no really established waiting line. Karin Ford : Great, thanks for that. Have you started to see any positive impact from the tax cuts on your tenants? Joel Marcus : Well, I think that a number of the companies both pharma and biotech have obviously had favorable impacts from tax reduction and repatriations that I\u2019m sure has fueled some of the M&A we\u2019ve seen here in the first quarter and probably will continue to see that. So I think in a sense that the margins we don\u2019t see any big demand coming out of that per se, because I would say that big pharma through their normal course of going after products when they have a product that\u2019s going through the pipeline and it looks very promising that tends to be the spur for expansion and I think a lot of those companies will use \u2013 they\u2019ll invest in their R&D and we\u2019ll see some expansion in the markets they are already in, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see anything hugely dramatic from that, but it\u2019s all positive that\u2019s for darn sure. Karin Ford : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Marcus for any closing remarks. Joel Marcus : Okay, well thank you everybody. We did it within an hour and appreciate it and talk to you next quarter. Operator : Thank you sir, today\u2019s conference has now concluded and we thank you all for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz with Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Paula Schwartz : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel. Joel Marcus : Thank you, Paula, and welcome everybody to our second quarter call. And with me today are Steve Richardson, Peter Moglia, Dean Shigenaga, Dan Ryan, Tom Andrews, John Cunningham. Once again, I have the distinct pleasure and honor to thank our first-in-class team for delivering a truly outstanding second quarter with superb operational excellence and really, really outstanding. Life science tenants in each and every one of our clusters and submarkets recognize the Alexandria brand for highest quality, highest reliability, best-in-class service and best collaborative partnering. These qualities substantially enhance our pricing power in each of our markets and the statistics bear that out. We're also in the first year 2018 of the 5-year growth plan we announced at Investor Day 2017 to double the revenues of the company. As Steve will talk about, we've had -- we have and continue to expect to have strong per share FFO performance during 2018 and have great visibility for growth into 2019. As all of you know, our urban clustering strategy is based on the belief that clustering similar businesses together boost productivity, operating efficiency, and innovation, a concept promoted by Harvard economist, Michael Porter. About a year after we became public and read his -- one of his many works, but the one on competition and a particular chapter entitled, Clusters and the New Economics of Competition, he noted successful businesses are typically found within close proximity of one another or in clusters despite technological advances allowing companies to operate really from anywhere. And that clustering approach, which we adopted has been a smart strategy that's paid off in great locations in clusters like Cambridge, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, New York City and so forth. I think underpinning the growth, as I\u2019ve said a number of times is we're still in the early innings of discovery of diagnostics therapeutics whether they'd be cures or really effective treatments. We\u2019ve only addressed about 5% of the diseases that are known to mankind. I think it's also good to note as we did last quarter, the five key reasons why this industry is working on all cylinders right now as we've seen now a historic growth in the funding for the National Institutes of Health, a very strong and innovative Food and Drug Administration, more research spending on medical philanthropy than ever. We're really experiencing record years in venture capital and we continue to see robust spending on R&D by commercial stage biopharma companies. And in fact, I think, Ian Read of Pfizer this morning announced an increase in their R&D spending, which is a good news. Want to comment briefly before I turn it over to Steve on our New York City life science cluster, which I was proud to lead the launch with an amazing and talented team, and that team has built, leased, and operated our flagship campus at the Alexandria Center for Life Science, New York City in a truly outstanding fashion, and has helped start and/or recruit its world-class tenant base. And keep in mind, we\u2019ve had to truly create a commercial life science tenant base there where none has existed. With the recently announced acquisition of 219 East 42nd Street, one of Pfizer's current headquarters buildings within a short 13 blocks of our ACLS campus close to Grand Central and ensconced in the middle of Manhattan's dense East Side Medical Corridor, we made an outstanding purchase at $500 -- $580 a square foot with a strong current yield and a medium-term lease back to Pfizer. And what's particularly of interest to us is the future 350,000-square-foot of ideal lab/office redevelopment. So East Side Medical Corridor is in proximity to Grand Central, proximity to our own anchor campus, medium-term leaseback with Pfizer's strong yields, excellent cost per square foot, and difficult to locate Manhattan buildings with convertibility. And then finally I want to address something that is I think is near and dear to all our hearts, what really matters to employees and team members, in general, and here at Alexandria. And recently there was a study by Harvard Business Review that spoke about a single word, Repsect. There is old respect, which we accord equally to all members of our team. There is earned respect, which recognizes individuals who display valued qualities or behaviors and acknowledges that each member has specific strengths and talents, and there is identity development, self respect in a sense of unique self. So, just as instability can spiral as we witness daily on social media, so too can a culture of respect and that is why we at Alexandria deeply care about respect in our work life. So Steve, take it away. Stephen Richardson : Thank you, Joel. I'll be covering the markets this afternoon. But before I do that, I'd like to build on Joel's comments and underscore the profound shift in the sciences that is driving the success of Alexandria's highly differentiated strategy. We had the pleasure of listening to George Demetri, a world-renowned Doctor and Director for one of the key oncology centers at the Dana-Farber in Cambridge, expressing his strong enthusiasm for the shift in a compelling interview with one of his patients who has survived cancer for several years due to these new therapies. These breakthroughs underpin our stellar results and a defining strategy. Several highlights include : We have an industry-leading investment grade large market cap tenant quality comprising 55% of ARR, and 83% of top 20 tenant's ARR is from this class of investment grade or large market cap companies. 78% of our ARR is from Class A facilities in key gateway markets on the East and West Coast with AAA locations adjacent to the country's leading research universities and institutions. The product type we work with day-in and day-out is mission-critical. The tenants absolutely demand sophistication and deep expertise in design, construction, leasing, and operations and a long-term partnership approach. Our science and technology teams' unique expertise underwriting cutting edge companies provides unmatched insight into the life science industry. And finally, as Peter will touch on later in the call, the clearly visible pipeline driving growth through 2018 and 2019 totaling 2.6 million square feet is 84% leased at great yields generating significant NAV. Let's take a look at the market. We're really seeing robust and high-quality demand evident across all of our core clusters. As you can see from the supplemental, 65% of leasing this quarter is early renewals and 58% year-to-date are early renewals, clearly indicating a strong sense of urgency in the market. As we look at market-to-market, Cambridge had a 1.6 vacancy rate at our Investor Day during November of 2017; todayit's 0.7%. Demand was at 1.8 million square feet then, it's 2.2 million square feet today. San Francisco at that time had a 5.5 vacancy rate, now it's 3.3%. There was 2.5 million square feet of demand then, and now we have 2.8 million square feet of demand. San Diego had a 7% vacancy rate during November of '17, it's now at 5.2% and demand remains solid with about 859,000 square feet. Maryland's vacancy rate has remained about the same at 3%, but demand has increased from 379,000 feet to 511,000 feet, and it's important to note that VC funding has more than doubled to $370 million, and 52 life science companies have been started in the past 18 months providing important diversification from NIH-related entities. And finally, Seattle's vacancy rate has stayed strong at just 1%, and demand is healthy as well at about 575,000 square feet. Our 1818 Fairview development has 169,000 feet of active life science demand in addition to the lease negotiating spaces referenced in the supplemental, and so we expect to substantially resolve the balance of the leasing during the second half of 2018 well ahead of pro forma. Just a couple notable leases to highlight, and this one in particular, I think, really speaks to the differentiated strategy here at Alexandria. The 106,000 square feet in Seattle with the Fred Hutch at our flagship of waterfront stream plant, sports a 35% GAAP increase, a perfect example of the breakthroughs and therapies noted above and the virtuous cycle in our clusters. Fred Hutch had licensed key CAR-T technology to Juno Therapeutics. Juno in turn delivered groundbreaking clinical outcomes with these novel therapies. Celgene then acquired in Juno for $9 billion and a portion of the proceeds flow to the Fred Hutch as a shareholder and the Hutch in turn is now expanding its research efforts at 1201, truly an excellent outcome. Seattle is quickly becoming a center of innovation for immunology, especially immuno-oncology and has a longstanding reputation as a center for global health and infectious disease research. A 50,000-square-foot lease with AstraZeneca, in Gaithersburg, Maryland is a clear indication of the health of that market as we referenced about. And finally, one of the especially notable leases this quarter was in Cambridge at 152,000 square feet with Sarepta at 215 First Street with a huge 53% GAAP increase. So the markets are very, very strong in all of our key clusters. And with that, I'll turn it over to Peter. Peter Moglia : Thanks, Steve. Those are outstanding fundamentals, and the reason probably driving what I'm going to say right now as I update everybody on our near-term pipeline. After that I'm going to touch on cap rates, and then I'm going to address CapEx since it's become a top of my topic since the Green Street July 19 report on this subject. With the cost to complete of $868 million should deliver another 2.6 million square feet of Class A facilities in AAA locations of gateway markets, we are well-positioned to continue to driving significant NAV growth well into 2019. The projects that we'll deliver through the balance of '18 and '19 are a combined 84% leased, giving investors clear visibility of the value creation ahead. In the second half of '18, we're going to deliver a 0.5 million square feet, including 399 Binney Street in Cambridge, which is 75% leased with all but the retail space under negotiation. This wonderful addition to our One Kendall Square campus is expected to stabilize at a 6.7% cash yield in a market that is at least 4% cap rate. 9625 Towne Centre Drive and University Town Center submarket of San Diego will be delivered to investment-grade tenant Takeda in the fourth quarter at a 7% stabilized cash yield, and our 5 Laboratory Drive project in the Research Triangle Park is quickly becoming a focal point of the AgTech community with 38% of the project leased and serious prospects for another 30% of that space. Yields on this project are expected to be in the high 7s. In 2019, we'll be delivering over 2.1 million square feet, including the first phase of our Alexandria Park redevelopment in Palo Alto, which has already been fully leased to a tenant that was subsequently purchased by a $27 billion publicly traded company, enhancing our credit before the paint was even dry. 681 Gateway in South San Francisco, that is essentially a 100% leased or under negotiation with strong initial cash and GAAP yields of 7.9% and 8.5%, respectively. 279 East Grand also in South San Francisco anchored by Alphabet subsidiary Verily and in various stages of negotiation for all of the remaining space is expected to deliver spectacular 8.1% cash and 7.8% GAAP yields. And finally, 1818 Fairview in Seattle, which is making excellent progress with 24% under lease or negotiation and another 115,000 square feet of serious prospects actively engaged. All the activity there is life science-related, and it's confirming that Seattle's life science market is certainly gaining momentum. Initial stabilized yields for this project are projected to be 6.7% on both the cash and GAAP basis in a sub-5 cap rate investment market. Speaking of cap rates. As you recall, on the last earnings call, we described a sizable deal that was pending in Cambridge. Since that time, it's been disclosed that Forest City and its partners bought out MIT's 50% interest in a portion of lab/office product at University Park in East Cambridge. We understand with the purchase price applies a low 4% cap rate. In addition, we wanted to add to the Seattle commentary by mentioning 2 new sales comps in South Lake Union, both 404 Fairview Avenue North, a 350,000-square-foot office building and 202 Westlake Avenue North, 130,000-square-foot office building recently sold to institutional investors at 4.2% cap rates at prices in the high $900-per-square-foot range, illustrating that Seattle is indeed one of the most desirable investment markets in the country and that investors are still willing to pay healthy prices for core assets in gateway markets. To wrap up our comments, we wanted to touch briefly on Green Street's CapEx report of July 19. One of the differentiating factors of our business model is the reusability of our building improvements. Green Street's analysis of our office peers revealed annual CapEx in the range of 26% to 31%. Those of you, who attended our Investor Day may recall our 5-year average being approximately half the lower end of that range. So with that, I'm going to go ahead and pass it on to Dean. Dean Shigenaga : All right. Thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. I want to briefly cover first, our inaugural Corporate Responsibility Report, for the third time NAREIT Gold Award for Communications & Reporting Excellence, second quarter results and significant revenue and cash NOI growth, our continued strong internal growth, provide a brief overview of our highly leased value-creation pipeline, cover our balance sheet and improving credit metrics, and I'll close out with comments on our updated guidance, importantly on our $0.03 increase in the midpoint of our FFO per share growth. Corporate responsibility, just wanted to thank Jennifer Banks, our co-CEO and General Counsel, Vince Ciruzzi, our Chief Development Officer, Ari Frankel, AVP of Sustainability & High Performance buildings and his team, and Katie O'Brien our Executive Director of Corporate Communications for their excellent work on our inaugural Corporate Responsibility Report that we issued in June. This report captures our efforts focused on important environmental, social and governance matters, and our goal of making a positive and meaningful impact on the health, safety and wellbeing of our tenants, stockholders, employees and the communities in which we live and work. This report also includes our 2025 sustainability goals for ground up development, environmental impact, reduction of the energy, carbon, water and waste and healthy building certifications. We are again very honored to have been selected for the third time as NAREIT's Gold Award winner as the #1 in the large cap category by an independent panel of judges for Communications & Reporting Excellence to the investment community. So a huge congrats to our entire team. Thank you, guys. We reported very strong second quarter results that highlight excellent and efficient execution by our team on our strategic and operational goals. Total revenues for the quarter were $325 million, up 19% over the first quarter of '17. Cash NOI for the second quarter annualized was $818 million, up $125 million or 18.1% over cash net operating income for the fourth quarter annualized. FFO per share diluted as adjusted was reported at $1.64, and up 9.3% over second quarter of 2017. We reported continued and strong internal growth that reflects the strength of our real estate and life science industry fundamentals, and our unique and differentiated business strategy. Occupancy remains very strong. It was up 50 basis points to 97.1%. Briefly on One Kendall Square, our team is well ahead of timing for capturing the mark-to-market opportunity for below market leases. To-date, our team has executed 280,000 rentable square feet of lease renewals and releasing of space for approximately 3x the leasing that we had originally anticipated by June 30. However, this accelerated leasing did result in temporary vacancy at One Kendall Square with occupancy dipping to 80% for a couple of months before rebounding to about 88% as of June 30. Rental rate growth on leasing activity continues to remain very strong. Over the past 4 years, rental rate growth on leasing activity has ranged from 20% to 28% on a GAAP basis and 10% to 14% on a cash basis. Rental rate growth for the second quarter was 24% and 12.8% on a cash basis in line with this trend and puts us on track for updated full year guidance on rental rate growth. On our early renewals, Steve touched on this briefly, but roughly 2/3 of our lease renewals and releasing of space in the first half of the year really related to early lease renewals. 1/3 of these related to expirations in '21, '22 and '23. Now that we're about halfway through 2018, we really have better visibility on the portion of early renewals, including the renewals that were executed in the second quarter and have increased our full year guidance for rental rate growth. Additionally, as we look back at value-creation leasing by our team in the first half of '18 that really highlights truly amazing execution, over 1 million rentable square feet related to new Class A properties undergoing development and redevelopment, including 594,000 with Uber in Mission Bay, 133 rentable square feet with several very high-quality venture-backed biotechs at 399 Binney Street in Cambridge, 104,000 rentable square feet with Verily, that is a subsidiary of Alphabet at 279 East Grand, 61,000 rentable square feet with a really exciting DNA synthesis company at 681 Gateway in San Francisco, 34,000 square feet with several Ag biotech entities at 5 Laboratory Drive and Research Triangle Park, and then very recently 26,000 rentable square feet with Lonza at 9900 Medical Center Drive and Shady Grove. The first half same-property NOI growth was very strong and in line with our guidance for the full year of 2018. Our second quarter same-property cash NOI growth was also solid, but also reflected the temporary vacancy at One Kendall Square that we mentioned earlier, and also reflects no cash growth benefit from our recently completed development project at 75/125 Binney Street since full cash rents commenced on April 1, 2017. Importantly, we remain on track with all the same-property performance for both the 6 and 12 months ending December 31, 2018. Peter had briefly covered our pipeline in detail, just to provide a brief overview of summary. 3.5 million square feet targeted for delivery in '18, '19 and '20. 2.6 million of that is really targeted for '18 and '19, that's 1.8 billion at completion, 84% leased that will generate very strong yields of 7.3% and 6.8% on a cash basis. And right behind that, we have about 908,000 rentable square feet undergoing marketing, while we execute on preconstruction activities to reduce the time to deliver these projects. Turning to our balance sheet. We completed the issuance of $900 million of unsecured senior notes at a weighted average rate of 4.35% and a weighted average term of 8.8 years. $450 million of the notes were related to our sustainability initiatives with proceeds allocated to fund certain eligible green development and redevelopment projects that either have or expected to receive LEED Gold or Platinum certification. In July, we also partially repaid $150 million of our outstanding construction loans. And then later this year, we anticipate repaying the remaining $200 million outstanding under our 2019 unsecured term loan. So as you look back over 2017 and including the full year of 2018, we will have refinanced over $940 million of variable rate level based debt further strengthening our balance sheet and our credit profile. We have just recently commenced an amendment process to our line of credit and our 2021 term loan, which is really focused primarily on extending the maturity date to 2024 with an opportunity to slightly improve pricing and increase the overall capacity under our line of credit. We expect to close this amendment in the third quarter and will provide more details shortly after closing. We also remain on track to achieve our key credit metric goals and remain committed to continued improvement in our credit metrics each year, including fourth quarter annualized net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA as our goal for 2019 and 2020 is to move closer to 5 times. Unhedged variable rate debt is targeted to be less than 5% at the end of this year, and we are reviewing our options to cover our remaining equity capital for 2018 from additional real estate sales. And additionally, we do expect to file a new aftermarket offering program at some point over the next 1 to 3 quarters. So in closing on guidance, we did update our guidance for earnings per share to a range of $2.87 to $2.93 and FFO per share as adjusted to a range of $6.57 to $6.63. This represents a $0.03 increase at the midpoint for FFO per share as adjusted, and the key drivers of the increase really is a combination, continued strength of our core operations combined with growth from our recently announced acquisitions. And I should point out that this $0.03 increase follows the $0.02 increase in our midpoint from last quarter. We also increased the midpoint of our guidance for occupancy up 20 basis points to a range of 97.1% to 97.7%, and rental rate growth of 400 basis points and 200 basis points on a GAAP and cash basis for each range. So our range for GAAP and cash rental growth is now 17% to 20% and 9.5% to 12.5%, respectively. And just as a reminder everybody, we have a large pool of same-property assets that drive growth in net operating income. $0.01 in bottom line FFO per share growth only increases same-property NOI growth by about 15 basis points. So as a result of the improvement in our outlook for occupancy and rental rate growth on leasing activity, it is really reflected in the strength of our range of guidance for a strong same-property growth for 2018. So with that, I'll close it out and turn it back over to Joel Marcus. Joel Marcus : Okay. Operator, can we go to Q&A, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question will be from Manny Korchman of Citi. Please go ahead. Manny Korchman : Hi, everyone. Good afternoon. Joel, you opened the call talking about cluster markets and both sort of your entry barrier success there. I was hoping you could help us frame New York in a more specific way with the cluster markets as a focus, the building you're acquiring is, I guess, near your East River campus, but I wouldn't call it a cluster per se. And then you also have the risk of new developments that are already going on and will be going on near the new projects. So how do you sort of put all that together and connect it back to your cluster theory? Joel Marcus : Well, Manny, thanks for asking the question. Well, first of all, a cluster, if you look at the 2 leading established clusters both kind of the Greater Boston cluster and the San Francisco Bay cluster, those really evolved in the late '70s and early '80s and took literally a generation to really grow and become what they are today. And so New York is really in the first decade of a 25-year process. So what you may see in other clusters, you won't necessarily see today in New York and Manhattan just given its limited geography and the density of buildings and people there is going to evolve somewhat differently, but we do believe and we've said this for a long time, the East Side Medical Corridor is really where people want to be with, relatively if there is such a thing, easy access or at least fairly good access to the institutions and to the ecosystem. So that's kind of how we think about the shape of the Manhattan market. And over time, I think, you will see it evolve in ways that even today we can't actually necessarily predict. But our focus has been the East Side corridor, and this is a, in my view, a bull's-eye and a home run in that sweet spot. Manny Korchman : Thanks, Joel. And maybe one for Dean, the acquisitions you've done to-date are right at the midpoint of your guidance range, but you only have $50 million left to hit the high end. Is that just guiding right now to what you see in the pipe and that number is likely to move upwards or is the acquisition environment just sort of more difficult than that $50 million is probably about accurate? Dean Shigenaga : Yes Manny, I think it's indicative of our view at the moment, but it's probably also just to put that into perspective a little bit. At the beginning of every year, at Investor Day, we do give an outlook on acquisitions, and typically it's fairly nominal as it exists at all, and that really has to do with the fact that we don't really know what will hit the market, Manny, that actually makes sense to acquire. Peter and the team keeps a pretty good pulse on activities in the market, and if something makes sense, we may bid on it, but ultimately winning the project is a whole different conclusion. We really need to make sense of the deal. So right now, we don't see a lot remaining on the horizon, but something could come up, Manny. And if it does, we'll keep the market informed. Manny Korchman : Thanks. Operator : The next question will be from Jamie Feldman of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Jamie Feldman : Great, thank you. I guess, sticking with Dean here. So you had a decent amount of recognized gains from the investment portfolio in the quarter. Can you just talk about how you've included those in guidance for the year? Whether -- how much is in your guidance for the quarter or just as you think about the year overall, how much you include or have you included? Dean Shigenaga : Manny, I think, that question may have come -- sorry, Jamie, that question may have come up last quarter or the quarter before. And I think my reference was that just look back historically where we've been, every year it does vary a little bit. I think over the last 3, 4, 5 years, its' probably been in the $10 million to $20 million range. Currently, it's on a path to probably get to the upper end of that. And I would say that much of our activity is really event-driven. We do from time-to-time sell some of the public securities as a result of a company reaching its IPO or being acquired by a public company. But as an example in the second quarter, this gain was really event-driven. It was related to an acquisition of a biotech company, and that resulted in the majority of that gain that was recognized this quarter. So leading into the quarter, we had no idea that, that particular transaction would have occurred. And so I think that's the most important thing to keep in mind. We don't necessarily control the gains that are being realized. They do occur because of great events that are occurring in the marketplace. Jamie Feldman : Okay. But you typically assumed that $10 million to $20 million per year is the right way to think about? Dean Shigenaga : That's where it's been for the last 3, 4, 5 years, if I recall it correctly, Jamie. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then I guess, just thinking more about the Pfizer acquisition and redevelopment. I mean, clearly, this is an investment in the infill market with a redevelopment components in kind of older building, older market. Do you think -- as you think about your business going forward and where you do see these cluster markets, you are supposed to see more of that rather than kind of Greenfield ground up from Alexandria? Joel Marcus : Well, I think again it depends on the market, but we've done some of that all along in a number of markets, and we still have obviously in other markets or even in some of those same markets, a robust development pipeline. So I think you'll see some of both. This was an unusual situation. I'm sure we could -- one knew that Pfizer was looking over time to do something. But as Dean said early on, when things come to the market, you react to them. You don't necessarily know a year or 2 out or even sometimes quarters out exactly what's going on. But I think you will see us to do a combination of those two. That's been our bread-and-butter. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then last one from me is, just any thoughts on the tenant credit watch list. Are there any tenants you're concerned about right now? Dean Shigenaga : Jamie, it's Dean here. If you look at the top 20 tenants that we got disclosed, they're all in really great position today. 83% of that top 20 list is either investment-grade or $10 billion or greater in valuation. So really no significant concerns out there. Joel Marcus : Yes. And I think our number 1 tenant Illumina had a good day today. I think they are up about 10% or so, that's very good. So our underwriting is very thorough, very in-depth ongoing and at the moment, as Dean said, I think we feel very comfortable with our tenants. And very frankly, we've avoided, I can think of one case in the Bay area, in fact, I think I was interviewed on this at CNBC Power Lunch a couple of months ago, we decided not to take on the Theranos building. It went for sale up in the Stanford Research Park because of the belief that the business was going to fail, and there would be repercussions from that both financially and reputationally. So we thought it was good real estate, but it was something we just didn't feel appropriate in pursuing. So we're pretty careful about what we do. Jamie Feldman : Okay. Thank you. Joel Marcus : Thank you, Jim. Operator : The next question will be from Sheila McGrath of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead Sheila McGrath : Hi. Yes. Another question on the New York Pfizer acquisition. Just to clarify, the current cap rate on that is 6.7%, and what kind of returns do you expect on the redevelopment? And is there any excess development rates given rezoning changes in that area? Joel Marcus : Yes. So John Cunningham is on. So John want to maybe highlight, at least initially. Not in too much depth there. John Cunningham : Yes. As far as the additional density, the nice thing about the asset is that we bordered at 9.6 FAR by rate, it's currently at 15 FAR. So there is an additional 230,000 square feet of additional density available. And then given the additional changes at the -- based on the Midtowny's rezoning, it could go up to about 21 FAR, 21.4. We have not really considered and utilizing that level of FAR for this site, but are confident that we'll keep our options open going forward in the future. Peter Moglia : Hey Sheila, it's Peter Moglia. I guess, just I confirm the cap rate is 6, 7. So I think -- and I think Joel touched on it, I think one of the key things to this is the $580-per-square-foot value. If you sit down and break the numbers, and you take, okay, you're getting a big leaseback from Pfizer for 6 years, if you just value that leaseback and subtracted it from what we paid, you're essentially getting it for the land value. And I think -- so we're paying for the land value, but we're getting a building that we're going to able to leverage off of. So in 6 to 7 years when we start planning for the redevelopment, we're really going to have a great basis from which to price the next-generation of Alexandria in New York life science real estate. Sheila McGrath : Okay, great. And then on acquisitions, I guess, Peter, the stabilized yield in the supplemental on 100 Tech Drive and the Maryland life science portfolio, those yields go up to like 8.7 and 9.1. I'm just wondering are those yields just rolling in place leases to market? Or are you redeveloping those buildings? Peter Moglia : The 100 Tech Drive is actually already delivered. So that's set, and so is the Maryland portfolio. It's a 100% leased portfolio. There is a little bit of rollover coming at the next couple of years, but we fully expect to reach those numbers and potentially be a little bit better. Sheila McGrath : Okay. And last question, you were active on ATM this quarter, it doesn't look like you need that much additional equity capital based on the plan. Just if you could touch on what assets are for sale? Is it non-core? Or do you look -- are you looking to do a joint venture of a stabilized asset? Dean Shigenaga : Sheila, it's Dean here. Yes, we have $230 million remaining of equity capital sought for the rest of this year, excluding the forward that we can settle by the end of the year. So the goal is, as I mentioned in my commentary is to look at dispositions. We do have some, what I call non-strategic assets that we're selling. But importantly, I think, we do want to look at something of high value that would be attractive cost of capital and a disposition here. Joel Marcus : A partial interest disposition. Dean Shigenaga : So we're working through the details of that, and we'll provide more color over the next -- maybe by the next call, we'll give a little more detail around our plans there. Sheila McGrath : Okay, great. Thank you. Dean Shigenaga : Thanks, Sheila. Operator : The next question will be from Tom Catherwood of BTIG. Please go ahead. Tom Catherwood : Thank you. And good afternoon, everybody. So Steve and Dean, just on the forward leasing that you mentioned, I think, you mentioned roughly 2/3 of leasing has been forward. Of that, 1/3 is on leases that '21, '22, '23. What are the mechanics as far as when you recognize the same-store NOI growth, are those leases blends and extends? Does the kind of growth kick in once the natural lease term expires? How does that kind of flow-through to your earnings? Dean Shigenaga : So Tom, it's Dean here. It depends on the transaction, an extension of the lease will usually trigger 3 straight lining GAAP revenue. The actual commencement of the cash rents, which in this environment is generally upward, will depend on the negotiation, probably more frequently that occurs at the initial expiration date and then steps as opposed to bringing that all the way forward. And I think the other thing to think about is part of the early renewals were in one case, in Cambridge as an example, was connected to an expansion. So you have an early renewal and expansion all combined together. And the expansion component would commence upon and delivery of the expansion space. So hopefully that gives you a sense for what to expect. Stephen Richardson : Tom, this is Steve. Maybe add to that, just to be very clear, blend and extend implies some type of concession, that's absolutely not what is happening here. These are early renewals with a sense of urgency in the market and people are coming to us to lock down space. When you look at these vacancy rates of 1%, 2%, 3%, the tenants are acutely aware of the competition for space. Tom Catherwood : Got it. So just to clarify, if it was just kind of the first scenario, Dean, that you laid out where it's an extension, so the GAAP store same-store NOI change would be recognized now, and then the cash would kick in the later years whenever that natural exploration was, correct? Dean Shigenaga : Correct. And then to remind, some of these early renewals is also One Kendall Square. I shouldn't say early, some of it's releasing. So one of the expirations was, I believe, 2023 expiration related to re-tenanting with the new tenant, which allows us to capture the cash rents much sooner. Tom Catherwood : Got it. And switching over to developments, Page 5, you guys lists 493,000 square feet of development rights that you acquired this quarter. If you go back to your kind of landholdings, it looks like these development rates are spread amongst Greater Stanford, San Diego, RTP and an undisclosed bucket of other value-creation projects. Can you walk through these additional opportunities? And kind of how they came to fruition this quarter? Joel Marcus : I think we don't want to get into, because there are some assemblage and some other key strategy. So I'd say, Tom, kind of hold your question for a couple of quarters, and we'll lay that out. Tom Catherwood : Very fair. Then maybe I'll try one development, one hopefully that you can talk on. The development rates did seem to jump up for the third phase of the New York City Alexandria center, is that something you could talk about? Joel Marcus : Right. So we have signed a letter of intent on May 31 with the city. We're working -- John and the team are working on the ground lease negotiations. We expect to have a building that will be enhanced in size from what we believe, but I would say stay tuned, the announcement will be forthcoming fairly shortly. Tom Catherwood : Got it. Thanks, Joel. Joel Marcus : Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Rich Anderson of Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Rich Anderson : Thanks. Getting back to the ATM comment earlier. Is to fair to say you fast-track that may be quicker than at least we were assuming in our model? Was that driven by the Pfizer deal? Or was that always kind of assumed to be kind of a chunky issuance this quarter? Dean Shigenaga : I'd say, broadly, the ATM usage this quarter, in the second quarter was driven by acquisitions broadly, Rich. And when we see the deal flow, that was under contract, we did go forward into the ATM program. The timing may not be matched perfectly in all circumstances, but I think at the price point that we did raised the capital, it was fairly attractive to do so at the time we did. Rich Anderson : Okay. And then Joel mentioned, Illumina having a good day today, Pfizer indicating more R&D spend, Biogen, I suppose, we're reading that as a good news with their Alzheimer's activity. I'm looking at your top 20 list, do you -- are there any that you could peg there or having similar but may be quieter good moments where they are expressing to you that they need more space? I don't know, if you could be company-specific, but are you getting that with the regular kind of a flow of information from your top 20 tenants because of certain things that are going on within the organizations? Joel Marcus : Yes, I don't want to broadcast their pipeline of leasing. But I would say that Lilly had certainly a positive quarter. Celgene's kind of on the turnaround doing better, it had -- stock had lagged for a while; bluebird is still in a very strong position, but doing the same thing. So I would say, in general, almost all of these have, I think strengths of businesses that -- they have been slow, I mean, it's hard to say on any given quarter, but I think in general, there is positive absorption from some of these, not necessarily all at this point, but some of these tenants for sure. Rich Anderson : And when you look at them as also competitors like MIT, is there any -- or I should say -- I shouldn't say like them, but MIT is a competitor, do others kind of fit that mold too at all?Or they're generally lassies? Joel Marcus : Well, I think because MIT has a gigantic endowment and they have a pretty huge real estate strategy, they're pretty unique in that regard. Rich Anderson : Okay. And then lastly on the Pfizer deal, $580 a square foot going in. I hear you on getting a lot of NOI back over the next couple of years, and may be seeing that land value as a basis. But is this -- when you think about redevelopment, is it too soon to talk about what that could be in terms of a per pound type of investment? Or should we just be thinking about this as an acquisition in and of itself and we'll worry about that 7 years from now? Peter Moglia : Yes Tom, it's Peter Moglia. I'd say it's the latter. We're going to collect rent for 6 years, and we'll see where it goes from there. But I think of it this way, one of the most efficient ways for us to provide space to the market is through redevelopment of an existing building that we can get at below replacement costs, and we are very below replacement cost. So we'll be in a price per pound that should be very competitive, if not extremely competitive versus new product when that comes to the market. Rich Anderson : Okay. And no chance that it -- I mean could it exist as just this asset? Or it absolutely would need to be redevelopment, I don't know the building, so? Peter Moglia : It would absolutely -- it's expired. I think it would be a missed opportunity if we just decided to take some lease and keep it running the way it is now. But yes, I think, we're going to add a lot of value. Rich Anderson : Okay, sounds good. Thanks. Peter Moglia : Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Michael Carroll of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Michael Carroll : Yeah, thanks. A little bit off of Rich's question, you guys go out there and acquire some of these acquisitions, I guess, particularly the land sites, and I'm looking at 701 Dexter, specifically. How long do you kind of underwrite before you'll start breaking ground on those projects? And do you think you will start breaking ground on Dexter sometime soon? Peter Moglia : Well, it's Peter Moglia. That submarket is very hot right now. And as Steve laid out in his comments and I in mine, the momentum of the life science market there is gaining steam. There is no doubt that the tech market there has been on fire for quite a bit. So there is still a great need for product there. We're going to focus ours towards the life science side, but we're pretty confident given what we're doing at 1818 East like right now that we're going to be able to follow up with other projects soon after that. So we bought that with the intent of designing and entitling it fairly quickly. Michael Carroll : Okay, great. And then how long does that entitlement process take? Is it something like 2019 start? Peter Moglia : We're constrained by the city's Master Use Permit process. I think in the quickest month we ever got was about 9 months. So we probably wouldn't be in a position to even pull a permit for another call it 12. So yes, so that would be sometime in the end of '19 would be at the earliest we could even address that. Okay, great. And then Steve, can you give us a quick update on the San Francisco market? And what's your expectations of receiving any (inaudible) allocation with the Times Square side? Stephen Richardson : The market as we've talked about is extremely healthy. There is no availability of life science space in Mission Bay. You have a very small vacancy rate, 2%, 3%, 4% in kind of Mission Bay and SoMa on the tech side. The city is moving forward. They've passed one stage of the political process. Therefore, the central SoMa adoption, they do have a recess in August. They've received a number of comments. They do have a few filings against the plan. Our understanding is that those are being actively worked on and resolved. And when they come back in September, they are going to move expeditiously. And I think as we maintain now for several quarters the thought is that each of the projects will be receiving an allocation so that they can move forward on a phase basis thereby providing the city with all of the community benefits front-loaded. So we expect that, that will be the outcome by the end of the year. Peter Moglia : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Joel Marcus for his closing remarks. Joel Marcus : Thank you, everybody, for listening. We look forward to talking to you on the third quarter call. Thank you everybody. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Paula Schwartz with Investor Relations. Ms. Schwartz, please go ahead. Paula Schwartz : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The Company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the Company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel. Joel Marcus : Thank you, Paula, and welcome everybody to the third quarter call for Alexandria. And with me today are Steve Richardson, Peter Moglia, Dean Shigenaga, Dan Ryan. The third quarter was an outstanding quarter by almost every financial and operating metric and particularly core operating metrics that were really stellar and Dean will talk more about that. My congratulations to our entire Alexandria family and for each person\u2019s day-to-day, day in and day out operational excellence, which is what really makes it all happen. And also congratulations to the world-class accounting and finance team on their many years of hard work, resulting in our recent credit upgrade from Moody's, something very important. And Moody\u2019s does focus on tenant quality and at Alexandria, it's one of our strongest characteristics of the Company. As you know from the earnings release, 52% of our annual rental revenue is from investment grade or large cap public companies. We are very proud that 79%, almost 80% of that revenue is from Class A assets in AAA locations, and about 60% of that is focused in Cambridge in San Francisco. Average lease term is about 8.6 years and 12.3 for top 20 tenants. So really a very strong and stellar core to the tenant base. I want to just make a couple of comments on the industry for the quarter. Venture funding in life science continued at very strong pace over $7 billion in the third quarter, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of over $5 billion invested. And this is really a record breaking trend driven by increase in deal size and well established venture firms raising larger funds and deploying capital at a faster pace. Something else that I think we are very fortunate, we had our 47th new drug approved on October 24, this year and the FDA has surpassed last year's 46th drug approval count and could be on pace to beat the all time record of 53 set in 1996. Strong bipartisan support resulted in legislation enacted to increase the National Institutes of Health. Overall funding, $2 billion to approximately $39.1 billion and we are very fortunate about that. I think that is one of the critical competitive advantages of the United States in the world of biomedical research. We did have very strong legislation, bipartisan legislation passed to address the opioid crisis signed in a law by the President, in the recent past. And certainly the opioid crisis has been a scourge resulting in the death of over 64,000 people last year greater than those died in the entire Vietnam War, which is actually hard to fathom. And so all of us in the industry and particularly ourselves are focused on specific things we can do to advance that project forward and we'll give you more details on that in coming quarters. Biotech IPO activity has been the strongest since 2014, approaching 50 certainly over the next couple of weeks and raising almost $5 billion during the first nine months. The NASDAQ biotech index has been down a bit recently due to the volatility this month with the markets as all of you know and we've seen certainly a flight of value and big cap safety. And I think with that, I'm going to turn it over to Steve to comment on a number of operational aspects, then Peter and then back. Stephen Richardson : Great. Thank you, Joel. Steve Richardson here. This afternoon I'll highlight the continued strong demand for Alexandria\u2019s highly differentiated Class A science and technology campuses and the country's leading innovation clusters. Building on what Joel had mentioned about the life science capital markets, we did have 17 IPOs this quarter and this is just part of an overall strong demand context, really driving stellar leasing and financial results with increases this quarter of 16.9% in cash and 35.4% in GAAP, the highest in 10 years. Drilling down to Alexandria\u2019s cluster markets, it's important to know that Alexandria has been a first mover in each of these markets, and as such as a dominant position with the highest quality campuses immediately proximate to the country's leading life science research institutions. The Cambridge market remains extremely strong with 0.9% vacancy rate and demand spiking up from 2.2 million square feet last quarter to 2.8 million square feet this quarter with fiber requirements in excess of 200,000 square feet. The San Francisco region has a vacancy rate overall of just 3.0% and no availability in Mission Bay. Demand remain strong in the region at 2.5 million square feet and as the trend has been for a number of years, life science companies are competing with tech companies for space and increasingly for talent as there were 17 tech requirements in excess of 100,000 square feet in the City of San Francisco alone and a total direct tech demand of 7.2 million square feet from San Francisco down to Palo Alto. San Diego's core, UTC and Torrey Pines submarkets are also very healthy with a direct vacancy of just 5.3% in steady demand of nearly 900,000 square feet. Moving North, Seattle\u2019s life science cluster in the South Lake Union market remains very tight with just 1.6% vacancy and lab demand at 400,000 square feet. Research Triangle Park has also been a bright spot with a mix of AgTech and life science demand totaling 275,000 square feet. And finally, Maryland's come back, continues with an excess of 500,000 square feet of demand and 4.6 vacancy rate. Looking at the continued constrained supply and healthy demand here, market rents continue to remain strong. We continue to have pricing pressure in the market. Cambridge is now at $80, plus triple net. New York City is in the mid-80s triple net. San Francisco, the mid to high-60s triple net, San Diego in excess of $50 triple net, Seattle similarly mid to high-50s triple net and Maryland in RTP north of $30 triple net. Finally, as a key market takeaway, would really like to highlight that 68% of the renewals and releasing year-to-date or from early renewals. There was a sense of urgency in the market and that's enabling Alexandria and our teams to work collaboratively with its industry leading tenant roster and continue to drive meaningful rental rate growth. With that, I'll hand it off to Peter. Peter Moglia : Thank you, Steve. I'll spend the next few minutes updating you on our near-term pipeline touch on cap rates and address construction costs as they remain a major topic of interest. 2018 deliveries have 217,000 square feet in service and another 489,000 square feet with a cost to complete of $76 million will be delivered by the end of the year. The 706,000 square feet total is close to stabilization with 96% of the space leased or under negotiation and is expected to stabilize at a 7% cash yield. Great leasing progress was made this quarter at our five laboratory drive project in RTP, which is now 51% leased and has another 47% of the space under negotiation. This is remarkable success considering the projects started only 15 months ago and was not expected to stabilize until 2019. 399 Binney in Cambridge were delivered by year-end and has all the space other than the retail under negotiation with a number of high quality venture capital backed companies, who will likely anchor a number of Alexandria projects in the years to come. This 174,000 square foot development in the heart of Kendall Square is projected to stabilize at 6.7% cash yield. 9625 Towne Centre Drive in the University Town Center submarket of San Diego remains on target to be delivered to investment-grade tenant Takeda in the fourth quarter at a 7% stabilized cash yield. The 1.1 million square feet to be delivered in 2019 with the cost to complete of $319 million is already 85% leased with another 6% under negotiation. Major leasing progress was made at 1818 Fairview, renamed 188 East Blaine Street as of this quarter, which went from 24% leased are under negotiation in the second quarter to 62% buoyed by leases from high quality life science companies and institutions seeking a presence in Alexandria\u2019s Eastlake neighborhood headquartered at Lake Union. The initial stabilized cash yield is projected to be 6.7% in a market where institutional assets have been trading in the low- to mid-4s. Seattle's life science ecosystem is rich with high quality institutions, such as the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the Infectious Disease Research Institute, and the University of Washington. The area is preeminent in the fields of cancer, infectious disease and immunotherapy, but the pace of commercialization from the areas institutions has historically been slow. However, our deep relationships in ecosystem building are beginning to show results, as illustrated by the aforementioned success at 188 East Blaine and at 400 Dexter delivered last year. We are confident that we will continue to capitalize on our long-term investment in the market, which dates back to 1996, which is why we recently added 701 Dexter to our asset base. It will allow us to develop up to 217,000 square feet of life science or tech space in South Lake Union in close proximity to the University of Washington Medical School and the Gates Foundation. Now I will touch on cap rates. As at anytime during the cycle where we've seen the 10-year treasury rise, people's minds start to wander towards cap rates. We saw the 10-year break 3% barrier for the first time in almost 4.5 years in May, and although it's toggled above and below that market is averaged around 3% since then. As of today, we have not seen any contraction in cap rates for lab product that has traded during this time. In fact, it's been quite contrary. Alexandria sold our interest in Longwood Center in Boston for a 4.7% cap rate to our partner [Clarion] at the end of the quarter. So a solid lab market given the presence of multiple Harvard-affiliated research hospitals, the Longwood medical area is inferior to Cambridge, so a mid-4 cap rate really illustrates the appeal of life science assets institutional buyers. In addition to that trade, the sale of the LINX project, 490 Arsenal in Watertown is also an indicator of status quo, if not cap rate contraction as initial pricing guidance for this inner suburbs location was for a mid-6 cap rate and after multiple rounds with multiple bidders, it traded at a 5.4% cap rate in September. I'll conclude my comments with an update on construction costs. In the first quarter, we noted that our 2018 and 2019 deliveries were insulated from the effects of tariffs because we have GMP contracts in place. Only a change in scope involving steel or aluminum could expose us and although we don't anticipate any scope changes, we have adequate contingency to cover any impacts of the tariffs we incur in. In the first quarter, we reported that if we had re-priced those projects, including the impacts of the tariffs, we would have had an increase in total project costs of approximately 1%. We have updated that estimate and have moved it from 1% to 1.3% of total project costs and are including this impact in all of our escalation assumptions for new projects. Likely a bigger threat to our development cost structure is labor shortages, caused by the last recession that removed a number of skilled workers from the market. Workers are coming back, but the shortages can impact our costs and schedule if we don't proactively manage them. We've been doing just that by leveraging our deep relationships in all of our markets to ensure we always have the contractors A team and employ a number of processes such as bringing contractors into the planning process early, ensuring we have the labor lined up and all costs included in our underwriting. With that, I'll pass it to Dean. Dean Shigenaga : Thanks Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll briefly cover six topics. Our solid third quarter results, continued strong internal growth, our balance sheet and improving credit metrics, non-real estate investments, sustainability and our updated guidance for 2018. Kicking off with the results. As we enter the fourth quarter of 2018, it's useful to look back over the past year and reflect on the strength and consistency of our execution by our entire team really quarter-to-quarter. The third quarter of 2018 also reflects continued strong execution. Total revenues for the nine months of 2018 annualized were $1.3 billion, up 19% over the nine months of 2017 annualized. Cash NOI for the third quarter annualized was $867 million, up $162 million or 23% over cash NOI for the third quarter of 2017 annualized. We reported FFO per share diluted as adjusted at $1.66, up 9.9% over the third quarter of 2017. We also reported continued and strong internal growth that reflects the strength of our real estate and life science industry fundamentals and our unique and differentiated business strategy. Occupancy remains very strong, up 20 basis points to 97.3% as of 3Q and up 50 basis points since the end of 2017. San Diego occupancy of 94.2% reflects the anticipated lease expiration of 44,000 rentable square feet related to 4110 Campus Point Court that was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2017 with an in-place lease. We are currently reviewing various renovation options for this space. In New York City, our occupancy was 97.2% and reflects the temporary vacancy as we transitioned 29,000 square feet to multiple tenants with 77% of this leased are under negotiation today. Our rental rate growth continues to remain very strong. Over the past four years, our rental rate growth on annual leasing activity has ranged from 20% to 28% on a GAAP basis and 10% to 15% on a cash basis. Rental rate growth for the third quarter was 35.4%, as Steve had mentioned and represented the highest rental rate growth in the past decade and it was 16.9% on a cash basis, and overall reflective of the unique and strong real estate and life science industry fundamentals in our submarkets today. Early lease renewals represented almost 70% of lease renewals and releasing a space for the first three months of 2018 and continue to drive growth in rental rates and cash flows. We are in excellent shape with 2019 contractual lease expirations, representing only 5.4% of annual rental revenue, 25% of which is already leased. Our same-property NOI growth for the third quarter was very strong, up 3.4% and 8.9% on a cash basis and overall in line with our guidance for the full-year of 2018. Our team has successfully completed several strategic goals this quarter and continue to strengthen our balance sheet and our credit profile. Due to the ongoing strength of the private real estate market, we remain focused on strategic and disciplined execution of important real estate dispositions, including as Peter had mentioned, the sale of Longwood generating about $70 million of proceeds, net of debt repayment, and about a 4.7 cap rate. We also are advancing a partial sale of the JV interest in a high value core property located in Cambridge. Importantly, we are expecting a lower cap rate than our prior sale in Cambridge, which was done at a 4.5 cap rate. We are still working through this transaction and we will provide our usual details once we complete the partial sale. Keep in mind that over the past four years, including the partial interest sale, it's in process. We anticipate completing $1.5 billion in dispositions, averaging a highly attractive cost to capital in the 4% cap rate range. We also raised about $196 million under our ATM program during the quarter at a sale price of $127.66 per share. As Joel had mentioned, we are very proud that we received our upgrade in our corporate credit rating from Moody's to Baa1/Stable, which really highlighted our diversified portfolio of properties with consistently high occupancy and high quality tenants, many of which are less sensitive to economic cyclicality. Also, it's important to note that S&P has a positive outlook on our BBB flat rating moving us along to our goal of continued improvement in our credit profile. We also extended a key source of liquidity for our balance sheet with important relationship lenders through the extension of the maturity date under our line of credit to 2024, increased available commitments by $550 million to $2.2 billion and improved pricing by 17.5 basis points to LIBOR plus 82.5% basis points.  We also extended the maturity date under our $350 million unsecured term loan to 2024 and reduced pricing by 20 basis points to LIBOR plus 90. We repaid two LIBOR-based loans, aggregating $350 million, reducing unhedged variable-grade debt to 6% of total assets. We remain committed to continued improvement in our credit metrics each year, including our fourth quarter annualized net debt to adjusted EBITDA as our goal for 2019 and 2020 is to move closer to five times. As Warren Buffett recently stated in his most recent annual shareholder letter, new accounting rules required us to recognize significant unrealized gains resulting in unusually high net income in the third quarter, which by the way, we exclude from FFO per share diluted as adjusted. It's important to recognize that our cost basis in these investments were approximately 4.4% of total assets as of 9/30. It's also key to recognize that realized gains of about $25.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, really have been driven primarily by liquidity or M&A related events versus management deciding to sell securities. We are on track for about $35 million in realized gains based upon the run rate for the first nine months, and this is higher than prior years, but really reflective of the quality of innovation in the life science industry today. We'd like to thank Ari Frankel, our AVP of Sustainability & High Performance Buildings and our entire team for our GRESB Green Star designation and the number one ranking in GRESB\u2019s health and wellbeing module. We also want to thank our team for hosting GRESB\u2019s North America real estate results of that that the Alexandria Center for Life Science in New York City. We continue to execute on our goals making a positive and meaningful impact on the health, safety and wellbeing of our tenants, stockholders, employees, and communities in which we live and work. Our team also remains focused on our environmental impact reduction goals for 2025, as recently highlighted in our inaugural corporate responsibility report. We updated our 2018 guidance for net income attributable to common stockholders on a diluted basis to a range from $4.34 to $4.36 primarily reflecting unrealized gains on non-real estate investments of $117.2 million and a realized gain on the sale of Longwood of about $35.7 million. We also reaffirmed the midpoint of our range for 2018 guidance for FFO per share, diluted as adjusted of 60 at the midpoint and narrow the range from $0.06 to $0.02. The midpoint of $6.60 puts us on track for another strong year of execution by our best-in-class team with 9.6% growth over 2017. As a reminder, we will hold our Annual Investor Day event on Wednesday, November 28 at the Alexandria Center for Life Science in New York City, where among other key items we will provide an overview of our detailed guidance and assumptions for 2019. We appreciate your continued interest in Alexandria and thank you in advance for waiting until Investor Day regarding detailed guidance assumptions for 2019. Let me turn it back to Joel. Joel Marcus : So if we could go to Q&A operator. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Manny Korchman with Citi. Please go ahead. Emmanuel Korchman : Hey, everyone. Just I don't remember that Dean or Joel mentioned this, but the JV in Cambridge, can you give us some details as to at all \u2013 as to what that building is or more specific geography and also just your thoughts behind the new JV at this point? Joel Marcus : Yes, I think the answer to that is, no. We'll do it when we complete the transaction. And I think Dean can talk about the capital raising. We've always tried to think about multiple sources. And so this is one key source that we're growing up on at this point. Dean Shigenaga : Yes, Manny, I would reiterate what Joel said. As I mentioned in my commentary over the last four years, about $1.5 billion in real estate dispositions, heavily weighted to high value, low cap rate assets, which when you blend in. So attractive, very attractive cost to capital and when you blend that in with the discipline issuance of common equity as well as tapping long-term debt from the bond market. I think we were actually hitting an attractive cost to fund projects that have given about 7% on a cash basis, so pretty consistent execution there. Emmanuel Korchman : And then maybe you could give us updated thoughts on the New York market specifically in Long Island City with your entrance into that market and where you see yourselves building a larger cluster there, if this was one-off opportunity. Joel Marcus : Well, I think if you look at our press release of October 18, we really tried to give a picture of our strategy in New York City, which is continuing to expand the current campus at the Alexandria Center by the North Tower, looking at upsizing that a bit. Our acquisition of one of the Pfizer buildings on East 42nd and the acquisition in Long Island City really fits well with that. There is a ferry from Long Island City right to the East Side Medical Corridor. So I would view these as almost all of the same overall East Side Medical Corridor effort. And I think as I said many quarters ago, we do view New York in a positive fashion, although it's fundamentally different than other markets. It doesn't have an established \u2013 there are no waiting line of tenants. It isn't an established market where large companies are likely to move. You have to recruit individual units of larger companies and it's a much earlier stage efforts. So I think our footprint and our pipeline that we've announced really recognized those underlying factors. Each market is truly vastly different than the other and you can't treat them at all alike. Emmanuel Korchman : And one quick one for Dean, I appreciate that you'll be giving full 2019 guidance at the Investor Day. But just in terms of the impact from lease accounting, it'll impact your numbers. Do you have early estimates on that that you could share? Dean Shigenaga : Yes. Manny, I would say there's two things that I think probably have come up for most REITs. One is what you're referring to is the initial indirect leasing cost that under the new rules will be required to be expensed. And it looks like it's fairly insignificant to Alexandria, right about in that 1% of FFO per share. And I think the other thing to consider is that we do have certain ground leases which as you probably know under the rules would be put on balance sheet. So we have roughly a $200 million gross up on our balance sheet for that. But I would say from a P&L perspective on net income or FFO per share, there's really no impact from changes under the new lease rules for ground leases. Emmanuel Korchman : Thanks, everyone. Operator : The next question comes from Sheila McGrath with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Sheila McGrath : Yes. The gap in cash leasing spreads were significant this quarter. I was just wondering if that was across the Board or if there was one lease in a particular market that was driving that? Peter Moglia : Yes. Sheila, I\u2019d say we had good strength across our markets and it's pretty consistent with what we've observed over the year. It\u2019s a full nine months as well as prior years, as we've always had really good strength on contractual expirations, and I think the early renewals have always been a pleasant surprise to cash flow growth. Sheila McGrath : Yes. I think Peter mentioned that much of the leasing this year was early renewals. Can you give us a little bit more details there like do you expect this trend to continue? Peter Moglia : Well, fortunately real estate fundamentals and the life science industry fundamentals are strong, so we're operating in a very solid environment. Our expirations are fairly modest going out year-to-year, but I would say what is happening, which is a real positive. Tenants are very nervous about space. They continue to come forward to early renew sometimes three plus years prior to their expiration. So we are reaching far out. I think from our perspective, Sheila, we're just trying to be balanced, because there is some upside in rental rate growth, so being patient while taking some off the table is kind of the approach we've been taking. Sheila McGrath : And last question on investment gains. Unrealized investment gains for the quarter were significant and I know those don't impact FFO or anything, but I was just curious, was that driven by an IPO or just depreciation of existing holdings? Peter Moglia : That was really across a broad set of investments, Sheila. So it's a good reflection of the appreciation of the quality of that portfolio. Joel Marcus : And certainly \u2013 hey Sheila, it\u2019s Joel. There has been a strong IPO market this year, so some of that's reflected in there. And I think Dean mentioned in his prepared remarks that 2019 lease expirations of about 1.3 million square feet. Our annual rental revenue on that is about $41, and we've got, as Dean said, 25% pre-leased and another 12% in negotiation. So that gives you some idea of kind of how people are thinking about here we are in the third quarter of 2018 thinking about 2019 already. So I think that bodes well, generally well. Dean Shigenaga : Yes. Sheila to expand on the question on investments, I'd say roughly spread across private and public, so you actually had a good appreciation in the quarter across the portfolio. Sheila McGrath : Okay. Great. Thank you. Joel Marcus : Thanks Sheila. Operator : Next question comes from Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Please go ahead. Thomas Catherwood : Thank you. Good afternoon. Just want to kind of follow-up on Manny's question about New York City. There's a number of groups that are involved and trying to kind of push the New York City life science cluster, including the city and state with a variety of incentives and proposals. So I guess, Joel, how do you view Alexandria's role in shaping the ecosystem in New York? And do the incentives that are being provided play any part in your capital allocation decisions? Joel Marcus : Yes. That's a really good question. Maybe let me take them in somewhat reverse order. So there are a number of people in New York, some of whom are credible and some of whom are totally incredible, and lacking in credibility as well as being incredible. That are trying to push the life science industry as if it was Cambridge and it is not, it doesn't bear any resemblance to Cambridge. New York grew up as a strong clinical market. It\u2019s very hospital based. It's got very good basic research. But commercial activity before we started back and when we won the RFP from Mayor Bloomberg was back in 2005. There was a single incubator up at Columbia that did \u2013 bunch of companies doing research other than that, it was all office. So you're starting from ground zero, it takes 25 years to build a legitimate cluster. This cluster will be different than San Francisco, different than Cambridge. It's an early stage cluster. There will be some large companies who put units in, but it\u2019s one off, it\u2019s stepwise growth, it's not a hockey part growth, like some people are touting. How we have really worked and then I'll get to incentives. How we've worked with the city and the state and the components of the ecosystem is, there are four elements to build a cluster, you got to have a location. The Alexandria Center was chosen as really the key location. And when we complete the North Tower, we will have 1.3 million square feet. You've got to have great science. They do have excellent science. You got to have great management teams for companies. That's a challenge. You have to import a lot of management. Certainly at the management level and at the development level, there are good researchers there. But that's an area that has to work on. And then Venture Capital, it's taken eight years to date to try to build a decent Venture Capital base, which is now realizing coming to fruition. So it's a big effort and we've been clearly at the vanguard of that in always. When it comes to incentives, we have not relied on city and state incentives in the future. The city does own the land we're on. And that was their contribution to the joint venture, but we put up all the capital. And I think the city and state incentives are helpful, but really not. They're not going to make the difference of bringing and growing the industry frankly. Sorry for the long winded answer. Thomas Catherwood : No, quite \u2013 so just to move back. So LIC investments, so there was no incentives tied, you don't need any incentives to make that work? Joel Marcus : None whatsoever. Thomas Catherwood : Got it. And then kind of I guess for Steve and Peter, you mentioned some strength down in North Carolina. Obviously, some pickup and development leasing, but last quarter you also picked up roughly 100,000 square feet of development rights. This quarter you moved maybe 130,000 square feet into intermediate term developments. What are you seeing in terms of demand that's making you kind of more comfortable doing developments down there? Stephen Richardson : Yes. So let me take that for a moment. So North Carolina has seen a downturn substantially in the life science industry over the last decade with Glaxo, really kind of \u2013 I wouldn't say closing, but a substantially reducing its footprint. The market there is kind of spread out. There's a little bit in Durham, a little bit in other places, but we've chosen to focus on the research triangle region and we've also chosen to focus on what we call agricultural technology because we think that's going to be the next big wave. Human health is really two components. One is fighting disease and the other is good nutrition. So at the next call, year-end in fourth quarter call, I'll get into more detail on our strategy there, but it's been primarily the result of our AgTech strategy down in North Carolina. Thomas Catherwood : All right, thanks guys. Joel Marcus : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Richard Anderson : Thanks. Good afternoon. So when you talk about early lease renewal activity, how would you compare the rollup that you get in the current year negotiations versus what you're doing for those tenants that are approaching you early? Is it a similar kind of rollup versus where you were at or is it something less or more? Dean Shigenaga : Rich, it\u2019s Dean here. It's actually a little mix of everything as you would expect. I would say that early renewals that have a large benefit to cash flows is very specific to the lease. We have a handful of those that have been occurring every year for the last four or five years now. But we're still getting really nice mark-to-markets on average across the markets. And so there's a blend of what I call normal healthy mark-to-markets occurring today and then some half a dozen or more larger, really large steps in early results. Richard Anderson : What do you define it as \u2013 where you define as normal? Joel Marcus : By normal, I'd say call it right down the fairway of our guidance, so 10% on a cash basis. Richard Anderson : Okay, what you\u2019d say, Joel? Joel Marcus : No, go ahead. Richard Anderson : Okay. As falling onto the mark-to-market sort of question, you had a nice lift versus where your guidance was last quarter yet? No change the same-store. Is it just that the, it's just not big enough. Part of the same-store pool? Or you running at the high end of the range now or how would you describe that that issue? Joel Marcus : It's a little bit of both Rich. I just to put it into perspective, it takes quite a bit in steps to actually move or in a GAAP pickup because those are GAAP numbers or the cash numbers for that matter on the cash side and really drive same property results because 80% to 85% of our cash flows are operations actually go through the same property pool. But we are getting an overall benefit. It's just not reflected in the strong results. Richard Anderson : Okay. Joel Marcus : Yes, so Rich I was going to say, just a footnote to what Dean said. So in a place like Cambridge, again the reason there's so much demand like that and companies are not looking to go out throughout 128 or to the [birds] for much cheaper space is. The cost of rent as a percentage of their overall operation is not significant. And the need to keep these companies in the mainstream, on transit, in good recruiting locations, et cetera, really outweighs cheaper rent in a more remote location. So I think that's the other reason you're seeing this kind of confluence of early renewal activity in some of Cambridge being maybe the best example. Richard Anderson : Okay. And then when you look ahead, I know you're not going to give guidance right now and I'm not asking for that unless of course you want to acquiesce. But the mark-to-market number has been a pretty brilliant part of this story for quite a while now. As you look ahead and you see which markets are expected to show some of the disproportion amount of the exploration activity? Do you see sort of this type of growth continue perhaps not at this level, but I mean or is there some sort of shelf life to this that we should be aware of? Joel Marcus : Well, just looking, if you go to Page 24 of the sup, the 2019 lease expirations, they're really well distributed in Greater Boston, San Francisco, San Diego, Seattle, a little bit in Maryland, so there's no overly burdensome concentration in one location. Then if you look at the annual rental revenues of those leases in place, relatively speaking, they're pretty low. Richard Anderson : Yes. Okay, that's good. Thanks for pointing that out. And then lastly, just a modeling question for you, Dean. With the moving parts in the unconsolidated JV line, do you have an idea of where that should shake out on a sort of an annualized run rate basis putting aside anything that might happen in Cambridge in the near-term? Dean Shigenaga : What Richard, I don't have that in front of me right now. So why don't we think about giving the market an update at Investor Day on that. Richard Anderson : Okay. No problem. Thank you very much. Dean Shigenaga : Thanks, Rich. Operator : Next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Jamie Feldman : Great. Thank you. I know at the outset of the call you talked about a very strong VC funding market, a very strong biotech IPO market. We've seen some volatility in the capital markets recently. I mean, how do we think about your business in a market where those two factors are not quite so strong? And how do you make decisions for the future based on that? Joel Marcus : Well, I think that \u2013 if you go to my opening comment, Jamie, 52% of our annual rental revenue is investment grade or large cap public. That's actually where the money has flowed these days. So I think we feel pretty good. It would be \u2013 I think not a good thing if venture dried up and not a good thing if the IPO market shut down. But if you think about Venture Capital and you go behind the numbers, there are a handful of funds that or handful of funds that have and are raising large, large amounts of money that some have closed and some will close over the next couple of quarters that will probably restock. And this is on the life science side, not the tech side, that will probably fund those entities to the tune of north of $2 billion. So even if things became rougher in 2019, the amount of venture that will be available for investment over the coming years will be strong. And I think actually evaluations fall that'll even be better in a sense for investors in the private markets because it will be more attractive. But I don't think we're going to see any wholesale radical change over the next year or so. Dean Shigenaga : Yes. And I would add, if you think back to pre-2013, the biotech IPO window was pretty much shut for about a decade and they were doing fine with liquidity events. And then today, biopharma has got a tremendous, with 75% or something of the topline revenue actually coming from products that have been sourced outside of pharma, which means biopharma is going to feel capital into the biotech industry to continue to grow their platform. Joel Marcus : Yes, I think that's right. If valuations fall, pharma is going to get very acquisitive. Jamie Feldman : Okay. All right. That's helpful. Thank you. Joel Marcus : Thank you. End of Q& A Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks. Joel Marcus : Thank you very much everybody and we'll look forward to talking to you on the fourth quarter and year-end call. Take care. Operator : This conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Paula Schwartz : Thank you, and good afternoon. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel. Joel Marcus : Thank you, Paula, and welcome everybody to the fourth quarter and year-end 2018 conference call, and happy new year and healthy new year to everybody. With me today are Steve Richardson, Peter Moglia and Dean Shigenaga. And as I always do, I want to thank the entire Alexandria family for an operationally outstanding fourth quarter and year ended 2018. A quick look at Page 4 of our press release highlights our, I think, and depicts our amazing collective accomplishments as of year-end, including our all-time high-end revenues. Each of the speakers will get into these -- the quality of our tenants, the quality of our cash flows, our leasing stats, our margins, our credit rating, our exposure to variable rate debt and importantly, very importantly, our leverage is lowest we've ever had in the history of the company. So with that, I'd like to talk a little bit about -- since our founding, we've always been blessed to be an idea-based meritocracy culture. And as a very mission-driven company, we operate at the highest standards and levels of integrity and ethical behavior. And we have among the best disclosure and transparency hard earned over our 22 years as a public company and so recognized by NAREIT. nd when we speak about corporate social responsibility, which is a big buzzword in the industry today, we at Alexandria try to live it every day. In 2018, among many notable accomplishments, our team volunteered over 2,600 collective hours to important nonprofit causes and 49 of our team members ran the New York City Marathon and raised over almost $0.25 million for Memorial Sloan-Kettering's cancer fund research. At Investor Day on November 28, in addition to giving what we felt was very good guidance for 2019, we also gave investors and analysts our framework for our 5-year growth plan where Alexandria has the potential to double rental revenues from 2018 to 2022 on what we own on balance sheet today, assuming a positive macro and industry environment. And I think it's important to understand why we can articulate such a bold and positive framework. It really is based on 3 key strategies. Number one is our business strategy. And in the 2004, '05 and '06 time frame, we pivoted from a single-asset strategy to a core cluster campus strategy and began and initiated major campuses in Mission Bay, New York City and Cambridge and beyond, which are now bearing huge cash flow -- high-quality cash flow results. In addition to our business strategy, our financial strategy was pretty crucial coming out of the financial crisis of '08 and '09. For the years 2010 through 2013, we became critically important an investment-grade company with access to investment-grade debt, and we sold certain key land parcels including a very large site, which really was handled in an exquisite fashion by Steve Richardson, which now sits on where the Warriors Stadium is being built and where we're building two towers for Uber for part of their headquarters at Mission Bay. And that really was critical to substantially lowering our leverage, which led to our significant outperformance in the years 2014 through 2018. And then thirdly, really, you have a business strategy, you have a financial strategy and then you have a management and personnel strategy. Those are the 3 kind of anchors of any really great company strategy. And from 2008 onward, we did not layoff our construction development team during and after the market crash. Led by our very talented Vince Ciruzzi, we kept our great team and then continued to build as we came out of the crash to where it is today, where we have a super high level of operational excellence with delivery and cost management. We continue to build our core accounting and financial team with Dean's leadership and the regional operating teams headed by long-tenured level five leaders. And probably one of the most important things we did was to appoint Peter Moglia as Chief Investment Officer during the crash, which radically professionalized our entire investment philosophy and approach to operations, acquisition, redevelopment and development. And Peter also brought a highly specialized experience base and knowledge base in financing, joint ventures and sales of partial interest. If you look at Page 33 of the supplement, it really depicts the Alexandria management of our development pipeline, something that has become because of the financial strategy, the business strategy and the management strategy really enabled us to grow after and out of the crash. And you can see the stats there on Page 33, which I think are, Dean always is very proud, really I think exceptional for an economy. Let me move very quickly before I hand it over to Steve on a quick summary of the Life Science industry. Venture capital had another historic year with -- and an all-time high with Life Science being funded to the tune of over $27 billion. San Francisco Bay was #1 with 32% of that, Greater Boston 21% and San Diego 9%. The FDA and the industry had a record year with 59 novel medicines approved by the FDA, a historic number. I'm not sure if they can match that in future years, but it was truly historic. Also, 2018 was a strong year for biotech IPOs, with 56 companies going public and raising accumulative $6.7 billion. So we're very proud of both our real estate fundamentals and also the Life Science industry fundamentals. So let me turn it over to Steve to get more color on the quarter and the year. Stephen Richardson : Thank you, Joel. Alexandria as an innovator and leader in creating first-in-class life science clusters is very pleased to report healthy lab real estate fundamentals, featuring strong demand against the backdrop of constrained supply, and important to note, severely constrained supply in a few of our key submarkets that we'll detail in the following comments. Very quickly, 2018 was an absolutely excellent year. The highlights include a cash rent increase of 14.1%. Important to note that this is the highest during the past 10 years. 4.7 million square feet of leasing, the second highest during Alexandria's nearly 25-year history. And this stat, I think, is critically important that percentage of early renewals and re-leasing this past year was 71%. And what's underneath that is a clear indication of a sense of urgency in the market amongst our client tenants. The quarter highlights include rental rate increases of 11.4% cash and an increase of $41 million in rental revenue, primarily due to the delivery of 300,000 square feet leased on a long-term basis to Merck in South San Francisco and Takeda in San Diego, both high-quality, investment-grade pharmaceutical companies. Other key leases include Dendreon leasing 76,000 square feet in Seattle. That alone was a 44% GAAP increase, which is really a testament to the value and durability of Alexandria designed and operated lab improvements. Moving onto the East Coast. Gates Medical leased 52,000 square feet at [indiscernible] in Cambridge. An important GSA lab tenant leased 64,000 square feet at five Research in Maryland. Regenxbio also leased 132,000 square feet at a new project we have in Maryland. We also have an investment-grade pharmaceutical company that leased 66,000 square feet at a redevelopment project at 681 Gateway in South San Francisco. And finally, a very exciting early stage company insitro leased 35,000 square feet in South San Francisco as well. Our leadership role in the country's leading life science clusters enable us to capitalize on these very solid lab real estate fundamentals. At the outset, I referenced a severely constrained supply dynamic and the details below include the Cambridge market with just a 1.1% vacancy rate with the lab demand at 2.1 million square feet, paired with another 1.9 million square feet of technology demand. Mission Bay and San Francisco has a 0% vacancy rate and Greater Stanford down on the peninsula has a 1.6% vacancy rate. Overall, the San Francisco region's life science demand remained strong at 2.5 million square feet, while tech demand has actually increased to 7.8 million square feet in the area from San Francisco to Palo Alto. We are monitoring supply in South San Francisco with a potential for 2 new projects from new entrants in the market there. Moving north, Seattle's life science cluster in South Lake Union has become even tighter with the vacancy rate of less than 1% and lab demand increasing to 611,000 square feet. And important to note that this is against the backdrop of more than 3 million square feet of tech demand. On the southern part of the West Coast, San Diego's UTC and Torrey Pines submarkets have a direct vacancy of 6.8%. And as well, we are seeing an increase of lab demand there to 1.6 million square feet. And finally, Maryland is healthy with nearly 500,000 square feet of demand and just a 4.6% vacancy rate. I think the clear takeaway here is that the solid lab real estate fundamentals continue to be driven by the success of the life science industry, as Joel outlined. Alexandria as a trusted partner to the entire life science ecosystem is oftentimes collaborating with its clients for many months and even years on new projects. Page 33 of the supplemental details the accomplishments of our fully integrated, underwriting leasing and construction teams during the past 10 years with 4.1 million square feet 100% leased and 3 million square feet 30% -- 36% leased at the start of these Class A projects. As we consider new starts in our core markets that will continue to drive NAV, we will closely monitor these lab real estate fundamentals and continue leveraging our unique and strategic insights. Take it away, Peter. Peter Moglia : Thanks, Steve. I'm going to spend the next few minutes updating everybody on our fourth quarter deliveries, our near-term pipeline and our asset sales efforts. In the fourth quarter, we fully delivered 213 East Grand in South San Francisco to investment-grade tenant Merck. The initial stabilized cash yield is 6.5%, which is a healthy spread over what we believe would be a sub-5% cap rate if it was sold today. 9625 Towne Centre Drive in the prime University Town Center submarket of San Diego was fully delivered to investment-grade tenant Takeda. The initialized cash yield is 7.3%, which is 30 basis points greater than we initially projected and 160 points -- basis points over Green Street's cap rate for the submarket, so another great example of value creation. Two assets in Maryland : 9900 Medical Center Drive in the prime Shady Grove submarket of Rockville and 704 Quince Orchard Road in Gaithersburg partially delivered in the fourth quarter. Both assets have pro forma yields approaching or exceeding 8.5%. The Maryland market is continuing to gain momentum, and we are well positioned to capture its growth, illustrated by 2 recent announcements touched on by Steve for build-to-suit, for public gene therapy companies, Regenxbio and Autolus. Those two projects will further diversify the region's tenant base and combined for over 250,000 square feet of lease space that we'll deliver in 2020. A portion of five Laboratory Drive was delivered as well in the fourth quarter, bringing nearly 1/3 of that project into operation. Great leasing progress has continued there with 100% of the space either leased or under negotiation, prompting the need to expand this unique campus in RTP by beginning the development of the adjacent 9 Laboratory Drive property, which is also one of our 2020 deliveries. Finally, one of our partial 2018 deliveries, 399 Binney, slipped into January because of pipe work performed by the city of Cambridge that interfered with our glazing installation and delay caused by the power company who were months late in hooking up permanent power. Both of those events were out of our control. The team did an amazing job mitigating these impacts down to a 1-month delay. And due to achieving economic terms above our initial underwriting, the associated cost impacts will not cause our return to dip below our pro forma yield of 6.7%. In fact, it will likely be higher once we complete delivery of the remaining 40,000 square feet. This asset resides in the sub-4.5% cap rate Cambridge market and is yet another example of our ability to create tremendous value for our shareholders. 2019 brings more of the same. With the 2.2 million square foot pipeline, including unconsolidated joint ventures, that is already 88% leased with another 2% under negotiation. We have construction loans in place for the joint ventured assets, reducing the total equity needed to complete these projects to approximately $450 million. 188 East Blaine Street continued its steady absorption, going from 33% leased in the third quarter to 49% leased at the end of the fourth. We have remained on track to achieve an initial stabilized cash yield of 6.7% in a market where institutional assets have been trading in low to mid-4s. 275 Second Avenue in Waltham, submarket of Greater Boston, has approximately 30,000 square feet left to deliver and is now 90% leased with a proposal out for the remaining 10%. It remains on track to achieve a 7.1% initial stabilized cash yield. 279 East Grand, which is an extension of our South San Francisco campus anchored by Alphabet subsidiary Verily is approximately 67% leased to Verily and 33% leased to an exciting new company that Steve mentioned insitro, which is developing new drugs by integrating machine learning techniques with recent groundbreaking discoveries in life science. This project is a testament of the high-quality value creation development team we have in place in the Bay Area as it's expected to deliver with an initial stabilized cash yield of a whopping 8.1%, likely a 300 basis point spread over its market cap rate. The Bay Area team is also executing the redevelopment of 681 East Grand located only a few blocks from the 279 building. It is also anchored by an investment-grade tenant and is expected to stabilize the cash yield of 7.9%, also likely a 300 basis point spread above its market cap rate. In addition, they will be delivering the remaining 49,000 square feet at Alexandria Park in Palo Alto by the end of the second quarter. The space is fully leased to an investment-grade tenant and is projected to stabilize at a 6.7% yield in the low 5% cap rate submarket. Finally, we're excited to be adding the redevelopment of 140,000 square feet of the Alexandria Life Science Factory in Long Island City to our 2019 pipeline. This property will serve to accommodate the expansion of our growing base of early stage companies in New York City and is expected to be a platform, from which to cede our development of the North Tower, which is anticipated deliver in the 2021-2022 time frame. I'll just touch on asset sales. We are pleased to update you that we have signed purchase and sale joint venture and ancillary documents effectuating the partial interest sale of 60% of the 388,000 square foot 75/125 Binney project in Cambridge to a highly regarded U.S.-based institutional investor. The agreed-upon value of $1,880 per square foot represents a 4.3% cap rate on fourth quarter annualized net income and is a testament to the significant value that resides in our urban innovation campuses and our brand. In addition, we have identified a number of assets that can be recycled into higher returns or joint ventured to provide an advantageous cost of capital relative to common equity. We are currently working with consultants to confirm our valuations and we will be iterating our disposition strategy based on these efforts and market conditions throughout the year. To sum it up, our value creation machine continues to run. And when we need to monetize it, we've been able to execute that flawlessly. So I'll go ahead and pass it over to Dean. Dean Shigenaga : Thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. Let me just touch on an important topic before I jump into key highlights for the quarter and the full year. As Peter highlighted, we announced the execution of this P&S for the sale of the 60% interest core Class A property that was developed at 75/125 Binney Street in Cambridge. The sale price is $1,880 per rentable square foot that represents a 4.3% cap rate on fourth quarter cash NOI annualized. If you look back over the last 5 years, including this transaction, our dispositions aggregate $1.5 billion at an average cap rate in the mid-4% range. The key takeaways that our team has built a very high-quality asset base of Class A properties in some of the best real estate submarkets in the country, and we have built an industry-leading high-quality tenant roster. And both of these translate into one of the best portfolios of high-quality cash flows in the REIT industry today. We clearly have a very attractive high-value asset base and this P&S announcement today further supports this. Our office lab properties should be valued at a premium to Class A office due to the quality of the real estate, high-quality tenant roster, lower long-term CapEx requirement, and importantly, our unique and differentiated business strategy, our platform, brand and highly experienced team. So let me get back to our comments on operating and financial results. I briefly want to cover our fourth quarter and 2018 results, balance sheet and improving credit metrics, growth and cash flows from operating activities and dividends, brief comment on sustainability and philanthropy efforts and our updated guidance for 2019. From a real estate perspective, 2018 was truly an outstanding year with our entire team executing on our strategic goals. Real estate and life science industry fundamentals were strong in 2018, and 2019 will benefit from continued strength of fundamentals. 2018 was a year of record leasing, as you heard from Steve. $4.7 million rentable square feet executed with the highest cash rental rate growth in the past 10 years at 14.1%. Our outlook for 2019 leasing is strong as well. Contractual expirations are very manageable at only 5.2% of total annual rental revenue, and we're projecting 2019 cash rental rate increases in a range from 11% to 14%. Strong occupancy was supported by our high-quality tenant roster and was up 50 basis points since January 1 to 97.3% at year-end. In 2019, we expect continued growth in occupancy to 98% at the midpoint of the range of our guidance, reflecting continued strong demand from some of the most innovative entities in the world. Our unique and differentiated business strategy focuses on high-quality cash flows from our collaborative life science and technology campuses in key urban innovation clusters. Class A properties in AAA locations generate 77% of our annual rental revenue today. Additionally, we have an industry-leading, high-quality tenant roster with 52% of our annual rental revenue from investment-grade rated or publicly traded large cap companies. Fundamentals, record leasing, strong occupancy, collaborative campuses and Class A properties, our favorable lease structure with, one, annual rent escalations and, two, operating expense and CapEx recoveries and our high-quality tenant roster collectively contribute to our consistently strong same property performance. We've reported strong same property growth and NOI at 3.7% and 9.2% on a cash basis for 2018 and both exceeded our strong 10-year average performance. Our outlook for 2019 reflects continued strength with cash same-property NOI growth in the range of 6% to 8%. Adjusted EBITDA margins were strong at 69% and represents another top statistic in the REIT industry. Operating expenses were up 17% during 2018 and includes the increase of 7.5% within the same property portfolio. This increase in same-property operating expenses was really higher in 2018 than a typical annual increase in OpEx in any given year was really driven to increases in property taxes related to recently completed construction and annual reassessments in certain markets. Keep in mind that our favorable lease structure includes the triple net provision in 97% of our leases and result in a recovery of operating expenses from our tenants. Our team's strong leasing philosophy in 2018 also included outstanding execution of lease-up of value creation projects. We executed 1.7 million rentable square feet of leases related to development and redevelopment of Class A properties, 90% of which related to 2019 deliveries. These leases provide significant initial contractual annual rents, aggregating $96 million and contain annual escalations to drive continued growth and cash rents. Our venture investment and support company is focused on transforming the lives of people throughout the world. Since the beginning of 2018, new GAAP rules require that we recognize changes in the fair value of certain investments in earnings. As of December 31, our cost basis was $652 million or 4.5% of total assets, and we had unrealized gains of $240 million. Our net loss for the fourth quarter of $0.30 per share and earnings per share of $3.52 for the full year of '18 included unrealized losses of $83.5 million and unrealized gains of $136.8 million, respectively, due to changes in the fair value of certain nonreal estate investments. Now turning to balance sheet and our improving credit metrics. We closed out 2018 with the strongest balance sheet in the history of the company in both -- in 2018 both Moody's and S&P highlighted improvement in our credit profile with Moody's increasing their rating to Baa1 stable and S&P increasing their outlook to BBB positive, really ranking ARE's ratings near the top of the office sector today. Our balance sheet leverage was solid at 5.4x based upon net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, and we remain very committed to strong and improving credit metrics. Briefly on cash flows and common stock dividend. We have a very high-quality growth in cash flows from operating activities after dividends and also hit an all-time high in 2018 at over $150 million, really due to strong execution of internal and external growth initiatives. During the year, our Board of Directors approved two increases in our quarterly common stock dividends, resulting in an 8.1% growth in full year 2018 dividends over 2017. Our Board's policy continues to reflect our strategy of sharing growth in cash flows with our common stockholders, while retaining significant capital for reinvestment into new Class A properties. Briefly on sustainability and philanthropy efforts. We're clearly focused on creating sustainable and vibrant environments to support the development of breakthrough therapies and technologies to help cure disease, enhance nutrition and improve the way we live and work. We also focus on having a very positive and meaningful impact on the health, safety and well-being of our tenants, employees and communities in which we work and live. We're very proud of our Green Star designation from GRESB and our team's pursuit of important 2025 goals to reduce the impact we have on the environment. 2018 was also a great year for our team's philanthropy and volunteerism efforts. Our team volunteered over 2,600 hours at more than 250 nonprofit organizations and provided mission-critical support to organizations, doing impactful work in the areas of medical research, STEM education, military support services and local communities. Closing here on guidance. We updated our guidance for 2019 that was initially provided on November 28 at our annual Investor Day event. Our team's usual review of construction projects over the last 60 days identified opportunities to reduce projected construction in 2019 without -- or with no changes to projected delivery dates in 2019. Our updated guidance for 2019 assumes $100 million less in construction, representing a 7% reduction in overall spend. About half of this or 3.5% of our overall budget was reduced as a result of identifying usual conservative assumptions in our annual estimates. The other half of the reduction or another 3.5% of our budget was due to certain aspects of a particular construction project that were no longer a component of the final project. The key point here is that cost reductions did not impact the timing of project deliveries for 2019. The reduction in spend also resulted in reduction in our forecasted common equity needs by $100 million and a reduction of capitalization of interest, which is really a reduction of construction spend for the year. I should also point out that capitalization of interest in the fourth quarter of '18 peaked at $19.9 million, up $2.5 million over the third quarter due to the buildup of CIP for the significant delivery of almost 650,000 rentable square feet of new Class A properties from our development and redevelopment activities really in the fourth quarter and into January of 2019. These deliveries will result in a reduction of capitalization of interest as we look into the first quarter of '19 in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2018. Our 2019 guidance for EPS was updated to a range from $1.95 to $2.15, and there was no change in the strong outlook of our 2019 FFO per share as adjusted at the midpoint of $6.95. In closing, we truly had an outstanding year in 2018, and our team is off to a great start into 2019. Let me turn it back over to Joel. Joel Marcus : So operator, if we could go to Q&A, kindly? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Jamie Feldman of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. James Feldman : I was hoping you could talk more about the pre-lease percentage of the 2020 development delivery pipeline? Can you provide more color on that? Stephen Richardson : Jamie, it's Steve here. Yes, sure. As we look at the 2020 deliveries, we've got 5 different buildings that total about 560,000 square feet. In those projects right now, we're 81% leased, another 2% negotiating, so very substantially resolved in the 83% range there. We do have a number of other projects totaling about 1.3 million square feet slated for deliveries later in 2020. We're in active discussions with groups at a number of those projects, and we look forward to updating everybody as the year progresses. Dean Shigenaga : And Jamie, if I could add, I would just remind you in my prepared comments that during the year of 2018, we executed 1.7 million rentable square feet related to the value creation pipeline. 90% of that related to deliveries that are occurring in 2019. So our team is hitting on all cylinders on lease-up of the value creation pipeline, and we're working hard to really get the remainder of the pipeline addressed, but we're excited about what we have already resolved. James Feldman : Okay. Did I miss it somewhere that you actually say, which five are the leased? Stephen Richardson : We haven't broken those out yet, Jamie. We'll be doing that in the future. James Feldman : Can you say, which ones are leased? Stephen Richardson : Yes. We've got couple down in San Diego and then the two projects at Medical Center Drive in Maryland. James Feldman : Those are leased? Stephen Richardson : Yes. James Feldman : Okay. All right. And then, Dean, so your comment on the $100 million of less spend, does that -- is that getting pushed out into '20 or how do we think about it? Or is it just shrinking the total pipeline? Dean Shigenaga : It is not pushing out much of the spend into '20. Most of it related to conservative two buckets, Jamie. One bucket was conservative assumptions that we were able to address over the last 2 months, which is pretty typical in a given year to be able to knock out 3%, 4%, 5% of the budget just by carefully challenging the forecasting. And then, we had 1 unique project that had a little bit of an element in it that as we looked harder at it, it wasn't something that we could accomplish in the final design and -- or ended up being a reduction to the overall cost of that project. So neither of them, Jamie, had anything to do with pushing the cost out to '20 or any delays on any of the projects. James Feldman : Okay. And then, finally, I mean, as you think about the potential of doing more JV sales based on the great pricing in Cambridge, I mean, is there a scenario where you actually don't need any more common equity this year? Dean Shigenaga : We have a modest number that remains, Jamie. I would say that dispositions are always a key component of our capital plan. We also have pretty unique opportunities to invest capital at great returns. So I don't know that it will fully eliminate it, but it's an important component. Operator : The next question comes from Manny Korchman of Citi. Emmanuel Korchman : Your markets have certainly had some massive rent growth, which is from -- given sort of those very low vacancy rates you discussed. Is there an elasticity curve to rent? Or could you push rent harder? And if so, why aren't we seeing even bigger mark-to-market or rent markups on rollovers? Stephen Richardson : Manny, it's Steve here. Look, there's always a balance and I think we've been pretty consistent with that. These are repeat clients, multi-market clients. I think you've seen very significant statistics. With the outset, we referenced the highest cash increase this past year. So I don't think we've been shy at all about pushing rents. So we continue to engage on a long-term basis with these tenants, and I think we are hitting the mark and capturing the full value there. So stay tuned as the development pipeline continues to get leased up. Peter Moglia : Manny, it's Peter Moglia. I also would like to remind everybody that one of the things that we really do well is incorporate annual increases into our leases and add a 3% per year clip by the time those leases roll, and we're still making some pretty great cash and GAAP increases over and above what happened during the lease, certainly, I think, speaks to our great execution on the leasing side. Emmanuel Korchman : And maybe on a similar topic. Again, given those low vacancy rates, what's the re-lease-up for those multiples of demand that want to be in this market and just can't find the space? Peter Moglia : Our 2019 and 2020 deliveries, to start. Stephen Richardson : Yes. And to add to that, Manny, I think you see the early renewals and that one of the all-time highs at 71%. Clearly, the sense of urgency there, locking down space, figuring out how to expand when it's a high-class problem, but that is a challenge we have in a number of our markets. Emmanuel Korchman : And one final one for Peter, if I could. Just what are your criteria when thinking about these JVs? So maybe more specifically, why was it 75/125 that got JV-ed rather than one of your other Cambridge properties? And then as you look at expanding either the JV or the sales program, how do you think about what you're JV-ing? Peter Moglia : I'm sorry. What's the last part of that? How do I think about what? Emmanuel Korchman : Peter, just how do you think about what goes into a JV versus something you want to own -- wholly own going forward? Peter Moglia : Yes, I think one of the key elements is, have we provided as much value as we possibly can up to this time? And is the ability to create more value later on? In the case of 75/125 Binney, it's fully leased to great tenancy, but it goes for another, I believe, 12 years before you can actually get to the mark-to-market. So our partner is patient capital, and it will do well in 12 years when that lease rolls, but it's a great opportunity for us to monetize that and then put that money to work into our highly leased -- highly returned pipeline. So that is one of the things we certainly look at. And then as far as JV partners go, we've definitely looked for those that are -- understand our business and are easy to work with and trust in our judgment and our brand to deliver great results. And this particular partner recognize that, and I wouldn't be surprised if we do more business with them down the road. Operator : The next question comes from Sheila McGrath of Evercore. Sheila McGrath : Yes. I wanted to ask Peter a few more questions on the JV. Did you speak to one partner exclusively? Or were there many potential partners discussed? And what was the level of interest? And if you could just give us a little insight on where the rents in that asset mark versus current market rent? Peter Moglia : Okay, the first one, the current rents, I believe, are in the mid-70s and the market rent there is conservatively in the low to mid-80s. So that -- the answer is that piece. As far as marketing, we had a strategy to message to investors that we wanted to work with because that is a very important thing as far as who we partner with. It's not all about the cost or the purchase price. It has a lot to do with the culture of who we're dealing with because we want to make sure we're very aligned. So we had a small, targeted audience that we approached. We had a valuation in mind that was very close to what we ended up with, and our buyers stepped up early and we were able to get it done. There were a number of other people contacted before we settled on the final choice, and we did receive an enormous amount of interest given that this product was in Cambridge and that there are a number of parties out there that want to JV with Alexandria and get into this life science real estate niche. Sheila McGrath : Okay. that's helpful. Do you think that the people that you're in discussion with are starting to give the life science the lease structure and EBITDA margins more -- any consideration versus more traditional office? Peter Moglia : I think that people definitely recognize on the CapEx side that we're very efficient in our operation versus office. I think they also look at our tenant roster and understand that they're not only investing in great real estate but they're getting credit behind it relative to office. So I think that's really what's driving it. Plus the industry is one of the driving forces of the economics of the United States. It's an industry that's very difficult to take offshore due to intellectual property issues. And obviously, it's a well-paying industry and our tenant base is very -- has very large balance sheets and is constantly looking to expand its pipeline for the future, and they have been looking to us to be a provider of that space. Sheila McGrath : Okay, great, and just one more. You've allocated more capital to the Stanford kind of cluster via acquisitions. Can you just talk about that market and your vision there? Is demand kind of equally driven by tech and life science in that cluster? Stephen Richardson : Sheila, it's Steve here. Having been in that market for 35 years, it was historically very well balanced between life science and technology. I mean, you had some very strong brand names down there with -- Merck historically has been a tenant in Stanford Research Park, Syntex, Alza and others. And what we've seen over time is tech has become larger and larger with Google, in particular, Facebook, even Apple begin crowding out to life science industry there. There is still strong demand for serial entrepreneurs, the venture capital on Sand Hill Road for people to be in that Greater Stanford cluster. So as we look at this very strategically, certainly with the acquisition in the Research Park, building out as we will the first new Class A lab facilities in San Carlos in over 20, 25 years, we think this is critically important to the industry and we've heard that directly from clients that we've worked with for a long, long time. Operator : The next question comes from Tom Catherwood of BTIG. William Catherwood : So we've seen a good deal of M&A activity in the life science sector. Obviously, some impacts your tenants, Bristol-Myers and Celgene and Takeda. How do -- kind of multi-part question here, but, a, how do you evaluate your exposure to any one tenant when these large companies are merging? And then the second part of it is, when companies merge, what has -- historically, what has been the impact on the real estate needs? And has it depended if it's a large-cap pharma or small-cap biotech? What's kind of been the impact on the need? Joel Marcus : Yes. So Tom, this is Joel. So I think if you look at Page 26 of the supp, as we kind of think about -- we have really an all-star, highly diversified cast of top 20 tenants that make up more -- almost 45% of the rent. We always think about not trying to be overly concentrated. And I think if you look at the numbers, the percentage of aggregate rental revenues, we really don't have great exposure to any single company in a way that we think would be catastrophic or highly damaging to the company from Takeda at #1 at 3.6% down to FibroGen, which has a potential blockbuster product to oral erythropoietin to replace the injectable, at 1.4%. So I think we're pretty mindful of that. I think when you think about the Celgene/Bristol-Myers -- Bristol-Myers' acquisition of Celgene, so you have our #7 acquiring our #5, but I think one thing to keep in mind is Bristol is leading some facilities in Seattle that we've re-leased at the Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center. And we believe on Celgene, as we luckily don't have any of Celgene's home campus in Summit, New Jersey, which I think where most of the cost synergies will come out of, but they have two important locations -- several with us but two of the most important are Juno in Seattle and the... Stephen Richardson : Receptos. Joel Marcus : Receptos, yes, in San Diego. Both of those, we believe, have mission-critical therapies that are critical to the acquisition and the value of the acquisition. So I think we feel pretty good overall about that combination. William Catherwood : Got you. And then in general, in the past, in your experience, do kind of waves of mergers cause a large footprint reduction? Or does it totally depend on kind of the mission of the companies and what their drug pipeline looks like? Joel Marcus : Yes, I think where you have large companies merging to large companies, I think you have a lot of cost synergies that shake out and you have a lot of home campuses, many of those are owned by the pharma companies themselves where things get reduced in size. But I think where you have pharma buying biotech, it isn't always true but I think more than -- more likely than not, those acquisitions are for the pipeline and the talent that you have. There are occasions where select biotechs are bought that have a single product opportunity, and those are pretty easy to spot. So when we lease to tenants, there are no tenants in our top 20 that have -- that are single product, onetime shots on goal. So we're really careful in our underwriting about that. That would be a bad outcome. William Catherwood : Got it, got it. And then a quick question for Peter. You mentioned that the Maryland market continues to gain momentum as well as the lease-up then an RTP driving the start of the next development down there. Is this the case in those two markets where demand is relatively onetime in nature, as in the growth is related to a specific resource topic or 1 specific funding source? Or are those markets developing more sustainable ecosystems similar to your larger clusters? Joel Marcus : Yes. So maybe let me talk -- I'll ask Peter to talk about real estate, but for a second, in Maryland, I think you have a resurgence over the last couple of years of tremendous amounts of dollars that have come into the National Institutes of Health. And overall, the government funding of biomedical research in that area has been stronger. You've also seen -- as Peter and Steve said, you've got certain new gene therapy or cell therapy companies that have emerged. There's a stronger base of venture capital in the areas located there and they raised funds that are in the $2 billion to $3 billion range. So that ecosystem actually has come back from a very nascent system. It was super vibrant in the early 2000s with the genetic revolution and sequencing, but then it kind of fell into a long kind of tenure, kind of non-growth situation but it's really coming out and we expect it to be not a onetime shot. North Carolina, I think what we've done is we've tried to move to where we think -- and we'll have a lot more to talk about this on the first quarter call, where we think the intersection of human health is both in fighting disease and then enhancing nutrition. And so we've made a stake in the ground and really created the first ever in the U.S. that we know of -- that we know about multi-tenant ag tech campus, and that's the one that I think Steve referred to that we've got about 100% lease or committed. Peter, you might comment. Peter Moglia : Yes, I mean, I'll echo the comments on RTP. We certainly saw a trend few years ago of North Carolina being an optimal place for ag tech research, and we started making incremental investments over time. And as Joel said, we'll provide some more detail on that next quarter. In Maryland, I wanted to say that -- I think one of the things we're really happy about is that it used to be very dependent on government funding, and so you could basically chart the market based on the NIH budget. And of course, around 2008, 2009, we started to see that dip, and of course, the Maryland market went down. What has happened over the last few years is that we're seeing a lot of commercial companies coming into the areas because they want to be adjacent to the NIH and other institute -- government institutions because they're having the government cosponsor different programs. Kite, for example, has moved there because they're working with the NIH and the National Cancer Institute on projects, and then we saw a follow-up with Autolus, one of the tenants that is anchoring our new development at 9950 Medical Center. They're also a CAR-T company. So that diversity is going to really dissipate the reliance on government, and that was really a key for us to gain the confidence to start investing more in there. And it's paid off because demand has just really been strong, and any thing that has come available has re-leased fairly quickly. And of course, now we've announced to build to suit, which will be the first new product developed in Maryland in well over a decade. So there's been a constrained supply for good reasons because there was very little growth over the last decade but that is now turning. And because we're well positioned with landholdings and redevelopment opportunities, we're able to capitalize on it and we're hoping that there'll be more good news in the future. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Carroll of RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll : Can you provide some color on the major near-term development starts the company is pursuing today? I know the North Tower is on that list, but are there any other major projects that we should be looking out for here over the next few quarters? Stephen Richardson : Michael, it's Steve Richardson. Sure, I think as we've listed in the supplemental there, we've got a project in South San Francisco on Haskins Way. So we're beginning to do the predevelopment work and horizontal infrastructure. As I had talked about earlier down in the Greater Stanford cluster, the 825, 835 Industrial Road project as well, we're doing predevelopment work there down in San Diego at 3115 Merryfield, again, predevelopment work there; 1165 Eastlake. And these are all in markets where we don't have significant availabilities, and these are the result of ongoing conversations that we have with our client tenant base. So I just want to be clear on how these decisions are being made and how we're informing our plans to move forward, and I think 1165 Eastlake is a perfect case in point. The 1818 project has done extremely well. And then finally, down in North Carolina, as Joel and Peter were just commenting, the great success at 5 Lab Drive is leading us to start doing predevelopment work, getting 9 Lab Drive. And then 6 Davis Drive is also getting build-to-suit interest, very early discussions down there. So that kind of rounds out the 2020 deliveries, as we've been detailing them in the supplemental. Michael Carroll : So when you think about breaking ground on these projects too, do you need to have some type of pre-lease percentage to break ground? Are you just happy if there's interest and there's no availability and you think that's going to be leased up over the two years it takes to complete and stabilize? Stephen Richardson : Yes, I think what we've done historically, Michael, is we've looked at the predevelopment work and the horizontal work as necessary from a speed-to-market perspective, but then we monitor these very closely before we actually make the big capital investment and going vertically. And at that point, that's when we really look at having some type of kickoff tenant or anchor tenant in these projects. And as I detailed in my prepared remarks, 4 million square feet at the time of kickoff were fully leased at 100%, and the other 3.1 million square feet were roughly 1/3 leased, so very significant and on both accounts, whether we were multi-tenant or single tenant. Michael Carroll : Great. And then Steve, I know you mentioned in your prepared remarks the increased competition that you're seeing in South San Francisco. I mean, how do you think about that market today? And is that something that you still want to heavily invest in given the planned projects that are on top over the next few years? Stephen Richardson : Yes, maybe stepping back at the Bay Area, we just had a strategic planning meeting, and I think what was highlighted is we are very, very well balanced in kind of the 4 key clusters, the SoMa market, the Mission Bay market, South San Francisco and Greater Stanford market, so not really overweight in any one market. We've been 100% leased in the region now for a number of years. South San Francisco continues to be a critically important market to us, and we think the Haskins project will provide a great platform for a number of different types of companies. Peter had highlighted it, 681 Gateway. We fully resolved that in very short order. We just started the redevelopment activities there. We're already 100% leased. So we monitor the competition very closely. I think we're significantly differentiated on a number of fronts, and we think our tenants respond to that very favorably as well. Operator : The next question comes from Daniel Ismail of Green Street Advisors. Daniel Ismail : Maybe to follow on that question, are you noticing any other pockets of new supply in any of your markets that is a cause for concern? Stephen Richardson : Daniel, it's Steve again. No, not in particular. Again, Seattle's very tight. I would say Cambridge is severely constrained. We've talked about the Bay Area, really no significant ground-up development projects down in San Diego. So really, South San Francisco is the only sub-cluster that we're monitoring. Daniel Ismail : Okay. And maybe just a bigger picture question for Joel. So prescription drug pricing is likely to come up in tonight's State of the Union address. Are there any expectations for drug price regulation in the next 12 to 18 months? And the -- and is there any potential impact on the pricing power for your tenants? Joel Marcus : Well, I guess I'd say one thing. Could you imagine Congress agreeing on anything? But we did actually meet with Medicare recently and had some very good discussions with them. The President's desire is to try to eliminate the rebates and the middlemen fees, which make up -- so if you're an ethical drug company selling branded products, about 40% of the price of that goes off to third parties. And then in the discussion we had in Washington, it's clear that there are a lot of end user vendors, not the patient but the vendors who dispense these. So there are hospitals and other third parties that then mark the drugs up, some as much as 10x. And when it's buried, if you go in for surgery and it's $100,000 -- actually, I just had this happen personally to a family member, and they get a bill back that shows everything's paid for by insurance or reimbursed by insurance except drugs and the drug is $1,000 or $2,000. Oftentimes, that's marked up 2, 3, many times by the group that's dispensing it. So there's a real effort to go after the probably unreasonable markups and the middlemen who are taking 40% off of the list price before it ever gets to the consumer. Those are the two big areas that I think people are focused on but it's pretty clear. Remember, go back to basics. Drugs only make up about 10% to 15% of overall health care cost, and 90% of all drugs that are sold are generic. So there's a lot of fire and talk about drug prices, but it doesn't fall wholly on the manufacture standpoint. I think what you may see is Medicare forcing out that middlemen rebate pricing whether that can be extended to a private pay. Remember, in U.S. insurance or U.S. health care, about 2/3 are covered privately; about 1/3 is covered through Medicare and government plans; and then there's about 8% to 10% which still are uncovered. So if Congress is going to act, they have to act on the 2/3 and it would take both parties and I don't think that's going to happen, but it would go after the middlemen pricing and the unreasonable markups of the dispensary element of the system, if that's helpful. Daniel Ismail : No, that's helpful. Maybe just a last one for Dean. On the sources of equity in 2019, should we be expecting that to be done in the form of a forward equity raise or of ATM throughout the year? Dean Shigenaga : Manny, I think all of our -- whether it's debt or equity capital and dispositions for that matter... Joel Marcus : Daniel. Dean Shigenaga : I'm sorry, Dan, really dependent on market conditions. And when we hit that point in time or assess those, the environment, and execute, the capital needs on the equity front are fairly modest this year given the disposition program we have in place. So either option is available to us when we're ready for it. Operator : And we have a follow-up from Manny Korchman of Citi. Michael Bilerman : It's Michael Bilerman. Maybe Dean or Steve or Peter, whoever wants to take this, but just sort of following whole sort of capital discussion. And I recognize that if you're trading at a big premium to NAV, issuing equities at great use of capital, but when I think back to last 3 years, one of the things that you guys did was over-equitize a lot of your external growth via -- whether it was acquisitions or redevelopment or new development opportunities in order to delever the balance sheet, but the balance sheet now in the best position, better it ever has been, which is a great thing. But you think about the equity size of the company, and the company has gone from about 70 million shares outstanding to over -- well over 100 million shares outstanding. So the equity base has grown pretty dramatically. As you think about the capital commitments that are going to be coming down the road in 2020, 2021, 2022, just given the vast amount of opportunities that you already have within the company, do you think about more of a merchant build to take advantage of the significant value creation that you have in the development pipeline and maybe pre-selling more assets, like you just did at 75/125 Binney, to raise that capital today when the market is hot and when you've put these commitments out there where you are getting great returns on the development? Dean Shigenaga : Michael, good comments all around. You're right that we did raise more equity over the last few years to drive down improvement and leverage in our credit profile. 70 million to 100 million shares directionally sounds correct, but keep in mind we also grew bottom line FFO per share 60% if you include our growth through the end of 2019 here, so outstanding, top of the market REIT sector growth. I think the key to continuing to drive results as strong as that is to be disciplined with our value creation pipeline, both development, redevelopment and being disciplined on funding, which we will continue to do and utilize sources that makes sense. Over the years, I'd say 10-plus years, we've always thought about different alternatives, including what you just mentioned but we haven't pulled the trigger on it as far as some fund-type approach because it didn't just make sense for the business. So we do evaluate alternatives as the short answer your question, Michael, and we'll continue to be very prudent in how we execute the business. Michael Bilerman : And I don't know necessarily they have to be a merchant bill fund or have a fund, but it just sounds like there is substantial institutional interest in your asset class, as evidenced by the sales that you've done and other sales in the marketplace that try to harvest some of that value today when you know that your commitment is going out or there could be a good arbitrage knowing it would be short-term dilutive but long-term NAV-accretive in doing that. Dean Shigenaga : Yes, it's interesting as we step back over the last -- looking at this question today but we've thought differently about it, a variety of scenarios to fund the business over the last 1.5 decades, Michael, and we'll continue to brainstorm about different alternatives. But I think, again, the key here is to be focused and balanced on how we grow the business and how we fund it, and so we'll continue to brainstorm on the best solutions. And if something changes, we'll share it with the investor community as it develops. Joel Marcus : Yes, on a number of assets, I think, Michael, we clearly would not joint venture, things like our center in New York or a number of assets in Cambridge. But the 75/125, for the reasons Peter articulated, turned out to be a great opportunity both time, value and it's on the -- actually the same side of the street that 225 Binney is that we joint-ventured back a couple of years ago. So it's on the north side. It also is going through an interesting transition in tenant base. And as Peter said, we had wrung all the value out of it that we could be. We remember the times when we we're dealing with ARIAD. So that building has a long history, as you know well. So we're pretty careful about what we do, but I think Peter's deep expertise in this area and, I think, world-class relationship together with Tom and those on the ground in Cambridge, I think, give us a real set of opportunities to selectively mix a variety of forms of equity for our future growth. And also, on the future growth, we don't know what's going to happen come 2021, 2020 even. So we're pretty careful about the growth in the future. Michael Bilerman : Right. Joel, have you -- I can't be the only one that's receiving emails from bio REIT [indiscernible] at yandex.com. Can you comment a little bit about what's happening with your eldest son and the lawsuits going back and forth regarding him starting a -- ran a labs thing in Europe and countersuing for the use of your logo and name and where this is headed? Joel Marcus : Yes. So I think if you go back to what I said at the beginning, think of Alexandria as a company that has been around for 25 years. I think this year is actually our 25th anniversary. We've built a very special business. We were the first ones to really identify this business and really build this business. We've developed, I think, a unique business strategy, as I said in my prepared remarks. We've developed, I think, a great financial strategy that's been reflective of the market changes over the years. And I think most importantly, we've built an employee base and a management base that I would say is really second to none, very long-tenured people in all aspects of the company. We've had Jim Collins come in and help our people, and I think it's fair to say that if you look at anyone who is trying to bring any discredit or any cloud to the company, I think you can assume that, that is a meaningless approach. And I think that I'll let Jennifer Banks, who's our General Counsel, comment on the litigation. But I think just remember, you have a highly ethical, highly motivated company here made up of long-tenured people, and I think the kinds of things that are going on are clearly illegal and they're immoral and they will be dealt with in a very severe fashion. Jennifer Banks : Michael, this is Jennifer Banks. I'm a General Counsel here and so I'll just jump in quickly. I mean, as I'm sure you can imagine, we don't comment on litigation matters. For litigation matters, like all company matters, we'll continue to always make all appropriate and required disclosures, but we don't have comment beyond that. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks. Joel Marcus : Yes. Thank you, everybody. We appreciate your taking time to listen, appreciate the Q&A, and we look forward to talking to you at the first quarter results end of April or early May, and we'll bring you more detail on the -- on some of the ag tech strategies that we have in mind and appreciate it very much. Thanks, guys. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please also note today's event is being recorded. At this time I'd like to turn the conference call over to Paula Schwartz with Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Paula Schwartz : Thank you and good afternoon everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws. The company's actual results might differentially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the SEC. And now I would like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead Joel. Joel Marcus : Thank you, Paula and welcome everybody to the first quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today are Steve Richardson, Peter Moglia, and Dean Shigenaga. First quarter of 2019 was probably as close to a picture-perfect quarter as Alexandria has had in quite a long time, although we had many great quarters. But in addition to stellar earnings results, we had stellar leasing results which will be talked about in stellar's same-store results. And I want to thank the entire team and make sure we're focused on continuing our relentless passion to further our human health mission each and every day with operational excellence in an ego-less and high-integrity environment really important. At the grand opening of one of our latest developments the home -- West Coast home of research for Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Jennifer Ferguson the mother of two children with cystic fibrosis noted about Alexandria's unique world-class design of this building and said, this building is going to be more than steel and concrete. It is a life-saving cure for my kids. It is amazing to think about what is going on or what is going happen in this building. And that's how we feel about everything that we do day to day and how we take our charge and our mission very seriously. The first quarter was also the 25th anniversary since the start of the company when we did a Series A round closing I think on January 5th, 1994 of $19 million with family and friends. We have grown methodically and steadily and try to learn every day and every week and every month and every year along the way to become an investment grade S&P 500 company with a total market cap as of the end of the first quarter approaching $22 billion. We've got one of the strongest client tenant bases in the entire REIT industry with a whopping 50% of annual rental revenue from investment grade or large cap publicly traded companies. Our weighted average remaining lease term is approximately eight and a half years. High quality tenants with long lease duration and strong annual steps is certainly good. I also want to make a couple of comments about -- and we've -- I think in the press release we've highlighted this the opioid epidemic and the issue of overdosing. The health and fitness -- this is the health and safety crisis of our lifetime. We've teamed up 50-50 with Verily, the life science subsidiary of Alphabet and I'll talk about this in a moment. But 115 deaths per day in the United States more than have died each year or more die each year than did in the entire Vietnam War. And I think it's pretty clear that we could not as a mission-driven company focus on human health stand idly by and not here critically need a call to action. With a heartfelt undertaking, we've pioneered a comprehensive care model with Verily in a safe campus environment which has rehabs, sober living, family reunification, and community transition. The goal is to help people recover from addiction and live healthier lives while revitalizing the community. We hope the scale of the components of this model will drive superior outcomes and be a model for the rest of the country. And the restoration of the health and well-being of the community is good business for sure. We chose Dayton Ohio which has the highest per capita overdose death rate of any U.S. city. Many of you may know and many of you may not know more patents per capita in the first half of the 20th century were developed in Dayton, home of the Wright Brothers among 35 leading industrial cities in America, and was the site for many new companies forming in the first half of the 20th century were developed in Dayton, home of the Wright Brothers among 35 leading industrial cities in America and was the site for many new companies forming in the first half of the 20th century. It turned out to be a very prosperous transportation hub between or among Indianapolis, Columbus and Cincinnati. From the late 50s to present, Dayton lost their manufacturing, they closed, GM closed. NCR closed, the number of Fortune 500 companies were reduced down to two and the population declined about half. So we've tried to -- our purpose is to -- there is to create a tech-enabled recovery ecosystem focused on helping people recover from the opioid addiction and live healthier lives while revitalizing the community and the team is developing a tech-enabled system of care that will offer treatment center, rehabilitation, housing, wrapped around services all in a state-of-the-art campus. I want to move on to the life science industry for a moment and talk about our five drivers of demand that we track for life science industry all continuing strongly positive. NIH funding at an all-time high. FDA regulatory continuing positive. The new interim commissioner Ned Sharpless, who comes from the National Cancer Institute and who has a strong background in cancer research should maintain the pro-innovation environment. Charitable philanthropy is continuing to reach all-time highs. Venture capital flows very strong at over -- approximately $6 billion in the first quarter and 70% of that has been to ARE clusters and biopharma R&D investment has been strong in their pipelines. I want to mention one of the topics of the day which is the Medicare for All fallacy. Interestingly enough if you look at Bernie Sanders, home state of Vermont, they actually attempted a single-payer system and failed miserably because it would have taken an additional 10% increase for all state income tax in Vermont plus an additional 12% tax on all payroll for businesses and turned out to be totally unacceptable. So today, we've got about one-third covered by Medicare, two-thirds covered by private insurance and there is about 8% to 10% uninsured group that we're struggling to figure out how to bring them into the system. And it makes no sense to throw away the baby and not the bathwater so to speak. So we can't have a government solution that excludes all other insurances and Medicare may not even be the right agency. And in fact conversations with the people at CMS they think it's an impossible task. And the veterans administration that's another very challenging government-run health care effort. What is really needed is expanded affordability, expanded access and portability. Even today, the challenge of having portable electronic medical records is a myth. It just doesn't exist in many cases. Medical costs are actually much higher than pharmacy costs and these will be increasingly exposed. And often times pharmacy costs are embedded in hospital cost and recently there's been a whole rash of disclosures about drugs being marked up 10 times by hospitals and then embedded in overall bills to cover big losses in emergency rooms. So little bit of a view of what's going on out there. When we talk about future growth of Alexandria, it's fair to say, that Alexandria does not see the slowing of its own earnings growth. We've given a five-year framework to double the rental revenues from 2018 through 2022. And you can see from the 2019 pipeline, we have a strong highly leased very robust pipeline. In the coming months, we'll unveil details about 2020 and talk about starts and leasing velocity. And the team has included on Pages 41 and 42 some of the pipeline opportunities for 2021 -- 2021 and 2022. So with that as kind of a background and intro, let me turn it over to Steve for some details on the quarter. Stephen Richardson : Thank you, Joel. Good afternoon, everybody. I'd like to focus on Alexandria outperforming in all of its key clusters. The company is driven by its most important asset our best-in-class team used with our unique business model has and will continue to outperform in each of our key clusters. The life science industry we serve as Joel just highlighted and noted in our recently released annual report is undergoing a knowledge explosion. And Alexandria is pioneering and now dominant position creating highly desirable world-class campuses and ecosystems in urban settings adjacent to the countries most productive life science research universities and institutions is providing excellent financial results. I'll go ahead and run through the market and really highlight the outperformance with again significant contributions from each of the markets. In Cambridge, our franchise-leading campuses totaling 5 million square feet now are uniquely positioned to continue capturing growth in the immediate term. Rents have grown to the upper 80s, with one in fact eclipsing $90 triple net. And market's 0.2 vacancy rate and three-point million square feet of demand, an increase over the 2.8 million square feet of demand last quarter provides ample opportunity for Alexandria to continue its strong renewal and re-leasing rent growth over the next several quarters, without having to wait several years or more to capitalize on this strong market. The San Francisco region has an availability rate of 1.9%, down from 3% last quarter with demand up from 2.5 million square feet to 2.9 million square feet. The 480,000 square foot lease with Pinterest at 88 Bluxome highlights another superb example of the trusted partnerships we've created with our tenants, as we will embark together on the efforts to secure our Prop M allocation and create a world-class destination, a truly remarkable achievement and kudos to the entire San Francisco team. In addition, two separate renewals totaling 83,000 square feet with rental rate increases ranging from 37% to 58% paired with modest tenant improvements contributed significantly to this quarter's record cash increase. Moving down to San Diego, have a very healthy market with just 5% to 6% direct vacancy in the core UTC and Torrey Pines clusters and demand now of 1.6 million square feet has increased over the 900,000 square feet from last quarter. Another important renewal rate that was 20% higher for 54,000 square feet in this market also supported the cash increases. Seattle's vacancy rate remains very low with 2.5% and demand ticked up to 611,000 square feet versus the 400,000 square feet from last quarter. And Peter will touch on the excellent leasing activity at our waterfront facility 188 East Blaine which positions the company well for future growth in this critical cluster. And finally, Alexandria's unique product offerings are increasing in RTP as demand has grown from 277,000 square feet to 392,000 square feet. Maryland as well continues to be in a contributor with a 35,000 square foot suite released at 35% increase against the backdrop of a market vacancy of just 4.4% and demand now nearly 300,000 square feet. So, in conclusion, as we look at these markets, our strong competitive advantage derived from our broad-based value proposition to the life science industry is clear from the financial results posted in each of our markets. The future for our operating and near-term development pipeline is very robust and we are energetically reaching well into our intermediate pipeline with significant leasing activity, as evidenced by the large lease with Pinterest. On this positive note, I'll hand it off to Peter. Peter Moglia : Thank you, Steve. I'm going to spend the next few minutes updating you on our near-term pipeline, recent lab office comps and provide an update on construction costs. As we noted on page two of the supplemental, we've delivered 1 million square feet over the past two quarters, including 481,000 square feet in the first quarter. After a delay noted on our last call due to work performed by the city of Cambridge that interfered with our glazing installation and delay caused by the power company who were months late in hooking up permanent power, we delivered 123,403 square feet at the 399 Binney Street building in January, only one month over our pro forma delivery date. More good news is that we've increased our stabilized cash yield to a 7.2% yield which is a solid increase of 50 basis points over our original pro forma of 6.7%. At today's cap rates for lab office in Cambridge, we believe we've developed to a value accretion margin in the range of 60% plus when comparing our current stabilized yield with current market cap rates. Anchored by Alphabet's Life Science subsidiary Verily, we delivered 139,810 square feet or 66% of the 279 East Grand building in South San Francisco in the first quarter at a very healthy 8.1% yield. Green Street's current NAV model applies a 5.3% nominal cap rate to South San Francisco assets. So the 280 basis point spread over that benchmark makes 279 a significant new contributor to NAV. 188 East Blaine, our new flagship building on Lake Union in Seattle, delivered 90,615 square feet or 46% of the building at a 6.7% initial stabilized cash yield. Steady leasing progress continued as we move from 49% leased at the end of 2018 to 67% leased at the end of the first quarter. And the limited supply in the market has enabled us to push rents above $60 net for the first time in our history there. As of the end of the first quarter, we've delivered 56,137 square feet or approximately half of Phase 1 of Alexandria Center for AgTech, also known as 5 Laboratory Drive in RTP. This project has been very well received by the market and has reached 97% lease within 15 months of the commencement of construction. It is the latest of eight properties containing over 0.5 million square feet within our asset base that serves AgTech research and development and it will expand our leadership in the sector by providing a multi-tenant, multifunctional, amenitized research and development project that will serve as the center of gravity for the industry in RTP. We delivered 66,000 square feet of the 142,400 square foot 681 Gateway building this past quarter and remain on target to meet our outsized yield of 8.5% for this redevelopment of office space allowed at our South San Francisco Gateway campus. In Palo Alto we delivered 48,547 square feet at Alexandria Park completing the first phase of redevelopment there at a 6.2% yield, which was slightly higher than what was originally projected. Credit tenant Workday leased all of that space. Rounding out the first quarter deliveries was 10,250 square feet at our multi-tenant 80,000 square-foot building at 704 Quince Orchard in Gaithersburg, Maryland where we are successfully targeting a growing cadre of early-stage company there. As we typically do, I'll discuss a couple of lab office sales comps that occurred this quarter. Both are in Cambridge and were reported to have had significant interest from several institutional investors, which correlates well with the enthusiasm we're hearing from brokers and investors about the demand for life science and real estate investments. I'll also note a sale in Mission Bay of a pure office building that illustrates investor enthusiasm for that market. 610 Main Street North, 610 Main Street South and 710 Main Street were sold by MIT in April. The purchase price was $1.1 billion or $1,625 per square foot, representing a 4.3% cap rate for the approximately 677,000 square-foot campus, which includes a 650-car parking garage. The properties are subject to a ground lease and are anchored by Pfizer and Novartis. 1030 Massachusetts Avenue was sold by Bain Capital representing Harvard's endowment for $128 million, or $1,640 per square foot and a 4.7% reported cap rate. The 78,049 square-foot property is in mid-Cambridge between Harvard and Central Square and it's fully leased to a mix of life science tenants including Astellas and private biotech Obsidian Therapeutics. I'll wrap up this commentary with a notation that 550 Terry Francois a 289,408 square foot office building leased to the Gap in Mission Bay was sold by Hines in December for $342.5 million or $1,183 per square foot, representing a 4.1% cap rate. The property is adjacent to our 1455-1515 Third Street and 455 Mission Bay Boulevard south properties in Mission Bay. So a quick update on construction cost. They've remained stable in our markets, except for Seattle where our GCs are projecting 2019 and 2020 to escalate 0.5% higher than our previous projections and we've adjusted our pro formas accordingly. This is being driven by demand for skilled labor. For our consultant in New York City, escalations may be growing -- or may be slowing there, but we're keeping them at our current levels of 4.5% to 5% until we see further evidence in our pricing. As for the impact of tariffs, we've accounted for them in current project budgets that are under GMP and are included in our escalation assumptions for those that are not. In addition to monitoring escalations, we're also assessing and including the impacts of increased project costs due to anticipated energy efficiency and resiliency programs both our internal goal and those that will be required from various regulatory agencies. I'll go ahead now, and pass it on to Dean. Dean Shigenaga : Thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll briefly cover four key topics today, including our first quarter results and our strong start to 2019; second, lease accounting matters; third, our venture investment portfolio; and fourth, and last our updated guidance for 2019. Our financial and operating results across the board were truly outstanding for the first quarter and highlights that our team is off to a strong start for the year. The first quarter highlights included continued strong leasing velocity and rental rate growth. 680,000 rentable square feet of development and redevelopment leasing that was executed. Well, side almost 510,000 rentable square feet of lease renewals and releasing the space at significant rental rate increases of 32.9% and 24.3% on a cash basis and approximately 50% of this leasing volume related to contractual explorations beyond 2019. So rate of renewals continue to drive leasing velocity. Our unique and differentiated business strategy focuses on high-quality cash flows from our collaborative life sciences and technology campuses in key urban innovation clusters. Class A properties in AAA locations generated 77% of our annual rental revenue. Additionally we have an industry-leading high-quality tenant roster with 50% of our annual rental revenue from investment-grade rated or publicly traded large-cap entities. We reported solid growth and same property net of operating income of 2.3% and 10.2% on a cash basis for the first quarter. The strength and consistency of our same-property NOI growth was driven by among other items continued positive real estate in life science industry fundamentals, high velocity of leasing, and solid rental rate growth and our favorable lease structure. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was very strong at 70% and represented another top statistics within the REIT industry. As expected, we adopted new accounting rules for leases effective January 1 of 2019. Key points that I will highlight include; income from rentals on our consolidated income statement include both tenant recoveries together with base rent. We also separately provided disclosure of tenant recoveries in our same property results and in footnote five to our Form 10-Q that expect to file later today or tomorrow. As of March 31, 2019, our balance sheet includes $240 million of right-of-use asset and related lease liability, primarily for our ground leases, in which we are lessee. G&A expenses include approximately $1 million related to internal leasing costs that under the new accounting rules no longer qualify for capitalization. Now briefly on G&A expenses. Just want to remind everybody we have a very unique and differentiated business strategy. Importantly with a very unique and highly experienced and tenured team, it is simply inappropriate to compare a team and business to the average REIT today. Our company is well more than just a typical real estate company is. Our core vertical is real estate, but we importantly focus on three other strategic verticals including venture investments, thought leadership, and corporate responsibility and we are a leader in each of these four core verticals. These verticals align well with the strategic business imperative of our client tenants. It's also important to recognize when -- that when you review all-in G&A cost regardless of classification since it does vary from REIT-to-REIT and search for the best measure for how to how efficient a REIT is operating you'll likely end up reviewing EBITDA margins. We have an industry leading adjusted EBITDA margin as I mentioned earlier at 70% today. Turning to venture investments. What began in the early days in the company's history really has developed into a unique and important component of our real estate business. Our venture investment business verticals strategically aligned with our real estate vertical with both focused on working with some of the world's most innovative entities, developing new therapies and technologies to improve quality of life for people throughout the world. I give kudos to our science and technology team, we have one of the highest quality tenant rosters in the REIT industry and our team has proven track record for underwriting high-quality innovative tenants. When thinking about a run rate for gains, I always like to look back at what we have done. Looking back over the past three years, realized gains included in FFO as adjusted from our venture investments have been approximately $15 million, $10 million and $28 million and have averaged $8.9 million per quarter over the last three quarters. As a percentage of range, looking at net operating income, and realized venture gains in 2018 as an example, 97% was generated from our unique and differentiated real estate vertical and 3% of our overall earnings was generated from realized gains on our venture investment vertical. Moving to our balance sheet. We kicked of 2019 as you know with the strongest balance sheet in the history of the company. Our team has been busy again on liability management matters and extended our weighted average remaining term of debt to seven years. In our release yesterday, we announced the following, $850 million issuance of unsecured senior notes with a weighted average interest rate of 4.1 years, and a term of 14.6 years including the tranche consisting of 30-year notes, in support of our overall sustainability initiatives $550 million or 65% of this deal related to green bonds. We repaid two secure notes payable aggregating $300 million at a weighted average interest rate of 4.88% including one note with a rate of 7.75%. These repayments resulted in an increase in our unencumbered net operating income to 95% of total NOI. Subsequent to quarter end, we entered into an agreement to extend the maturity date from 2024 to 2025 related to our unsecured term loan that should become effective later in June of 2019. Briefly on guidance for 2019, we narrowed the range of guidance to $0.10 with EPS in the range from $2.65 to $2.75 and FFO per share as adjusted in the range from $6.90 to $7, with no change in the midpoint of our FFO per share guidance. We also increased our projected guidance for rental rate increases, up 1% and 2% on a cash basis at the midpoint of the ranges. Page 6 of our supplemental package includes our detailed guidance assumptions for 2019 for your reference. I'll pause there and turn it back to Joel to open it up. Joel Marcus : Okay. Operator, if we could go to Q&A please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Manny Korchman from Citi. Please go ahead with your question. Manny Korchman : Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Steve, the Pinterest lease that you guys signed at Bluxome what happens if you don't get the Prop M allocation or \u2013 I was making it more specific. What if you don't get that allocation this year or next year? Steve Richardson : Yeah, Manny let me walk through the process again. The Central SoMa plan was approved by the Board of Supervisors in December of 2018. As we've talked about you had four challenges were filed at that time. Those parties continue to work with the city and work through a process and at the same time very consistent with what we've said all along. There are huge community benefits of value to all stakeholders here. So the city in fact has very affirmatively and proactively continued the approval process. We view this as another step in the process. We expect as we've said for a couple of quarters now to be in front of the Planning Commission in the late summer of this year. We expect to secure our approvals and then would expect that the lawsuits will be resolved at the end of the year. So of course, there's a hypothetical out there, but it could take longer could be another quarter or two. But everything has pointed and we've seen this time and time again things do get delayed, but ultimately they would get resolved here. So Pinterest is working with us arm in arm and we expect to have a very successful outcome here. Manny Korchman : Thanks. And maybe switching close to Boston, at NECO on the Seaport it looks like you've got it under development delivery schedule as an after -2022 event. When would you start construction there? And then, does that end up being a cluster or one-off or trial? Or how do we think about your concentration in Boston Seaport? Dean Shigenaga : Yes. So I think Manny at the moment, we'd prefer not to make any comment on that. There are a lot of moving parts and I think in the future quarter or so we could give better color on kind of our view of the world. But at the moment, I think we're going to not make any comment. Manny Korchman : Okay Joel. Since I didn't get an answer on that one, can I ask another one? Joel Marcus : Sure. Manny Korchman : The tech IPO market right now is pretty hot. Any impact on your tenants or markets or marketable securities balances from new IPOs? Joel Marcus : Well, I think Pinterest, we did have an equity investment there and that will get marked up to market when we report I guess next quarter. And I guess it was this quarter, we do have a stake in Uber, so when that goes public that will get mark-to-market. And we have still Google stock, we bought in 1998. Although Google was down -- Alphabet down 8% or something today, but -- so we've done some highly selected investing in certain technology companies and I would continue to imagine that most money managers view the tech sector as one of the most positive sectors these days in the general market. So I think its best we're viewing it things are pretty solid and we stuck to really high quality either big cap public companies or selected unicorns we feel have really legitimate business models and highly disruptive impact to the economy. Manny Korchman : Thanks, Joel. Joel Marcus : Yeah, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question. Jamie Feldman : Great, thank you. Joel thanks for color on Dayton venture with Verily. Can you talk about -- I mean is this something you could see doing multiple ventures like this and expanding to more markets? Or is this more of a one-off? And then how do we think about the economics? Joel Marcus : Yeah our goal was not to get into the business of being a provider of real estate to the users here which are the dispensers of health care services. This is very unique. But what we did feel is we could make a difference and we spent a lot of time over a number of years trying to find the best place where we could make the best and biggest impact and that's Dayton for the reasons I enunciated. And we're trying to do a unique campus and a unique set of data-driven services that have never been done before from intake, literally from The Street to job placement. Not just you come in, you detox and you're out on the street in 28 days. I think the -- literally all those efforts fail wherever we've seen them. I don't think were going to be doing lots of sites or multiple sites because that's not our core business. But what we do feel is this is a model for every community in America which is hit hard and we'll make it -- we're going to make our secret sauce as available possible to the -- to other communities. Because we think this is something that private industry and the government should be partnering to really build throughout the country. So we're trying to be the tip of the spear, but not the spear. Jamie Feldman : Okay. Joel Marcus : And our -- we own the real estate 50-50 with Verily. Our payback period's about a 25-year payback period. So it's not fast. Our returns aren't as great as Peter's enunciation of our other things. But I do believe, this was a critical call to action where we have unique skills and Verily has unique skills. And I -- we could not have done it with something we really compelled to do. Jamie Feldman : Okay that's helpful and I appreciate it. As we think about shifting gears, I guess to Dean on page 6. Your capital sources plan. So it looks like you've got the $438 million of sales done. But can you talk about some of these other buckets and the timing to get them done the debt the other and the common equity? Dean Shigenaga : Sure Jamie. It's Dean here. That's basically done if you look at the bottom of the table on the right side on page 6. We did complete the issuance of our unsecured notes. In fact, upsized it opportunistically, which allowed us to retire some additional secured notes on our balance sheet. So that's been taken care of. What we are laser-focused on and that's pretty true every year. We've always had a component of dispositions going through. So on top of the 75/125 partial interest sale, we have another at the midpoint roughly $300 million of dispositions predominantly spread over two transactions that are in process, so stay tuned there. And then I assume you're also asking about common equity. We never really disclosed when that happens, but it's an open item for us to focus in on through the remainder of the year. Jamie Feldman : Okay. I mean, do you think asset sales could take the place of that or they have anything else in the pipeline? Dean Shigenaga : No, I don't -- not necessarily. It's possible that a little of it, but Jamie we already have $750 million at the midpoint of our asset disposition program for 2019. So it's a pretty healthy volume. As we make our way through the two key transactions that are in process, we can give you more color once we get through those too. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then just finally, I guess, back to Joel or anyone on the team. Appreciate your thoughts on Medicare for All, but any thoughts on just the drug pricing legislation particularly maybe the international comparison pricing? How that might impact the business and tenants, if you have any latest thoughts? Joel Marcus : Yes. So that's actually a good question. I happen to see that in your note. We actually a group of us have actually been at Center for Medicare Services not just for pharma industry, but a wider group and we have been working pretty intensively with CMS on this issue. This issue would only cover the third of people covered by Medicare. The international pricing mechanism is probably not the best, because the U.S. is supporting pricing to some extent overseas, which is kind of unfair. So not only the drug -- or the biopharma industry, but I think payers providers and a group of people all feel like there are some alternatives that are better and those are under intense discussion with CMS as we speak. Jamie Feldman : Okay. Thank you. Joel Marcus : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Sheila McGrath from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question. Sheila McGrath : Yes. On the other investment bucket, I'm just wondering if we should expect this year to be a little bit more elevated because so many of the companies that you mentioned are coming public and you would look to possibly sell just to get rid of some volatility in that line item. Joel Marcus : Yes. So I'll let Dean answer that. But I think as you probably know Sheila, on the IPO, there is a standard six months lockup for all IPOs so that despite whether we wanted to or not selling after the IPO was limited to all participants. But Dean, can give you his view on. Dean Shigenaga : Yes. Yes Sheila, so let me comment in two areas. First, as I mentioned in my prepared commentary, our run rate for last three quarters has been actually interestingly consistent averaging $8.9 million per quarter over the last three quarters. That might give you some sense of recent activity. To the extent that this type of environment with the types of investments we do hold, it's not unusual as to see something with a really great multiple come out. And to the extent there is one individual transaction like that, we'll exclude it from our run rate as we have historically. But hopefully, the commentary and you just look back over the last few quarters though as far as what they expect may be a better barometer, since we actually haven't provided specific guidance on that line item in our results for 2019. Sheila McGrath : Okay. And then on the Verily announcement in Dayton. I'm sorry, if I missed this, but how much capital do you estimate that project will require? And do you envision hiring an outside operator? And then just when you say tech enabled, just curious a little more detail what that means? Joel Marcus : Yeah. Sheila, so the total investment is $20 million, split 50-50 between Verily and Alexandria. The operator is actually a consortium. We have put together a non-profit consortium. I don't want to get to details, because there is a kind of a big grand opening in public announcement kind of mid-June where the Governor of Ohio and the Mayor of Dayton will participate with us and the Verily folks. But it is a -- when you think about tech or information driven, think about if you were able to understand the all of the data, human data from or as much as you can from everyone you intake, who has been impacted by opioid addiction or overdosing, and you build a database, the treatment mechanisms can be much more individually tailored if you have a set of data that is valuable versus just giving everybody the same detox schedule. It's like cancer. And everybody knows, everybody has a cancer patient in their family, and literally virtually there are no two cancers that are identical. It's one of the most heterogeneous sets of diseases that you can possibly imagine. And so treatment has to be really tailored for each patient, and that's what we're trying to get to. So people are treated almost like cattle. They're just brought in detoxed and thrown back on the street. That's just a recipe for disaster, and that's why we have 115 people every day dying. Sheila McGrath : Okay. And one last quick question. Just on Launch Labs, you press released activity in Cambridge, and then another AgTech kind of Launch Labs in RTP. I was just wondering if you could update us on that product for Alexandria. Joel Marcus : Yeah. We think -- I mean think about what we have said on the call, half of our revenue is generated by investment-grade tenants, and/or big cap companies. And so we also believe in the Life Science industry that you have to really be a part of the entire ecosystem, which means from seed stage to grown-up stage. A good company example that I always like to use, we were involved in the Series A start-up of Alnylam up in Cambridge with our Science Hotel product. I think they took 4,000 or 7,000 feet. Today, they occupy hundreds of thousands of feet, and are multiple billions of dollars in market cap. So it's good to be there at the beginning, so we can pick the winners of the future, especially given the amazing progress and disruptive technologies today. So that's our goal in dealing with that product. Sheila McGrath : Great. Thank you. Joel Marcus : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Tom Catherwood from BTIG. Please go ahead with your question. Tom Catherwood : Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. Sticking with the question on RTP, and the AgTech Center down there, how does -- how do the companies and the lease structures in the AgTech world differ from what you would be doing in Cambridge or San Francisco? Is there any material difference? Joel Marcus : No, they don't. Tom, this is Joel. There are three products. One is lab -- lab office, and then the other is greenhouse, and they're all triple net leases and the lease structure is exactly the same. We just felt that -- and I think I may have mentioned. If I didn't, venture capital certainly is one indicator went from something like $8 billion over $16 billion over the last two years in the AgTech, and it didn't fall on deaf ears when we tracked those statistics to understand that more and more this world is about not only fighting disease, but it's about gaining good nutrition. And this is an industry \u2013 especially, given the huge consolidation among the big guys. Now there's only three, and the Chinese own one of them. That's really important for what we think is a huge launch of innovation in this area. So that's why we've kind of gone after that particular niche. Tom Catherwood : Got you. And then when we think about the -- Steve I think you mentioned the 392,000 square feet of demand in RTP. Is that primarily private industry backed by those venture funds that you were talking about Joel? Or is this university-related tech transfer? Kind of how does that ecosystem round out? Stephen Richardson : Hi. It's Steve. That's a wide breadth of companies there. So as you annunciated it, it's all of the above. Tom Catherwood : Okay. And then... Joel Marcus : In fact -- I mean, it's much like New York. We've got I don't know 50-plus tenants in our campus in New York. Not a single one of them other than one that I can remember did research in New York before we had the campus. So the -- some of the AgTech stuff in north -- in the Research Triangle region as we call it -- really these are new companies being seeded by venture people, sometimes institutional investors and sometimes the big majors to do things outside of the big corporations. And so a lot of these are very new companies. Some are big, big existing companies, but there's a broad range of demand that gives us comfort down there. Tom Catherwood : Got you. Got you. Then one last one Steve. Demand in San Francisco, you mentioned that picking up at 2.9 million square feet. Is that demand concentrated in any specific submarkets? And how is it trending in your Greater Stanford cluster? Stephen Richardson : I think we're seeing it very well distributed. You have continued demand in Mission Bay. The challenge of course is the supply constraint there. Equally strong in South San Francisco and we are seeing very positive demand down in the Greater Stanford cluster just as we anticipated. So it is broad-based in each of these core clusters, Tom. Tom Catherwood : Excellent. Thanks everyone. Stephen Richardson : Thank you. Joel Marcus : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Rich Anderson from SMBC Nikko. Please go ahead with your question. Rich Anderson : Thanks. Good afternoon everyone. So Joel, you mentioned the 50% number that is rental revenue from IG or large cap. What makes that the right number? I'm curious, if you see that going up, because 77% of your portfolio is defined as Class A. I don't know why, but I would think that the 15 to 77 should perhaps be closer together. Is that the wrong way to think about it? Joel Marcus : Yes, because I mean if you look at Cambridge as an example and we are working day and night with tenants to try to direct them sometimes out of Cambridge most people want to be in Cambridge and our product is new Class A campus-like or rehab -- Class A rehab and that's where they want to be. They want to be in the best locations. And you have to remember that rental expenses aren't generally the biggest part of their budget. So I think that's why you see that that split. They're a lot of NewCos, same thing in San Francisco where they want to be in the best locations for interaction with UCSF et cetera. Going out to the burbs or to concrete tilt up buildings in lesser locations just aren't of great interest. So I think that's why you see -- I don't know that there's any right answer for what our credit amount should be, but I think 50%-plus is where we've been for a long time and fairly comfortable given lease durations of what we have. Rich Anderson : But in the extreme -- and it may be for anyone in the room, the extreme case of Cambridge where you have five million square feet or more of demand and basically no availability. I mean at what point do people just acquiesce and say, okay, I got to be in Boston or some place somewhat close. And if that were to happen to increasing degree would you be willing to follow that demand? Stephen Richardson : Well I think that relates to the question that was asked earlier about Seaport and some of the other locations. I think naturally you have to look at other locations, because doesn't matter how much capital you have there's a limited amount of land and limited amount of buildings in Cambridge. And so clearly people have to look at other locations in some fashion. Rich Anderson : Yes. Okay. And last for me. You're putting off these huge mark-to-markets whether you look at cash or GAAP. I'm not asking for 2020 guidance or 2021 guidance, but when you think about the sort of the geographically where assets are going to be having lease expirations. To what degree can we maintain levels in these huge ranges? Considering the fact that where leases expire is perhaps an important component to why you're getting the type of growth that you're getting? Joel Marcus : Well, I think if you just -- I'll ask Steve and Peter to comment as well because they're very granular with this. But if you look at the 2020 expirations, I think 24 we've got what 1.7 million square feet of -- which is about what 5.9% of the annual rental revenue. But if you look at the rental rates on the right-hand side in the markets, many of these are well below market. Rich Anderson : Yeah. Stephen Richardson : Yeah. Rich this is Steve. I mean when you start looking at the mark-to-market in Cambridge right about 21%, San Francisco you got Mission Bay at 18%, South San Francisco as much as 27%, San Diego and UTC 11%, Seattle about 10%. So, in each of those markets, the mark-to-market opportunity is pretty significant. When you get into the individual sweeps that might be rolling, there may be a mix there. So that's not necessarily guidance for how it's all going to shakeout, when you roll it up. But I think across the board in those markets in particular, you can see it's pretty healthy. Rich Anderson : Yeah. Peter Moglia : Yeah. This is Peter. I just want to add, that we're roughly a third Greater Boston, a third Bay area, and a third everywhere else. Of course there's been a great run in Greater Boston and San Francisco everybody knows about. But I think what is going to help power -- it's an extended run like we're having is that these other regions like Maryland, Research Triangle region, New York City, San Diego are also doing very well, just given what Joel, set the stage for early on with the indicators of the industry. There are positive. They've been positive. And as we roll or re-lease in all the regions, they're just all contributing which we can't say has happened throughout our history but we're just happened in a great time where everything is clicking on truly also owners. Rich Anderson : Okay great. Thanks and kudos on the Dayton project. Peter Moglia : Thank you very much Rich. Operator : Our next question comes from Dave Rodgers from Baird. Please go ahead with your question. Dave Rodgers : Yeah, maybe for Steve or Joel just on the 88 Bluxome and the Pinterest lease. Do you anticipate or is there any discussion about the recapturing the existing Pinterest space? Or would this be purely expansion? Stephen Richardson : Dave, hi it's Steve. No, it is purely expansion. That was the clear intent. And that's the way this is a new expansions stand-alone lease. So they're very excited about that. And they are thoroughly enjoying their existing billing at 505 Brannan which has actually won a number of design awards. So that's an important facility for them. Dave Rodgers : Great and then on the 2020 delivery, I guess you haven't laid out in the supplement. You've got about $1.9 million square feet plus or minus, may be planned for delivery as you've got about 350,000 started under construction. Do you anticipate delivering a larger number of maybe shells to tenants next year? Do you have the ability to kind of deliver some of these bigger buildings of 530,000 or 208,000 square foot buildings, in that kind of year to 15 or 16 month time frame? Any color on that? Joel Marcus : Yeah. So I said in the beginning we would give over the next couple of quarters more granular visibility into 2020, but maybe just keep it high level. I think it's pretty clear we'll be able to deliver way more than shells in 2020. I think we've got a very robust pipeline. I think we have a lot of great activity. And will save it for another quarter but we have a lot of confidence in the 2020 pipeline. I think if you look at this year's pipeline, just think about that as continuing on into 2020. Peter Moglia : And this is Peter I'll just comment a bit about, how we're able to deliver in a timely fashion. We're pretty proactive when we put these assets into our land bank. And start entitlement work almost right away if not right away. So we'll be able to come out of the ground if we're not already out of ground pretty much at any time we need to this year. Dave Rodgers : That's helpful. Thank you. And then maybe last one just for Dean. Given the equity forward that you've done, I think last year maybe how do you view your experience of that? And whether that's on the table again this year as well? Dean Shigenaga : Dave, its Dean here. Every year we look at our capital line carefully. Each year is slightly different and the needs. And it's interesting it's only April. Well, it's almost May. It's a day from May and we've knocked down a good chunk of our capital needs which we're very pleased with. The bond deal is very successful the JV sale 75/125 Binney Street was an outstanding transaction. And so over -- as we go through and look forward Dave we'll provide more color. We never really get into the weeds on timing and structure. I think it's safe to say that we'll remain disciplined in our approach and we want to be prudent and disciplined in how we go about raising capital. Eventually we'll be able to lock-in great returns on the cost to capital here whenever we get to the race. And then it will allow us to move on to whatever else remains open on sources and uses of that point probably. We talked about our dispositions but we're working on that as well. So, surely in the year but we're firing up on all cylinders right now. Joel Marcus : Yes. The big focus at the moment is on the two additional dispositions that Dean spoke about so that's kind of where our focus is. Dave Rodgers : All right. Great. Thank you all. Joel Marcus : Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen at this time we'll conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference call back over to Mr. Marcus for any closing remarks. Joel Marcus : Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciated and look forward to talking to on the second quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your lines.",

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz with Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Paula Schwartz : Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Federal Securities laws. The company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And I would like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel. Joel Marcus : Thank you, Paula and welcome everybody to our second quarter call. With me today are Dean Shigenaga; Steve Richardson; and Peter Moglia. I want to start with focusing on the cover page to our 20 -- our 2Q19 press release and supplemental, which features our recently developed Vertex Pharmaceutical West Coast research base, designed in the shape of two human lungs together with a quote from the mother of the two children suffering from cystic fibrosis, which I quoted in the first quarter call. This is our solemn mission to build the future of life-changing innovation as we have each and every day over the past 25 years as the originator and innovator of the life science real estate niche and we thank each and every team member of the Alexandria family for their important contribution each and every day. As we sit here after the close of the second quarter, we really are very proud on a couple of aspects. I think we've reached a point where we can say we really have built a fortress balance sheet with over $3.4 billion in liquidity and a weighted average remaining debt term of greater than 10 years, and Dean will highlight some of the capital accomplishments this past quarter. We also have a pipeline which will \u2013 which could enable us to double rental revenue from January of 2018 to December 2022. The strongest client tenant base with 53% of our annual rental revenue from investment grade or publicly-traded large cap client tenants with a weighted average lease term of 8.4 years. In addition, a robust 2Q cash same-store growth number that Dean will talk about as well and Steve will highlight robust cash re-leasing spreads this past quarter. And we're very proud of a very strong value-add pipeline leading into 2020 with significant positive activity in each one of our markets, including the 88 Bluxome win, which is a really big win and a very unique one, Steve will talk about. Notably, we increased our dividend -- our quarterly dividend 3.1% during the second quarter as well. In July, we're proud to be notified that we were selected by NAIOP as the 2019 NAIOP Developer of the Year for our outstanding design, work, sustainable outcomes, scientific prowess and connected campuses driven by our unique and differentiated mission and deep thoughtfulness toward enhancing the communities in which we work. And if we focus for a moment on the next life science frontier, it's pretty clear that the sheer scale of unmet medical needs for patients suffering from diseases of the brain is quite staggering, the cost to society enormous, just the nine most common neurological diseases are estimated to cost the United States $800 billion a year. Dementia today affects 50 million people worldwide and 10 million new cases diagnosed every year. Alzheimer's alone affects almost 6 million Americans and more than 1 million Americans live with Parkinson's at a total cost of about $50 billion plus a year, nearly double previous estimates. It's estimated by 2050 that more than 12 million Americans will suffer from some form of neurodegenerative disease. In the realm of psychiatric diseases, nearly one in five adults, almost 50 million people experience some form of mental illness in a given year, costing our economy almost $200 billion of lost earnings alone, while approximately one in 25 people, 11 million daily suffer from a form of mental illness depression, now the leading cause of disability worldwide, and has become the major contributor to global burden of disease. On the addiction front, and we touched upon our efforts in the opioid abuse area last quarter, the abuse of illicit drugs as well as alcohol and tobacco in the US is costing us almost three quarters of a billion, I'm sorry, three quarters of $1 trillion annually related and costs related to crime, loss work productivity and healthcare. The ongoing opioid epidemic is now estimated to cost the US over $500 billion annually, largely driven by the immense scale of preventable fatalities caused by opioid overdoses, where on average 130 Americans die each and every day. Imagine if that was in a war, how that would be covered by the press. Discovering new treatments and cures for diseases of the brain has become a goal of ever-increasing urgency and one on which Alexandria is super-laser focused on with our financial capital as well as our human capital. And with that, let me turn it over to Steve to give some highlights of the quarter. Steve Richardson : Thank you, Joel. Steve here. We're very pleased to report the company's unique cluster campus business model is not only driving superior operating and financial results, but it continues to provide tremendous value to our tenants and stakeholders. Alexandria's dominant franchise and brand, its best-in-class team and highly differentiated campuses continue to exceed expectations and drive significant internal and external growth opportunities for the company. I'll provide a granular analysis of the following key clusters and metrics. In the Mission Bay, SoMa submarket, Alexandria\u2019s leadership role dating back from 2004 in establishing Mission Bay as one of the country's most vital life science translational research clusters has and continues to provide significant value. Our campuses, totaling 2.7 million square feet, have been nearly 100% leased for a number of years. Our lab vacancy is 0% and the tech vacancy in the market is 1.3%. Lease rates for existing lab and tech space is now in the high-60s to low-70s triple net, while we anticipate new deliveries to exceed 80s triple net. Significant lease transactions include Pinterest\u2019s 488,000 square feet lease at Alexandria\u2019s unique 88 Bluxome project in SoMa, which we'll discuss later, as well as Sony leasing a 130,000 square feet; Autodesk, a 117,000 square feet; Glassdoor a 116,000 square feet; SamCERA, a 116,000 square feet; Workday, 74,000 square feet; and Zoom, 64,000 square feet. Just want to highlight, it's very important to note the overall high regard respect and leadership position of Alexandria as was epitomized by last week's decision by the San Francisco Planning Commission to provide Alexandria with the only full project approval in Prop M allocation for our new Class A plus game-changing 88 Bluxome Mixed-Use Urban Campus in SoMa. I just want to step back and take a moment to say how proud we are of the company and the team for this accomplishment, as we're very thoughtful at the very outset to embrace exceptional design, sustainability, and very importantly, the community and its needs, all resulting in a full project approval and the only Central SoMa project to have secured an anchor tenant, Pinterest and now nearly 60% leased. We are very honored to have received this overwhelmingly positive endorsement from both the city and the community. Moving further south in South San Francisco, we're very well positioned in this submarket. Our campuses totaling 2.2 million square feet are 99.3% leased, including the delivery of Merck\u2019s Class A 300,000 square foot Innovation Center at the start of 2019. We've taken a balanced and prudent approach towards expanding our South San Francisco campuses and are very pleased with the leasing progress at our new ground up, 315,000 square foot, two-building campus on Haskins Drive with a signed LOI for nearly 30% of the space. The South San Francisco vacancy rate is just 2.9%, but we're closely watching the supply pipeline with a potential for significant blocks of space coming to market if a speculative construction like others were to advance. As this is ultimately a submarket, and not a cluster centered around a world-class institution like UCSF. That's our careful prudence here. Lease rates are now in the mid-to-high 60 triple net and new leases in South San Francisco include Atreca for 75,000 square feet, Cytokinetics for 235,000 square feet and Tolerion [ph] for 25,000 square feet. Finally, talking about leasing and same-store performance, which was stellar this past quarter. We leased 819,000 square feet this quarter for a total now up 2 million square feet in the first half of 2019. Again, a testament to Alexandria\u2019s world-class leasing and operations team, 61% of these leases are early renewals. So it's very clear that there's a continued sense of urgency in our campuses. Historical increase in renewals and re-leasing rates for this quarter, 17.8% cash and 32.5% GAAP for the 580,000 square feet in this pool and when you look at the same-store growth of 9.5% cash basis, splits roughly between the burn off of concessions and step-ups, a very, very healthy and very stellar quarter. And on that note, I'll hand it off to Peter. Peter Moglia : Thank you, Steve. This is Peter Moglia, everybody. I'm going to spend the next few minutes updating you on our near-term pipeline, our acquisition in the seaport area of Boston and give you some thoughts on recent capital flows into the life science real estate area. During the second quarter, we placed 218,061 square feet into service from six different 2019 deliveries that I'll touch on. In South San Francisco, we delivered 24,396 square feet of our 279 East Grand project anchored by Alphabet\u2019s Life Sciences subsidiary, Verily. We've now delivered 78% of that project at a very strong yield of over 8%. We delivered another 27,164 square feet at 188 East Blaine, our new flagship property on Lake Union and Seattle and are on track to meet or exceed our pro forma cash yield on cost of 6.7% which is very strong when considering Class A operating assets and this market continue to trade at sub 4.5% yield. 12,822 square feet was delivered at 266 and 275 Second Avenue in Waltham and that property is now fully leased with the remaining 19,000 square feet under construction and expected to be delivered in the fourth quarter. The initial stabilized cash yield on this redevelopment is 7.1% in a market where stabilized lab buildings have historically traded in the low side 6% range. A significant portion of Phase I of Alexandria Center for AgTech located in the Research Triangle market was delivered in the second quarter, bringing that highly unique 97% leased project to 74% delivered. We delivered the remaining 76,400 square feet of 681 Gateway in South San Francisco this quarter, and more importantly, increased the pro forma initial cash yield cash yield, cash yield from 7.9% to 8.2%. Completing second quarter deliveries was 3,450 square feet at our multi-tenant 80,000 square foot building at 704 Quince Orchard Road in Gaithersburg, Maryland, where we remain on track to deliver an outsized 8.8% initial stabilized cash yield. Looking further out, our 2020 development and redevelopment pipeline currently consists of about 2.2 million square feet and Dean will provide some high level information on this commentary - on his commentary. Next, I'd like to talk a little bit about our Seaport acquisition. The acquisition of 5 and 15 Necco, also known as Innovation Point represents a strategic opportunity to expand Alexandria\u2019s unparalleled world-class franchise in the Greater Boston area. Innovation Point in part delivers a fully renovated 95,000 square foot historic building, 5 Necco Street that will be the global headquarters for GE. GE will occupy approximately 75,000 square feet or all of the office space in the building for a 12-year term. It also provides Alexandria the opportunity to deliver an iconic 330,000 square foot to 360,000 square foot world-class Life Science building with a robust and vibrant set of retail and ground floor amenities at 15 Necco Street and the existing approvals that resides there will enable us to expedite the entitlements and likely put us in a position to break ground in early 2020. When combined with our adjacent 10 Necco asset, the acquisition provides Alexandria the opportunity to scale this campus to between 600,000 square feet and 650,000 square feet over time. Finally, in light of substantial capital flowing into the Life Science Real Estate niche, we created and pioneered. We'd like to remind investors and analysts that there have been others in many of our markets for a number of years. It has not affected our ability to grow and thrive in any of them, because Alexandria is much more than a landlord or capital allocators. We are a long-term, highly ethical and trusted partner to our tenants who put their mission critical facilities needs into our hands, because they know we have a long tenured and highly respected experience and expertise to build and operate them to the highest standards. We understand their signs, business and strategic goals. We provide highly curated cluster campus environments that accommodate their growth and allow them to recruit and retain the industry's best talent. We are solidly positioned to continue to lead this ecosystem in building the future of life-changing innovation. And with that, I'll pass it over to Dean. Dean Shigenaga : Thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll briefly cover five key topics today, including our second quarter results and continued strength from both internal and external growth, our very strong balance sheet today, our recently published corporate responsibility report, venture investments and then lastly, our updated guidance for 2019. Total revenues for the second quarter were up a significant 15% over the second quarter of 2018, reflecting continued outstanding execution by our best-in-class team. Our adjusted EBITDA margins continue to remain near the top of the REIT industry at approximately 79% for the second quarter. Same property NOI growth for 2Q was up 4.3% and significantly at 9.5% on a cash basis as compared to the second quarter of 2018. Our team executed very well across key drivers of our same property results. We completed in an outstanding volume of leasing activity in the first half of \u201919, aggregating 2.1 million square feet, including 1.1 million rentable square feet related to lease renewals and re-leasing the space with very strong growth in rental rates of 32.6% and 20.1% on a cash basis over the expiring rental rates. Very strong execution of leasing supports were high and stable occupancy in our same property pool approximately 96% to 96.5% for both the second quarter and the first half of 2019, and our very favorable structure with annual rent \u2013 annual contractual rent escalations approximately about 3% drives growth and same property cash NOI year-to-year. Continued strong external growth and a few important key highlights for you today. Now that we're about \u2013 just about midyear through 2019, it's clear our team has executed extremely well on the delivery of projects in the first half of the year, with a number of highly leased projects aggregating about 1.5 million rentable square feet targeted for the delivery through the remainder of 2019. Our team has also done an outstanding job this year working with key relationships in the Life Science industry, and successfully executed almost 950,000 rentable square feet of leasing related to the development and redevelopment projects. As Peter mentioned, we have grown our pipeline to about 2.2 million square feet of projected deliveries with initial occupancy in 2020, which are weighted to the second half of \u201820. And we will have more details to share over the next two quarters. In aggregate, our projects undergoing above ground vertical construction with initial delivery dates through 2020 are now 74% leased plus an additional 5% under advanced negotiations. We also have a pipeline of strategic growth opportunities on balance sheet, including certain pending acquisitions, providing important visibility of potential deliveries beyond 2020 aggregating 10 million square feet. Our team has placed our balance sheet in a very strong position today with significant flexibility, our strategic pursuit of opportunities to refinance outstanding debt and extend our maturity profile with attractive low cost, long-term fixed rate debt continued into 2019 for the third year in a row. In March and July of 2019 alone, we raised 2.1 billion with a weighted average coupon of 3.86% and an amazing term of almost 18 years. The proceeds of our most recent $1.25 billion bond offering in July were used primarily to execute a tender and redemption of our outstanding bonds that were scheduled to mature in 2020 and 2022. Upon completion of the redemption of our remaining outstanding 2020 and 2022 bonds, later in August here, we will be in a really amazing position with no debt maturities until 2023. We have no significant remaining debt capital requirements for 2019. However, we are working with one of our JV partners on a potential early refinancing of a construction loan which has a maturity today of 2021. Weighted average remaining term of our debt is truly outstanding and has been extended to 10.1 years, and notably is longer than our weighted average remaining lease term of 8.4 years. During the second quarter, we also completed transactions aggregating 8.7 million shares of common stock at a weighted average price of $144.50 per share for proceeds that ultimately will \u2013 generate $1.2 billion. $86 million this closed in the second quarter. 8.1 million shares do remain subject to forward equity sale agreements that we expect to settle in 2019. We've got tremendous liquidity as Joel highlighted earlier of $3.4 billion, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA and fixed-charge coverage ratio has remained very solid and is on track for our goal of 5.3 and greater than 4 times respectively by the fourth quarter. As a mission-driven urban office REIT really focused on making a positive and lasting impact on the world. We're truly honored to highlight our recently published annual corporate responsibility report and our focus on leadership and environmental, social and governance matters. It's important to also recognize that our strategic business initiatives are well aligned with those of our highly innovative client tenants, really highlighting the importance of our initiatives. Key highlights from our corporate responsibility report include; 58 LEED certified or in-process certifications, that upon its completion, represent over 50% of our annual rental revenue recognition as a leader in workplace, health and wellness, and key philanthropy initiatives with over 2,600 volunteer hours by the team, and key social initiatives like our partnership with Verily, an Alphabet company really to design and develop a fully integrated campus ecosystem in Dayton, Ohio for the full and sustained recovery of people living with the opioid addiction. And lastly, continued progress on our 2025 goals to reduce energy consumption, carbon pollution, portable water consumption and increase our waste diversion rate. We also want to congratulate our awesome team on their fourth NAREIT Gold Award for communication and reporting excellence in the large cap category. Our team is really proud to be recognized for their efforts to create clear, concise and efficient disclosures for the investment community. Thanks to our entire team and truly great work, guys. During the second quarter, we recognized $21.5 million of investment income including $11.1 million of unrealized gains. In the second quarter, importantly, we also recognized $10.4 million of realized gains. As you look back over the last several quarters, realized gains from venture investments have averaged about $10.7 million per quarter. Closing here on guideline \u2013 guidance. Since our first quarter earnings call, we updated guidance on June 20 through an 8-K filing and further updated our guidance yesterday, primarily for the improvement in our outlook for 2019 rental rate growth, when you compare that to expiring rates on lease renewals and re-leasing the space and our range increased by 1% at the midpoint to 28.5% and 17.5% on a cash basis. Now this represents our second increase in our outlook for rental rates for the year. Our EPS guidance was updated to a range from $2.39 to $2.47 and we increased the midpoint of our guidance for FFO per share diluted as adjusted by $0.01 to $6.96 with an increase of the lower end of our range of guidance by $0.02. Guidance was also updated for the outstanding execution by our team on the opportunistic bond offering and refinancing of our 2020 and 2022 bonds as I highlighted earlier. And please note, as we have disclosed for a number of quarters now [indiscernible] a 117,000 rentable square foot property located in San Diego is now vacant, resulting in temporary \u2013 a temporary 49 basis point decline in overall occupancy by September 30th, while we renovate and re-tenant this property. Additionally as disclosed on page four and page six of our supplemental package, an acquisition of an operating property in San Diego, with several buildings aggregating 560,000 rentable square feet with in-place leases, has an occupancy of 76% and this will reduce our overall occupancy by another 57 basis points and represents an opportunity for our team to grow cash flows from this property post acquisition. Please refer to page six of our supplemental package for further details on our guidance assumptions for the year. And I'll turn it back to Joel. Joel Marcus : Operator, if we could go to question-and-answer, please. Operator : Sure, thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question will be from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Jamie Feldman : Great, thank you. I guess starting with Dean, you've raised a lot of capital in the quarter and slightly after. Can you just give us your thoughts as you look out over the next -- through 2020 and the development spending, what you think next year's capital plan might look like compared to this one, this year's? Dean Shigenaga : So Jamie, thank you, it's Dean here. So good reminder that we do plan to hold our Annual Investor Day event on Tuesday, December 3rd later this year at our New York Center in New York City. As we're thinking about this time every year, we do get questions about the next year and our preferences to respond to those questions about our outlook, once we publish that on the morning of our Annual Investor Day event. But, Jamie broadly, I think if you look back over the last several years, our objective with capital and our capital raising needs each year, we\u2019ll remain to be very disciplined and prudent with funding our needs from various sources as we have historically. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then, we've seen a pickup in kind of value-add or development that are -- kind of development related acquisitions over the last couple of quarters. Can you just talk about maybe the returns you're getting or what is it lately that's made those types of opportunities come in the surface for you guys, looks like you've even got more to close going forward? Peter Moglia : Hey, Jamie, it's Peter. Look, the volatility and interest rates, latter part of last year, I think woke up a lot of people that were holding real estate and decided, if I'm going to sell, I'm going to sell soon. Of course, that has tempered and we're looking at \u2013 continue to look at a low rate environment. Nonetheless, a lot of opportunities have come into the market and in great locations where we wanted to expand. So we've been able to capitalize on that, especially considering our stock has performed well and our cost of debt has gone down due to Dean and his team's great work. So with all those things aligning, we've gone ahead and purchased some things and we certainly strive for a good spread over exit cap rates of at least 150 basis points or something ground up and we\u2019ll continue to maintain that. Jamie Feldman : Okay. You\u2019re saying the acquisitions you\u2019re underwriting 150 basis points better than ground up? Peter Moglia : That's typically the target, we sometimes do better. It's going to depend on the risk, obviously. But we're certainly aware of risk adjusted return concepts. And I think we do a good job of allocating capital that way. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then just as you think about the legislative environment or regulatory environment, especially related to the drug pricing, have you seen any change in tenant behavior or any thoughts that you can pass along on just either how your tenants are acting or how you think they might act going forward? Joel Marcus : Hey, Jamie, this is Joel. So we haven't seen any real impact at the moment. I think it is pretty clear though that from the executive branch to the legislative branch, in light of the impending 2020 election, each -- a party wants to have some talking points about what they've accomplished on drug pricing. Unfortunately, they\u2019ve focused on the 10% to 12% of the healthcare pie and haven't appropriately focused on the big numbers. But I think it's fair to say, given some of the movement in the Senate Finance Committee that we\u2019ll see something done over the next few months. And my sense is that, it may reside in a -- some adjustment to Part D of Medicare. Remember, outside of the 8% to 10% of Americans who are not insured, two-thirds of people are covered by private pay or self-insured plans and one-third is Medicare. So the one-third is going to be focused on the PART D. It's also important to remember, there's this notion of trying to index somehow Medicare pricing to international standards, but that President can't enact that by Executive Board or individually. So that's something to think about. Jamie Feldman : If you would boil it all down, I mean, what's your view on how this plays out for you in terms of your business? Joel Marcus : I think that, if there is a fixed Part D that would impact what we call the oral oncology drug sector and the two biggest players in oncology are Bristol-Myers, Celgene and Roche have pretty dominant positions there and so they'll have to think about how that impacts them, a company like Lilly wouldn't be impacted in any way, shape or form. So I think it's selective. And remember, Medicare is about a third of overall drug. Medicare covers a third of US people, so it's not 100% by any means. Jamie Feldman : Okay, all right. Thank you. Joel Marcus : You\u2019re welcome. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Manny Korchman with Citi. Please go ahead. Manny Korchman : Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Maybe this question for Dean. Dean, the accelerated acquisition pace in 2019, does that at all impact your goal of doubling revenues and does it sort of speed that up or this all sort of contemplated and is this just going to be land bank essentially through those years? Dean Shigenaga : Manny it's Dean here. The acquisition pipeline as you can imagine, is very unpredictable. It does add to our five-year growth plan in that sense. So it doesn't move along to that target nicely for us, but that was not critical in our initial outlook that we had contemplated in our five-year plan. Joel Marcus : And remember, that's a framework we haven't given definitive guidance on that since we only give one year guidance. Manny Korchman : Okay. And then you talked about the competition, specifically, I guess, in South San Francisco. Have you seen anyone coming into more of your cluster markets that\u2019s a more of a developer or a merchant developer that's who is trying to put up and get out or is that limited to that one market? Joel Marcus : Well, I think historically, certainly, over the last 5,10, 15 years, there have been both national players and regional players in every single one of our markets. So I think that just is the way it is, and that hasn't really changed. There is a lot of capital moving into this sector. So that's why Peter maybe mention that he did, because people are looking at this as a \u2013 to some people, this almost becomes a valuable core asset, whereas when we started out for many, many years, this was looked at as kind of a funky oddball, a niche that you wouldn't group with retail, housing, office, industrial, et cetera, but that's changed around and that's why the cap rates have gone where they are. So that's a net process for us [indiscernible]. Manny Korchman : Thanks, everyone. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Please go ahead. Rich Anderson : Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Dean, first to you. Why do a forward deal if you plan to settle it as soon as this year? I can understand having a longer tail to the plan. I'm just curious what your line of thinking was there? Dean Shigenaga : Sure, Rich it's Dean here. Forward equity sale agreements generally, most of them are set for about a 12-month term, contractually, very few of them extend meaningfully beyond that, it might go to 15 months, but not much beyond that. So I think conceptually, Rich, forward transactions are short-term settlements. I would say that most useful transactions on a forward has really \u2013 is really focused on settling somewhere in the near-term over several quarters to match your funding requirements. And that's the reason why we use it. Rich, it's really to align with our timing of funding. Rich Anderson : Fair enough, just curious, usually, it's a next year sort of event. But I understand the answer. So the second question is somewhat conceptual. You guys are doing a lot in the way of early renewal activity, 61% again this quarter. I'm curious if there's any impact on your ability to negotiate those rents? In other words, if someone's coming to you early, do you think about the current market rent or you think about what the future market rent would be for them? Had they waited until they were contractually expiring and hence you kind of get a bigger number out of that in negotiation? Is that something that makes any sense at all or is the market just the market? Steve Richardson : Rich it\u2019s Steve Richardson. It as you might imagine, it is all a balance and we are certainly looking at an increasing rental rate environment, how to tackle that. So I think, with that balance, we get the benefit of locking the tenant down. I think we are getting upside beyond what the rent is today. And really importantly, and this is a metric that we've noted for a long time now, the reusability of these improvements, the lower CapEx requirement is really enhanced when we can renew somebody in our space that they've already invested in. So I really do think we end up with an optimal balance where we get the best of all worlds there. Joel Marcus : But we're also mindful of relationships and we're not pushing the last dollar and the last cent, because you can be penny-wise and pound-foolish in a sense, because these relationships are long-term and we want to be a partner, not a financial landlord who is pressing every last cent out of the property. Rich Anderson : Perfect answer. Thank you and then last, on the \u2013 I think perhaps the one of the jewels of the story as you\u2019re pre-leasing of your development pipeline upwards to 80%? Curious how much of that is, you start to deal and you are almost amazed by the level that you're able to get to in a relatively short period of time? Or do you manage it and I guess the short question is, where are you and what type of pre-leasing you need to just get the engine rolling on a development? And how does that vary from one market to the next, I imagine you be more willing to go spec in a Cambridge and less so in maybe, San Diego or something? Dean Shigenaga : Yeah, I think since the financial crisis, we've tried to match going vertical with commitments in hand. And I think fortunately \u2013 we've been fortunate and also with relationships, we've been able to match those after the last \u2013 over the last many years with a very comfortable kind of dovetail, there's no magical number, obviously as you could imagine, there would be more momentum in Cambridge than there would be, say in the New York City. But, it's one that just you have to have kind of the touch and feel of that particular sub market. So it's pretty differentiated. PeterMoglia: Hey and this is Peter Moglia. I mean, the other thing I think I would add is that, it's a testament to how ingrained we are in the fabric of the industry and each market that we are well aware of the demand well before the market is. So that allows us to plan for these things. And if you plan well, you can deliver quickly and that's what our tenants need. So really our long-term presence in these markets, and our teams that are highly experienced and with long tenure pays off, and the ability to forecast when we should be delivering product. Rich Anderson : Okay, lastly, can you mention who the San Diego seller was? Dean Shigenaga : No, we need to keep that confidential. Rich Anderson : Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. Joel Marcus : Thanks, Richard. Operator : The next question will be from Sheila McGrath with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Sheila McGrath : Yes, good afternoon. On 88 Bluxome, you have the approvals. That's great news. I'm just wondering the status of any lawsuits there and what you expect the timing to be and is this going to be in two phases? Or is it all one phase? Joel Marcus : Yeah Sheila, I'm going to kick it over to Steve in a moment. But I think, remember what Steve said, we're the only project to get full, one-time approval for the entire project and we don't have to go back for any prior approval and a full Prop M allocation. No other developer in Central. SoMa has that, they must come back. But Steve can speak to the lawsuits that I think we're pretty optimistic on. Steve Richardson : Yeah. Hi, Sheila it\u2019s Steve. That's exactly right. There are ongoing discussions, everybody is reasonably encouraged and we would hope through the balance of the year that we would be able to resolve those, enabling us to be in a position to go ahead and kick off construction. So, again, we're very hopeful. And that, again, that would be for the entire project as Joel just emphasized there, we do not need to go back to the city. So we could in fact, kick off the entire 1 million square foot project. Sheila McGrath : Okay, great. And then just a question on Alexandria District for Science in the Greater Stanford area, that's a big project. It's already 37% leased. Just wondered if you could give us an update on that and is that a ground up development? Or was that redevelopment? Steve Richardson : That is a ground up development? Yes, we're very pleased. And I think this really speaks to what, Peter had discussed with our long-term presence there. And the insight that we have with the teams on the ground that we've been able to have this type of success this early in a ground up project, so very pleased with the progress there. Sheila McGrath : Okay. And then two questions for Dean. On the forward equity, should \u2013 in terms of timing, should we assume that is back-end weighted to fourth quarter? Dean Shigenaga : Yeah, yeah that's fair to assume, Sheila. Sheila McGrath : Okay. And then on the other investment gains, I'm just wondering is the active IPO market in biotech is that driving these realized gains a little bit higher this year? And given current equity market conditions, should we assume a similar level as the first half of the year? Dean Shigenaga : Sheila it\u2019s Dean here again. I'd say, when I think back several years now or maybe even longer than that, because we've been investing in early-stage companies for quite a number of years. The liquidity events that drive realized gains are always \u2013 have always been a combination of IPOs and M&A activity. And that seems to be pretty true for the last number of quarters. The IPO market has been fairly active since 2013, but you still see quite a bit of M&A driving liquidity events and gain for this business. Sheila McGrath : Okay, thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Michael Carroll : Yeah. Thanks. I wonder if you guys can touch on your investment activity. I know Peter kind of discussed this a little bit earlier. I know you've been acquiring a lot of future development sites. I mean, what \u2013 how do you underwrite that? And when do you break ground on those projects, once they potentially be stabilized down the road? And how willing are you to increase your land bank today? Dean Shigenaga : So, Michael, it's Dean here. I think, broadly, what we'd like to comment on is that, what we've done here is, I think, given really nice visibility for our investors to think about how we can manage growth into the future, because now we have a pipeline that goes beyond \u201820 of about 10 million square feet. So we just want to be able to provide strategic visibility for everybody and I think we\u2019ve accomplished that in recent quarters with adding to the pipeline. Michael Carroll : Okay, is there a limit to how much land you want to add to your land bank? Or is it just the market fundamentals are so strong you're willing to grab high quality sites and you can find them? Dean Shigenaga : We're always been very thoughtful in that regard, Michael, as it relates to the amount of product we have. What we did on page two of our supplemental disclosure was, add some visibility into that pipeline, about half of it is currently vertical, highly leases, 74% leased and included in this bucket is the 88 Bluxome project, which is also about 60% pre-leased today. What I think that most of our investors should focus in on is, what's behind that. And it's a fairly modest number. So this is land that's either nothing vertical is going on with these land sites, but it's really strategic sites for future growth. That number is only 6% of our gross investment in real estate. So it's pretty modest today. Michael Carroll : Okay, great. And then Steve, can you talk a little bit about your comments on the South San Francisco market? I know demand has been pretty strong and I know one of your competitors had some good leasing activity on one of their development projects. I mean the supply, were you in that market? And then maybe can touch on about the - if you can, the acquisitions you put in the sub regarding the three sites in the San Francisco Bay area that's pending acquisition right now? Steve Richardson : Yeah Michael hi, it\u2019s Steve. Yeah we\u2019ll provide further color when we're able on the pending acquisition certainly in the Bay Area. And on South San Francisco yeah I think as we've said for a while, we've just been very thoughtful and prudent in the approach there. We\u2019ve got a tremendous set of campuses, they are essentially fully leased, adding product like we're doing at Haskins is the right thing to do with the right time. And we are watching this supply very closely there with a number of different projects that if people choose to build on a speculative basis, could add more supply than we've seen there for a while. So we monitor this extremely closely, but right now we're taking a very balanced approach. Michael Carroll : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Daniel Ismail with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. Daniel Ismail : Great, thank you. Peter you mentioned the amount of new capital flowing into the space and with potentially lower rates. I\u2019m curious to get your thoughts on where you see cap rates across your markets and have you noticed any accelerating cap rate compression in any specific markets? Peter Moglia : Yeah, thanks Daniel. Yeah it\u2019s Peter. I wouldn't say that we've seen accelerated cap rate compression, but it has ticked down. I don't think anybody would have forecasted that at the end of last year. But I think I may have had this conversation with you in the past, but right now, a great look or a well located lab building in a core market is probably more valuable on a cap rate basis than an office building, which is unique considering what Joel said about how people looked at our assets back when we started. So, obviously that has been a terrific or had terrific impact on our NAV. And we expect that it will continue, we do get contacted quite a bit from people interested in our assets when we do put things out for sale, we do have some pending transactions with that had very high quality investors interested. And next quarter we\u2019ll be giving some news on that, and I think everyone will be pleasantly not surprised, but satisfied with the cap rates that we\u2019ll show. So, it's a good time to be a laboratory owner for us and that's another reason we continue to create value through some acquisitions, because we wanted to create even more. Daniel Ismail : And just a quick one for Dean, noticed expenses picked up a little bit this year or this quarter again, anything we should know driving that\u2019s and maybe that outlook for the rest of the year? Dean Shigenaga : Daniel I think I missed the key part of your question. Daniel Ismail : It\u2019s the express - excuse me, expense growth this quarter looks like it picked up again eight points \u2013 about 8%. Anything driving that we should know? Dean Shigenaga : Nothing unusual in our operating expense growth, I think that it probably had a little bit of repairs and maintenance and property taxes is a driver lately over the last few years. I think what you find in our \u2013 as we build out and renovate product or redevelopment or development, the different regions are sometimes slow to assess the values and that creeps in overtime and doesn't necessarily all commence in the year that we actually deliver product.  And it\u2019s importantly, though, Daniel as you know, our leases are triple net, so we're able to pass through almost all of our operating cost or tenants and I think that's really important, because that mitigates volatility to earnings or net operating income. Daniel Ismail : Great. Thanks guys. Operator : The next question comes from Tom Catherwood of BTIG. Please go ahead. Tom Catherwood : Thank you. So a question on San Diego. This cluster has always been somewhat unique for you guys and that it's been more spread out than some of your other markets. But in this quarter, you've taken down more land adjacent to your campus point projects and you're looking at kind of a pretty substantially sized dense cluster there. Is this the case of just taking advantage of adjacent assets that came up for sale? Or do you think that a denser cluster in San Diego could help drive demand in rent growth? Joel Marcus : So this is Joel. I remember San Diego was our first market and I think campus point is pretty unique, because it fits essentially as part of a university town center, which is a more urban like market than you would normally find and say other parts of San Diego per se sales compared to Torrey Pines, which is one of the most beautiful, but it's not so urban. So I think that is an important factor. And then obviously, we have the preeminent campus and a world-class set of client tenants there, both Life Science and Tech and so the opportunity to expand that campus by adjacencies is, I think super-prudent. So those things play into our mindset. Tom Catherwood : So will it be fair to say that you're starting to see some interest by tenants in getting those adjacencies to similar companies that you've seen, obviously not the same level, but as you've seen in a Cambridge or in Mission Bay? Joel Marcus : I think yes and also we've been fortunate that existing tenants have wanted to expand. So having the ability to both, build or provide product that there may be some near-term vacancy ability is a real plus. Tom Catherwood : Got it? And then, I know it was a small deal, but you announced the LaunchLabs partnership with Columbia University this quarter. I assume that\u2019s the West Harlem campus, is that correct? Joel Marcus : That's correct. The motivation for that is a little different than you might imagine, broadly speaking, New York really is a early-stage company. It is, clusters take about a generation 25 years to really evolve and develop, Boston, Cambridge is in there, second generation, so as San Francisco, but New York is really in the first decade. So there's not a long waiting line of tenants like there is in Cambridge, it really is an early-stage market and one that you really have to create. So we've tried to meet that reality with a product that makes sense and we've partnered with that by far the largest and most dominant institutions in that market. Tom Catherwood : Very fair and I think along those lines, we've seen new lab space development that happened and it's also ongoing in West Harlem, there was an incubator up there right now and there's been a number of companies that have formed a Tech transfers out of Columbia up there. Is this kind of a test the waters kind of move where you get to feel out the potential, a growing cluster in New York or is it just the connection to Columbia that was really the benefit? Joel Marcus : Well, I think most of the \u2013 and you have to take demand kind of with a grain of salt in New York, there is some institutional demand. And I think that's been the focus of some of the developers there, because there's not a line of companies waiting like there is as in San Francisco or Cambridge has pretty prototypical examples. Columbia is the biggest and most dominant institution. They have a huge amount of NIH funding. So it's really part of a strategic ability to take advantage of that opportunity. I'm not sure whether there will be a sub-cluster of any effort up there. There is you mentioned one incubator, that's the Harlem bio space, but that's 3,000 square feet. So I think you can't assume that a massive amount of incubation space. Tom Catherwood : Very fair. Thanks, Joel. Joel Marcus : Yeah. Operator : The next question comes from Dave Rodgers with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Dave Rodgers : Hey, good afternoon. Steve wanted to start with you on the 88 Bluxome property. I think you've quoted now couple of times like 60% leased or committed and Pinterest only get to you a portion of the way there. So if you had said it earlier, I missed it and you mentioned a lot of leases at the beginning of the call. But have you announced the second lease there? Can you give a little more color on that? Steve Richardson : Dave, hi it\u2019s Steve. Yeah this is the historical kind of relationship we had with the Bay Club. So that's the other leased that\u2019s counting towards that occupancy percentage of the overall mixed-use complex. Dave Rodgers : Got you. That's helpful. Thank you. Steve Richardson : Sure. Dave Rodgers : Dean, the increase in capitalized interest I think, for this year. Was that just purely a function of more land kind of acquired in the most recent quarter? Were there any other changes as you looked at kind of that bucket of capitalized properties? Dean Shigenaga : No, I just \u2013 what has increased is the dollar basis on average days under qualifying activities, which could be construction, vertical construction or pre-construction which is entitlements. So we have more activity today than we did last year as an example. And that's I think apparent as you look at our disclosures for product beyond 2019 as an example. Dave Rodgers : Right. It is and I guess I was just thinking within the guidance that went up not necessarily versus last year, but in your own guidance. So I guess I was just trying to reconcile any changes \u2013 Dean Shigenaga : Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm sorry, Dave, you're right. In June \u2013 on June 20th, we filed an 8-K which highlighted an increase in our acquisition guidance. And a portion \u2013 a significant portion of that is future redevelopment and development opportunities. And that results in almost all those projects have qualifying activities that require capitalization of interests or guidance for cap interest went up at that point. And net interest went down, because there weren't any increases in interest costs anticipated. And just to round that out a little bit, Dave, we fund that with common equity, because that's non-income producing, there's no cash flows on the future development product. So that kind of helps you understand why there's no increase in interest cost, it\u2019s equity funded projects. Dave Rodgers : And you're capitalizing the average cost of debt, I assume so that's the change. Dean Shigenaga : I'm sorry? Dave Rodgers : Yeah, I get you, that\u2019s helpful. I appreciate that. And then maybe last question for Joel. Joel, I think in the last cycle you go back to kind of early 2000s you guys were very aggressive buying buildings, land redevelopment, et cetera. But I guess I was wondering aside from the balance sheet which hasn't been much improved from that point in time. Have you guys done anything different? Or is it really just a market that's cooperating this time versus last time kind of the market that sell out, if you will, for a couple years? Dean Shigenaga : Well, I think if you listen to the story, you would realize that Mission Bay took place in 2004-2005 and beyond where we shifted from single asset to a campus cluster strategy. We, in 2006, we moved Big Time [ph] into Cambridge with Tech Square and the entire Binney Street development of over 2 million square feet. And we won the RFP in New York. So the pivot in the days of 2004, \u201805 and \u201806 have vastly impacted our growth over the last number of years. And I think that the leveraging and the investment grade that we achieved in 2011 have significantly enhanced our balance sheet to where we are today, we believe we've got what people sometimes refer to as a fortress balance sheet and that has enabled us to continue to grow. I think there's nobody who has this kind of a unique business. So I think nothing is ever the same. If you look at some of the things that we've done and some of the approaches we've taken in each of the markets, I think they're pretty highly differentiated than where we were say even five years ago or 10 years ago. Dave Rodgers : Right, thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks. Joel Marcus : Exactly at 60 minutes, 1 o'clock and 4 o'clock on the East Coast. Thank you very much and we look forward to talking to you on the third quarter call. Be safe. Operator : Thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentations. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz with Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Paula Schwartz : Thank you and good afternoon. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws. The company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now I would like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel. Joel Marcus : Thank you, Paula. And welcome everybody to our third quarter call. And with me are Dean Shigenaga; Steve Richardson; Peter Moglia; and Dan Ryan. I'd like to start out by highlighting Alexandria's cluster markets remaining strong and vibrant and our first mover advantage is a huge competitive advantage to all the aspects of our business. Our high-quality cash flows are really based on best locations, best assets, best tenants in by far and away the best teams. When it comes to external growth, our disciplined allocation of capital to a visible highly leased value creation pipeline is highlighted pretty -- in pretty great detail in our supplement, you'll be able to see the pipeline we placed in service. But this quarter and recently the near-term growth of our annual net operating income and Dean will have a little bit of detail, it confuses a couple of people, but we didn't miss NOI -- any NOI numbers this quarter. We commenced development and redevelopment of a pretty significant pipeline, which is also detailed and we were successful on our leasing of development and redevelopment space. And Steve, and Peter and Dean will highlight all of that, when it comes to the Mercer Mega Block, which I think the team will highlight, I just want to say, we won that really irreplaceable development opportunity because there is no other group with 20 years or more experience on the ground with the expertise and the experience, we really have in South Lake Union and I think it's pretty obvious that our team completely understands the integration of that kind of the development with the community today. There is no longer opportunities just to simply build a great asset, you have to be able to build with not only your tenants in mind, but really a great impact and integration with the communities in which we work and live in play. And Steve will talk in some detail about 88 Bluxome and again we won that because, and we've gotten approvals, because we're a trusted partner with the city of San Francisco. It's important to remember, we have an industry-leading high quality tenant roster 53% of our annual revenues are investment grade and our average lease term today is over eight years. A couple of comments about industry fundamentals, which continue to maintain themselves a strong and vibrant. The biggest cost driver of the healthcare system today is chronic disease and there are a bunch of them. And patients in the categories of chronic disease account for a whopping 85% to 90% of all healthcare spending and collectively those diseases are the leading cause of death and disability in the United States. So this industry the biopharma industry as a huge opportunity to impact and make great cost savings, when it comes to chronic disease. When it comes to diagnose -- diagnosis studies in high-income countries show that treatment costs for early diagnosis of patients generally are two times to four times less expensive than treating those diagnosed with advanced stage cancer is a good example. So again another great opportunity for this industry to impact with the cost of healthcare. The industry itself; venture capital continues to be robust with over $19 billion raised in the first three quarters and over two thirds of those flowing into Alexandria cluster markets. Public markets on the other hand are becoming more selective and risk adverse, making it more difficult for both life science and tech companies to go public. Despite these five life science companies and seven tech companies were able to go public. This past quarter raising $0.5 billion and $3.5 billion respectively. Obviously, part of that is due to some of the Unicorn challenges that we've seen trying to go IPO. The third quarter was an active quarter at the FDA with 13 new drug approvals, five of which were received by Alexandria tenants. There was an interesting quote in the Atlantic which did -- a good article featured a good article on is this tech world today in any way, shape or form like the tech bubble of the 2000, 2001 era and I thought I'd just leave or give you a quote. The problem with tech today in so much software will beat the world, bet that most of the celebrated unicorns weren't actually software companies. What we're seeing today is in the.com bubble if anything, it's a non.com bubble. A period have inflated expectations for companies that had no real business being valued like pure tech companies in the first place. And then finally on market fundamentals, they continue to remain strong and vibrant the team will talk about that and it's comforting to know that virtually almost 80% of our annual rental revenue is from Class A assets and our AAA campuses in our best cluster locations. So tenant demand and our leasing continues to be very solid. And with that kind of opening let me ask Steve to comment on the quarter. Steve Richardson : Thank you, Joel. Steve Richardson here. Alexandria's best-in-class franchise and fully integrated high performance team has put a number of truly noteworthy accomplishments on the board during the past quarter and I'll highlight just a couple. As Joel had mentioned, -- the City of Seattle selected Alexandria as its partner of choice to develop approximately 800,000 Square feet at one of the highest-profile sites in the entire city, the Mercer Mega Block. This was undoubtedly a highly competitive process and speaks volume to the national recognition Alexandria has achieved for its distinctive urban science and technology campus platform. Stanford University also selected Alexandria at its partner of choice to redevelop approximately 92,0000 square feet in the life science district of the Stanford Research Park, establishing a flagship destination to accelerate and really invigorate Stanford's life science cluster. And finally, as Joel had referenced as well. We are very pleased to receive our entire Prop M allocation at 88 Bluxome anchored there with a very exciting company Pinterest. Our team is really not only able to identify and execute upon the high quality growth opportunities and its clusters on the open market. But importantly able to bring our strong brand and multifaceted resources to bear in partnership with generational institutions like Stanford University, City governments like Seattle and others to advance mutually desirable and purposeful economic and societal goals. I'll just hit on a couple of broad companywide metrics. to really highlight the strong core results in our operating Urban campuses with really a theme and an emphasis on the continued positive momentum in the market. We had 1.2 million square feet of leasing this quarter and 3.3 million square feet year to date, which places us on track near the 10-year average at the Q3 mark. Q3, at 11.2% cash and 27.9% GAAP increases, and importantly here the drivers were across a number of regions; San Francisco, Greater Boston, Seattle, San Diego and Maryland. Year-to-date 16.2% cash and 30.6% GAAP increases. I think it's important to take a step back. When you look at these type of increases, we've averaged 25.4% GAAP and 13% cash over the past five years since 2015, a truly remarkable stat. A sense of urgency continues with our year-to-date Q3 2019 leasing, comprising 69% in early renewals. Our guidance for GAAP increases initially at 26.5% at Investor Day during late 2018 is now at 29.5%. We've increased this each quarter. Our guidance on same property was 2% at Investor Day. We've now increased to 2.5% this quarter, which is a big impact on the revenue base, we have today and being driven by rental rate increases not occupancy gains. The mark-to-market is now at 20.1% on a GAAP basis, the highest level in recent quarters. And finally, we're extremely well positioned moving forward into the future with the lease expirations of just 1.1% for the balance of the year, 6.6% in 2020 and 5.8% in 2021. In conclusion, a big shout out to the Alexandria team for a great quarter. And with that, I'll hand it off to Peter. Peter Moglia : Thank you. Steve. I'm going to spend the next few minutes updating you on our near-term pipeline. Our acquisition of the Mega Block in Seattle, briefly touch on our partial interest sales and a highlight of material move in our NAV per a new methodology rolled out by Green Street. So by reading the press release, I'm sure you are immediately informed about how busy we have been and the delivery of development and redevelopment projects is no exception. During the third quarter, we placed a noteworthy 1,261,419 Square feet into service from six different projects in six different submarkets. And year-to-date we have leased 1.2 million square feet of development and redevelopment space highlighting the strong demand present in all of our markets. At 399 Binney Street the commercial space is now 100% leased. And our final cash stabilized yield of 7.3% is 10 basis points higher than what we reported last quarter, and significantly above our acquisition underwriting which demonstrates our disciplined approach to underwriting and managing complex projects. We also completed 279 East Grand in South San Francisco delivering the last 35,797 square feet in this project anchored by Alphabet's Life Science subsidiary Verily. We delivered another 39,372 square feet at 188 East Blaine, our new flagship property on Lake Union in Seattle and we made significant leasing progress at that project during this quarter. 30,900 square feet was delivered at Phase 1 of the Alexandria Center for AgTech, our class A highly differentiated multi-tenant project in the Research Triangle market and rounding out the high -- the highly active quarter was the delivery of two significant San Francisco Bay developments held an unconsolidated joint ventures 593,765 square feet at 1655 and 1725 Third Street Mission Bay, delivered under long-term lease to Uber and 520,988 square feet was delivered under long-term lease to Facebook in the Greater Stanford market. Before I move on, I'd be remiss and updating you on our development, so that congratulating the real estate development team and all the business units here at Alexandria that support it for being named NAIOP's 2019 Developer of the Year. Through its prestigious National Awards program NAIOP annually honors the development company that best exemplifies leadership and innovation. Alexandria was chosen from an impressive slate of nominees and was evaluated by a team of seasoned developers on the following criteria. The outstanding quality of projects and services, financial consistency and stability, ability to adapt to market conditions, active support of the industry through NAIOP and support for the local community. Now Joel and Steve have already mentioned the award that we got for the Mega Block and why I'll just give you a few details about it. Our planned approximately 800,000 square foot commercial project will be a premier multi-use campus located at the intersection of Dexter Avenue North and Mercer Street in South Lake Union. The purchase price of $143 million fully allocated to the commercial space results in our price per FAR foot of approximately $179, which is in line with the most recent land trade in South Lake Union and reflects the current market rental rates in the area. At closing, the project will combine with current development pipeline asset 601 and 701 Dexter to form the nucleus of an unparalleled assemblage of $1.2 million developable square feet in the heart of the Lake Union submarket. Moving on to asset sales, we concluded our partial interest sales program for the year by selling a 49% interest in the alumina Campus in the UTC submarket of San Diego to a new high-quality institutional partner and by selling a 90% interest in 500 Forbes Boulevard in South Francisco to one of our existing high quality institutional partners. The cap rate for the alumina campus of 4.7% reflects current NOI, which does include free rent. But the buyer was given credit for all remaining free rent against the purchase price. The cap rate for 500 Forbes was 4% and reflects the high desirability of the South San Francisco market at this time. I'm going to wrap up my commentary by noting that Green Street published a REIT valuation report on October 15 titled, A big change in our pricing model where they discuss the replacement of NAV with Intrinsic NAV as the most important determinant of warrants and share price. The report noted that there is support for our NAV being 31% higher under that methodology and we encourage all of our investors to read it. With that I'll pass it on to Dean. Dean Shigenaga : Thanks Peter, Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll cover four key topics today, including the third quarter results and continued strong cash flows from internal and external growth, continued execution of long-term capital to fund strategic growth initiatives and further improvement in our already solid balance sheet and an update on our corporate responsibility business vertical. And lastly, an update on our 2019 guidance. Total revenues for the third quarter were $380.5 million or $1.6 billion annualized and really was up significantly about 14.2% over the third quarter of 2018, reflecting continued and outstanding execution by our best-in-class team. We continue to generate solid cash flows from a high-quality tenant roster, with 53% of annual rental revenue from investment grade rated or publicly traded large cap companies. Core operating metrics remain very strong. NOI was on track with our expectations. As a reminder, 88% of the 1.3 million rentable square feet of value creation deliveries in the third quarter related to unconsolidated joint ventures. The related earnings from these JVs is classified in equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. NOI from the unconsolidated JVs for the third quarter was $5.7 million, up $3.2 million over the second quarter of '19 and please refer to page 44 of our supplemental package for additional information. Our adjusted EBITDA margin continues to remain near the top of margins in the REIT industry at approximately 68% for the third quarter. The margin should increase to 69% next quarter and the temporary decline in the current quarter was driven primarily by seasonality with higher utility expenses, related to both higher rates and consumption due to the warmer summer weather. This resulted in higher recoverable expenses, but also a larger pool of operating expenses, which results in a minor decline in adjusted EBITDA margins. Same property NOI growth for the nine months ended the third quarter of '19 was solid and up 3.3% and 8.1% on a cash basis as compared to the nine months ended the third quarter of '18. And our same property NOI growth outlook for the full year of 2019 remains very solid. Our outlook for year-end occupancy also remained solid at 97% at the midpoint of our range of guidance. Occupancy as of September 30 of 96.6% reflects slightly -- temporary decline in occupancy. As we have been reporting for many quarters now, 117,000 rentable square feet square foot lease expired in the third quarter at 3545 Cray Court in San Diego. Our team commence renovations and we have 55% of the space already leased. Additionally, some of our operating properties that we acquired this year has vacancy representing lease-up opportunities that will drive growth in occupancy and cash flows. G&A expenses remained consistent and solid as a percentage of net operating income, third quarter of '19 was approximately 10% of NOI, which is consistent with our five year average and really solid relative to other office REITs. Turning to our venture investments in the third quarter, we recognized realized gains and losses. Really, we had realized gains of $14.1 million impairments of $7.1 million net into a net realized gain of about $7 million for the quarter. The write downs is really related to three privately held investments. We also recognized $70 million of unrealized losses. Now importantly through Friday, October 25 unrealized gains were up just in the 25 days, $27.1 million related to our publicly traded non-real estate investments. Now as a reminder; Warren Buffett has stated in his two most recent annual shareholder letters that he expects unrealized gains from investments to generate over $10 billion in swings in earnings every quarter and sometimes more than $2 billion in a single day. We have invested in companies that we believe will generate solid return on our investment. And while we hold these investments, we will have volatility in earnings from unrealized gains. Moving onto our balance sheet; our team just continue to execute on long-term capital to fund strategic growth. As you've noted, our weighted average remaining term of debt's now 10.7 years and this is up significantly from 5.9 years at the beginning of this year and it now exceeds the solid weighted average remaining term of our leases of 8.3 years. Our term loan was repaid in full in the quarter. We now have no interest rate swaps outstanding and we have no consolidated debt maturities until 2023. We have about $3.5 billion of liquidity, including about $1 billion in related to forward equity sales contracts that we expect to settle later this year. It's important to highlight how we have utilized our line of credit; we use our line of credit for funding really between execution of long-term capital and strategically and each year with very limited balances outstanding. On average our outstanding balance at the end of every year going back a few years now under our line of credit has been approximately $95 million. I want to touch on key highlights from our two bond deals in the third quarter which is disclosed on the Page 3 of our press release, it was really quick and opportunistic execution as interest rates declined. Our aggregate issuance of $1.85 billion was done at a weighted average effective rate of 3.51% and an amazing term of almost 19 years, this truly awesome execution by our team here and thank you, guys. This included the reopening in September of our 30-year bond that priced at a yield to investors of an amazing 3.5%. We repaid $1.65 billion of debt at a weighted average rate of 3.73% and a term of 2.9 years, which was through a tender of our 2020 and 2022 bonds and repayment of our unsecured term loan. Now, it's important to recognize that while the weighted average interest rate was lower for the new debt issuance. We raised $190 million of additional debt for the future, resulting in a slight increase in recurring annual interest of approximately $3 million. Now, in connection with both the tender and the repayment of our term loan we recognize a loss on early extinguishment of debt of about $40.2 million and a loss on the termination of interest rate swap agreements of $1.7 million. In October, we exercised our right to convert, the remaining outstanding Series D Convertible Preferred Stock with a book value of $57.5 million in the common. And in September we added a $750 million commercial paper program, which is backstopped by our line of credit and this will replace a portion of our short-term borrowings available under our line of credit. And we began first using this program in October. So in summary, our balance sheet is even stronger. We continue to focus on long-term capital to fund growth. Short-term borrowings on our line of credit and our commercial paper program will be used in a disciplined manner as we strategically focus on long-term capital to fund our business and minimize short-term debt outstanding at the end of each year. As a mission-driven urban office REIT focused on making a positive and lasting impact on the communities in which we work and live in the world, we are honored to highlight our team's achievement of the highest rating from GRESB our five-star rating. Our team also continue to focus on other important ESG initiatives including progress towards our 2025 goals. So, really focused on how we manage energy consumption, water usage, waste diversion, and carbon emissions. Turning to our guidance; we updated our guidance for 2019 EPS to a range of $1.83 to $1.85 and FFO per share diluted as adjusted to a range from $6.95 to $6.97 with no change in the midpoint of FFO per share as adjusted at $6.96. Please refer to Page 6 of our supplemental package for further details on our guidance assumptions for 2019. I just want to highlight a few very important key items. The guidance for rental rate increases, was really up 1% this quarter, up 3% in aggregate since our initial guidance on November 28 of 2018. These cumulative adjustments resulted in upward pressure on the midpoints of our guidance for same property net operating income and straight-line rent revenue resulting in increases to both midpoints by 0.5% and $4 million respectively this quarter. Additionally, since our initial 2019 guidance on November 28 the midpoint of our guidance for FFO per share as adjusted increased by $0.01. The upside of core operations generated in the current quarter was only a portion of the changes in our guidance and was offset by the slight increase in interest expense from our strategic and opportunistic bond offerings in the third quarter, again, with an average term of 18.5 years and included $190 million of extra debt capital. As a reminder, we unable to respond to detailed questions about 2020 guidance, until we issue our guidance along with the usual detailed underlying assumptions. With that let me turn it back to Joel. Joel Marcus : Operator, we can go to questions-and-answer, please. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Manny Korchman with Citi. Please go ahead. Manny Korchman : Hey, everyone, how are you? On the earnings call; Joel, you talked about Stripe moving to their new construction project was wondering where your conversations have been with Stripe's and say seeming will be coming out of your asset? Steve Richardson : Manny. Hi, it's Steve here. As you might imagine, we have ongoing discussions with all of our tenants and it was just the decision that they made they were looking at expansion opportunities in the near term. So decided to expand down in the South San Francisco market, and I think it's still TBD on what they'll do with 510 Townsend but it is truly one of the more iconic and probably highest quality buildings in San Francisco now. So either way we're in very good shape there. Joel Marcus : Yes. And I think the move is unique to that company. And so I think just keep that in mind. Manny Korchman : Joel, does that mean that you don't think that other companies will approach it from the same perspective that they're having a tough time growing and sort of San Francisco proper, and might have to look after their especially they want to keep one facility rather than have satellite offices? Joel Marcus : Yes, I think it's a more complicated issue we're under confidentiality and not able to share. But I think it's a one company situation that is just unique and the Collins and Brothers. Yes just made a decision, but that's all we could say about it. So I wouldn't take it as a trend suddenly that everybody in the City of San Francisco's heading to South City. Manny Korchman : Thanks for that. And then on the Mercer Mega Block. You guys several times refer to it as a win. I guess what was the city looking for in finding the right developer for that project or is there anything that you either have to be cognizant of or sort of target as you think about building and tenants in that project? Joel Marcus : Yes. So I think the, as I said, and I'll let Peter come in as well. I think one of the most important things and this is true of major urban cities today, certainly cities on the West Coast, that have a variety of impacts from, whether it'd be homelessness or other issues, I think cities today, we're looking more than a developer -- developing an iconic building for tenants. I think they are looking for and integration with the strategic desires of the city, when it comes to economic and social issues, and I think they're also looking for an integration with the community around as well. Peter, you can comment as well. Peter Moglia : Yes. Manny, it's Peter. They certainly did like our track record of creating ecosystems in New York, for example, the fact that we have the life science expertise, which is something, the city is interested in expanding. So all of the examples we've been able to point to as far as being able to build. Thriving cluster with amenities and other types of attractive features let them to choose us and move forward. So we're really proud of it. Manny Korchman : Thank you. Joel Marcus : And also, I want to promise that Peter would not go back and manage this Seattle region. Steve Richardson : There is a deed restriction. Operator : Our next question will come from Sheila McGrath with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Sheila McGrath : I guess, you have grown the cluster on the Stanford campus with some recent acquisitions this year and one this quarter. Just wondered if you could talk a little bit about your plans for building out that opportunity and is Stanford still a tenant in the building? Joel Marcus : Sheila, this is Joel. I'll let Steve comment on the particulars. But I think it's important to remember, Stanford has been the leader in that part of the world with iconic tech companies spinning out and certainly the old HP garage kind of model, and I think over the years there have been a number of major life science presences in that submarket that have actually departed and tech companies took over those spaces. So I'd say over the past number of years, maybe the last 10 years, there has been a net decrease of life science companies in that particular submarket and I think Stanford's desire is to maybe reignite and re-energize the life science industry there and I think that was one of their motivations, specifically on the property itself, we're not ready to kind of get into all the details of what we're doing but Steve could give you a high-level comment. Steve Richardson : Yes. Hi Sheila, it's Steve. No, we're really enthusiastic to be engaged with Stanford. We've been in the Research Park for 20 years. So, to continue to build out this life science district and then really when you look at the Greater Stanford area. There has been no new Class A product delivered there in 20 years. So, as Peter highlighted, we're making very good progress on the pipeline there and uniquely with the intersection of science and technology with Stanford's engineering background, it's just a wonderful cluster very vibrant and we look forward to working closely with them. Sheila McGrath : Okay, great. And then as a follow-up on the dispositions in San Diego in South San Francisco. Can you talk about the thought process on which assets you choose to monetize the interest level in that -- in those assets, and was the greater disposition number in guidance as a result of achieving better than expected pricing? Peter Moglia : Sheila, this is Peter. I'll let Dean finish the question on the amount, but the, what we look forward to when we're selling a property is where have we fully realized value for a great period of time and what is -- maybe more one-off, although we don't really have a lot of one-off things anymore, but what is not necessarily part of an integrated campus in these two assets kind of illustrate that, the alumina campuses well leased for another 12 years. There's really nothing else we can do outside of developing the last Building 7 which is an important thing that we're looking to do down the road, but we were able to raise quite of a -- lot of capital from that one transaction and the percentage of upside to the amount of proceeds we got that we gave away it was minor. For 500 Forbes, it is in a great market that it has a lot of investor interest, but it is not necessarily close to a number of our assets along East Grand or other -- here [ph] addresses that we hold their Gateway, for example, a number of buildings that we hold there. So we looked at that and said, great location, but not necessarily integrated into our two campuses there. So it was a good one for us to do a partial interest sale. And of course we the word partial is. is important. We still own big, big chunk of the alumina campus and a minor position in 500 Forbes, and we'll continue to manage those assets and hold on to them for the long term. Dean Shigenaga : Sheila, it's Dean here. I believe our initial guidance for dispositions this year started out fairly meaningful is probably close to $750 million, at least looking back to the end of '18. So we did end up with a little bit more capital on that front. I think we're getting close to a little over $900 million by the time we finish this year. So that additional capital discipline to funding broadly our needs this year. Most of that, as you know is going into construction, but we did have a fairly robust acquisition deal flow this year as well. Sheila McGrath : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, please go ahead. Jamie Feldman : Great, thank you. I guess just sticking with the investment market. Can you talk more about the appetite from buyers across all the markets? And then what do you think in terms of cap rates or cap rate compression? Peter Moglia : Jamie, it's Peter. Yes, it's obvious if it is open up a story in any of the markets that we're in and it's headlining with life science is being something people are interested in or raising money to invest in. So there is a very robust market for acquisitions and not a lot of things have traded, but for example, there was a portfolio of B assets that came to the market in Research Triangle Park in that set it pretty good GAAP rate comp for that market and it up in sub-6, which was well below or anyone had anticipated but illustrates the appetite for the asset class. So what was the other part of that question? [Indiscernible] cap rate sorry, yes... Jamie Feldman : Yes, cap rates. Peter Moglia : I just said, cap rates just nationally on the office side, have not moved in a number of quarters. If you read the different publications from Real Capital Analytics and others that track these things in detail. Even with interest rates going down recently, but also going up last year fairly remain the same. And I'd say there is really no difference in the cap rates for lab, they also have been very stable over the last two years to three years. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then I guess just maybe just to take a step back. The legislative environment, anything that you guys are watching or investors need to be watching that's either more or less risk than the last time we discussed it. The device I mean, you brought it up or it was discussed on the last conference call, just what do you kind of watching out the, what are you watching on the road ahead that is most concerning to you? Joel Marcus : So, Jamie. Well, everybody is watching Washington for almost everything that happens and there is generally nothing happening, it's all talk and no do, but it's pretty clear that both the Democrats and Republicans would like to have going into election year some win in the area of broadly they call it drug pricing. But my own view is, it's more like healthcare costs because drug pricing is 10% -- 12% of the pie. And so you can't really impact healthcare cost by trying to impact 10% to 12% only you've really got to have a much bigger stroke. And as you know, it's a complicated chain you've got manufactures, you've got middleman, you've got the insurance companies. You've got users, -- why drugs have or therapies better said get more notice is when you go to a hospital you have surgery you come out $100,000 bill and you don't look at it, because everything is covered assuming you have insurance, but you may get a bill for $1,000, $2,000 somewhat dollars for pharmaceuticals that you took and you wonder why the heck am I my paying so much when you spent 100 times more than that on or the insurance covered it. So, somehow, they're trying to figure it out. I don't think anybody has an easy fix, there's things that are being talked about it tweak Medicare and I've talked about those on past calls, but at the moment I would say, we don't see anything dramatic happening on the horizon at the moment, but clearly watching carefully. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then finally, given your commentary on unicorns and what's going on in the private equity market and IPO markets, what's your appetite to put fresh capital to work in your investment portfolio. Have you slowed that at all or do you expect to? Joel Marcus : Well, we don't have any target investment amounts, we're opportunistic. Day-to-day, week-to-week, month to month, quarter to quarter. So, and we certainly are trying to harvest gains and recycle capital where we see it. I think to some extent we've been pretty cautious for a good part of the year because of valuations. I was in one meeting personally being pinched by an Investor actually SoftBank was a lead investor in this deal and the valuation was approaching $1 billion and we thank them for the meeting and passed on. So we've been very disciplined and very careful about what we do and how we do it. I think if the market declines. Actually that's a better time to invest and that a peak. So you kind of have to be agile, disciplined. I think that's the word. I think we always try to use both on the real estate side and on the investment side we try to maintain great discipline in what we do. Jamie Feldman : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Michael Carroll : Yes, thanks. The company has done a pretty good job I guess sourcing future development projects and it looks like there is three sizable projects currently in the pipeline to be acquired in San Diego, San Francisco and Seattle. Can you discuss how management thinks about the timeline of these types of deals and is there a limit to how big you want to have the land bank? Joel Marcus : I think we would not want to comment on deals in process, either what they are and the timing on that, but I will ask Dean to comment on the land bank because that's clearly an issue that we hold near and dear to our hearts and having been through the 2008-2009 really market crash. It's certainly important that where we try to be and there, we held a lot of land way more than we do today, but we were disciplined about not disposing of it in Mission Bay and then in Cambridge. But Dean can comment on kind of how we think about targets. Dean Shigenaga : So, Michael. What we've done on Page 2 of the press release, given a bit of, bit of a breakdown of our land holdings as a percentage of gross real estate. So what is committed and under construction plus Bluxome which will be under construction hopefully soon represents about 7% of gross real estate and it's important to keep in mind, most all of that is vertical under construction, except for Bluxome, but we've made a lease commitment there and it's 64%, leased today, and then we also have land beyond that which I think is really where investors are probably focus because this is stuff that we haven't made a commitment to but represents the future growth opportunities and that's about 5% of gross investment in real estate. And so I think that's a modest number that we're carrying. And keep in mind much of what we're, we've talked about in the 7% bucket is targeted to be delivered by 2020 with the exception of Bluxome that will go beyond that. Peter Moglia : And this is Peter. I mean you should also realize or just look at our statistics; we've been delivering well over 1 million square feet per year into all of our submarkets, so we're not just buying space and or buying land and sitting on it. We're putting it to work pretty closely to after acquiring it, and as I mentioned on the comments like just year-to-date, we've already put -- we've already leased 1.2 million square feet of development space. So we're acquiring things, but we're putting it to work on this quickly as we're closing. Michael Carroll : Okay, great. And then Peter, can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment for I guess some of these, I guess acquisitions, just in general how has that changed over the past few years? Are you seeing the same type of players and have you seen pricing kind of increase some of these attractive land sites? Peter Moglia : I think pricing is just a function of real estate in general, lab space is certainly attractive, but all asset types outside of retail have been gaining significant value and I think we're just along for the same, right? There are few more buyers in the [indiscernible] for things that are stabilized, but a lot of the same people are still are still there. And as you can see despite the activity that we've published in his report. We're coming out ahead in many of these bids. Michael Carroll : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Please go ahead. Richard Anderson : Thanks, good afternoon. So, you touched on this in your comments but the third quarter, releasing spreads kind of brought down the average from a year-to-date perspective. Still in same growth. But I'm curious, is it fair to say that 30-ish type GAAP spreads for the long term is not something that investors and analysts should be thinking of or when you look, line of sight into what you have in front of you, including early renewals that growth of that order of magnitude, not to give us guidance is something that isn't sort of off the table or starting to sort of wither ? Dean Shigenaga : Rich, it's Dean here. If you look back at Page 21 of our supplemental, you do have two quarter and three quarter years' worth of historical information on rental rate growth on leasing activity. I'll just rattle out some stats. But the GAAP numbers are 24% to 30% and the cash numbers anywhere from high 12% up to 16%. So that may be a little bit of a barometer for range it's all healthy extremely healthy. Even the stats that we published for the quarter. So you're talking about a different mix of leases, leases that are being executed every period and every year. So, I think is being able to address a healthy real estate environment like we have in front of us, should give us some solid rental rate growth as we think about the future, but I can't tell you today, it's too early to predict on guidance. Rich, so stay tuned for our Investor Day for 2020. Peter Moglia : Yes, and okay. And I'd also say to Rich, I was actually at an investor meeting yesterday and one of the kind of leading investors I won't name him but talked about the macro environment going forward and created a range that if a progressive on the Democratic side one versus a Trump re-election that the market could swing literally 50%. So, down 30% and maybe up 10%, 15% or 20% on just policies obviously depends a lot on how Congress would shape up from the House and the Senate. But I think that we're all subject to that fluctuation or that kind of mindset going forward into 2020. So that's not specific to us, in particular. So if it turns out, predictions or whatever happens turned out to be positive, then that's going to be a lot more positive for our business and if turns out to be negative will be negative for our business. So I think that's a factor that is way beyond our control, for sure. Richard Anderson : Sure, no problem. Thank you for that. And another sort of kind of recurring theme is the early renewal element to your leasing activity 69% this quarter, but you've really been into the future expiration schedule. I think something like 12% expiring in '20 and '21 combined. To that end, is there a finiteness to the quote unquote pipeline of early renewal activity in your mind, or can it extend well beyond '21 into '22 and forward such that the early renewal activity will continue for some time to come? Joel Marcus : Yes, I think, I mean, my own view is, and I'll let these guys comment is not only early renewals but movement growth of companies where somebody leaves, I mean Stripe might be a good example and unexpected move by somebody. And then the backfilling of that space, if they do give it up. Don't know if they will or not. Steve's comment on that. But so there are a number of situations that continue to come up, one happened yesterday that we got word of in Greater Boston and somebody wanting to do something kind of unexpected. But at the end of the day, you say, wow. If we have that space back or could share rent on that space. It would be a big, a big plus because it's an older lease in place. So I think those things still permeate throughout the asset base. Dean Shigenaga : Richard, it's Dean here. You're right that the volume on early renewals as a percentage of our leasing activity has been very high, but it's been high for a number of years. So I think given real estate fundamentals just a lack of general supply in the markets in our tenants needing to continue to grow, you should probably continue to see healthy renewal rates as a percentage of leasing activity. Our volume in expirations are relatively light 5% a year for the next few years, but we still have tremendous early renewals that will drive leasing velocity on top of that. Richard Anderson : Okay, great. And then quickly Dean for you, just so I have the model right all the forward equity taken down in the fourth quarter and zero preferred dividends? Dean Shigenaga : We just had a little bit of dividends due through the closing of Series D in October and then it goes away after that and the bulk of forward I think the question came up last quarter settles in 4Q. I'm sure we have a little bit coming in 3Q as well. Richard Anderson : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions in the question queue. This will conclude the question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Marcus for any closing remarks. Joel Marcus : Okay, thank you very much everybody and we look forward to talking to you on fourth quarter and year-end. Take care. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Alexandria Real Estate Equities Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2019 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. Paula Schwartz : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel. Joel Marcus : Thank you, Paula, and welcome, everybody, to the fourth quarter and year-end 2019 conference call. And with me today are Dean Shigenaga, Steve Richardson and Peter Moglia. We'd like to thank, first of all, most importantly, to each and every single member of the Alexandria family from the bottom of our hearts for a stellar execution of our 2019 business plan, a real granular day-by-day execution with the highest level of operational excellence. We're very, very proud. As we celebrated our 25th anniversary in 2019 from our founding, we also achieved and passed the $25 billion total market cap level for which we're also very proud. And we're proud to announce, as you see today, the highest leasing activity in the history of the company with so many companies actually seeking Alexandria campuses, not just space anywhere. The highest rental rate increases in 10 years in the best -- are really driven by the best in locations and our assets, which have really driven that success. And our operating margins have really been outstanding, and they're really driven by judicious management of our unique business plan. So thank you, everybody, for that. When we look at the industry, there's continued bipartisan support for NIH funding, which has remained strong. Congress has provided an additional $2.6 billion for Fiscal Year '20 budget, totaling almost $42 billion. And this marks the fifth consecutive year, congress has provided the NIH with a multibillion-dollar increase. In 2019, there were 48 new therapies approved by the FDA, another historically strong year for bringing new novel therapies to patients, importantly -- most importantly. Several new therapies approved in 2019 included innovative modalities against novel targets and for diseases which have long-needed treatments, such as sickle cell disease and postpartum depression. And we're proud to say that in 2019, Alexandria received 52% its tenants of the FDA new approvals. And of all those approvals, about 1/4 were cancer related and 1/4 were central nervous system related. Total life science venture investment continued strong at about $26 billion for 2019, the second-highest record over the past decade. And despite market volatility in 2019, capital continued to flow to public markets. In 2019, $5.5 billion was raised across 48 biopharma IPOs on United States exchanges, and 84% of that amount raised was in Alexandria cluster markets. Let me turn for a moment to the coronavirus. On January 30, the WHO declared China's novel coronavirus a global health emergency, and some of Alexandria's most important tenants are already working with the NIH on vaccines and hopes are that a vaccine will be ready for human trials by as early as April. In the interim, U.S. drug makers are donating large amounts of antiviral medicines in the interim that may help in the fighting of the virus. And as many of you know, some experts predict there may be as much as a 2% decrease in China's GDP due to this viral -- due to this virus. Moving over to -- briefly to policy. There's been an increased focus on both drug pricing and FTC review of M&A that has caught the attention of both private and public market investors, as they work to understand how this may impact valuations and interest in innovation by biopharma, and reevaluate which types of companies are primed for success in both the current and/or potential future environments. However, these issues have not led to a substantial change in the capital available to fund innovative life science companies, and M&A continues to be active with multiple deals announced at the end of 2019 and in the first month of 2020. And it's likely that when you look at -- there are now 4 bills in congress that are pretty much stuck relating to some focus -- give or take, the focus on drug pricing. But it's questionable, given that we're in a major election year whether these will ever see the light of day. And then finally, the Trump administration, in its own policy, is interested in potentially tying what Medicare pays for physician-administered drugs to a basket of economically similar products in other countries, a basket of countries. And under such a proposal, Medicare would pay 126% of the average price paid in these countries. But I think it's fair to say it's a long way away. The White House is still reviewing a draft of the proposal. And once it's public, supporters and opponents have time to make their case before the administration long before it will be finalized. And even then, the idea will only likely be a temporary pilot program. Remember, too, that Medicare basically covers about 1/3 of the U.S. population. So with that, let me turn it over to Steve for some granular details on the quarter and the year. Stephen A. Richardson: Thank you, Joel. Alexandria is continuing clear leadership as a partner to the broad life science industry and a premier developer of world-class science and technology campuses, is driving exceptional performance as evidenced by the highest annual leasing volume in its history of 5.1 million square feet and the highest leasing spreads during the past 10 years of 32.2% on a GAAP basis. It's important to take a step back as we start a new decade and assess what is driving this outperformance. One, our talented people across the entire company and a strong culture of meritocracy; and two, the strategy that we emphasized at a recent Investor Day. The ongoing creation and curation of unique mega campuses in the country's strongest innovation clusters. We are very well positioned for robust future growth with compelling mega campuses in each of our clusters. Peter will cover in detail the recent acquisitions that have added to these campuses, and the following high-level summary provides a clear framework for this high-quality growth opportunity. In Greater Boston, Arsenal on the Charles; in New York City, we are advancing the third tower negotiations with the city. In Maryland, the Shady Grove build-to-suits in a new large land parcel; in Research Triangle Park, the Research Drive and Davis Drive campuses. In Seattle, the Mercer Mega Block anchoring our dominant position along the Eastern portion of South Lake Union; and in San Diego, the San Diego Tech Center in Sorrento Mesa. And to present a particular highlight today the very creative and compelling joint venture with Boston Properties in South San Francisco. The campus totals 29.3 acres. Alexandria has contributed 313,000 square feet of operating properties comprised of a Class A lab facility, an office building and a state-of-the-art net 0 mass timber amenity building with conferencing and a cafe anchored with tenancy from the California Life Sciences Association. Boston Properties has contributed 775,000 square feet in 3 office buildings. The existing facilities will eventually be on an approximate 50-50 basis and new development on a 51-49 basis. We jointly have the ability to unlock tremendous value on this site with the ability to develop 3 ground-up Class A facilities, totaling 637,000 square feet and redevelop one of the Boston Properties office buildings. So that approximately 50% of the campus offers value-creation opportunities over time and a ultimate transformation to a high-quality laboratory Mega campus. The site is really destined to become the premier life science location in South San Francisco as it features walking distance to the Caltrain, which is undergoing a substantial renovation and upgrade, a reimagined master-planned and a unique amenity building that will be a magnet for the life science industry. Alexandria and Boston Properties share a high regard and mutual respect for one another's teams and accomplishments and collectively, we are very enthusiastic about the future of the campus as we co-develop, with Alexandria as the lead developer, a highly amenitized mega campus featuring a total of 1.7 million square feet at completion. On a separate note, the Proposition E in San Francisco will be -- we expect to be passed during the upcoming March election. Prop E will essentially provide yet another barrier to entry for development as it ties the allocation of Prop M office entitlements to the city's ability to deliver its state of California mandated requirements for affordable housing. The Prop M allocation of 875,000 square feet or approximately 1% of the entire city's office inventory could thus become further constrained and reduced. We are monitoring this ballot measure closely and anticipate its passage will make existing and entitled campuses even more desirable and valuable. Broad company-wide metrics include, again, 5.1 million square feet leased during 2019, the highest in the company's history. 2019 rental rate increases of 17.6% cash and 32.2% GAAP, the highest during the past 10 years. On a mark-to-market basis across all regions, we're at about 17.1% on a GAAP basis. And finally, and importantly, a sense of urgency continues in the marketplace, as nearly 3/4 of our leases in 2019 were early renewals. Alexandria's strategy, the team and strong brand is positioning the company well for sustainable growth in each of our markets. I'll hand it off to Peter. Peter M. Moglia: Thank you, Steve. I'm going to spend the next few minutes updating you on our fourth quarter deliveries, 88 Bluxome, the Mercer Mega Block and 15 Necco progress, give an update on construction costs and then given recent activity, highlight a couple of major acquisitions that occurred in the fourth quarter and one that closed in January. So as for developments, 2019 was a very busy year in many respects, but especially on the development and redevelopment front as we delivered over 2 million square feet at average initial yields of 7.4% on a GAAP and 6.9% on a cash basis. The fourth quarter deliveries were light relative to the first 3 quarters at 131,000 square feet, but we closed out 5 projects during the quarter and ended the year with all 11 projects spanning 9 submarkets at 95% occupancy or higher, illustrating the strong demand present in all of our markets. Given the significant interest in 88 Bluxome in the SoMa submarket of San Francisco, the Mercer Mega Block in Seattle and 15 Necco in the Seaport area of Boston, we wanted to provide a brief update on those 3. As many of you know, the Bay Area's team -- the Bay Area team's significant community and municipal engagement resulted in our 88 Bluxome project receiving Prop M allocation on the entire project, as opposed to approval in phases as other developers received. We are pleased to report that we are now fully entitled as all challenge periods have expired and the Central SoMa plan litigation has been resolved. We expect to receive a permit for demolition and our site work in May, and we expect to commence those activities in the summer once certain required off-site work is completed. As you likely know, the [indiscernible] or the 1,070,000 square foot project is 46% leased to Pinterest and 58% leased overall. The status on the Mercer Mega Block is that we're negotiating a prospective purchaser consent decree with the Department of Oncology that essentially will cap our environmental liability and that should be resolved by year-end, and we should close shortly thereafter. Concurrently, we're preparing drawings for early design guidance and submittal of a master use permit shortly after closing, which will perfect the entitlement to that project. We're -- as far as 15 Necco goes, we're redesigning the building to be a lab-ready shell, and it is currently in for review with the Boston Planning and Development Agency. We expect the entitlements to be complete and have a permit to break ground in the first quarter of next year. The location has been very well received by tenants in the market, and we've had preliminary discussions with a few of them. Moving on to construction cost. Given our proclivity for value-add activities, our underwriting process includes rigorous periodic updates of construction cost trends. The effective tariffs have been a constant theme in many of our investor meetings. And by and large, we've been able to manage through them by engaging our contractors early and leveraging our deep relationships with them to achieve the best pricing for steel and aluminum, have buyout and cover any unexpected spikes with contingency. Despite recent positive developments in the trade war, we remain cautious and conservative in our underwriting of cost as manufacturers are quick to point out, pricing is subject to change based on trade negotiations. Our latest analysis, which we get directly from our contractors, indicates that the national average for escalations remains in the 5% range, which is consistent with 2019 and recent years. Most of our major contracting partners across our markets anticipate slowing towards the end of 2020 and into '21 and '22, which could ease pressure on pricing. Most of the pressure on pricing is attributed to skilled labor shortages. Although the construction industry continues to add jobs, most of the additions have been unskilled laborers, increasing the productivity gap, which has led to above-market pay scales for skilled workers and overtime to staff projects. The projected slowdown would mitigate this. Moving on to acquisitions. As you know, we executed a secondary offering in January, and use of proceeds includes funding a number of strategic acquisitions. Approximately $956 million of these were completed in the fourth quarter of '19 and include the following. Arsenal on the Charles, which was disclosed at Investor Day, is located in Watertown, an inner suburb of Cambridge and closed December 17 at a purchase price of $525.5 million. This acquisition is a terrific example of our focus on value-add investments. Upon full development, we contemplate a 12-building campus, containing 1,035,000 square feet that will provide unprecedented scale in Cambridge's inner suburbs. 3825 and 3875 Fabian Way closed in December at a purchase price of $291 million and is located in the Greater Stanford submarket of Palo Alto. This 478,000 square foot campus has been leased back to the seller and provides a similarly unique opportunity for Alexandria to achieve scale on a highly valued cluster location. The 598,000 square foot San Diego Tech Center will be rebranded as SD Tech by Alexandria and will ultimately be fully developed in phases into an approximately 1.3 million square foot life science and technology mega campus, which we own in a 50-50 joint venture. Although it's known as a premier technology campus in Sorrento Mesa, it has lost its luster in recent years and, therefore, offers us a great opportunity to leverage our redevelopment skills and long-term ownership horizon to create significant value through a thoughtful repositioning. In addition to the 4Q '19 acquisitions, we completed 3 transactions totaling a little over $341 million in January, and I'll briefly touch on one of those as well. 275 Grove Street, also known as Riverside Center, is a 510,000 square foot office project with terrific access to Cambridge and Boston via its adjacency to the Riverside Green Line Station and location at the nexus of the Route 128 and Mass Pike Interchange. It is also located in an area of the western suburbs where a considerable amount of executive talent resides. The project is in Newton, which is within 5 miles of our Waltham Cluster, and we see this acquisition as an extension of that. In addition to the transit advantages and proximity to decision makers, Riverside Center provides optionality to incrementally convert the building to lab over time. So with that, I'll pass the call over to Dean. Dean Shigenaga : Thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. As a mission-driven real estate company, we're very proud of our team's awesome execution of operating and financial results. Our team remains very focused on leadership in ESG, making a positive impact on society by executing in a thoughtful manner to minimize the impact that our business has on the environment and advancing human health, well-being and nutrition. During 2019, our team earned a 5-star rating and an A disclosure score from GRESB. We issued $550 million in green bonds with proceeds allocated to green eligible projects consisting of gold or platinum LEED-certified projects in addition to other bond issuances; continued the execution of our 2025 goals focused on how we manage carbon emissions, energy consumption, waste diversion and water usage; and then continued leadership in health and wellness. November was a really exciting time period for our employees as 59 of them finished the 26.2 mile New York City Marathon in support of raising important funds for mission-critical research at the Mountain (sic) [Memorial] Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Now this is pretty amazing since this was the first marathon for most of our runners. Our solid results highlight continued growth in high-quality cash flows, operational efficiency and several key REIT industry-leading statistics. Total revenues were $1.5 billion up 15.4% over 2018. Cash NOI was $1 billion for the fourth quarter annualized, and FFO per share as adjusted was right on track with our expectations at $177 million and $6.96 for the fourth quarter in 2019, respectively. High-quality cash flow growth was generated from one of the best tenant rosters in the REIT industry with 50% of our annual rental revenue from investment-grade or large-cap tenants. Same-property NOI growth was strong for 2019 at 3.1% and 7.1% on a cash basis. And as Peter had highlighted, in 2019, we delivered 2.1 million rentable square feet of development and redevelopment projects contributing to significant growth in rental and net operating income. Now occupancy came in very strong this quarter at 97.8% before consideration of vacancy in recently acquired properties. Now vacancy from these recently acquired properties reduced occupancy in the fourth quarter by 1%, and when combined with acquisitions we completed in January of 2020, will in aggregate, reduce occupancy in the first quarter by 2.4%. Now this vacancy is primarily related to San Diego Tech that was acquired in the fourth quarter and the consolidation of buildings, Boston Properties contributed to our joint venture with 27% vacancy. Now the important takeaway is that our occupancy across our core asset base remains very strong, and this vacancy represents opportunities to grow rental income and cash flows over the next 6 to 8 quarters. So please refer to the tabular disclosures at the bottom of Page 20 of our supplemental package for additional information. Now there has been recent attention on potential changes to property taxes for commercial real estate. Currently under Prop 13, commercial real estate in California is subject to property taxes that are assessed at 1% of the purchase price, subject to annual increases in fair market value capped at 2% and subject to assessment for new construction. Now it's really too early to tell if there will be changes in property taxes for commercial real estate in California, but a few key points to keep in mind. Alexandria has a very favorable lease structure with over 97% of our leases providing for the recovery of operating and major capital expenditures. Therefore, there would be a very insignificant amount that we would not recover from our tenants if our properties were assessed at fair value. Additionally, most of our properties are relatively new from ground-up development and redevelopment, and therefore, we believe we are in a better position than the average property in our core markets. Importantly, the life science industry is extremely focused on the benefit of proximity to other scientists and innovative entities in order to develop new and innovative therapies versus the nominal amount of rent they pay relative to their annual R&D budget. Now a couple of points on impairments. During the fourth quarter, we recognized impairments aggregating $10 million, primarily to reduce a portion of our cost basis in 2 privately held investments. We still expect to recover a significant portion of our original investment. One company is focused on neurodegenerative diseases, and the other is a clinical-stage company focused on novel enzyme targets. Importantly, our overall venture investments continue to generate significant value. Our disclosures this quarter highlighted recent value creation aggregating almost $500 million, consisting of over $400 million of unrealized gains as of December 31 and over $70 million of net realized gains over the last 2 years. Now on the real estate side, in the fourth quarter, we decided to commit to the sale of the only 2 legacy properties that we own in New Jersey and Florida, which resulted in impairment charges aggregating $12.3 million. We hope to sell these properties over the next 4 quarters. Now we remain on track with our disclosed goal of 5.2x for net debt to adjusted EBITDA by December 31, 2020. And we felt it was prudent to remain patient and execute our follow-on equity offering in early 2020 to fund 2 key acquisitions that were awarded and completed in December of 2019. Now as a result, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 0.4x higher than the 5.3x that we originally forecasted. It's really important, though, to highlight that our team deserves recognition for the achievement of our Baa1, BBB+ credit ratings, which ranks our credit profile at approximately the 90th percentile across 160 publicly traded REITS and this excludes mortgage REITS. Now one brief comment regarding our ATM program. We do expect to file a new at-the-market offering program in the first quarter here. On guidance, we have reaffirmed our 2020 guidance for EPS and FFO per shares adjusted at a midpoint of $2.22 and $7.38, respectively. And please refer to Page 7 of our supplemental package for detailed underlying assumptions included in our guidance. Let me turn it back over to Joel. Joel Marcus : Operator, you can open it up for question-and-answer, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Jamie Feldman of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. James Feldman : I guess, I just wanted to start on -- just thinking about the potential risk of excess supply in both South San Francisco and Boston Seaport. It seems like we've got several projects in the pipeline there. Can you just give us your latest thoughts on both those markets? Stephen A. Richardson: Jamie, it's Steve. Thank you for the question. We've talked about this for quite a while in South San Francisco, and I think we've been very pleased to see that the supply that's come on has been substantially absorbed. Kilroy with 650,000 square feet of Phase 1 is entirely leased, so that does not present a near-term opportunity. Blackstone now has resolved half of their 400,000 square foot building. So they just have 200,000 square feet available there. And then finally, HCP just has 65,000 square feet available in their project, a little further North in South San Francisco. So on an overall basis, that's very limited supply of available inventory. And we, in turn, feel like we're extremely well positioned with 201 Haskins. We've got 100,000 feet leased there and ongoing discussions for another big block of space. So as it may have been a concern and something we were watching closely a year ago, we're in very good shape. The future pipeline, I think, we'll take a look at that and continue to monitor that. But I think that will be metered over a number of years and that really present a big supply shock. Moving out to Seaport. There are probably 3 other projects that could compete with our Necco site, if you're looking for large blocks of space. Couple of them at about 200,000 square feet and another one at about 500,000 square feet. So again, you may have a future supply that's a number of years down the road, but nothing in the near or intermediate term that we're overly concerned about. But we're always monitoring this extremely closely. James Feldman : Okay. Can you talk about the demand pipeline for the Seaport? It does seem like there's several projects in the pipeline there beyond farther out as well. Stephen A. Richardson: Yes, I think as we look at the demand in the Cambridge market, it continues to stay healthy with 2.7 million square feet of lab demand. And when you start looking at a 2% vacancy in that market, we have discussed all along Seaport being a very strong natural outlet for that. So we are in early discussions with a very large tenant base that we have in our 3 mega campuses there in Cambridge. So we're very encouraged at a very early stage with the tenant interest in that site. Peter M. Moglia: And this is Peter, Jamie. I can just give you some color that, obviously, the Seaport is a major tech destination. There's a number of big tenants going in there. Amazon is making a huge move and will likely gobble up a lot more space when you talked about the concern over supply. But also, it's starting to gain a lot of traction with life science companies. Vertex, which is already there, is looking to expand in a fairly big way, and there's a couple -- Foundation Medicine has moved over there. And there's a couple of other tenants that we'll keep to ourselves that are interested in as well as Cambridge has very limited availability and people see Seaport as a great place to go in lieu of that. James Feldman : Okay. And then last for me. I mean if you think about your acquisitions done to date and the pending, I think -- it looks like you're pretty close to your full year target. So how do we think about -- how should we think about the potential that you go well above that target? And if so, how do you finance it? Dean Shigenaga : Well, Jamie, it's Dean here. I think what we found really interesting about the market today versus looking back several years ago is there is obviously a volume in the market, many deals of which we pass on. The other thing that's really interesting about the dynamics today, I would say that we're required to do diligence before we're even aware of being awarded as the winning bidder on a transaction. So I think what I'm trying to highlight is there is deal flow in the marketplace. We're very disciplined in what we choose to pursue. And there is a short fuse when it does come up as a winning opportunity. So we'll keep the market informed as we go through the year. As far as funding goes, whether it's construction, value-creation projects or future acquisitions, I think we'll remain as disciplined as we have been historically, Jamie. Today, we've got a bucket of equity to solve for. We solved a big chunk of it, and we have an amount to resolve for the rest of the year. But I think you'll find us disciplined and preserving our optionality as we look forward to solving the rest of our capital [ means ] for this year. James Feldman : Okay. How large is your noncore pipeline or noncore portfolio right now that you'd sell? Dean Shigenaga : I think the way to simply describe it, Jamie, is we always prune the bottom of the portfolio. There's always a couple of assets we're selling every year that don't even resonate to any meaningful capital. We did most of our heavy lifting back in 2012 and 2013 on the noncore side. Operator : And our next question will come from Tom Catherwood of BTIG. William Catherwood : Steve, at the opening, you mentioned kind of the role of Alexandria as a partner to life science industry. And then later, you mentioned the sense of urgency for your tenants across your markets, hence, the high leasing spreads and the early renewals. How do you balance this kind of almost dual mandate of the ability to push rents because vacancies are so low and tenant demand is so high with the fact that you have these long-term relationships with tenants? What's the kind of equation that goes into that? How do you make sure you're giving them the space that they need, while also pushing rents as far as you can? Stephen A. Richardson: Tom, it's Steve. Thank you for the question. I think it's been and it has been for the time since the company was started. It's a balance of respect for the clients that we're working with and the work that they're doing. These are multi-market relationships. They're multi-company relationships. So they are critically important. And I think we balance that respect with the reality of the marketplace and share that in an open and pretty transparent way so that ultimately, the companies and the decision-makers feel like they are gaining tremendous value in the facilities, tremendous value in the operations of the facilities and really are working with somebody who's a partner for the long term. So I think it's a balance between those 2. William Catherwood : Got it. That makes sense. And I assume that there is kind of also helping them find space in other areas, which leads to my next question. Peter, it was really helpful when you provided more insight to the Riverside Center purchase in the Boston suburbs. Obviously, the Boston suburbs has been an area where you've been more active with acquisitions and redevelopments over the past few quarters. What are you seeing as far as demand dynamics beyond just executives living in the area? What are you seeing as far as tenant demand there? And how does this differ from previous cycles when the suburbs experienced much more volatility than your urban markets? Joel Marcus : Yes. So Tom, this is Joel. Let me start off before Peter jumps in. I think one of the things you have to think about is there are a host of companies broadly in the life science area that actually don't want to be in the Cambridge location for a variety of reasons beyond where executives may live. And so we've seen certainly being the #1 life science market in the United States, there are a continual flow of companies that either started in Cambridge and choose to move out or have never moved there and are expanding. And I think those are ones we see pretty regularly, a number of which are pretty great credit and a number of which are not. But I think there is a pretty good core of tenants. And then those tenants are pretty mindful of what Peter says is transit has become king. And I think working with a owner operator that both understands their needs and is pretty sophisticated about what they do and how they do things. But Peter can give you any further. Peter M. Moglia: Yes. I mean -- I think Joel answered it well. I guess, one thing I would remind everyone about is we've had over 1 million square feet in the suburbs for a number of years with high 90s occupancy. Never really run into any problems there. As Joel said, there's a number of companies that just would prefer to be there. But we feel confident in acquisitions like Arsenal on the Charles and the Riverside Center because they do connect well to transportation. They have very close proximity to Cambridge and Boston. And given just what is going on in Boston, in general, such as the tech cadre going to downtown, connecting to all the different teams, such as the green line as well as red line is important. And so the demand is really coming from a lot of folks that want to be in the suburbs, as Joel said, but there's also a tremendous amount of company growth in Cambridge that can't find growth space. So we're figuring out where to go next. And I think we've made some pretty good decisions. William Catherwood : Got you. So it sounds like it is a little bit different in the suburbs than it used to be. So one last one for me. Joel Marcus : And not all suburbs are created equal. So remember that. William Catherwood : Very fair. Last one for me, probably for either Dean or maybe Steve, a lot of redevelopments as part of the acquisitions that you guys did in 2019, whether it's stuff in Campus Point or SD tech or the Arsenal. Is it possible that earnings could kind of take some chunky hits as leases expire? And you go in to re-do some of these either out buildings or [ parts ] of these buildings. Or are you planning to pull the projects out of service, so you end up capitalizing interest and FFO remains stable? How should we think about how those kind of roll on over the next 12 to 18 months? Dean Shigenaga : Tom, it's Dean here. I'm trying to think about the redevelopment projects that we have on the horizon. At least if you look at our 2020 lease expirations as an example, in fact, '21 as well, we highlight that there's some redevelopment opportunities, as an example. So I think over the next 2 years, what we do have going into redevelopment is very, very modest. There is 75,000, 76,000 targeted for '20 and then another 79,000 targeted for '21, and that is related to the Arsenal and the Charles. So I think that gives you some visibility over the next 24 months, that it's not really going to have any impact. Peter M. Moglia: And this is Peter. I think I'll chime in to remind everybody that some of these redevelopments are considered covered land plays. If you look at the camp at 1260 Campus Point Drive, 4161 Campus Point Court, we have Leidos occupying those properties as we do a build-to-suit for them just next door. So we're able to kind of get the earnings while we build. And then once we deliver, one of those buildings will be converted to lab, the other will be demolished in favor of a new building, part of the overall 1.9 million square foot Campus Point, maybe campus development. 10 Necco Street in Seaport is very similar. It's a parking garage with good income coming off of it as we position it for redevelopment. So we have a number of things like that, and we're very aware when we buy something that could be redeveloped that -- to the extent it has cash flow makes it more attractive. Operator : And our next question will come from Rich Anderson of SMBC. Richard Anderson : On the Boston Properties joint venture, I'm curious if you can speak about that in dollar terms a little bit in terms of -- do buildings get mark-to-market when they get contributed into the JV? What's the leverage on the JV? What's your equity investment? And what kind of capital are you kind of taking out-of-pocket and putting into this JV? I guess, mainly, I want to know what 1.7 million square feet means in dollar terms. Dean Shigenaga : So Rich, it's Dean here. I think you asked a couple of points. First off, I think it's important to recognize, this is a tremendous joint venture opportunity for Alexandria. The mark-to-market is actually fairly modest on the operating assets. So that really doesn't come into play here. As far as dollars going in, I'd say, stay tuned for the first quarter disclosures, we'll get into a little more information that's required to be disclosed. But it was just a very recent transaction. So it was premature for us to get into the details right now. Richard Anderson : Okay, fair enough. Now the -- this satisfies your 2 sort of objectives, which is mega campuses and buying vacancy. And so I agree, it seems like a really great setup for 2 really high-quality companies, so -- like all that. Wondering if there's a pipeline here, Boston Properties operates in a lot of your markets. Is there a chance that you -- the 2 companies could work more together in other areas around the country and do something similar? Or is this sort of a one-shot deal do you think? Stephen A. Richardson: Rich, it's Steve. This was a very unique opportunity. We were literally adjacent neighbors to one another for a couple of decades. There was actually one parcel in the heart of the campus that Boston Properties owns, and we had a long-term perpetual easement across it. There is additional parking with a parking facility that ends up unlocking another chunk of square footage. So you had presented to both of us a very unusual and unique opportunity. So we're very focused on this and don't necessarily see this being a pipeline, as you mentioned. But again, just a very unique and exceptional opportunity to create something that really will be transformational for nearly 30 acres in South San Francisco. So quite the scale when you think about it. Richard Anderson : Okay, great. And then on your buying vacancy initiatives what is -- like the path, the cadence to cap rates, if you're buying at x? And how does that ramp, if you could speak in general terms when you look at these sort of half vacant type of opportunities for the company? Joel Marcus : Yes, I wouldn't say that we have a strategy to buy vacancy, Rich. I think it is unique to each transaction. So the San Diego Tech center, as we said, presented itself in a unique way, very undermanaged and really was not meeting up to what we think its aspirational capabilities could be. I don't think we went in there specifically because it had significant vacancy, same thing with Boston properties issues. I mean I think they were motivated by vacancy. I'm not sure we were. But we were motivated for the things that Steve pointed out, is the ability to, over time, create a very unique mega campus right at the gateway entry to South City. So I don't think I would intuit that as a light deliberative strategy. Richard Anderson : Okay. I didn't mean to put words in your mouth there. So sorry about that. But nonetheless, good deals. And then finally for me, what is the timing of that $55 million burn off-of free rent on the delivered developments? Dean Shigenaga : Rich, it's Dean here. The majority of that $55 million of free rent that is now related to properties that are in service, generating revenue. So the free rent period will burn off substantially over the next 4 quarters. Operator : And our next question will come from Sheila McGrath of Evercore ISI. Sheila McGrath : I wanted to first clarify on the Mercer Mega Block. Peter, did you say you don't expect that to close until the end of this year? And if so, when do you expect to have buildings open at that project? Peter M. Moglia: Okay. Well, I will confirm that closing will be at the end of the year. We are concurrently, as I said, processing drawings for our early design guidance and [ MOP ]. So that is a fairly long process. But I'd imagine our entitlements will be perfected sometime in '21. And then decisions will be made then based on market conditions. It's really hard to forecast where we'll go. Sheila McGrath : Okay. And then just following up on your comments on the mega campus strategy. Obviously, the flexibility for growing tenants is a key part of it. Just wondering if part of the economic benefit is spreading the cost as the amenity building across a larger campus, if that's part of your strategy? And on those dedicated amenity buildings, are you getting reimbursed for the amenity package from tenants? Peter M. Moglia: Yes, Sheila, it's Peter. You're exactly right. The mega campus does allow the spreading of the cost, not only the cost of the amenities, but it actually gives us a lot of economies of scale in the operations of the buildings. So that's how we're able to get to that NOI premium in addition to higher rental rates. We have lower reimbursements, so the tenants feel that they can go ahead and cover those things. The amenities themselves are almost always included in the load factor. So we do get full rent on them as well as some -- the collection of operating expenses. So the larger the campus, the easier it is to do because, obviously, you want to manage your load factor. Sheila McGrath : Okay, great. And one last question. You mentioned the leasing spreads continue to be significant with 2019 at -- I think, a record in the past 10 years. Just wondering if you have a rough estimate for us where in-place rents for the portfolio might compare to current market rents. Stephen A. Richardson: Sheila, it's Steve. Yes, we had talked about a mark-to-market of 17.1% on a GAAP basis and nearly that on a cash basis, and that's across all markets. And it is particularly strong, as you might expect in Boston, Cambridge. Operator : Our next question will come from Manny Korchman of Citi. Michael Bilerman : It's Michael Bilerman here with Manny. So I just wanted to come back to potential other opportunities around the assets that you own, and it definitely sounded like from the BXP call that BXP approached you guys with this unique opportunity. And certainly, there's a lot of unique circumstances from that ownership of assets beside each other. But I'm just wondering, after you've now identified and been able to go through this process for what will be 1 plus 1 greater than 2. Have you sort of done a deep dive into every single one of your other assets and campuses to see whether there's other landlords that may be beside your assets who you could work with to create similar value, either by buying them out or entering into similar types of joint ventures like that? Joel Marcus : Yes, Michael, this is Joel. We've actually been doing that for quite a while, thinking about our locations, the assemblages. Campus point is maybe the best example of that where we grew a campus we acquired back in 2010. I can't remember exactly how big it was then, but in the hundreds of thousands of feet today. It's over -- almost 2 million square feet. And that's probably the best example where we have very deliberately gone after adjacent parcels or buildings or things like that, other owners and so forth. And I think that's something we always think about. It's not so much easy to do, oftentimes, especially if they're owner users that are adjacent, but that clearly is part of our long-term strategy. Michael Bilerman : I guess, is there anything else sort of underway that got uncovered where arguably, this thing with BXP once you got into the negotiation and understanding what was that -- what was there, obviously, on a lot of value to both parties. Is there nothing that sparked something of similar scope within the portfolio today? Joel Marcus : Probably enough breaking news today. Stay tuned. But the answer is... Michael Bilerman : Right, it's a question whether you've gone through a more deep dive into these opportunities. Joel Marcus : The answer is yes. Very much so, yes. Michael Bilerman : Manny had a question too. Emmanuel Korchman : Okay. Dean, just thinking about the capital plan, I understand you want to keep your options open but just could you help us dial in how much of that is equity? And maybe as part of that, what the cadence is of taking down the forward that you just did? Dean Shigenaga : Manny, sure, it's Dean here. So 2 questions. Maybe I'll start with the latter as far as the timing on the forward because a big component of the capital raise was related to 2 key acquisitions that not only closed in December, but also were awarded around that timeframe. So we had a short fuse to work with. We do need to bring down a big chunk of the capital in Q1. So you'll see some of the equity settled in the first quarter and then you'll see the rest kind of spread through the remaining 3 quarters. As far as our broad needs, Manny, our guidance, on Page 7, touched on the broad equity component number that we need to solve for 2020, which was $1.95 billion at the midpoint. And the follow-on offering in January solved for little over $1 billion of that. And so we'll work through options to close out the remainder through the next several quarters. Operator : And our next question will come from Dave Rodgers with Baird. Dave Rodgers : Maybe for Joel or Steve, I wanted to ask about just kind of the mega campuses versus the historical kind of clustering of slightly smaller building. I mean, as you move to these mega campuses, is it your expectation you would kind of move back toward maybe a smaller base of lab tenants? Would you prefer that versus maybe leasing a mega campus to a tech tenant? It just seems like maybe the tech tenants will be less likely to want to rent next door to competitive tenant versus the lab tenants. So just some thoughts maybe around how that -- what direction that takes you. Stephen A. Richardson: Dave, it's Steve. Thanks for the question. Yes, again, by and large, 90% or thereabouts of the NOI is from life science companies. And the industry, as it's growing and maturing -- and I think one of the most important slides we put out at Investor Day was the new modalities that the life science companies are pursuing to really get at intractable diseases. So what we see is these companies continuing to grow, the demand to be in these clusters and the footprints that they're looking to occupy and their colleagues are looking to occupy, continue to grow. So we see the mega campuses as a natural response to the way the industry is growing and evolving in a very healthy, productive and sustainable way. Dave Rodgers : And then maybe just a second question. You have about a little over 2 million square feet of remaining expirations between '20 and '21. As you talk to those tenants, what are their maybe hesitation to have renewed already? I mean is it -- does it have to do with rent? Are you getting pushed back on rent? It doesn't sound like maybe you're getting a lot of the new modalities. Are they thinking of, \"Hey, I have to move to another cluster?\"  I mean how much of that is kind of weighing into these decisions of these smaller tenants in particular? Joel Marcus : Very much case by case, I think. I think it's very hard to make a general observation there. Some are quite small and some are somewhat larger, but I think it's super case by case. So I wouldn't read anything into it, particularly. Stephen A. Richardson: And Dave, it's Steve. I would just emphasize Joel's point. We really don't have a number of large blocks rolling. It really is consisting of smaller tenants. And they would typically be looking at a different timeframe than larger tenants. Operator : Our next question is a follow-up from Jamie Feldman of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. James Feldman : I was just hoping you could talk more about the impairments. I think you had a $10 million impairment in the fourth quarter. And I think it was like $17 million for the year. Just what caused you to take the write-down? And then also just going forward, is that kind of a reasonable run rate based on -- obviously, not every investment is going to play out the way you think it will? Dean Shigenaga : Jamie, so the $10 million impairments on the venture side was really related to 2 privately held investments. The impairment, as you -- well, let me just touch on the accounting rules because it will give you a sense for how the impairments do come up. On the public side, publicly traded securities, they're mark-to-market through earnings now based on the closing stock price for each security. So it's pretty straightforward. There's no impairments on the public portfolio. To the extent a privately held company provides net asset value, the FASB said, use net asset value as really effectively a practical expedient for fair value. And as a result, there's no impairments because you're just going to record those investments at net asset value. So it's the other privately held investments where there's no NAV, and you do have to mark-to-market from time to time for up rounds and down rounds in those companies. But to the extent there is some hiccup in their business plan that impacts the value -- the valuation for the company, the accounting rules will require you to take a look at indicators of impairment and recognize a write-down. I think, Jamie, when you have a portfolio of any assets, real estate or these venture investments, you will have an impairment from time to time. I don't think the historical run rate gives any perspective for the prospective charges that could occur because they're very specific to the companies. And most importantly, Jamie, we've got tremendous value that we've generated from this portfolio. As I mentioned, over $400 million of unrealized gains on the books as of December 31, and that's in addition to roughly $70 million of realized gains that were recognized over the last 2 years. So I'd probably focus on the upside here than the occasional write-down, which is inherent in a portfolio of assets. Joel Marcus : Yes, the one -- I'll add a footnote, Jamie. The one similarity between the 2 companies is there was management changes in each of the companies that played into that impairment. James Feldman : Okay. So both of these are investments you're still holding on to that you think still have upside? Dean Shigenaga : Well, we're -- we wrote down only a portion of it, Jamie, which means we still have a significant amount of our original investment we expect to recover. As far as the future goes, it's too difficult to speculate whether we'll make more money downstream in the future on it than our current budget cost basis. So stay tuned on that. James Feldman : Okay. And then as I looked at the development pipeline, it looked like there were several projects where your lease percentage declined, but the square footage increased. Was there anything specific that you did this quarter in terms of changing building sizes or adds to some of these projects? I'm just trying to make sure I understand what's new? Dean Shigenaga : There's only one that I could think of, Jamie, that might have been a little more noticeable than anything else. I think in our project, the Alexandria district 56% -- it's 56% leased, 65% leased negotiating. And I think it's pretty close to where it was. It might have moved a little bit. I know there's one lease we had that we're not as confident in completing, but it's still in the works. I think that was the only meaningful change that may have been reflected, Jamie. James Feldman : Okay. I'll follow up offline. I think there was 1 or 2 that adds like -- they're now larger projects, so it pulled back [ I think 50% ], but I don't have it in front of me. Well, I'll follow up with you guys. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks. Please go ahead, sir. Joel Marcus : Yes, thank you, everybody, and we look forward to chatting with you on the first quarter call. Take care. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz from Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Paula Schwartz : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now I would like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel. Joel Marcus : Thank you, Paula, and welcome to everybody. And with me today, virtually, I think, our first virtual quarterly call. In order presentation is Jenna Foger, Steve Richardson, Peter Moglia and Dean Shigenaga. And we're pleased to present the first quarter earnings call. This will forever be known as the COVID-19 quarter for all public reporting companies. And as I always do, I want to thank our entire team for a truly stellar operationally excellent first quarter 2020 under extraordinary lead difficult COVID-19 circumstances. Our current and go-forward operating and financial status is excellent. On the fourth quarter and 2019 year-end earnings call on February 4, I commented on the novel coronavirus global health emergency and what Alexandria and our client tenants, we're already working on astoundingly, it was not until March 11, 2020, that the World Health organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The COVID-19 virus is a tiny 120-nanometer particle, roughly the wavelength of ultraviolet light that has rippled and replicated across the globe with very ultra violence. And more than 3 million cases worldwide to date.Tiny things have immense impact, especially when everything and everyone is so interconnected and vulnerable. And some have kind of dubbed this China's chernobyl. In a few minutes, I'll ask Jenna to update you on the COVID-19 fight regarding testing therapeutics and vaccines, which is moving forward in a rapid pace literally every day. We had Alexandria laser-focused and enormously proud of our collective accomplishments during this very challenging first quarter, which none of us will ever forget.Our team's tireless and truly outstanding performance really by all metrics, and we are staying lean, mean and laser-focused on our mission with no ego. Our teams acquired and delivered over 35,000 individual pieces of PPE, mostly N95 masks and delivered those to hospitals in 6 cities, New York City, Boston, Seattle were our top priorities. We also delivered them to Dayton, San Diego and LA Hospitals. We consider this to be a truly great execution of our corporate responsibility.Alexandria is among the industry leaders in total shareholder return. Alexandria has best-in-class tenants. Alexandria has best-in-class assets and a powerful and inspiring cluster market presence design and place-making really second to another. We have world-class trusted relationships. And importantly, our fortress balance sheet gives us great flexibility and optionality going forward.We, in the life science industry are at the forefront of this multifaceted fight against COVID-19, while still innovating each and every day novel technologies and new products to also treat cancer, cardiovascular, metabolic, neurological and other serious, serious diseases. While most REITs compare their business today, the COVID-19 in the COVID-19 pandemic to the great financial crisis of 2008 and 2009. I think for us, we like to look at 4 years after that time really in 2013. This industry and its innovation really catapulted its capabilities and impact starting in 2013, which really was the start of the great bull run of this industry. And as we sit here today, the life science industry is really the true solution to winning the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. A return to the days when Merck and is then CEO, Ray Vagelos, were the most admired company and the most admired CEO in America.The first quarter of 2020 set an all-time record quarterly high of $8.1 billion invested in venture-backed life science companies, a very high level and accelerated pace, over 80 of biopharma R&D collaborations took place in the first quarter, including the blockbuster, $483 million Moderna and BARDA government funding to -- and Moderna being 1 of our important tenants to advance and scale clinical testing and the manufacturer for a novel COVID-19 vaccine really the key to the solution here.Biopharma continues to outperform the broad market in the first quarter amidst the COVID-19 reality. While most industries are adversely affected by acute changes in consumer demand, this is not the case for biopharma. As the need for new medicines is fundamental to our human condition. This discrepancy is one of the reasons why biopharma outperformed other sectors during the great financial crisis and the tech bubble crash of 2001. NIH funding support remains very strong with a 7% budget increase for fiscal 2020, up to $41.7 billion, a very favorable regulatory environment continues with the FDA, especially in light of COVID-19 and 11 new product approvals were achieved in the first quarter.Medical research philanthropy has also hit an all-time high as well. How I think it's fair to say that the much like flying was before and after 911, things will never again be quite the same as they were pre-COVID-19 and the international pandemic. How quickly we return to what will be a new normal, depends on how we solve the public health situation, restore public confidence and safety. Jim Collins, the famous business author and writer. Research clearly evidences to be built to last, you have to be built to change. And more importantly, in Jim's introduction to his book built to last states, the real focus is it is really about building something that is worthy of lasting. It's about building a company of such intrinsic excellence that the world would lose something important if that organization cease to exist.Jim Collins further stated, we are more convinced than ever that building an enduring great company, 1 that is truly worthy of lasting is a noble cause. And our mission at Alexandria is now more important than ever, and we are in the fight each and every day. Making a tangible and positive impact. And we're great -- we were really graced by Jim Collins on the cover of our 2016 annual report, where he indicated Alexandria has achieved the 3 outputs that define a great company : superior results, distinctive impact and lasting endurance. And with that, let me turn it over to Jenna Foger. Jenna Foger : Thank you so much, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. Against that backdrop and the backdrop of the unprecedented economic, public health and social impact of this global coronavirus pandemic. As Joel elegantly described, life science fundamentals remain strong as the biopharma industry represents the beacon of hope in the fight against COVID-19. Effective diagnostics, therapies and vaccines are absolutely mission-critical to solving this crisis, and we truly owe a debt of gratitude to the heroic work being spearheaded by so many of our tenants to help test for, treat and prevent COVID-19. The countless efforts we are tracking, not to mention the many philanthropic initiatives across our cluster campus communities, providing medical supplies and protective equipment to neighboring hospitals is profound and inspiring. We are currently tracking over 60 tenants across our cluster markets with publicly disclosed COVID-19 programs with dozens of intercompany and public-private collaborations transpiring across our portfolio.Our tenants position at the forefront of fighting COVID-19 reflects the strength, quality and fortitude of our tenant base. As you all know, we take tremendous pride in the tenants we attract, each of which is strategically underwritten by our science and technology team, which I have a profound honor of being a part of alongside 20 of our colleagues with deep background in science and business. So I would like to briefly highlight the mission-critical work of our tenant companies across 3 major categories : one, improving testing, quality and capacity, 2, advancing new and repurposed treatments; and three, developing preventative vaccines. So in the area of improving test and quality and capacity, tenant companies, including Abbott labs, LabCorp, Roche, Quest Diagnostics, Thermo Fisher, UCSS color genomics and several others are working to enhance the quality and capacity for rapid and accessible testing to determine who actively has the virus, who has been exposed and who has developed immunity against it. The availability of widespread screening and serological testing of this nature will be instrumental for track and trace initiatives and, of course, the safe and healthy reopening of society and return to work.In terms of therapies and vaccines, over 180 potential drug treatments and vaccines are being studied in more than 250 clinical trials around the world, with well over 100 preclinical stage programs in development. As you can imagine a substantial number of these programs are sponsored by our tenants. Headlining efforts among them include Gilead sciences Remdesivir, which is in late-stage studies for the treatment of moderate and severe COVID-19 patients, which, if positive, will likely form the basis for the first FDA-approved treatment for COVID-19.Tenant company Adaptive Biotechnologies is partnered with Amgen to identify and develop therapies from the blood of sick or recently recovered COVID-19 patients. Other tenant biotechnology has announced partnerships with fellow tenants, Alnylam, Biogen, GSK and others to develop new and existing antibodies that could be used as therapeutic or preventative options to come back to COVID-19 and other coronaviruses. Several other tenants, including AbbVie, Eli Lilly, Fiber and Novartis are similarly endeavoring to develop novel therapies and repurpose existing drugs to provide near-term treatments for moderate and severe COVID-19 patients and those at highest risk.And lastly, vaccines. So clearly, a prophylactic vaccine represents the effective end of this global COVID-19 pandemic. Our tenants Moderna and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases NIAD partnered as Moderna's mRNA-based vaccine into the clinic last month. Subsequently, as Joel mentioned, BARDA committed up to $483 million to support the clinical development and manufacturing scale-up of Moderna's vaccine candidate. To help expedite FDA approval over the next 9 to 12 months an unprecedented pace for the sort of activity and facilitate the supply of tens of millions of doses of that vaccine for a month thereafter.Other tenants, including Johnson & Johnson, Medicago, Novavax, Fiber, PS, Sanofi, are leveraging their vaccine development expertise and technology platforms with the goal of expediting the delivery of a safe and effective vaccine to the public in 2021. These noble and expedient efforts across our tenant base are in large part to the fact that as the new coronavirus made itself known to the world, these companies were already well equipped with the R&D infrastructure, resources and talent in place such that they were able to mobilize at nearly a moment's notice to combat this unprecedented global health emergency.And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve. Stephen Richardson : Thank you, Jenna. Good afternoon, everyone. Steve here. We've discussed the mission-critical nature of our laboratory office facilities since our inception 26 years ago. It is clear now more than ever that Alexandria is the proven leader in providing mission-critical an indispensable strategic national health infrastructure in these unique facilities. As Joel and Jenna outlined earlier, we have 60 companies directly engaged in the fight against COVID-19. Our unique platform is leading to healthy activity at Alexandria's Class A laboratory facilities. During Q1, we leased 700,000 rentable square feet at very strong rental rate increases. Actually, the highest during the past 10 years with 22.3% on a cash basis and 46.3% on a GAAP basis, led by a large lease in our flagship Tech Square campus in Cambridge. Our mark-to-market continues to be strong at 15.8% GAAP and 14.3% cash.Lab supply constraints continue with nearly 0 lab subleases coming to market since the inception of the pandemic and continued strong occupancy at 97.5% in our campuses when excluding the vacancy of the recently acquired campuses in San Diego and South San Francisco that will provide future growth opportunities. Executed leases now for the month of April are on pace with Q1 leasing velocity. And important to note that we do have ongoing demand in the form of serious interest and negotiations with tenants on renewals and expansions and our new ground-up developments and redevelopment projects. It's also important to highlight that Alexandria has long been a pioneer, an early adopter in the discipline of designing and constructing state-of-the-art healthy facilities. We currently have 39 total fit well and we well health certification initiatives with 12 projects completed and another 27 projects underway. One of these facilities in Cambridge, in fact, received the highest score fit well ever awarded. Our mission-critical facilities already feature many state of the art mechanical and filtration attributes and are easily adaptable as may be needed going forward guided by our skilled operational teams who are well versed in the types of measures needed to deliver enhanced environments.Finally, Alexandria is fully prepared and well positioned at all strategic and operational levels to protect the inherent value of our unique Class A facilities and continue to grow as a trusted partner to the life science industry to beat this pandemic.With that, I'll hand it off to Peter. Peter Moglia : Thank you, Steve. I'm going to quickly update you all on our development pipeline. Acquisitions closed in 1Q and touch on some capital markets activity. Coming into 2010, we have 11 development and redevelopment projects in our pipeline that are 61% leased, with another 7% under negotiation. One of the many things that we like about our pipeline is that it is spread among 6 markets and 9 submarkets, which really shows that the ecosystems we've built in all of our clusters are contributing to our growth and our story is not just about any particular region. Despite the shelter in place orders, reducing our ability to tour potential tenants, there is good activity on partially leased assets that are progressing at various levels from initial online presentations to paper being traded. As Steve mentioned, we are still seeing healthy activity in our markets. And these leasing percentages should accelerate given the pent-up demand and the new COVID-19 related requirements.As you may have noted, by looking on Page 38 of the supplemental, 7 projects have had a temporary pause in construction, but 3 of them have restarted as they've been deemed essential. Delays related to shelter in place orders or I'll refer to as SIP, are not day for day. They are likely between day for day and 2 days per day of delay, depending on how long it takes to remobilized the subcontractors back on-site and where we were in the staging of the work. We do not anticipate any material supply chain issues. The amount of delay is really going to depend upon the subcontractor labor and what other work they are performing elsewhere. In general, we anticipate about 1/4 delay on average for those projects that are in temporary work stoppages due to SIP orders and assuming construction recommences upon lifting of the current orders, and they are not further extended. We do anticipate or we do not anticipate any material movement in yields at this time due to these delays. In the -- touching on acquisitions, in the first quarter, we closed on 2 projects, we discussed on last quarter's call, 275 grove in the Route 128 corridor and the JV with Boston properties in South San Francisco.In addition to those, we closed on 9808 and 9868 Scranton Road in Sereno Mesa. And 3330 and 3412 Hill view in the Stanford Research Park. The Scranton Road assets total 220,000 square feet and are located directly across the street from and will be incorporated into our SD tech campus. They are currently 88% leased with the predominant tenants being investment-grade companies. The assets present us the opportunity to achieve a strong 6.8% stabilized cash yield by leasing the vacant space and future value creation opportunities as they are convertible to lab. A 50% interest in these assets was subsequently sold into a joint venture, and we received $51.1 million from net asset sale.As mentioned, in addition, we closed on 3330 and 3412 Hillview in the Stanford Research Park for $105 million. These 2 high-quality Class A office properties total approximately 106,000 square feet and are fully leased to credit tenants. The rents are considerably under market and offer near-term value creation in an irreplaceable location. The buildings are also convertible to lab offering us long-term optionality and further value creation opportunities down the road.Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we closed on 975 to 1075 Commercial Street and 915 to 1063 old County Road, a 12.7 acre site that is the fourth and final piece of our 25 Acre assemblage branded as the Alexandria district in St. Carlos. This campus is in close proximity to the Caltrain station and will reach 2 million square feet upon full development. First phase of a little over 500,000 square feet is currently under construction and has been well received as the only purpose-built Class A lab campus in the Greater Stanford cluster illustrated by it being 56% pre-leased with another 9% under negotiation.I'll wrap up by mentioning that conversations with a number of brokers indicate that there is still strong interest in lab office assets from a diverse set of investors. To that end, the post 426,000 square foot campus in Waltham in Massachusetts closed on April 2 at a 5.1% cap rate, the lowest suburban cap rate we know of. And a reliable source has told us another life science transaction in the Boston area has gone under contract while in the shutdown. With a positive light shining on the industry, it is not surprising that demand for our product type remains robust.And with that, I'll pass it over to Dean. Dean Shigenaga : Thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everybody. I'm just going to quickly rattle through my commentary, kicking off with really outstanding results for the first quarter. Revenues were up 22.6% over the first quarter of '19. NOI was up 22.9% as well over the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin was very strong at 68%. Contractual and annual rent escalations average almost 3% today. Our value creation pipeline is 61% leased and will generate significant revenue and cash flows, and I'll come back to this topic in a moment. We also have about $37 million of annual cash net operating income that will commence as free rent burns off primarily over the next 4 quarters. Related to recently placed into service development and redevelopment projects. Same-property NOI growth was very solid at 2.4% and 6.1% on a cash basis. Rental rate growth, as you heard from Steve earlier, on lease renewals and releasing the space was very strong, up 46% and 22% on a cash basis. And our properties are open and operating today and through this environment. Our business is not absolutely immune from this unusual and unprecedented environment. But is doing very well on a relative basis. The NASDAQ biotech index, as some of you may have noted, was up 5.8% year-to-date as of yesterday. And our stock has outperformed on a relative basis, roughly down about 7% year-to-date, again through as of yesterday.Our team is working diligently on our annual corporate responsibility report, which we expect to issue around mid year. Now as Joel had highlighted, our balance sheet really remains in the best shape in the history of the company. We had about $4 billion of liquidity. We have an excellent maturity profile with no debt maturities until 2023. And the top we rank roughly in the top 10% on a relative ranking with our credit profile when compared to all publicly traded REITs. We have a real high-quality tenant roster, et cetera, et cetera. I mean, these are just some of the best statistics in the REIT industry today. And we remain committed to our strong and improving credit profile. Our dividend is well covered with an FFO payout ratio just under 60% today. This strategically allows us to use a portion of our cash flows from operating activities after dividends, which is just above $200 million today. For investment into our value creation ground-up development projects.Now briefly on rent deferrals and an update on rent collections, we've only received a handful of requests for rent deferrals, which is primarily on the retail side of our tenancy. And we've really taken these requests 1 by one, and we'll review each review these each 1 month at a time. The total rent deferrals were in the low $600,000 range for the month of April. Now we're very proud of our research and property management teams for really building an outstanding and high-quality tenant roster and for really taking care of these long-term relationships. We've collected 98.4% of our April rent and expense recoveries, which is just outstanding.Our AR balance as of Friday, April 24, was $7.3 million, representing the lowest balance since 2012. And our team has successfully decreased our AR balance, both when we look back to the depth of the great financial crisis. So our goal was clear from the beginning of April that we would continue to make this a priority each month. We're feeling really good now that we're at the end of April. We've collected almost all of our account receivable balances our business is doing really well, again, relative to other REITs. However, this is an unprecedented environment, and we have forecasted a relatively minor impact to our outlook for the last 3 quarters of 2020. We're forecasting about an $0.08 or 1% reduction in FFO per share as adjusted at the midpoint of the range of our guidance. And this is really related to a very limited retail tenancy that we have as well as transient and short-term parking of the $0.08, 60% of this is related to retail, and the remainder is primarily related to transient and short-term parking. To put this into perspective, this $0.08 is roughly 60 to 70 basis points of our annual rental revenue, and we believe this will only be about a 50 basis point decline to our year end occupancy.As of March 31, our annual rental revenue from retail was about $10.4 million. We recognized an allowance of about $3.8 million related to NOI for the second, third and fourth quarter of 2020, and most of the impact to retail revenue will really occur in the second quarter since GAAP requires cash basis revenue recognition related to these leases that now have specific allowances or reserves. And our retail-related occupancy declines, which we expect to be very minor, may not occur right away since these leases are still in effect today. And keep in mind, retail is a very minor part of our operating results, but we hope these details are useful.Parking income for ARE is primarily from urban or CBD markets. And these markets have very limited parking to service tenants and daily parking needs. For example, Juno Therapeutics in Seattle has about 600 employees, but they only have parking for about 50% of that employee base. So these really dense urban CBD submarkets generally have lower risk of a major decline in parking income due to the very limited supply of spaces in the markets.Our outlook for same-property performance for 2020 remains very strong, down only about 50 basis points. The $0.08 of FFO per share related to retail and parking revenue. Translates to about 60 to 70 basis points of same-property results. And this was offset by our same-property results in our forecast running at the upper end of the range prior to this guidance adjustment.Now turning to real estate impairments. We spent quite a bit of time analyzing options for 1 of our unconsolidated retail joint ventures. To put this into perspective, this deal came together back in 2015 as we were looking for opportunities to monetize certain assets, including this land parcel, now in this case, we found an opportunity to contribute our land into a joint venture with a local retail developer in Maryland. And this project was really doing well on its way to solid, stabilized NOI, until COVID-19 arrived and almost every tenant was required to comply with executive orders and close their business. Now we concluded that we're not going to recover our bases and wrote off our investment of approximately $7.6 million.Turning to our venture investment portfolio. The portfolio has done really well to date. For example, our venture investments aggregate about $1.1 billion. But this includes unrealized gains of $384 million. During the first quarter, we did recognize impairments aggregating about $19.8 million, primarily related to 3 privately held investments. One is focused on Parkinson's and ALS, another in the dermatology area. And the third is a smart glass technology-related company. Now each of these companies really have great innovation and technology. However, we do not expect to recover our entire investment.On the positive note, realized gains for the first quarter were $15.1 million. Recent quarterly gains were put on -- for 2020 really are on track to exceed the $50.3 million in realized gains recognized in 2019.Turning to our value creation pipeline. We're uniquely positioned with flexibility to be prudent during this unprecedented time, while we're also very well positioned to address future demand. Now construction has been impacted in urban markets with more of our suburban markets having limited to no impact. COVID-19 and other projects continue while following appropriate guidelines.Now we felt it was prudent to significantly reduce our 2020 capital plan with a reduction of $640 million in construction spend and $300 million of acquisitions, both at the midpoint of our guidance. Now our remaining construction spend for 2020 is now primarily focused on construction that is committed to tenants. Importantly, though, we remain uniquely positioned for opportunities on a project-by-project basis to meet the demand for our well-located pipeline of future ground-up development projects. Now we updated our 2020 guidance to a range for EPS dilutive from $1.69 to $1.79 and for FFO per share diluted as adjusted from $7.25 to $7.35, as usual, please refer to the detailed underlying assumptions included in our 2020 guidance, beginning on Page 9 of our supplemental package.Let me pause there and turn it back to Joel. Joel Marcus : Operator, let's open it up for Q&A, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Sheila McGrath from Evercore ISI. Sheila McGrath : Joel, I was wondering if you could talk big picture, your thoughts on research funding for life science tenants in the race for the cure, do you think the laser focus will have some positive outcome for R&D funding for your tenants? And you also mentioned 60 tenants working on COVID responses. Are they dominated in any 1 or 2 single markets or across the portfolio? Joel Marcus : Sheila, welcome to the call. So the -- I talked about NIH being up 7% this year, who knows where Congress may decide to additionally, focus there was $25 billion in the recent care bill this, I think, the second addition focused on testing. In fact, I was on a call the other day, where there's going to be some rollout of some pretty amazing novel testing. So a lot of money is going into that sector. In fact, it may be that the nasal swab will actually be old technology at some point, and people will be using there's some research out of practical research out of Rutgers and Yale, indicating that you can actually find virus in spit. And if you could imagine, you could do that simply on a daily basis. And be alerted on your smartphone that you aren't able to go to work, that would be a pretty unique solution. So we see a fair amount of money, both from pharma, from Bio, from the venture side, obviously, from philanthropy and from the government. I think the BARDA deal that I mentioned and Jenna mentioned almost $500 million to try to ramp up testing and the vaccine with Moderna is 1 example of, I think, extraordinary focus in this area. So I think it's broad-based and really across multiple regions. Sheila McGrath : Okay. Great. And then on leasing spreads for the quarter, I think Steve mentioned they're the strongest in 10 years. I was wondering if you could give us more detail on the mix of the increases geographically? And if there was any 1 lease that was well below market that might have impacted the numbers? Joel Marcus : Yes, I'll have Steve comment. It was somewhat broad-based. One of the important leases was a renewal in Tech Square. I don't want to get into the details of that, but that was certainly an important part of driving. But Steve, any further comments? Stephen Richardson : Sheila, it's Steve. No, that's exactly right. We do have, as we said, mark-to-market strong across most of the regions, and it is typically broad-based for this particular quarter, we did have that 1 lease at Tech square that was a particular driver. But in general, we do have nice mark-to-market opportunities. Sheila McGrath : Last question. On the North Tower, your 10-Q mentioned that, that project would be postponed. I'm just wondering if that -- in York, is that indefinitely postponed? Or what's the status of that future development? Joel Marcus : Right, as you maybe even have seen on television when some of the news media reports go to that site, which is right next to our 2 towers, the pad that was the location of OCME, the Office of County Medical Examiner was occupied for many, many years. So the white tent with the unidentified remains of the world trade center victims. They've vacated that site, and then we began a diligence there. They reclaim that site for a temporary period just a number of weeks ago, they have mobile morgues there because of the number of people dying in the New York City area. We would expect them to probably vacate that by the summer or the fall, and then we would look to see where we are with the economy and so forth. But I don't think it's going to be an indefinite postponement in the sense of how long they'll be there. We just don't know at this point. Operator : Our next question is from Anthony Paolone from JPMorgan. Anthony Paolone : You talked about just the continued demand for space from your life science companies. And reading these headlines about Google, maybe changing some of their space plans. And so I was wondering if you could talk about when you net all of this, maybe what's happening on Tech and what's happening on life science together, what do you think is happening with your rents? And what do you think will happen with occupancy on the ground in some of your markets? Joel Marcus : Well, I'll ask Steve to come in a minute. But I think in general, we're a dominantly life science focused business. As you know, Tony, for a long, long time. We do have a number of important single-tenant buildings where we have companies like Google. They have the original campus. They started in Facebook, et cetera. We don't typically have multi-tenant office buildings that have lots of different tenants and lots of different in the office. And so we don't think that's going to have any particular impact on us. It may -- more broadly. But Steve, you could comment what you're seeing on the ground? Stephen Richardson : Tony, it's Steve. Yes. Broadly, when you look at just the overall vacancy in these markets, they're typically mid-single digits and even low single digits. Look at Cambridge, 1.8% vacancy, San Francisco, 2.2% availability and on with other regions as well. And then my comment as well, there has not been really any significant sublease space that's come to market since the pandemic. So you do have again, a constrained supply situation. We think pricing power will be maintained the level of demand continues to be strong. Again, April's activity was consistent with what we saw during Q1 and of this year. So the markets are, in fact, healthy at this point, and we're very, very close to them as well with our installed tenant base. Joel Marcus : Yes. I think the bigger question, Tony, that you may be asking, too, is, will these companies somehow decide to put people in more remote locations or even at home. And that's something we just don't know yet. There are obviously a number of office tenants who've indicated that they will have a new way of working, maybe in shifts or, in fact, maybe will wait and do telecommuting until there's either an effective therapeutic or hopefully an effective vaccine as well. So we haven't seen that roll out. But again, in the office world, most of our leases are really full building leases with the major tech companies. We don't have lots of spaces rolling and smaller spaces to deal with. So that's a good thing on the office side. Anthony Paolone : Okay. And then in terms of the acquisition, you walked away from in the quarter. Can you give us a sense as to the size of it? And what changed or what your view of value was and maybe is now to prompt, leaving the $10 million on the table? Joel Marcus : Yes. So maybe I'll have Dean comment and then maybe Steve as well. Dean Shigenaga : Tony, Dean here. So the size of the deal is roughly $150 million to $160 million in that range. And it really came down to economics at the end of the day, during the diligence period, Tony. We constantly revisit the cash flow analysis and our views on the performance of the holding in the near-term was meaningfully different. And when we took it in totality with our business today, and where we want to deploy capital. It was a pretty simple decision, even though we don't take these decisions lightly because you're talking about $10 million. But it's the only transaction I can think of in the history of the company where we've had to do that. And it was well thought through, and I think the prudent decision for us as well as our investors to pause and terminate the deal. Joel Marcus : Was -- keep in mind, it was an office asset in the city of San Francisco. Steve, anything else you'd want to add? Stephen Richardson : No, Dean really covered it there. Anthony Paolone : Okay. But just to make us understand, was it more you just saw your capital better situated somewhere else giving what's unfolded? Or was there some -- it wasn't a matter of the tenant crapped out or something? Joel Marcus : Well, I think in this -- remember what I said, this was an office asset, a multi-tenant office assets. So you can imagine your first question really went to the heart of that as we saw things unfolding in the office sector. Our underwriting changed. And so that kind of alert you to is this where you would want to deploy your capital in this particular kind of environment? The answer was no. Operator : Our next question is from Tom Catherwood from BTIG. William Catherwood : Peter, it was helpful your comments on the seven active construction projects that had been delayed in the three that had been restarted. But you also have another 2.1 million square feet of near-term development opportunities. Have your capital spending plans impacted these projects? And are there some that you're prioritizing over others at this point? Peter Moglia : Yes. So maybe let me ask Dean to kind of take first shot at that. Dean Shigenaga : So Tom, the way we thought about our capital, and this is true for many years now. The large portion of our capital spend is in the category that we always have the flexibility to moderate, like we did just now with our earnings release. These are future projects in the pipeline that have not yet commenced vertical construction not committed to tenants yet. We move them along to shrink the time to deliver, which means everything from entitlement to site work. We could be doing anything below grade, which could include a obviously, infrastructure, but a parking garage, if necessary, just the strength of time to deliver. Now there's still important costs continuing, but the bulk of the spend has been temporarily paused because we think that's the most prudent thing to do in this environment. And I think as we get clarity to COVID clearing out and things getting closer to normal. I'm pretty confident we're going to see opportunities that will present themselves, i.e., tenants looking for expansion capacity within this portfolio of land holdings that we have. And we could do these deals 1 deal at a time, Tom. I think that's the beauty of the position we're in. We can moderate the spend like we have, but we also can be opportunistic when appropriate. And I think that's what we really want to convey. The projects, by and large, remain in the priority, the way they've been disclosed from near term, medium and future. And that's how we rank them generally. But the specific ones that will pull the trigger around will be more demand driven. Joel Marcus : And keep in mind, as we said in our guidance, Tom, one of our overriding goals, having lived through the great financial crisis was to give ourselves maximum optionality so that we adjusted our spend and our go-forward business plan almost on a dime, pivoting very quickly so that we don't need any further -- to raise any further capital this year to accomplish what we presented here on the call. William Catherwood : Got it. That makes total sense. I guess the kind of follow-on to that then would be -- so I assume then you get those projects that are near-term to a level where there aren't startup -- significant start-up costs again. I guess we're thinking longer-term for yield impacts, and obviously, it's very early to be able to tell on that. But I would imagine if it was shut down midstream without full entitlements or without full approval that there would be kind of restart up costs or delays. So all that is part of the calculation? Joel Marcus : Yes. Yes. And I mean, we -- to some extent, did something similar was different, but yet there is kind of a similarity during the great financial crisis when we continue to build the East tower in New York and we shut down the West tower having finished the foundation, but we didn't go vertical, and it turned out to be a really great call. William Catherwood : Understood. And over to acquisitions. Obviously, acquisitions came in higher-than-expected over the past two years. The lower guidance for 2020 makes sense as you talk through your capital allocation plans. But I want to get more color on the transaction market in general. Is part of the lower guidance that you're seeing sellers pull their properties because they're not getting the pricing they want and on the flip side of that -- sorry, go ahead, Joel. Joel Marcus : I was going to say, let me just respond quickly. Now I think that's part and parcel of giving ourselves the maximum optionality where we don't have an assumption of as many acquisitions as we had earlier so that we don't have to tap either the debt or the equity markets at all or even raise money through partial interest sales or whatever. So part of that was -- had nothing to do with the outside state of the market. It had to do with giving ourselves total and maximum optionality here. That was the driving force. William Catherwood : Got it. Got it. I was just wondering as far as if there were opportunities out there that you might like that we missed out on because of the lower guidance, but it doesn't sound like that is the driving force. Joel Marcus : No. Although given where we are today and our balance sheet, as Dean articulated, we have optionality to do a lot of things that maybe we wouldn't have had to do in a different environment. So it really puts us in a in a unique and, I think, excellent position, which is where you want to be if you can be. Operator : Our next question is from Manny Korchman from Citi. Emmanuel Korchman : In your press release, you talked about the fact that a lot of the new ground-up development in your pipeline is supportive of COVID-19 Research. That would obviously imply that, that's a shift as to the work that's happening in those facilities. So one, is that simply an overlap with the tenants that were already signed up and now they're going to be doing that type of work in those facilities? And two, does that mean that there should be more shadow demand for all of the other stuff that they thought they would be doing in those spaces pre covered? Joel Marcus : Well, so maybe the first question, the COVID-19 type requirements or COVID-19 type infrastructure requirements, I should say, in the buildings. These are companies who are already focused in areas of therapeutic need in the antiviral areas and certain testing areas, certain infectious disease areas. I mean, Vera is a good example. That was their business before. And to be able to move from a particular focus in infectious disease or in therapies in the antiviral side to COVID-19 is not much of a stretch. Because the basic capabilities and technology and manpower is already there. So there isn't a lot of big pivoting among tenants who were working at. I mean, the East Lake development for Adaptive. I mean, they are all over the COVID-19 area, but it was a natural progression from where they were. But the second part of your question, yes, we've been already contacted. I can think of personally about a half a dozen e-mails, I've got from individuals from companies where they are looking for additional capability additional facilities for their ramp-up on COVID-19, whether it be vaccine, therapeutics or in fact, in testing. And so we do think there will be some pent-up demand there. Emmanuel Korchman : Great. And then on your comment about sort of the retail environment within your assets, what does that retail look like on the other side of this? Is it going to be a different mix of retail? Is it going to be not retail at all? Sort of help us get out there first of all, what those retail spaces and what will look like? Joel Marcus : Yes. That's really hard to say. My sense is that given that we're not a heavily retail-oriented developer and operator. We think that one by one, we're going to look at the retail operations and see, does this make sense in a new environment, people are going to want clean, prepackaged, probably not so quickly to sit down. So I think there's going to be some shift. Some operators will be pretty facile at being able to do that. And others probably won't. And I think those will just be done on a one by one basis. Luckily, as being said, we don't have immense numbers of retail tenants. So for us, we'll be pretty methodical to try to go through that analysis. But I think it's fair to say until there is a truly effective vaccine, people are not going to be socializing and eating the way they used it. Operator : Our next question is from Jamie Feldman from Bank of America. James Feldman : I was hoping you could talk about your tenant base in the life science tenant base that's not involved in COVID-19. I mean, are those tenants basically still open for business? Joel Marcus : They are. James Feldman : And any pushing for rent relief or any kind of issues on earnings or revenue? Joel Marcus : No. I think what's happening is many of the office type people are working virtually. Because you've got a component in every company depending upon size of people who are just office users. And then people in the labs, labs, by their very nature are essentially, you've got good spacing between people. In fact, when we've done tours in the past, especially a member in San Diego people saying, \"Oh, my God, are there anybody working in the labs. So because on a beautiful day, a lot of times, people worked through the night rather than during the day. But they -- I think people have adapted pretty well, so they have essential crews going in to do continue experiments and mission-critical work in those -- and they shift around on days and weeks, and then those who don't need to be there aren't there until the stay in place orders are lifted. But everything is essentially open and working. But under new rules and new rules of the road, if you will. James Feldman : Okay. And then as you think about long-term building design, do you think there's a lot of talk about what might be different in the office sector. But if you think about the lab sector, do you think this is a catalyst for any changes in space design? Joel Marcus : Yes. So Peter, you want to maybe comment? Peter Moglia : Sure. So Jamie, one of the things that we used to get asked about was the densification trend for office going to affect lab, and the answer was always no because for one, lab spaces as much about equipment as it is about people. So the way that just research has done right now with people kind of that every other bench with equipment filling in, social distancing is really already factored into the design. There may be some things that can be done with circulation within a lab that will examine to make things even safer. But by and large, we've already been studying this. Our traditional lab product is probably already safe in this environment. We're looking at some of our proprietary products that might be a little bit more dense, and we've already got plans in place for some practical reconfigurations that will not be costly, but we'll just create a little bit more safety. James Feldman : Okay. And there's a lot of talk about air quality just for traditional office. Mean are there things in your lab development business that you think are strategic assets or knowledge assets that might actually help you even more in the office business? Or that if you think how that design might change going forward? Joel Marcus : Well, that you're running up, if you don't mind you off, you really answer. Yes, you bring up a really good point. We actually even have one of our large tech tenants, which I won't name because I'm not sure they would want that publicity. But has come to us, they were put into 1 of our large lab buildings and as the only non-lab tenant they really have fallen in love with the high ceiling and the 100% fresh air. This is pre-COVID, by the way, that they had such great experience and such great feedback from their employees that when they go out now with RFPs for new space, they're asking for the same floors and the same air filtration, air changes that we provide. So look, everything that we have that is office with potentially a couple of minor exceptions, is built for laboratory. And therefore, it does have high ceilings. It may have MEP design that is a bit more efficient for office, but we have thought about and put in infrastructure that would enable it to be lab in the future.So we do have the ability to provide an atmosphere from a mechanical standpoint, that mirrors lab. And I think to the extent that office tenants are growing and expanding. We'll see when that happens. But that they will look at buildings like ours, like they have been because we have that advantage. And Steve even mentioned the fit well and the wealth standards, which factor in such things as the amount of natural light that comes into the space, the amount of actual space people have to move around the building, the outdoor space people have to work in. All of those things in this environment are going to be really important as people decide where they want to office. And so our thought to getting into these well and fit well-designed standards is going to pay off not only in our lab business, but for anybody who is leasing office from us as well. James Feldman : Okay. That's helpful. And then finally for me, as you look across the competitive landscape, are there buildings owned by landlords that have balance sheets that may not be so strong? And you kind of see -- you could see some distressed opportunities? Or do you think the better quality buildings that would fit with your portfolio are pretty well owned at this point? Joel Marcus : I would say it's possible. So stay tuned. Operator : Our next question is from Rick Anderson from SMBC. Richard Anderson : So this question has kind of been asked and kind of answered, but not quite. And I wanted to sort of ask it a different way. The 60 tenants, in some way, shape or form involved in the process here and doing awesome things to try to move things along. But is there a -- I know on suggesting they shouldn't be doing that, of course, but is there a short-term potential impact on their own profitability as they -- some amount of resources are redirected towards COVID-19 and their own core drug research business perhaps gets a little bit of a delay. Is that a reasonable way to think about this? Or am I completely off base on? Joel Marcus : Well, I think for those that -- certainly for the bigger pharma and bigger biotech, who actually report quarterly earnings, I think that's a possibility. Saw a little bit of that in Merck's report today, where it's pretty clear that when people can't go visit the doctor can't go into the hospital for normal procedures and you're stuck kind of in your home, your access to medical care. And in fact, pharmaceuticals is a little more problematic. I think for the private biotechs or the biotech companies that haven't reached profitability, I don't think that's such a big issue because it's the pipeline and the value of the pipeline that really counts. I don't know, Jenna, do you want to make any other comments? Jenna Foger : Yes. I think the other thing that I would add, Rich, is really that the platforms themselves that they're optimizing. So in the case of or Moderna, the learnings and the pure intelligence that they're getting by optimizing the platform in this rapid speed and rapid notion is actually incredibly valuable for the company overall. Hopefully, they'll be successful. But even if they're not. So I think that's the way to think about it. And I think, as Joel mentioned, clearly, the large pharma folks will have some trouble of their own as far as clinical trials and progressing. But as far as refocusing efforts to COVID, it's actually not all that expensive for them to do that. So if they're successful, I think it's great and I'll come back to them. And if they're not, it's really not that much because a lot of it is either in collaboration with other biotech companies that they're doing the work or using repurposing old drugs. So I think that's just the overview. Richard Anderson : Okay. Great. And then the other reference earlier in the call was sort of different utilization of office space in the longer-term aftermath of all this. But when I think of your lab buildings, perhaps maybe the build-out there is 50-50 office and lab space. Do you think for that 50 that's on the office side that your tenants might start thinking about a work from home type of strategy? Or is it just too soon to sort of make that call even for the life science component of your business, not the pure office? Joel Marcus : Well, I think at the moment and when they reintegrate into the -- whatever will be the new opening and that's going to be different city by city, state-by-state and even company by company. I think you'll find people working maybe shifts to begin with. Those who can work from home over time will probably be brought back into the system because I think it's pretty clear you -- it's hard to build a culture when you have people or maintain a culture when you have people working from home consistently. And especially a number of those people are senior management of a lot of these companies. So I don't think that's going to be a big issue, but I think it will be a time frame issue. But there's a light at the end of the tunnel because once there's a -- if there is, and we think there probably will be an effective vaccine. Hopefully, that goes away, although the age-old habit of shaking hands, hugging, being close to people probably will be rethought a lot by people and that may never change, except in family settings or things like that. So there will be some long-term changes. But I think as I've described the reintegration, I think that's likely what would happen on the office side. Richard Anderson : Right. Lastly. Sure. Peter? Peter Moglia : If you don't mind. This is Peter. Yes. The people -- a lot of that office space is actually the office space for the people working in the lab. So they do their experiments in the lab, and then they go back to their office and write things up and communicate about those things. So you actually can't work from home. You have -- that office has to be next to the lab because you're going in and out of that. And the majority of our space is revenue-producing space. It's research and development. It's not has nothing to do with back office. I'm sure there's a few companies that we have that may have some back office in there. But by and large, the majority of that office space are people that are actually working in the lab. So that can't be brought home. Richard Anderson : Next question for me is on the VC side. Obviously, some noise, not to be unexpected this quarter. But has it caused you to rethink or tweak that strategy at all? And the answer could be completely no or perhaps... Joel Marcus : Slightly, no. Okay. Yes, the three items that Dean mentioned are all very unique situations. One has to do with just the market. It's more of a consumer kind of product. Another one has to do with -- actually, the other 2 are really primarily due to management issues, not fundamental underlying business issues. And so in any venture portfolio, you're going to expect some don't perform. And yes, no change whatsoever. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll : I wanted to see if we can talk a little bit about the Mercer mega block. It seems like that asset was delayed. I'm not sure if it was delayed because of the current COVID environment or if there's something unique that's going on right there. So how is that acquisition going right now? And is there any changes within expectations? Joel Marcus : Yes. I don't think there's any delays other than COVID. It's just hard to get -- we're in diligence. And it's hard to get things done. Sometimes when cities are shut down when we're shut down to the extent that we have to be and when you're working virtually and mobilely, so I don't see any -- we were -- the anticipation is to close that either toward the end of the year or early '21. And I don't think that's materially changed. Michael Carroll : Okay. Great. And then can we talk a little bit about the leasing activity? And I know you made several comments throughout this call, and it seems like leasing trends are still very healthy. But has it changed, I guess, in the current environment compared to three months ago? Is it harder for people to see certain assets? And is that potentially delaying transactions, but not stopping those transactions? I guess, what's the good way to think about that? Joel Marcus : Yes. Steve, you can take that, but I don't think there's any huge delays and people are virtually looking at assets. Stephen Richardson : Michael, it's Steve. No, that's right. I mean the demand continues, the need for lab space, as Peter has outlined, is qualitatively different than office space. As people's programs and the funding that Joel highlighted in the beginning, come to fruition. They want to keep moving forward. They want to lock down lab space. The markets are very tight. Again, no major subleases have come to the market. So people are still acting with a sense of the need to move forward and do that deliberately and diligently we have been able to go into the market. These are all essential service buildings. In the orders, they are very clearly and explicitly defined biotech and pharma buildings as essential services. So they are open so we continue to see healthy demand. Joel Marcus : Yes. And as you saw from the press release and supplement, we announced that we had considerably upzoned our asset at 325 in and that's a good example during this last month or two of COVID shutdown, we've still seen a remarkable amount of interest in that development as a good example. Michael Carroll : Okay. And then just last one for me, I guess. I know that it seems like there's been a lot of funding coming into the space. I mean, in the post COVID environment, do you think it's logical to assume that there's going to be more funding coming into biotech that could drive, I guess, incremental demand? Or is the demand that you've seen is already pretty at record levels? And that's a pretty good pace. Joel Marcus : I think there's going to be more, and I don't know how things are going to sort out with China, whether they really open up the -- what really happened in Wuhan? I mean, there are a lot of different theories, as you guys know. But whether it was pure research, whether it was maybe a biological weapon. I don't think the web markets were necessarily the exact cause of that, but I'm not the expert. But I think there's going to be a much more intense federal, state and local effort to try to stockpile medicines, therapeutics, testing capabilities, vaccines. And remember, there are more than 1 strain of the coronavirus. And we don't know what other ones are out there and do to come. So I think this is with us maybe for the history of humanity here. Operator : Our next question is from Dave Rogers from Baird. David Rodgers : And maybe following up on Mike's question and some things that both Steve and Peter mentioned earlier. You talked about the activity in the proposal consistent with prior quarters, and that's pretty consistent with what we've talked in the private market as well. But leasing, new leasing activity in the first quarter was just slower. So maybe that -- you could just address that specifically, was that always going to be a little slower just the way the pipeline was materializing? And then maybe take that question to the future and say, second quarter, do we see a spike in COVID leases, third quarter, maybe the core portfolio, fourth quarter, we start to see people committing to kind of multiyear developments? Or do you think it happens more quickly than that? Can you give us maybe just a little bit more color on kind of how you're feeling today about some of the timing around that? Joel Marcus : Yes. I'm not sure anybody really knows, given so many different state local and even commentary on what to do in different locations. But Steve, you could take a crack at that? Stephen Richardson : Dave, it's Steve here. Yes, again, the activity remains consistent. It is consistent across all of the regions. So I think we're very well positioned to capture that demand. We'll just have to see exactly the intensity of the velocity and the magnitude of it. It is high-quality demand, but I think it is still a little bit TBD, but nevertheless, again, April was very encouraging. We're in the full throes of the pandemic, and it was consistent with what we saw during Q1. David Rodgers : In terms of the COVID leasing or the activity that you're seeing there, would that be a notable spike that we'll see coming? Or is it just kind of incremental to the demand that you've already been seeing? Joel Marcus : I think it's hard to say. I think it's possible that when you say spike, I mean, if there's an additional building or 2 requirements, or half a dozen? I mean, don't know if that's considered a spike or a natural evolution of the pandemic response. But we would expect that there are going to be a range of requirements out there, given the amount of money flowing into testing therapeutics and vaccines. I think you have to believe that don't know if it's a Tsunami or a wave, but it'll -- it's going to happen. David Rodgers : Last for me. Dean, I think your comment, if I heard it right, was that you thought gains this year, the realized gains from your equity investments would beat last year's $50.3 million. Talk about maybe the confidence and liquidity around those? Are those largely already identified and likely to be public market sales, so that gives you kind of the confidence in the liquidity for that market. Any thoughts would be helpful. Dean Shigenaga : Sure, Dave. So my comment is really just driven by the historical trend of realized gains. So if you look back over the last number of quarters, it's been roughly in that $14 million a quarter range this quarter, about 15%. And so I think over the last number of quarters, I've always mentioned, I think the best way of thinking about it is to watch the historical trend of where we're headed. And at that run rate at 15 a quarter, just as an example, we're already ahead on an annualized basis to the $50 million that we recognized in 2019. There's a tremendous amount of unrealized gains today in the portfolio, $384 million today. So there's good value still to be tapped. Operator : Our next question is from Tayo Okusanya from Mizuho Securities. Omotayo Okusanya : Just one quick question. I was curious if there was any what the interest in other markets you're currently not in right now, whether there was more interest in some of those markets or less? I think at the Investor Day, there had been some conversation about some markets that you could potentially be looking at outside your current core clusters today? Joel Marcus : Well, I think in this environment, that's not something that we're thinking about at this time. But I think over the long term, there will likely be other markets, but probably nothing we'd comment on at this point. Operator : Our next question is from Manny Korchman from Citi. Michael Bilerman : It's Michael Bilerman. I had two questions. One, and you talked a little bit about this deal that you walked away from the multi-tenant tech office building. Do you have sort of a broader sort of perspective on how you sort of think about your capital investment going forward, whether you view that 100% targeted towards lab and life science, where a lot of the office opportunities you've been involved with have been a byproduct of the markets that you've been in and the relationships that you've developed, does this whole pandemic change the sort of single-use office, either for a single user or a multi-tenant building going forward where you could see the company being going back to being exclusively focused on life sciences and labs? Joel Marcus : Well, I think, Michael, one thing is for sure, we have always put our always allocated capital to our core, which will never change, which is the life science industry. But as you know, the intersection of life science and the whole you might call it, the whole IT world is really booming. And so I mean, telemedicine went from something that millennials or Gen Z or Gen Xers would occasionally use because they're pretty healthy too. Right now, it's -- I think, I've got a note because we're involved with the company that's kind of at the forefront that it's spiked up 85% of what it was 2 months ago. So I think you can't ever forget, I mean, tenants of ours, Google, Verily , Microsoft, others that are heavily, heavily involved in the health care sector. So the 2 overlap in ways that are pretty fundamental. So that will always be of great interest. I don't think we'll have as much interest in pure tech office buildings. But I think where we see a building, as Peter described, that may be an office tenant today, but that's in a great location that we can convert in the future. That -- those would still be of interest. And I don't think we've ever really had interest in owning lots of office buildings, multi-tenant office buildings. Per se. That's never really been a focus of ours. So I think we continue our focus. Michael Bilerman : And then you talked a little bit about sort of all the focus on COVID-19 right now from your tenant base and that there may be clearly some effects from other activities that are not occurring for those tenants. How do you sort of think about the academia side with schools potentially not opening up in the fall. Clearly, a lot of your buildings are in close proximity to key academic institutions, whether it's MIT, UCFS. How do you think about that aspect and what potentially could come out of that of schools don't physically reopen? Joel Marcus : Yes. Well, I think number one, those are mostly for undergraduates. If you look at MIT, a lot of the professors and a lot of the labs are still open. They've gone to COVID related operations where people are cycling in, not at all at the same time. But labs and a lot of the graduate students and professors are still working. So in that sense, that's -- we're not so tied to the undergraduate populations. We don't -- we aren't kind of just out there being near university campus, that's kind of not our business model. But what we are focused on are being close to the fundamental institutions in the United States that have pretty strong computational, biological, chemical, all the right kind of areas where they're going to continue to work and people will continue to visit labs and work in labs. So I don't think that changes anything we're doing any Iota. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for closing remarks. Joel Marcus : Okay. It's been a long call, so sorry for that. Thank you, everybody, and look forward to talking to you on the second quarter call and most importantly, stay safe. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Paula Schwartz : Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I now would like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel. Joel Marcus : Thank you very much, Paula, and welcome, everybody, to Alexandria's second quarter earnings call and our first full quarter done virtually. And as I always do, I want to thank the entire Alexandria family for an outstandingly executed second quarter, really in all respects and by all metrics, as I said, our first full reporting quarter virtually. It was once said -- a couple of notes about change. Everything changes but change. And as I've quoted before, the award-winning visionary author Jim Collins noted, \"To be built to last must be built to change.\" And Stephen Hawking said, \"Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change.\" So Alexandria is, has always been, I think, resilient and very responsive to a changing environment. We're all blessed compared to many who are struggling during this pandemic, and I want to -- my heart goes out and wish everyone both safety and good health here.  And Dean will talk about this, but entire -- our huge kudos to the entire accounting and finance team on our win of NAREIT's Best Communications Gold Award once again. In our first quarter call in -- or on our first quarter call, I should say, we dialed back our growth in light of the uncertainties of the COVID onslaught in all realms. But now that we've gotten through that quarter and through part of -- gotten through the second quarter certainly and into the third quarter, we have a much clearer, I think, view of the landscape going forward. I want to say a couple of things about corporate responsibility. It's a lot in the press, but we're not new to this. And we've included in our press release the panoply of corporate responsibility initiatives. We've worked on very hard over many, many years many long-standing and impactful activities in our regional communities, our truly positively impactful sustainability initiatives, including, our pioneering zero carbon building in South San Francisco. And more recently, in response to the COVID pandemic, we are, in fact, at the vanguard of the life science industry in advancing the search for solutions to COVID-19. I want to also harken you back to our project OneFifteen with Alphabet, the subsidiary of Alphabet, Verily. 72,000 Americans died last year, hard to imagine half of the number that have died of COVID this year but an enormous number and more than in the entire Vietnam War, of opioid addiction. In 2020, deaths are up 13%, and one could imagine why that may be. Last year, we announced our OneFifteen project in Dayton, Ohio to serve as a unique and complete care model -- comprehensive care model really to attack the opioid crisis in America. Our hope was we would build a model that other communities could copy. We pioneered the design and development of the almost 60,000-square-foot campus, and thank you to the great team that worked on this on about 4 acres, which opened to outpatients in the fall of 2019. This month, we completed OneFifteen Living, the residential housing component of the campus. This facility is the so-called sober living facility for patients suffering from opioid addiction to live while accessing full on-campus treatment that will come over time and really, the first full treatment care facility from detox to job placement. Let me shift gears here for a moment and talk about the life science industry, and then I'm going to have Jenna speak after I finish and talk specifically about the 3 most advanced vaccine projects. As we all know, we're living in truly unprecedented times in history with the onslaught of a pandemic, the resultant recession and civil strife in many of our cities. We've seen a significant uptick, however, in demand this quarter across all of our markets, both from new and existing tenants, and that's given us, I think, good comfort. There's been strong bipartisan government support for life science R&D to solve COVID-19. For example, $10 billion has been committed to Operation Warp Speed, and they brought together some amazingly talented people. Of that amount -- or in addition to that, there's a large number, over $7 billion for CDC, over $6.5 billion to the so-called BARDA group, over $3.6 billion to the NIH and over $160 million to the NIH, all supporting COVID-19 pandemic. So far this year, the FDA has approved 25 new drugs. Last year, they approved 48, so we're on our way to maybe beating of the 2019 number. During the first half of 2020, funds raised by life science companies via IPOs and follow-ons almost matched all of 2019. And this is amazing because this happened despite COVID. Venture capital was strong to the tune of about $9.5 billion and 10% more than 1Q this year. And we're pleased to say 80% of all venture capital funding in 2020 has been in Alexandria's region. So before I turn it over to Jenna, let me make a comment. Life probably won't return to normal until we have a widely distributed COVID-19 vaccine, and the good news is this may happen sooner than expected, thanks to years of private investment and new cooperation between U.S. government and drug companies. This taxpayer money could not have been spent better even if some vaccines may -- candidates may actually end up failing. The potential return from resuming normal life is far greater than from all the transfer payments Congress has spent so far, and we hope that this combination of private innovation with faster regulatory action truly pays off. And with that, let me turn it over to Jenna Foger, our Senior Vice President, who coleads our life science team. Jenna Foger : Thank you so much, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. Against the backdrop of this COVID-19 pandemic that has made an indelible mark on our society, the economy and the future of public health, as Joel noted, life science fundamentals remain strong as the biopharma industry represents the beacon of hope and absolutely essential in the fight against COVID-19. We are currently tracking over 80 tenants across our cluster markets who are advancing solutions for COVID-19, and we owe a tremendous set of gratitude to their heroic work. Clearly, as Joel mentioned, the state manufactured vaccine should help bring about the effective end of the COVID-19 pandemic and as a prerequisite to fully reopen society and restore the global economy. As a reminder, given the global demand for a vaccine, multiple vaccines by multiple company sponsors are absolutely required. As such, researchers around the world are working with unprecedented speed and collaboration on at least 165 distinct coronavirus vaccine programs, of which nearly 30 vaccine candidates are already in human trials. And the cornerstone of the U.S. government's effort to expedite the development, manufacturing and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, as Joel mentioned, the administration had allocated $10 billion with Operation Warp Speed initiatives and has awarded grants to a handful of company partners, almost all of which are Alexandria tenants, including AstraZeneca, Emergent BioSolutions, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Novavax and Pfizer. Among these efforts, I want to call to your attention -- your attention to the 3 most advanced vaccine programs from Moderna, Pfizer and AstraZeneca, each a top tenant for Alexandria in their respective regions. Each of these companies has reported early clinical data that points to initial safety and efficacy. And all 3 companies' vaccine programs have now officially enrolled major late-stage pivotal studies and tens of thousands of patients around the world. Moderna in partnership with NIAID and Pfizer partnered with German biotech, BioNTech, are both developing messenger RNA-based vaccines. These vaccines contain instructions that tell ourselves to effectively build the same spike protein that is found on the coronavirus, which helps the virus invade human cells. Our immune system then make antibodies to latch onto and neutralize the vaccine and do spike proteins, such that when a vaccinated person encounters a virus in the future, those vaccine-stimulated antibodies should prevent the virus from infecting healthy cells. Moderna was, of course, the first U.S.-based company to enter its vaccine into human trials, marking an extraordinary and historic fast-tracking of a vaccine construct into the clinic. To date, Moderna has received just shy of $1 billion from BARDA to expedite the clinical development and manufacturing of its lead vaccine candidate. After reporting positive initial safety and efficacy data from their Phase I and II studies earlier this month, demonstrating that healthy volunteers receiving their vaccines produce significant neutralizing antibodies against the coronavirus as well as downstream T cells implying some degree of lasting immunity, both Moderna and Pfizer began to enroll 30,000-plus patients late-stage Phase II/III studies just this past week. Pfizer stated that they should have efficacy data to report as soon as October, and they've also received a $1.95 billion contract from the U.S. government to help deliver over $1 billion of their vaccine by the end of 2021. And finally, AstraZeneca, in partnership with the University of Oxford, uses a slightly different approach to their vaccine development effort using a genetically engineered viral vector to deliver coronavirus genes into cells that similarly encodes the coronavirus' signature spike protein and provoke an immune response. Based on results announced last week, AstraZeneca also shows a relatively safe vaccine with only mild to moderate side effects that successfully engages the human system -- excuse me, that successfully engages the immune system to fight the coronavirus. AstraZeneca has received up to $1.2 billion from the U.S. government to deliver up to 2 billion doses of their vaccine in 2021. So where are we now? Though it is challenging to predict exactly when the vaccine will become widely available, we do expect interim data readouts from each of these 3 pivotal programs and potentially others over the coming few months, which should directionally inform us about the broad safety profile of each vaccine candidate and/or whether each shows continued signs of efficacy. If results are positive, there is, of course, the potential for Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA for any of these vaccine candidates by year-end 2021 and into early -- excuse me, by year-end 2020 and into early 2021. Given that each of these companies is already scaling its manufacturing capabilities to be able to deliver at least 1 billion doses of each vaccine next year, there is a clear path towards the widespread availability of a safe and effective vaccine in the first half of 2021. However, just as it remains unclear how long natural immunity last after a person becomes infected with COVID-19, the durability of a COVID-19 vaccine also remains an open question. Also yet to be determined are the anticipated frequency and cadence at which we will need to get vaccinated, which segment of the population may respond better or worse to the vaccine and what proportion of the population needs to get vaccinated to ultimately drive herd immunity and eradicate COVID-19 altogether. But in the meantime, new antibody therapies by companies such as tenants Eli Lilly and Bayer Biotechnology and others could serve as a bridge to a vaccine and help reduce the severity of COVID-19 in infected patients. There are an additional 300-plus new and repurposed therapies in clinical development and in parallel with increased widespread testing and continued socially responsible behavior, we're hopeful that this virus will become more manageable and less fatal overall. Needless to say, we look forward to continuing to support the mission-critical work of our tenants to overcome this global pandemic within the coming year. And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve. Stephen A. Richardson: Thank you, Jenna. Steve Richardson here, everybody. Good afternoon. As we stated during the Q1 earnings call, Alexandria's role as a proven leader in providing mission-critical and indispensable strategic national health infrastructure is only becoming more important as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to challenge our country. I'd like to acknowledge with a loud shout-out to our full operations team the stellar work they're undertaking as they've been on the job 24/7, providing exceptional and high-quality service to our tenants at Alexandria's essential services facilities, which have been open and fully operational every day throughout this difficult time. The increasing complexity of construction, delivery and ongoing operations of this mission-critical infrastructure is formidable and not an easy task and requires a highly skilled and talented team that Alexandria has carefully built since its inception. We are pleased to report a healthy, dynamic and positive operations and market reality for the company, and I'll tick through a number of pieces of that. Brand loyalty is evident as Alexandria's tenants garner great value in our delivery of excellence in all operational matters. And as such, the company has collected 99.5% of accounts receivable during the second quarter and 99.3% during July so far, truly a testament to both the quality of the companies we serve and the great work by our operations team. Outperformance. During Q2, we outperformed our Q1 leasing activity with a total of 1,077,000 square feet leased. And as we've noted now the past several quarters, this contribution is coming from all regions, with this quarter's significant leasing statistics highlighted by San Diego's activity. Great kudos to the team there. Strong quarter. The rental rate increases continue to be strong with 15% cash and 37.2% GAAP during Q2. Early renewals year-to-date are consistent at our historic levels of 69%. And during Q2, we exceeded that with a figure of 78%. Mark-to-market is at 15.6% cash and 16.1% GAAP, which is pretty amazing when you consider the large number of new Class A facilities we've delivered during the past few years in core markets. Solid occupancy. We were at 94.8% across 28.8 million square feet in the operating portfolio, and taking into account lease-up opportunities at 2 recent key projects in San Diego and South San Francisco, would otherwise be at 97.1%. Finally, market health. Alexandria's core clusters have experienced no significant lab subleases coming to market during the pandemic, an important harbinger for Alexandria's ability to continue solid occupancy levels and consistent cash and GAAP rental rate increases for the balance of the year. As an additional data point, the lab demand has remained steady in the San Francisco Bay area with 2.3 million square feet today versus 2.2 million square feet during Q2 2019. A few requirements were, in fact, on pause during Q2, but we are actively touring prospects again. Tech demand, however, is weaker, falling by approximately 50% compared with 1 year ago, and we will be closely monitoring this segment over the coming months. In conclusion, the Alexandria team is fully engaged, providing operational excellence and importantly, Alexandria's long-term and historic commitment to the life science industry, as evidenced by the fact that the vast majority of leasing this quarter is with executive management teams we worked with as a trusted partner for many years and in some instances, decades. This is a truly unique and irreplaceable competitive advantage and one we relentlessly pursue in an honorable fashion each and every day. With that, I'll hand it off to Peter. Peter M. Moglia: Thanks, Steve. This is Peter Moglia. I'm going to briefly update you on all of our development pipeline activity, acquisitions closed in the second quarter and touch on some capital markets activity. So coming into 2020, we had 11 development/redevelopment projects, and we added 2 this quarter, including the second phase of our 5 Laboratory Drive project in the Research Triangle and 9877 Waples in the San Diego submarket of Sorrento Mesa, which is 100% pre-leased. These development projects are spread among a number of regions and give us a great mix of Alexandria-branded projects to meet the growing demand in all of our regions. Whenever possible, tenants want to locate their mission-critical operations in our high-quality and expertly managed assets. Although we achieved 196,000 square feet of leasing in our development pipeline during the COVID-impacted quarter, the leasing percentage remained 61% as the new leasing was offset by the additional project we added in the Triangle and a positive development at our Arsenal on the Charles project, where we were able to take back a poor performing leased retail space that will be converted to high-value lab office space. Our redevelopment of Arsenal on the Charles of that project has met our high expectations for it. To date, we have signed 3 LOIs for approximately 144,000 square feet. And remember, we only closed on this asset in mid-December, and we have a number of prospects for more. Tenants really like this location and our development plans for it. Despite the continuing overhang of COVID-19, we had an uptick in activity at many of our development/redevelopment projects. In Long Island City, we are in serious negotiations with groups representing 86,000 square feet of demand. At the Alexandria District in San Carlos, we have solid interest from a number of companies aggregating in excess of 200,000 square feet of demand. And up at 101 and 201 Haskins, we're working with 6 companies for space ranging from 20,000 square feet to 100,000 square feet. But COVID-19 is causing some companies to move deliberately. Last quarter, we mentioned that our 7 -- of our 7 projects experiencing -- or 7 of our projects experienced temporary pause in construction, and we're pleased to report that all of them are going forward with no current delays. We reported that we expected about a 1 quarter delay on average for those projects and did not anticipate any material movement in yields. That assessment has been confirmed in our 2Q numbers and is due to the remarkable job of our highly experienced real estate development teams that have done an amazing job managing the impact of delays and other COVID-19-related costs, which include the impact of social distancing, which has reduced our construction efficiency, added costs for safety measures such as the procurement of PPE, a dedicated COVID-19 Safety Officer required in many locations and added security. In addition to the contribution by our highly skilled seasoned team, the minor impact of our yields can also be credited to our highly disciplined underwriting, starting at the acquisition of these opportunities through the development and leasing phases. In the second quarter, we closed on 987-1075 Commercial Street project we discussed last quarter. And we added a prime parcel in the UTC submarket of San Diego across from our 9363 and 9393 Towne Centre Drive project that will be developed into a Class A 200,000 square foot lab office project with the potential of making it larger through an upzoning process. As far as sales activity goes, last quarter, we discussed the strong interest in lab office assets from a diverse set of investors, mentioning Healthpeak's purchase of The Post and Waltham at a 5.1% cap rate and a healthy price per square foot for a suburban asset of $751. We have since learned that Healthpeak has also paid a significant price for the 224,000 square foot 35 Cambridge Park Drive asset in Alewife for a reported $1,484 per square foot at a 4.8% cap rate. We also mentioned last quarter that a reliable source had disclosed that a transaction in the Boston area had gone under contract while in shutdown, and we can confirm that sale occurred. 27 Drydock, a 286,000 square foot lab office project in the Seaport area of Boston, was acquired by Beacon Capital Partners at an estimated cap rate of 4.8% and a price per foot of $916. This pricing was somewhat surprising as the asset is subject to a very onerous lessor-favored ground lease. It's really a good time to be in the market with assets in life science submarkets. We will continue to maintain our highly disciplined approach to underwriting, and we're going to keep you informed of our opportunistic acquisitions and dispositions over the coming quarters. So before I pass the baton, I would -- or we would like to encourage everyone to read Chip Cutter's article that appeared in Friday's Wall Street Journal titled Companies Start to Rethink Remote Work Isn't So Great After All as an alternative to all the press speculating that the office market is headed for the crypt. Laboratory office is not part of the work-from-home trend, but nonetheless, we believe traditional office product is not going anywhere. There will likely be some shifts in use such as workers not coming in every day and a reverse of the densification trend that permeated over the last decade. But there are a lot of reasons to have people physically together, and this article goes into some of them. So with that, I'll pass it over to Dean. Dean Shigenaga : Okay. Thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. Our national essential real estate platform, really combined with our trusted partnerships with some of the most innovative entities in the world, continues to generate high-quality growth in cash flows. 51% of our annual rental revenue is generated from investment grade-rated or large-cap publicly traded companies, really highlighting that our team has curated one of the best tenant rosters in the REIT industry. This high-quality tenant base continues to support growth in our common stock dividends that is currently $1.06 per common share or $4.12 per share on an annual basis and was up 6% over the previous 12-month period. We remain in a great position and continue to benefit from a very strong and flexible balance sheet, the best in the history of the company, really to support our strategic growth initiatives. And more on this in a moment. In June, we published our annual corporate responsibility report, which, along with our supplemental package, highlights our long-standing commitment to ESG, our focus on making a positive and meaningful impact on society and Alexandria's critical role at the forefront of the life science ecosystem, advancing solutions for COVID-19. Thank you to our ESG team for an outstanding job over the last year. Before jumping into the second quarter, I also want to share a shout-out with a huge thank you to our entire team for their 5-time recognition as NAREIT's Gold Award winner for Communication and Reporting Excellence. So congratulations, team. The second quarter results were solid and in line with our expectations. Rental revenue was up almost 20% over the first half 2019. NOI was up approximately 19% over the first half of '19. And adjusted EBITDA margin was very strong at 69% and continues to be one of the top within the REIT industry. Rent collections are now over 99.5%. And our outstanding AR balance as of June 30 represents the lowest balance in the last 12 years. Occupancy trends have been positive this year. However, this is hidden by the 2.3% of vacancy from recently acquired leases. Please refer to Page 23 of our supplemental package for details of this acquired vacancy. Occupancy as of June 30 was reported at 94.8% and included 2.3% of recently acquired vacancies. So occupancy before this vacancy was 97.1%, actually up 38 basis points since December 31. In addition to this key takeaway, it's important to highlight that recently acquired vacancy will provide growth in cash flows as our team executes on these leasing opportunities. Now on internal growth, our operating results continue to benefit from contractual annual rent escalations, averaging almost 3% today. Continued strong same-property NOI growth remains on track with our 2020 midpoint guidance of 5.5% on a cash basis. We also reported continued strong rental rate growth on lease renewals and re-leasing of space of 37.2% and 15% on a cash basis for the second quarter. Our rental rate growth has been amazing since 2015 and has averaged 29% and 15% on a cash basis. Now while our outlook for 2020 same-property NOI growth remains strong, the second quarter same-property performance was slightly impacted by 2 items. First, the second quarter results was impacted slightly by temporary vacancy of about 152,000 rentable square feet from leases primarily located in Cambridge and South San Francisco. About 2/3 of this square footage or 100,000 rentable square feet has been leased with occupancy commencing in the third quarter. If we normalize for this temporary vacancy, the second quarter same-property NOI growth would have been 1.6% and 4.2% on a cash basis and closer in line with our outlook for the full year. Now additionally, we also have other contractual rent increases that will begin in the second half of 2020 for leases at properties located in Greater Boston, San Francisco and Seattle that will bring same-property NOI growth on track with our 2020 midpoint guidance of 2% on a GAAP basis and 5.5% on a cash basis. Now the second item to highlight that impacted same-property NOI growth for the second quarter was retail and transient parking. Now as a reminder, retail represents only 0.7% of annual rental revenue. Approximately half of our retail is paying rent monthly. About half is not paying rent at the moment, and this drives a slight reduction to both GAAP and cash same-property NOI income growth. Now as I wrap up my comments on same property, I just want to reiterate that we are on track for solid same-property and net income -- net operating income growth for 2020. Switching briefly to our venture investments. Over the past year or so, we have been taking advantage of the strength of the capital markets. Our cost basis has remained about the same over the past year, really highlighting that we have been strategically monetizing certain holdings. Additionally, over the past year or so, unrealized gains have grown significantly to $556 million as of June 30. Now realized gains have averaged about $15.3 million per quarter over the last 4 quarters and was $17.7 million in the second quarter of 2020. Now moving on to external growth. Our team completed approximately 200,000 square feet of leasing related to current and future development and redevelopment projects located in our San Diego market. Our active pipeline of development and redevelopment projects consist of 2.3 million rentable square feet and is 65% leased and negotiating today. We also have important near-term and intermediate-term development and redevelopment projects, aggregating an additional 7.6 million rentable square feet. Now congratulations again to our team for transforming our balance sheet over the past decade. Our overall corporate credit rating ranks in the top 10% among all publicly traded REITs. We have one of the highest quality tenant rosters that is driving growth and cash flows. We remain committed to our strong and improving credit profile. Liquidity was about $3.7 billion as of June 30 and even higher after consideration of our $1.1 billion forward equity offering that we completed in early July. Now our debt maturities are well-laddered with no maturities until 2023. The bond market today is extremely attractive. Long-term fixed-rate debt for Alexandria is in the sub-2% range for 10-year bonds. And then this is really amazing when you compare it to cash yields on our development projects in the 6% to 7% range or higher. Concurrent with our common stock offering on July 6, we provided key updates on our sources and uses of capital for 2020. This update reflected continued demand for our well-positioned development and redevelopment projects and our solid outlook for 2020. Our construction spend outlook moved closer to our initial guidance for 2020 and is now $1.35 billion at the midpoint. Additionally, our updated guidance on July 6, that was also reaffirmed yesterday, reflects a strong outlook for acquisition opportunities and builds upon our strong initial outlook that we gave for 2020. Now the midpoint of the range of our acquisition guidance is $1.8 billion. On July 6, we also announced our target for real estate dispositions, including partial interest sales at an aggregate midpoint guidance of $1.25 billion. Now more details on this will be provided over the next quarter or so. We updated our 2020 guidance to a range for EPS diluted from $3 to $3.08 and for FFO per share diluted as adjusted from $7.26 to $7.34. Now as usual, please refer to our detailed underlying assumptions included in our 2020 guidance beginning on Page 9 of our supplemental package. With that, let me turn it back over to Joel. Joel Marcus : Okay. We're ready for questions from the group. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Manny Korchman with Citi. Emmanuel Korchman : Dean, if we think about the accelerated disposition program, a couple of questions there. Maybe just if you could help us figure out how you're weighing or thinking about doing dispositions versus even more equity than you've already done. And maybe helpful on that would be to talk about what types of assets or maybe what markets you're thinking about selling those in and also timing of those sales. Dean Shigenaga : So Manny, let me kick off with a little color. If you look back over probably 5 to 7 years now, we pretty much have been consistent with our sources of capital being from a range of opportunities to blend our long-term cost to capital, and dispositions have been a component going back to 2014, 2015 now. A lot of them have ranged from a partial interest sale, and these are high-valued core assets that we want to retain an ownership in. And so I would say, without getting into a whole lot of details because the deal flow is in process right now, we're looking at opportunities from an outright sale to partial interest sales. These are high-value assets in order to generate some equity capital to reinvest in the business. And then, Manny, just touching on the difference between dispositions and equity capital, there obviously are considerations to be taken when you consider both. I think, for us, it's always been a blend of capital. And our cost of equity has been fairly attractive over the time that I was chatting about since 2014, '15. Looking forward -- and our multiple has only improved, which has improved our cost of equity capital. I do think though it's still prudent to consider dispositions from time to time. And as a result, our program for 2020, given the needs for our business this year, we felt it was prudent to balance the equity needs with some dispositions. I think as we give some color to that program over the coming quarter or so, it will help bring a little more clarity to what we're focused on here. So I think you'll have to stay tuned for market information and details for at least a quarter. Emmanuel Korchman : Right. And maybe just thinking about how tenants, especially the ones that are so involved in searching for the treatment, the cure, the vaccine, whatever it be, how are they thinking about their growth in real estate needs? Is that on the back burner? Or is it just that there's separate teams that are doing one versus the other, and so those are same entities that are looking to lease more space from you or others? Joel Marcus : So Steve, you want to maybe fill that? Stephen A. Richardson: Sure. Manny, it's Steve. Manny, I'd say it's a combination of both. You have existing platforms that the capital markets are very liquid. As Joel was mentioning and Jenna, the strength of the venture and IPO markets, we know of a company that did a virtual road show and went public during this time. So they're using that capital, both for their existing platforms and for any COVID initiatives. In addition to that, we're also seeing manufacturing become a real and viable dimension as well, which is further driving demand. So you've really got 2 elements, the COVID R&D and then the COVID kind of very early manufacturing as well continuing to drive demand. And that is broad-based across a number of markets. Joel Marcus : Yes. You could also note, Manny, that there was an announcement yesterday that the U.S. government would loan Eastman Kodak, a company that failed to adopt Jim Collins' notion of change, $765 million as part of a wider attempt to bring pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing back to the United States. So I think you're going to see a lot of activity in the entire supply chain issue when it comes to biopharma. Operator : And our next question will come from Sheila McGrath with Evercore. Sheila McGrath : I was wondering if you could give us more insight on the Sorrento Mesa leasing that you mentioned. Did you have a tenant in hand before you purchased 9877 Waples? Joel Marcus : We did. And it was -- yes, Sheila. And it was a COVID-related requirement. So the answer is yes. Sheila McGrath : Okay. And then on the quarter, I was surprised that you had over 1 million square feet of leasing activity. Was that just other activity that's spilled into the quarter? Or were there any new requirements during 2Q? Joel Marcus : So Steve, you could give color, but I hope you weren't surprised that we had 1 million square feet. We weren't. We thought it would even be bigger. But anyway, Steve? Stephen A. Richardson: Yes, Sheila, a couple of things there. Again, it has, as we've talked about for a number of quarters, been broad-based across nearly all markets. As I did highlight, San Diego, in particular, was kind of a standout there. But nevertheless, all markets were contributing. No, not necessarily surprising. The impetus for space, the sense of urgency is still there. Literally, 78% were early renewals during this Q2 time period. So we have very, very close long-standing relationships with these tenants. So this was to be expected during this quarter. Sheila McGrath : Okay. And last question. You did just mention, I think, Steve or Joel, on the manufacturing being a new source of demand. Would Alexandria be interested in owning any of the pharma or vaccine manufacturing facilities? Joel Marcus : Well, we already do, and some of them are embedded in assets we own. Some are dedicated manufacturing. Others are pilot manufacturing or other clinical trial, scale manufacturing. It kind of spans the gamut. But yes, we're finding that there is a need, I think, hopefully, that we can bring a bunch of the critical manufacturing and other supply chain needs of biopharma products back from overseas, including China, for our own protection. And yes, we are very interested. And now we wouldn't be interested in a random manufacturing in the middle of nowhere. But if they're in strong submarkets that are tied to core markets, that's a good thing. Operator : And our next question will come from James Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. James Feldman : I wanted to just get your thoughts on the election and even with Prop 13 coming up before we know it. What are you concerned about most if it's a Biden win? And how do you think about the risks? Joel Marcus : Yes. I'm not sure I want to comment out about 100 days. I think on the third quarter call, it will be better. We'll have a more triangulated view who Biden's Vice President is. We don't know that yet. It's very important who may be in the cabinet. But to me, it's a worry for everybody because to elect somebody who may not be in the best of health would be a worry there, and that's unfortunate. It's too bad we don't have 2 45- or 50-year-olds running, but that's the way it worked. So I think I'll reserve comment until the third quarter, and we'll have a better view on things. The other part of your question, I'm sorry, I forgot. James Feldman : Just you guys are sitting in California, just your thoughts on Prop 13. Joel Marcus : Yes. So I don't know, Peter or Steve, you guys want to talk about Prop 13? Peter M. Moglia: Yes, sure. This is Peter. I have sat in on some calls with a committee that is running the campaign against it. They feel like there's a better than 50% chance it does not pass, but I'm sure it's tight enough to make everybody a little bit nervous. I think we're in good shape because a number of our assets in California are -- were developed by us in the last few years. So I don't think from a -- and plus we have a triple net lease structure so we would fare better than others. But given the current economy, I don't think it would be good news to help California out of its troubles by making it harder to do business. James Feldman : Okay. That's helpful. And then Peter, you had mentioned the Wall Street Journal article, I just want to get your thoughts. I know that tech is a smaller part of your business, but you do have Facebook, Uber and Stripe on your top tenants list. When you think about the Bay Area specifically, from your vantage point on the ground there, what do you think changes in terms of how people use office space? And especially more among the tech companies, do you think they will be doing more work from home or more flexible work arrangements, which will have a longer-term impact or even satellite offices? I'm just curious what you guys are hearing on the ground. Peter M. Moglia: I think Steve can talk to the San Francisco specifics, but I think there's been a lot of talk over whether or not offices is going away or not. I think the consensus is that things are going to work differently that the majority of people, 75% to 90%, depending on the survey you look at, want to go to work. They want to separate their home life from work. I know I personally do because it just becomes very odd to live your life in a constant state of work. But the advantages are becoming more and more apparent. It's very difficult to train people when they work from home. So you're onboarding people on a Zoom. Very difficult to transfer your culture. How do you celebrate a win? How do you commiserate a loss? You're not going to just get on Zoom and say, \"Hey, let's celebrate.\" You're in the office, something great happens. You high-five your colleagues, everybody goes and gets a cup of coffee or whatever and talks about it and just develops a bond. That does not work on Zoom. Same thing when you lose a deal, the debrief, the commiseration. What did we do wrong? How can we do better next time? Ideas, strategies in front of a whiteboard. One of my rare trips into the office recently was to meet somebody so we could get on a whiteboard because we needed a storyboard presentation. And I just couldn't do it on Zoom. So I think companies are going to realize that for retaining employees, they're going to have to establish a culture with those employees because otherwise, it just becomes a battle of salary and benefits. If people don't really feel connected to the company, why should they stay there? Somebody else is offering a few more shillings. So I think you're going to hear more and more about that. I think we've done really well as a business community in the United States in managing productivity and keeping it going. But I think cracks are starting to appear, and that's what that article kind of goes into. I don't know, Steve, if you want to talk about the tech company. Stephen A. Richardson: Yes. Thanks, Peter. Jamie, Steve here. Yes, if you look at tech demand from San Francisco down to the peninsula, say, Palo Alto as I referenced, it has fallen by about half. We had a little over 7 million square feet of demand this time last year. Now it's about 3.5 million. I think a lot of that is as a result of exactly what Peter is saying. People are navigating this. In the scheme of things, it's still kind of early innings as to the outcome. So we're certainly monitoring it closely. Having said that, the context is -- SoMa, for instance, now has a 4% vacancy rate versus 1.3% vacancy rate. When you've got big floor plates, kind of lower mid-rise construction in those areas, which is probably more desirable COVID-wise, the peninsula has gone from 7% to 9.9%. So on a relative context, it's still healthy there. And then I talked with somebody this morning who had a little bit of insight into Google's stay at home until summer '21. And their understanding, chatting with people at Google is it's really primarily driven by the school year. They were trying to provide certainty to families as the next school year is still highly uncertain. And ultimately, it's voluntary at this point. So we're monitoring it closely. We are getting direct intel. I think it's still kind of early innings, and we'll keep everybody updated as it unfolds. James Feldman : Okay. Thank you, and congratulations on the quarter. Joel Marcus : Thank you, Jamie. Operator : And our next question will come from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan. Anthony Paolone : On the tech demand side, you mentioned down 50%. Can you talk about whether that has any impact on how you're looking at any of the developments in your pipeline? Was anything dual tracked? Or does it make you change directions on anything that you're planning if that piece of the demand picture pulls back? Joel Marcus : Yes. I think, in general, no. Anthony Paolone : Okay. And then in terms of you are increasing your net investment activity as you look to the back half of the year. But you also talked about just the amount of capital out there that has paid some big numbers for deals, and it just seems anecdotally that there's a lot of folks that certainly like your business right now. I mean how did you think about just increasing the capital deployment, returns? And what have you been seeing in terms of competing to buy product, whether it's land or existing assets in this environment? Joel Marcus : It's a pretty broad question. I don't know, maybe try to be more specific, if you could, because I'm not sure we want to get into acquisition pipeline discussions or things like that until we can actually disclose something. Anthony Paolone : Yes. I'm just trying to bridge sort of what seems to be more capital being pointed towards your markets and your space, at the same time not driving up activity. Joel Marcus : Yes. I think the 3 sectors, generally, people are seeing today that have been fairly COVID-resistant or resilient is obviously logistics, data centers, life science. There are others, but those have been the primary ones. And so it's natural for people to think about how do I do this. But it's a lot more difficult in a sense because it's not like a company is moving into a generic office. These are fairly mission-critical facilities for companies and entities, and they really don't -- they're pretty picky about locations. They're pretty picky about the details of the improvements in the deliveries and the certifications and things like that and how they're going to operate. So there may be money and so forth. But if people mess up, they won't be given a second chance by tenants. That's for darn sure because when you have millions of dollars of experiments at stake, it's different if you're JPMorgan in an office versus a COVID therapeutics company and something goes wrong. So that's kind of a perspective. Operator : And our next question will come from Tom Catherwood with BTIG. William Catherwood : Following up on Tony's question on acquisitions. Joel, last quarter, you had been maybe a little -- call it a little cagey on the potential for acquisitions to ramp back up, especially with maybe more product coming to market. So my question then, given that, obviously, you acquired a bunch this quarter and there's more to come and you raised guidance. The additional acquisitions, were those primarily ones that you were already looking at prior to COVID? Or were those acquisitions that have come up kind of since COVID? And then the second part to that is, what do you think the opportunity set looks like moving forward? Is there a chance for kind of more assets coming on? Is there any chance for distress out there in the acquisition field? Joel Marcus : Well, so first, let me correct the characterization. I don't think I was being cagey. I think, honestly, when we reported the end of April, I think, in the first quarter, think about we had only been shelter-in-place for 45 days. And so when the executive management team looked at our balance sheet, which is in great shape and looked at our prospects, at our pipeline, we wanted to be really careful having lived through '99, 2000, having lived through '08, '09. We wanted to be very careful about really reining back our commitments. And so we did do that in a very, very, I thought, thoughtful and careful way. So I don't think it was caginess at all. It was really one out of concern that we don't know what this thing is. I mean we know what it is, but we don't know what damage it can do, COVID-19. We don't know -- we had no real information from China as to what went on there in places that were hard hit and so forth. It just was a very nontransparent situation. So none of us had any idea what to -- what it was going to happen. So we had to be very conservative about our go-forward game plan. But I think as time wore on in the second quarter and it was clear that the industry was really being marshaled to really come up, as Jim had talked about, whether it's testing, the diagnostics side, therapeutic side and importantly, the all-important vaccine side, the government's real ramp up, especially on this Warp Speed project on the vaccine or Warp Speed project. I think it gave us better confidence that we could ease our concerns and go back to a more growth plan, but still, I think, carefully guarded. Now some of the acquisitions -- I mean, acquisitions don't hang on for months and months. So I'm not sure there were a lot that were before that we may be still looking at, and there are processes that go on. But I think from time to time, people see a pretty buoyant real estate market. Peter cited pretty low cap rates on secondary location assets that are pretty strong. So people are thinking of maybe trying to maybe exit or other people are trying to come in. And I think we've just tried to be super thoughtful and super smart and disciplined, most importantly. We learned that from the teachings of Jim Collins about what we do and how we do it. I think the Arsenal that I think Peter, Steve alluded to, campus that we bought last quarter in Watertown is a great example. So I think that's how we have journeyed through this last couple of months. William Catherwood : That's completely fair. And I think your -- the conservative classification is much better than the one that I gave. And then you're absolutely right with that. Along those lines, Joel, Seattle has obviously been a key area of growth for you guys over the last few years. Most of your portfolio has been focused in the South Lake Union submarket. But this quarter, you disclosed some previous acquisitions in the Pioneer Square submarket, and it looks like you've added a substantial development site outside of your core markets in Seattle as well. So can you kind of speak to the -- your investment strategy in Seattle and maybe what's driving you or what you're seeing in other submarkets that's increasing your interest? Joel Marcus : Well, let me say, overall in Seattle, where we have an important presence there. We started back in 1996. So we've been in that market for a long time, and it's an important market for us. It is one of the markets that, thankfully, has taken advantage of the confluence of life science and information technology. We just topped out Adaptive's building on the lake at Eastlake Union 1165. We're building for them and the big -- or a big joint venture with Microsoft focused on COVID-19 issues. We have a very small presence in Pioneer Square that we kind of put our toe in the water a couple of years ago. I think the most recent acquisitions are south of that, so they're really not in Pioneer Square. They're more really in the Stadium area, and those are more long-term kind of thinking. But we just want to be careful because Seattle has been one of those hotspots for civil unrest. And some people have attacked, I think, without any real fair balance on -- they've gone after Amazon and Starbucks. Starbucks certainly is one of the most heralded and great companies. Amazon certainly is. But Starbucks, in particular, has done a great job for, I think, people. And so you see some of that stuff that's pretty disconcerting. But we hope that comes under control and that the city and the state really try to really go forward with a very positive game plan. So I think it's a little bit of a wait and see on some of those things. But that was a little bit forward thinking. I'm not sure we would -- those wouldn't be coming to the -- in the development in the near term, for sure. Operator : And the next question will come from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Richard Anderson : So I just want to make sure I kind of understand this. When we talk about the vaccine and the duration by which you would be -- it would maintain antibodies and thereby, protect people from the disease. I've heard in spots that it could be maybe 6 months where you'd have to go twice a year to get another kind of booster. Correct me if I'm wrong on that, number one. Number two, would that be a good thing from your tenants' perspective or a bad thing? I'm trying to sort of triangulate how permanent the condition COVID-19 will be for the underlying workings of your tenants, if vaccine happens and it's like a measles vaccine, it's good for life. Maybe things go back to normal in that regard. I'm just curious if you can sort of kind of explain that logic to me. Joel Marcus : Yes. So I'll have Jenna answer that in a second, but let me just say that each of the 3 most advanced candidate cases that she talked about, each have varying antibody immunity. I think Moderna probably is shown among the best, but no one really knows at this point the duration. But remember, much like everything in life, there will be in -- certainly in the biotech and pharma area, there will be dramatic improvements. I mean there'll be vaccine 2.0, 3.0, 4.0. So I wouldn't get too hung up about 1.0. But Jenna, you want to maybe comment on Rich's question? Jenna Foger : Sure. Rich. So yes, on the booster question, I think the idea is that there likely will need to be booster for some of these vaccine programs. I don't think that, that is necessarily a bad thing. I think Joel kind of hit the nail on the head that we really just don't know. The virus has only been known to us for 6 months, 7 months, 8 months. So we really need to learn more. But I think as far as these vaccines, in general, I do think that this will be -- if approved, they will be a revenue stream for these -- our tenants for the foreseeable future. But I also think that the knowledge that has been gained and the approach to vaccine development, in general, that has been gleaned from this experience will be absolutely lasting and so will poise a lot of these companies to develop additional products thereafter. Richard Anderson : Great. Great. I kind of asked a version of this last time, but let me ask it again. Have you seen a change in how your tenants are sort of attacking the situation, reallocation of IP or hiring more people? Is there more demand for space because of COVID-19 juxtaposed to their core drug research business that was near and dear than before COVID-19? I'm just curious if this has all created more manpower within your buildings. Joel Marcus : Yes. I think the answer is a simple yes. I think it's an add-on. It's a bolt-on. Some companies, it's dramatic. Other companies, it may not be existent. In other companies, it may be more minor. But the answer is yes. And the amount of money going into this because think about there's testing, all kinds of diagnostics, then you've got the holy grail of therapeutics and vaccines. So -- and then remember, COVID-19 isn't likely to be the last infectious disease agent that we see. I mean I think people worry about -- I mean the big worry would be would somebody try to weaponize these things so you get into a whole government need to prevent -- or to stockpile antibiological agents. So this is a big, big thing that's going to go on for quite a while here. Richard Anderson : Okay. And then Peter, last question, you mentioned some of the investment activity happening around your portfolios. Are you seeing any different money come in capital-wise, looking at these life science assets? Or is it pretty much the same players just being more -- perhaps a little bit more aggressive in the space? Peter M. Moglia: There's been a pretty large cohort of investors that we've been tracking ever since we started selling assets in '13. I don't think the mix of them has changed much. It's just they're probably a little bit more aggressive today. Richard Anderson : Thanks very much. Great quarter. Joel Marcus : Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question comes from Dave Rodgers with Baird. Dave Rodgers : Peter, you mentioned earlier that construction timing was really not having a big impact on your yield returns expectations, costs, et cetera, which was great. Maybe take it a step further. Is there anywhere where this kind of work-at-home environment for cities is causing zoning or entitlement issues? And then how do you look at construction costs and the impact on kind of zoning entitlement and construction costs on that next wave of development? Any thoughts on that? Peter M. Moglia: Yes. It's funny. It's like 2 things that just offset each other. On the one hand, there's less staff, and we are submitting plans for permits and things, and they're going to people that are working from home. So that would say, \"'Jeez, inefficiency, timing delays.\" But on the other hand, nobody else is developing really much anymore. So the activity is down. So I think that net-net, we're going to be fine as far as getting our permits and things like that. To the extent that something needed to be done, and I hear public hearing or something, it can get a little tricky. But so far, we've been able to get through those hurdles. Dave Rodgers : On the construction cost side, any early reads on where that might be as you're buying kind of the future jobs? Peter M. Moglia: We actually have been analyzing that in detail. I know Dean and I have both been looking at it. It's all theoretical right now that the pace of work could slow down, taking pressure off material and labor costs. I will say we haven't seen it yet, but it would -- it wouldn't be unreasonable to think that at least costs would flatten out. Dave Rodgers : Fair enough. I think in your release, there was a comment about maybe a project that you guys have written off that you were acquiring that you decided not to acquire. I read it as maybe being incremental to the one you discussed on the last call. But if it's the same, then it doesn't matter. But if it was incremental, any details that have maybe more of an office component or more retail to it that just you couldn't get comfortable with. Joel Marcus : I think it was the same thing. We... Peter M. Moglia: Yes. It was the same one. Dave Rodgers : Okay. I wanted to double-check. Dean, moving on to you. I think $29 million of free rent burn-off, you mentioned, coming from leases that have started but not burned off that free rent yet. Is that in the second half of this year? We get that next year? Dean Shigenaga : It -- I think, for the most part, is being absorbed over about 4 quarters, Dave? Generally, those numbers we update every quarter. And on average, almost all of it is rolling in over 4 quarters. The number is updated the next quarter because some has come in and some deliveries may have occurred. So over time, it's a different mix. But historically, it's generally been burning off over 4 quarters. Dave Rodgers : Great. And then lastly, Dean, maybe with you again on maybe guidance around the realized gains for the second half. I know it's really what you guys choose to sell. It's how you get there. You've made a lot of money in the business. You gave a really good disclosure about it in the supplement. It's running about -- if you annualize the second quarter, it's about $0.55 a share of earnings. But any thoughts on how that would kind of play out in the second half with the strong market that we've seen so far. Do you anticipate continuing to sell? Dean Shigenaga : Yes. I think pretty consistent, Dave, with what I've mentioned over the last few quarters. The portfolio has done well. And I think you pointed that out. But the run rate I touched on specifically, it's averaging $15.3 million per quarter, maybe a little bit upward this quarter at $17 million approaching $18 million. So that run rate historically, I think, is a good view for how you should think about the run rate over the next number of quarters. We -- I think it's prudent for us to monetize some of these investments at this point. We've made money. Some of them might -- we believe strongly, and we'll make more money, so we're going to hold a number of them. But I think it's prudent to prune. So you should have a decent run rate looking forward. Dave Rodgers : Okay. And then I don't know if this last one is maybe for Steve. I'll just throw one more in. I think you have about -- and I might ask something similar to last quarter, but 420,000 square feet of lease is still expiring this year that are negotiating, it looks like, or that may have an unclear resolution yet, another 1.1 million next year. I realize that you have a lot of small leases in there, and it's kind of hard to get visibility far out on those. But in terms of what's yet to be committed, is there anything known to be moving out besides those redevelopment assets? Or are you feeling really good about the remaining renewals? Stephen A. Richardson: Yes. Dave, it's Steve. Yes, we just got about 3% to resolve back in the second half of the year here. We started at 6.7% so we're already 60%, 70% through that. We've really just got 3 different suites, San Francisco, Boston, San Diego, that are in excess of 70,000 feet. So nothing overly challenging. I think we're making good progress on one of them. Another one, I think we'll be able to reposition successfully. So yes, nothing to be too concerned about there in 2020, for sure. And then '21, again, when you look at the early renewals, we've only got 5.7% in rollovers happening in '21. So we'd expect kind of consistent with what we've seen historically with early renewals and just a handful of any size, over 70,000 feet, just a couple there. Operator : And our next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll : Peter, can you provide some color on the recent and the pending acquisition? I guess, specifically, there's a fairly large pending bucket, I think, totaling about $780 million. I mean how far along is the company on these negotiations? Have these deals already been awarded to ARE? It's just a timing issue right now? Peter M. Moglia: Yes. So let me jump in and say, I think we'd prefer not to comment on those. But just I think Dean mentioned, stay tuned for third quarter. It just can't do it at the moment. Michael Carroll : Okay. And then I guess, on some of the assets that you've acquired, obviously, the recent acquisitions, there's a lot of future developable sites. What's the timing typically on these types of properties? And when do you expect to start breaking ground? Is there a plan there? Peter M. Moglia: Yes. Everyone is totally different. So if you looked at -- I mean, 2 examples, I mentioned the question on Seattle, that's more into-the-future development site. And if you compare that to, say, the Watertown, that would be maybe more in the near to medium term. So each one is different based on the campus, the location, what's going on, demand, what's going on in that market. So there's no general way to generalize. Each one is highly specific and kind of cultivated. Stephen A. Richardson: And I can confirm that we know they're going into it. So we put a lot of carry costs into our future basis as we underwrite these things. Michael Carroll : Okay. And I think that you did a pretty good job, I think, in the supplement for the -- you talked about the percent of, I guess, covered land plays that you have. Is a lot of these deals that you're looking at now, too, that you're willing to have and maybe a little bit of longer development time you have the covered land place? Peter M. Moglia: Yes. Again, each one is different. So let us not characterize anything at the moment. Sorry about that. Operator : And our last question today will come from Tayo Okusanya with Mizuho. Omotayo Okusanya : Congrats on a great quarter. I just wanted to kind of talk a little bit about acquisitions going forward. In the past year or 2, a lot of the acquisitions have kind of focused very heavily on purchasing assets that have a lot of future development potential. Is that the way we should still be thinking about acquisitions going forward? Or do we kind of start to see acquisitions as kind of operating assets going forward? Joel Marcus : Yes. I think Mike Carroll just asked that question maybe in a different way. I think every situation is different. So I don't think there's -- we don't want to characterize anything at this point. So I'm not sure it's good to think about one way or another just -- they'll be what they'll be, and they'll stand on their own. And let's just wait for each one to unfold as appropriate. Operator : And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks. Joel Marcus : Yes. Just thank you, everybody. Please stay safe and be well, and we'll talk to you on the third quarter call. Thank you again very much. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz with Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Paula Schwartz : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel. Joel Marcus : Thank you, Paula, and welcome, everybody, to Alexandria's third quarter call. With me today are Dean Shigenaga, Steve Richardson, Peter Moglia and Jenna Foger. I'd like to welcome everybody and -- from the Alexandria team and family wishing -- hoping you're all well, safe and COVID-free. As all of us know, 2020 has been an astounding year of the never-imagined confluence of a international pandemic from Wuhan, China; a deep shutdown recession; civil strife; coupled with a heated and complex election upcoming here next week. 2020 started off very sadly with the untimely death of Kobe Bryant, not only a great athlete but a special human being. And I want to make just a brief quote from one of his great things. He often said that, \"Great things come from hard work and perseverance.\" And those of you who knew or watched or admired Kobe, always, he was the last guy to finish up and the first guy to start, and was one of the hardest working people anyone could ever imagine. And that really exemplifies our team, and want to thank our team from the bottom of our -- my heart and our team's heart, for doing such a great job. Alexandria has really uniquely achieved 3 outputs that are very rare in corporate America today that define a truly great company : continuing superior results, continuing distinctive impact and lasting endurance. And again, we want to thank our entire team for a stellar third quarter as we are all building the future of life-changing innovation, literally during COVID-19. One could never imagine that. So a couple of different comments. I wanted to comment on the recent Blackstone transaction where Blackstone announced the recapitalization of its life science real estate business. And it only serves, I think, to reconfirm once again the great vote of confidence in the life science real estate niche we pioneered in 1994. The transaction implies an approximate $1,070 price per square foot for that 13 million square foot portfolio. And I think compared to where Alexandria trades more or less today at about $950 a square foot, I think that's, I think, very good benchmark for us. Blackstone timed its, I think, 2015 purchase really quite ideally as the biotech industry was emerging from about a 5- or 6-year bear market in the 2013 and 2014 time frame. And at that time, when they acquired the assets, they were, by and large -- most of the buildings were older than Alexandria's, and they were not in as strong locations as we were. They've clearly enhanced that portfolio since, and kudos to them for doing that. I want to take a particular mention on third quarter activity on our Research Triangle acquisition, which is really a particular note. A large acquisition, about $590 million purchase price, about $265 a square foot, 2.2 million square feet over about 300 acres, 20 buildings with very high credit tenant but also significant value add. This acquisition substantially increased our footprint in Research Triangle, and particularly was motivated by our need to accommodate numerous inbound substantial tenant requirements, both who needed existing solutions and build-to-suit capabilities. We now have 3 mega campuses in the Triangle, this newly branded campus, the Alexandria Center for Life Science \u2013 Durham; the Alexandria Center for AgTech; and the Alexandria Center for Advanced Technologies. We see continuing strong demand for life science base across our markets, but particularly pointed are the many requirements from our own tenant base within. Also, it's important to remember, 2 key truths have really been revealed by COVID-19. One is the resilience of -- and the need for domestic medical supply chains to be here based in the United States, crucial for national security and for medical supply. And I think it only reinforces that complex medicines are really the future of health care. And I guess the famous COVID-19 antibody cocktails would be a good example of that. I wanted to mention a little bit about Operation Warp Speed. This was initiated by the Trump administration and supported by more than $10 billion in funding through the CARES Act. Operation Warp Speed led by really a legendary, probably one of the most skilled vaccine developers in the entire world, Moncef Slaoui, aims to deliver 300 million doses of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine in first quarter as part of a broader strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics. Really all in tandem, very different than the government has ever operated before and really a great credit to public-private partnerships. The Warp Speed partnership is between selected biopharma companies and key federal science agencies, including BARDA, CDC, DoD, FDA, HHS and the NIH. As of October 21, the initiative announced funding decisions totaling over $13 billion for 10 companies -- more than 10 companies to support vaccine therapy and manufacturing efforts. These included virtually all of which, maybe except one, our tenants of Alexandria, Moderna, GSK, Sanofi, Pfizer, Novavax, AstraZeneca, J&J, Merck, Regeneron, Emergent Bio and Fujifilm. So quite a humongous feat, I think, given the onset of this pandemic in a pretty odd fashion. I think to this date, there is certainly speculation that this was not a natural occurring virus, but one that was man-made in a lab in Wuhan. A couple of comments about the life science industry. And again, a real shout-out to the great private-public partnerships that have been formed in so many different fashions. The life science fundamentals throughout 2020 have remained fundamentally strong, especially given the critical nature of the fight against COVID-19. This has helped lead to substantial progress and acceleration including late-stage vaccine trials and therapeutics, along with improved and expanded testing. The life science industry has not slowed down its pace. It's important to remember of investment in innovation well beyond COVID-19. The industry's commitment and investment in innovation, along with the FDA's ability to continue to operate at a high level despite the pandemic, has led to 40 new drug approvals as of the end of September, which puts us on a pace to meet or exceed the 51 average of the past couple of years. I was on a call last week with Commissioner Hahn. And it's a great credit to he and the entire professional workforce at the FDA for their really 24/7 effort in this time. Life science venture funding has continued to flow at a strong pace in the third quarter, setting new quarterly records at almost $12 billion, with more than $30 billion raised through the first 3 quarters, really surpassing all previous annual totals. It's important to remember that most of the -- this investment, 80% comes from Alexandria's core markets. And especially greater Boston, San Francisco, which capture about 60%. Capital flows to early-stage companies and the public markets continue at a fast pace. There have been 47 pharma and biotech IPOs in the first 3 quarters of this year, raising almost $9 billion larger than any previous year. And the companies have been able to access capital markets at historic levels approximating almost $35 billion in follow-on offerings, surpassing the previous high of about $29 billion in 2015. So all in all, it's been a pretty strong tailwind for the industry and what we're doing. So with that, I'd like to turn it over to Jenna Foger, our Senior VP of our Science and Tech team, and she's going to talk about the latest developments in the vaccine therapeutic area. So Jenna, please? Jenna Foger : Thank you, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. So as this unprecedented pandemic races on, giving rise to a new record high resurgence in COVID cases across the country and forging an indelible mark on the global economy, society and, of course, the future of public health, the imminent need for safe and effective treatments of vaccines to combat this coronavirus is paramount. And those skepticism and impatience have set in as each and every one of us navigates this uncomfortably discomforting human experience of waiting, never before has the work of our tenants in the life science industry have been more important. In the mission-critical and absolutely essential efforts of our nearly 100 tenants with meaningful COVID programs represent the beacon of hope for an end to this COVID-19 pandemic. In aggregate, our tenants in the life science industry also represents the solution for the longer-term impact to human health, which COVID has urged us all to rethink an increased focus on prevention, overdue innovation and infectious disease and other neglected therapeutic areas, and new paradigms for R&D collaboration, next-generation manufacturing, supply chain efficiency and improved distribution and access to new medicines. Clearly, a safe and effective vaccine should help bring about the effective end of the COVID-19 pandemic, and is absolutely a requisite to meaningfully reopen society and restore the global economy. As such, researchers around the world are working with unprecedented speed and collaboration on at least 135 distinct coronavirus vaccine programs, of which nearly 50 vaccine candidates are already in human trials. As Joel mentioned, a cornerstone of the U.S. government's effort to expedite the development, manufacturing and distribution of COVID-19 treatments and vaccines is, of course, the Operation Warp Speed initiative with the vast majority of its grant recipients being to Alexandria tenants. So among these efforts, I want to call your attention to 4 of the most advanced vaccine programs from Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Novavax, each a top tenant for Alexandria in their respective regions, and each applying a slightly different underlying technology and approach to vaccine development. Each one of these companies has reported clinical data that suggest initial safety and efficacy, and each are currently conducting major Phase III studies with tens of thousands of subjects around the world. Key data readouts from each of these companies are expected in the fourth quarter of this year spanning between now probably November and December. Together, these 4 companies alone are building capacity to provide over 6 billion doses next year. So what do we make of all of this? And it's the constant flow of headlines. It is highly likely that at least one, and likely more than one of these initial Phase III trials will report interim efficacy results in November and December of this year. If they do, the FDA could grant emergency use authorization by year-end or very early into 2021, which would enable the highest risk populations like health care workers and others to begin to receive the vaccine over the coming months. The FDA has set the minimum standard efficacy threshold for all COVID vaccines at 50%, meaning that a vaccine will have to protect at least 50% of those receiving it to receive emergency use authorization. And based on some of the data that's come out to date and the time that it's taken for companies like Pfizer or Moderna and others to report their data, health care analysts have begun to predict efficacy more likely in the range of at least 70%, but all obviously remains to be seen. As more data becomes available and the vaccines begin to be distributed, if safety and efficacy persists, these companies and others could receive FDA approval in the first half of 2021 with widespread distribution of safe and effective vaccines to the public sometime in the next year. Given the addressable population, pretty much the entire world, this will not be a winner-take-all opportunity and no one company alone will supply the global demand in the near term. Over time, the most effective vaccines will likely have more upside. Of course, many questions remain, and we'll continue to learn more in the coming months as more data rolls out. Just as it remains unclear how long natural immunity lasts after a person becomes infected with COVID-19, similarly, the durability of a COVID-19 vaccine is still a wide open question. Will COVID be a pandemic like SARS or MERS that will subside over time? Or will it be more endemic or flu-like, creating a longer-term market opportunity for the current treatments and development? In addition to safety and efficacy questions, challenges related to capacity, access, distribution, logistics and early adoption are all being navigated in real time. Meaningful strides are being taken by our tenants in the life science industry to preempt as many of these complexities as possible. And of course, in the meantime, new antibody therapies by companies such as tenants Vir in collaboration with GSK, Eli Lilly and AstraZeneca could serve as a bridge to a vaccine, taken prophylactically and/or to help reduce the severity of COVID-19, especially if taken early in the course of disease, as we see now with the Eli Lilly's antibody. Key data readouts will be forthcoming over the next few months while Eli Lilly's single-agent antibody and Regeneron's antibody cocktail have filed for emergency use authorization and await approval. Other notable advances in the treatment of COVID-19 included the FDA's first COVID-specific approval of tenant Gilead's antiviral drug Veklury or remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization. The FDA has also granted emergency use authorization for the use of convalescent plasma in hospitalized patients with severe disease. And the NIH has also included within its guidance the use of dexamethasone or steroids in hospitalized COVID patients requiring supplemental oxygen.  These notable and expedient efforts across our tenant base and the life science industry are in large part to the fact that as the coronavirus made itself known to the world almost a year ago now, these companies were already well equipped with the R&D infrastructure, technology platforms, resources and talent in place such that they were able to mobilize quickly and meaningfully to combat this global health crisis. It is our honor to continue to serve at the vanguard of this essential life science industry and to support the heroic work of our tenants and campus communities, focused on bringing an end to this pandemic, addressing the 10,000-plus diseases already known to us today and innovating the future of drug discovery to solve tomorrow's risks to human health. And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve. Thank you. Stephen A. Richardson: Thank you, Jenna. Good afternoon, everyone. The very strong results we've achieved during the third quarter are a testament to both the clear vision the company has had since its inception more than 25 years ago, and a highly creative and entrepreneurial team that has skillfully adapted to this tumultuous time. Alexandria's mega campuses are now not only essential and mission-critical, but they are also especially desirable in capturing a significant majority of the life science growth in the marketplace. The Alexandria brand is highly valued across the entire life cycle -- life science ecosystem for its well-earned trusted relationships, impeccable integrity and unparalleled expertise and experience. These timeless elements are the foundation for a tenant's decisions to continue to seek out a collaborative and mutually beneficial multidimensional platform for their growth with Alexandria. As the challenges only increased for navigating success in the quest to eradicate disease and improve nutrition globally, particularly with a once-in-a-century pandemic upon us, Alexandria stands out and is recognized as an innovative, insightful and unique partner as the following results clearly demonstrate.  In the realm of operational excellence, the company has collected 99.7% of its accounts receivable during the third quarter and 99.7% during October. The 24/7 nature of these labs and the fundamental value they provide for our tenants is clearly evident with these operational statistics.  On the leasing front, we have continued outperformance. During the third quarter, we outperformed the second quarter leasing activity with a total of 1.2 million square feet leased, which brings us to nearly 3 million square feet leased year-to-date during 2020, which is pretty impressive considering our 10-year leasing average is 3.9 million square feet. Alexandria's team is fully engaged, and our tenant base is thriving and continuing to grow.  To underscore the leasing outperformance, this quarterly run rate during the time of COVID is approximately equal to or better than the leasing run rate during the first quarter, the second quarter and the third quarter of 2019. And of particular note is the 80% leased or negotiation status of the development pipeline for the same set of projects detailed in our Q2 supplemental, so very solid progress with our on-balance sheet growth engine, and Peter will provide further details during his remarks.  Our core continues to be strong with rental rate increases of 30.9% cash and 39.9% GAAP for renewals and re-leases. And early renewals for the third quarter are above our historic levels and reached 86%, so the sense of urgency remains strong for our tenant base. Our mark-to-market is at 16.4% cash, a 90 bps increase from the second quarter and 17.1% GAAP, up 120 bps over the second quarter.  Occupancy continues to be solid at 94.9% across 31.2 million square feet in the operating portfolio. And after taking into account the recently acquired lease-up opportunities, we would otherwise be at 97.7% occupancy, up 60 bps from the second quarter.  Market health continues to be strong with robust lab demand of 3.2 million square feet in the Bay Area of San Francisco, 2.5 million square feet in the greater Boston region and 2.1 million square feet in San Diego. But importantly, there's a market acceleration to high-quality, COVID-safe campuses and evidenced, again, by our ability to capture a dominant market share of promising and strong credit life science companies. So in conclusion, Alexandria's pioneering efforts have placed the company at the actual and virtual intersection of science and global health. The team is entrepreneurial, creative and fully prepared to meet and decisively capitalize on this opportunity to partner with our tenants for the benefit of health across the globe.  With that, I'll hand it off to Peter. Peter M. Moglia: Thanks, Steve. I'm going to briefly update you all on our development pipeline, the impact of Prop 15 on Alexandria and touch on a recent third-party asset sale in one of our submarkets. So as with developments, overall, the leasing activity was very robust. We had over 300,000 square feet of leases completed and approximately 490,000 square feet of space put under LOI in the development, redevelopment pipeline during the quarter. And that was led by a significant demand at our 2 Bay Area projects, 201 Haskins and the Alexandria District project in San Carlos.  There have been a few adjustments to the development, redevelopment pipeline from last quarter. 975 (sic) [ 945 ] Market Street in SoMa was sold for $198 million as noted in our dispositions disclosure. Accepting the unsolicited offer really made a lot of sense to us as an opportunity to really recycle that capital into our already robust pipeline. 704 Quince Orchard Road in Gaithersburg, Maryland and 9880 Campus Point Drive in San Diego were successfully completed during the quarter and put into operation.  So as those assets were removed from the pipeline, 2 new assets have been added including the Parmer campus in Research Triangle that Joel referenced. That was acquired in the third quarter and has been rebranded as Alexandria Center for Life Science \u2013 Durham, approximately 650,000 square feet of the 2.2 million square foot campus is slated for redevelopment into research and development lab space for manufacturing space, and it has already been 50% pre-leased. The second asset, Alexandria Center for Advanced Technologies is also in the Triangle, and features research and manufacturing space in 2 buildings that are a combined 40% pre-leased.  We have also disclosed 3 new pre-leased projects in our San Diego region : 3115 Merryfield Row, also referred to as Spectrum 3, is 146,456 square foot ground-up development. That will be the fourth and final phase of our Spectrum 3 -- for our Spectrum campus in Torrey Pines. The project has considerable interest. 80% of the building is already under letter of intent. At Alexandria Point, we have pre-leased 100% of a new ground-up -- once ground-up 171,102 square foot development on that mega campus to a credit tenant. And at the San Diego Tech by Alexandria project, we've kicked off our first ground-up development with a 59% pre-leasing of 176,428 square foot building to an exciting genetic sequencing company, a technology that's really a major strength of the San Diego region.  On to Prop 15, we're sure everybody is aware of the details of California's Proposition 15 ballot measure that would overhaul the state's property tax limitation of 2% increases per year and replace it with market value assessments every 3 years for commercial properties that have values in excess of $3 million. If Proposition 15 is passed, the property taxes for some of our properties in California could substantially increase. Our current assessment is that we're in pretty good position to absorb the impact of this proposition should it pass as our California asset base is relatively young, with approximately 60% of our California properties purchased or developed, redeveloped over the past 10 years, and our triple-net leases allow us to pass-through, among other costs, substantially all real estate and rent-related taxes to our tenants in the form of additional rent tenant recoveries. Consequently, as a result of having triple-net leases and a relatively new asset base, we do not expect potential increases of property taxes resulting from tax reassessments to significantly impact our operating results, and they will have almost no impact on NOI.  Moving to the asset sale I mentioned. So over the past 2 quarters, we've discussed strong interest in lab office assets from a diverse set of investors mentioning Healthpeak's purchase of The Post and Waltham at a 5.1% cap rate and a healthy price per square foot of $751 a foot for a suburban asset. Their purchase of 35 Cambridge Park Drive for almost $1,500 a square foot in a 4.8% cap rate. And Beacon's purchase, I think, referenced last quarter of 27 Drydock, subject to a very onerous ground lease in the Seaport area of Boston at a 4.8% cap rate and a $916 per square foot value. It is still a good time to be in the market with assets in life science markets.  During the third quarter, Ventas purchased the Genesis Towers and 4000 Shoreline in South San Francisco for $1.02 billion or $1,301 per square foot and a 4.75% cap rate. We were somewhat surprised by that valuation as the Towers sit oddly and alone on the west side of the 101 Freeway and the south tower's an actual converted office building, which as we've been talking about at a number of recent meetings, can cause less than ideal conditions for tenants. For instance, the low clear height of the base building design led to lower finished -- a lower-finished ceiling than what you would normally find in a Class A lab building. And since the building had an office tenant in the top floors during its conversion, much of the ducting resides on the exterior of the building, making for less than ideal aesthetics and the freight elevator does not reach the building's other floors. All of these things really put the project at a competitive disadvantage to others in the rental market.  Look, despite the exuberance of our product type, we are going to continue to maintain our highly disciplined approach to underwriting. And know that our deep knowledge, expertise and experience will continue to provide us with great opportunities to grow our asset base at reasonable valuations. And with that, I will pass it over to Dean. Dean Shigenaga : Okay. Thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. Our essential real estate portfolio continues to provide highly innovative entities with mission-critical research facilities really focused on acceleration of innovation to advance human health. We're very proud to be the key partner to leading entities across pharma, biotech and AgTech, and have a highly experienced team delivering operational excellence quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Our high-quality Class A properties and future development sites, combined with our stellar tenant roster, continues to generate high-quality and growing cash flows. Our growth in cash flows from operating activities continue to allow us to increase our common stock dividend, most recently, $1.06 per common share or $4.12 per share on an annual basis, and that was up 6% over the previous 12 months. We are on track to retain over $200 million in cash flows from operating activities after dividends in 2020 for reinvestment into our highly leased development pipeline.  Our third quarter results were very solid, and 2020 is wrapping up as a strong year for our essential real estate business. Total revenues for the third quarter were up almost 17% over the third quarter of '19 and excluding the termination payment from Pinterest, really highlighting continued, solid execution on both internal and external growth. Adjusted EBITDA margin was very strong at 67% for the third quarter and remains one of the top stats within the REIT industry. The slight temporary decline in the third quarter was due to 2 items, about 1/3 of which was related to temporary vacancy for a space that will be delivered for occupancy in the fourth quarter and about 2/3 of that decline related to seasonal increases in utilities. Now the increase in utility expenses are recoverable from our tenants and did not impact net operating income. Importantly, our adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to improve to 68% in the fourth quarter.  Rent collections have been very strong, as Steve highlighted, at 99.7% for both 3Q and for October, and in line with our expectations for our mission-critical essential real estate. Now occupancy has been solid this year, 97.7% before the impact of vacancy from recently acquired priorities. And please refer to Page 24 of our supplemental package for a detailed list of vacancy that was acquired recently.  Now the key takeaway is that recently acquired properties vacancy will provide growth in cash flows as our team executes on these lease-up opportunities. Now our operating results continue to benefit from contractual annual rent escalations averaging approximately 3% from one of the highest quality tenant rosters in the REIT industry. As highlighted on our second quarter earnings call, tenants took occupancy in the third quarter, closing out temporary vacancy as of June 30 and contractual rents commenced in 3Q pushing through third quarter same-property results in line for our expectations for 2020. Now same-property NOI growth was 2.9% and 4.9% on a cash basis for the third quarter. We reported continued and very strong rental rate growth on lease renewals and re-lease in the space at almost 40% and almost 31% on a cash basis for the third quarter.  And quick comment on leasing activity for the quarter and for the 9 months. Two leases did impact the amount of TIs and leasing commitments related to lease renewals and re-lease in the space. One lease executed in the quarter related to re-tenanting of an older building that was occupied by a single tenant for 15 to 20 years, and the infrastructure was not really our traditional generic lab improvements. Also, consistent with our assumptions related to a recent acquisition, we successfully re-leased a portion of the property, along with the TI allowance to bring the space up to ARE standard really for high-quality facilities. Now these 2 leases are unusual, and did impact our quarterly average for TIs and leasing commissions. Excluding these 2 leases, our average TIs and LCs for the 3 months and 9 months ended September 30, would have been in line with historical amounts at approximately $17 and $20 per square foot, respectively.  Now during the quarter, our General Counsel resigned for family reasons. And she really was one of our top leaders in the company. She built a really great team and had an amazing 2-decade career at Alexandria. We truly wish her well. In connection with her departure, we recognized a $4.5 million compensation expense in the third quarter.  Now turning briefly to venture investments. Over the past year or so, we have been taking advantage of the strength of the portfolio and overall capital markets. Our net cash flows from -- have been about neutral for the first 3 quarters of 2020, highlighting that we have been strategically monetizing certain holdings. Unrealized gains have grown significantly to $542 million as of September 30. And realized gains have averaged about $16.1 million per quarter over the last 4 quarters and was $17.4 million for the third quarter.  Now our team has been working diligently on our active and near-term development and redevelopment projects. Peter touched on a lot of the details, but key highlights included 4.1 million square feet of active and near-term projects that are highly leased or negotiating at 74% that will generate significant cash flows. This consisted of great progress on the active pipeline that we presented last quarter, which is now 80% leased or negotiating. We added over 900,000 square feet to our active pipeline in the quarter, which is now -- those projects are 54% leased and negotiating. And we also have an additional 500,000 square feet of near-term projects, which are 80% leased or negotiating with vertical construction starts ranging from the fourth quarter to the second quarter of '21. So a huge thanks to our entire team for their outstanding execution on our development and redevelopment pipeline.  Moving to our balance sheet. I just want to say thank you to our relationship lenders and our team for completing an amendment to our unsecured senior line of credit, providing aggregate commitments of $3 billion, up $800 million and extending the maturity date by 2 years to early 2026. We completed a record low, 12-year bond deal at 1.875% in August of 2020. The all-in rate for 10-year bonds today for Alexandria remains very attractive at approximately 2%.  Now we remain committed to our strong and improving credit profile and are on track to hit our year-end goal for net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 5.3x. And we're very proud to highlight one of the strongest balance sheets in the REIT industry, ranking in the top 10 among all publicly traded REITs. We have liquidity of about $3.9 billion reflecting the increase in commitments from our October 2020 amendment to our line of credit. And our weighted average remaining term of outstanding debt was very solid at 10.6 years with very minimal debt maturities until 2024.  We updated our 2020 guidance and narrowed the range for EPS diluted from $3 to $3.11 (sic) [ $3.09 to $3.11 ], and FFO per share diluted as adjusted from $7.29 to $7.31. Now our targeted dispositions for the remainder of 2020 include 2 key transactions, both of which are moving along very well, with one expected to close real soon. Both of the deals are in process and subject to confidentiality agreements, and therefore, we are unable to comment on either transaction until after closing. Now as usual, please refer to detailed underlying assumptions included in our 2020 guidance, beginning on Page 10 of our supplemental package. Additionally, consistent with prior years, we plan to provide our detailed guidance assumptions for 2021 later on -- at our Annual Investor Day on December 1, and therefore, we are unable to comment on 2021 until then.  Let me turn it back over to Joel. Joel Marcus : Thank you. We'll go to question and answer. Operator, please? Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Anthony Paolone of JPMorgan. Anthony Paolone : Okay. I think, Peter, you had mentioned some of the challenges with some of the conversions to lab. But with a lot of the capital circling some conversions, new submarkets and new markets, can you just comment whether you think there's enough demand to go around for everybody? Joel Marcus : Well, yes, let me jump in before Peter comments, Tony. I think you have to look at where these are happening and where the demand wants to be, and those don't always match up. I mean -- I think if you look at Cambridge, the ability to add supply there is pretty, pretty tough. And the demand is strong. Same thing, I think, in different parts of San Francisco. So I think you have to isolate where these either are or might be converted. And you heard a little bit about the downside of conversions, they oftentimes don't work out all that well and where the demand is coming from and where they want to go. But Peter, you can comment. Peter M. Moglia: Yes. I mean I -- just yesterday, an article came out in the Bisnow website of San Francisco, titled, \"Too Low, Too Fragile, Too Short-Term: Life Sciences Conversions Are Popular But Hard To Pull Off\" by -- author's name was Dean Boerner. And I think it's just -- it's a pretty summary-level article. But like we've been talking about for the last couple of quarters, office buildings just don't have the infrastructure needed for a laboratory that will be efficient and flexible at the end of the day. So convert one, you can, but the tenants are going to have to make sacrifices in order to occupy that space. And they could be very material as far as like how many chemicals they can store, where they can put equipment. It's very inefficient compared to Alexandria's portfolio which was purpose-built for labs.  So we feel like any requirement in any of our submarkets that comes around, we're going to be the first choice. We're going to have a building that's flexible, that works and has a staff that knows how to run it. I mean that's the other thing. There's more than just bricks-and-mortar here. There's operational expertise and that can get very technical. And these are mission-critical facilities. Can't -- our companies can't really afford to go into a building when somebody doesn't know what they're doing because time is money, and especially in the life science industry. Anthony Paolone : Okay. And then my second question, Joel, I think it was either last quarter, maybe the quarter before, you had made some comments about the election, and it sounded like a blue wave would be bad. Can you give some updated thoughts on if we get a so-called blue wave, what the near-term impact might be on the business? Joel Marcus : Well, I think, first of all, the ideal is always, in government, that there's a balanced government and balanced between the parties. I think it's hard to speculate on a blue wave and what it means because the democratic party is really a pretty highly, I would say -- a party that encompasses a pretty broad spectrum of thoughts from socialized medicine to free market with some guidance. So it's hard to know what that really means.  I think there are 2 areas that so-called Biden-aligned groups said early on, if there were things they could do pretty quickly, what would they do. One might be to try to get Medicare to negotiate for those drugs administered by doctors. That's one that they might likely try to go after pretty quickly. And then another one is if they could show that intellectual property was created outside of the company, maybe a more revenue-sharing basis with, say, federal lab or a university or whatever. So those are 2 ones that I've heard that they might go to. But I think it's hard to predict and hard to speculate and -- anyway. So that's kind of my knee-jerk reaction at this point. Anthony Paolone : Do you think in that scenario, there's any pause in leasing as tenants try to just figure out what the environment might hold? Joel Marcus : No. Operator : The next question comes from Jamie Feldman of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. James Feldman : I guess just sticking with the supply topic, are there any markets where you are kind of second guessing or thinking twice about new starts given how much capital is flowing into them? Joel Marcus : Well, I think -- and maybe I'll have Steve comment. But I think one that we've certainly flagged over the past couple of years, which certainly has turned out to be way better than we thought, we tend to be pretty conservative in our thinking with South San Francisco when Kilroy announced the Oyster Point and a number of other groups have built their -- I think Healthpeak has done a good job of building and so has Blackstone. And it looked like there might be a tip, more -- the potential for more oversupply than demand, but it's turned out that the demand has been healthy, and the supply issue has been pretty in check. So we've been pretty careful there over the past couple of years, but we certainly have a very strong position. And I think as either Peter or Steve mentioned, we're making great progress on our 201 Haskins project. But Steve, you could comment. Stephen A. Richardson: Yes. I would add, Jamie, that our South San Francisco portfolio for the lab product is essentially 100% leased. At Haskins now, we're at 88% leased and negotiating so very well positioned there. The entirety of the Phase 1 of Kilroy's project is 100% leased. Blackstone is substantially leased. Peak is substantially leased. So we did monitor it, as Joe mentioned a couple of years ago, but there has been very robust demand. You have a combination of big pharma coming into South San Francisco that's anchored it with probably 4 or 5 global pharma companies coming in that were not there before. You have the second cohort of companies that have matured to commercialization. So we continue to see that very healthy and do monitor supply certainly very closely, but not overly worried as we might have been a couple of years ago. Joel Marcus : Yes. Steve, maybe mention Stripe moving there to the Kilroy project because that's kind of an interesting trend that we haven't really seen before. A little bit like Mission Bay was in the early days when it was life science and suddenly, tech came in, in a big way. Stephen A. Richardson: Right. Yes, I think that was really a unique situation as the market was extremely tight. When they were making that decision, they were looking for opportunities to have additional buildings for expansion, so they did make the move to South San Francisco. You had a particular tax regime in San Francisco. That might have been troublesome as well. So that -- we'll see if that's a harbinger for future tech locations, which will only increase demand in South San Francisco. But it is -- it was an important and kind of unique situation. James Feldman : Okay. And are there any other markets you're thinking about as -- even monitoring as high risk for supply? Joel Marcus : Well, I think you always think about Research Triangle because there is a lot of land in and around the Triangle. But that's the reason we've gone to a mega campus strategy because people don't want to just be in isolated locations. And many tenants, including one we're under LOI with right now in a pretty big expansion, we're looking for existing solutions. So I think that's one. We're always -- we always have historically been watching, but we're pretty comfortable given our recent dollar commitment there. Operator : Next question comes from Manny Korchman of Citi. Emmanuel Korchman : Thanks for the comments earlier on the amount of capital looking at the space. Just in that light, you guys have also increased the number of acquisitions you're doing, and there's a couple of big deals out there. I know you don't really talk about future deals. But how interested would you be in big deals, especially in a market like Cambridge? Joel Marcus : Yes. So let me maybe react to that. First of all, it's always hard at the beginning of any year to know, especially this year of 2020. I mean, my gosh, in March and April, we had cut and we're planning to cut further CapEx because no one knew if this was going to be a repeat of '08, '09 in a sense. But by May, it was pretty clear that, that wasn't the case. It was a different kind of market shock.  So nobody knows at the beginning of any year or during the year, what assets might come to market for what reasons. So I think it's always hard to speculate on acquisitions. And we're always looking for ones that have an ability to satisfy internal tenant demand that we have. Now we have hundreds and hundreds of tenants that we know where -- what they want to do going forward. So that gives us a huge competitive advantage. And I think trying to match that up with solutions that either exist or we can create. I think when it comes to big portfolios, I mentioned Blackstone before. I think their recapitalization and move from one fund to another. And I guess if there was an offer out there. We know that the base portfolio well back in 2015, I described it, there would be -- we didn't have interest then and we wouldn't have interest now. It doesn't do anything for us particularly. And adding a gigantic scale doesn't really make sense. But I think they've done a great job of calling that portfolio and then really adding quality buildings, which weren't there so much many years ago.  And I think on the other big portfolio in Cambridge, we don't have any comment on that. But I would say that's kind of an A-minus, B-plus location. We have 3 mega campuses in the heart of Kendall Square, which are AAA locations. So I think that gives you some insight on how we think about that. Emmanuel Korchman : Great. And Joel, maybe you'll take this one as well. How are you guys thinking about maybe the amount of manufacturing space that's in your portfolio now? And how much that might ramp over time. One of the pictures you highlighted in the supplemental this time around was a manufacturing facility, which I don't think you've done in the past. Just kind of curious how much of your space might not be labs or office but more manufacturing. Joel Marcus : Yes. Well, we have done manufacturing before. We don't do remote manufacturing, if somebody wants to build a plant in Puerto Rico or Iowa or Kansas or West Virginia or some place. We don't go to locations where we think that there is no long-term inherent value in the real estate. It's just an investment. It's amortized over the term of the lease. And then when it's gone, you've kind of written down your asset. So that's never of interest.  But I think given today, remember what I said in my comments, there are really 2 fundamental things going -- things that have been evidenced by COVID-19. One is -- and whether it's the Trump administration or Biden's push, he's kind of parroted what Trump has said. Whether he can do it or not, don't know. Or whether he'll have the chance or not, don't know. But it's pretty critical that we do repatriate as much research development in manufacturing in the medical -- in the critical medical arena and health care arena back to the U.S. for obvious reasons. And where those become either adjacencies or in close proximity to headquarters and core R&D, then we clearly have interest. If they're in really random remote locations, there would be no interest.  And you have to also remember there is a new generation of companies today, particularly in cell and gene therapy. And those manufacturing capabilities, whether they be at the clinical level or at full-scale commercial level are, to a large extent, worth more than the company's research. And so those become mission-critical. You can think of any number -- I mean Bluebird is a good example, any number of companies that have highly specialized manufacturing for these complex medicines of the future. So we think it becomes an integral part of [ R&D, C and now M ]. And I think it's a huge opportunity. I think it's a huge opportunity for everybody in the United States because I hope it comes true.  I think the one negative thing that sits on the horizon is if Biden happened to win, and he happened to be able to increase corporate taxes, he's going to do the very thing that we've sought not to do, which is force companies overseas, move companies' cash overseas. Why would you want to operate in a high-cost U.S. environment where you could operate overseas at a reduced price? And so that would undermine the purpose of bringing back manufacturing. So we hope that doesn't happen. Michael Bilerman : Joel, it's Michael Bilerman here with Manny. I just had one other one for you. As you talk about overseas and you talk about the highly competitive nature for buildings here in the U.S., either acquisitions, development deals, conversion plays, have you changed your thinking at all about putting incremental dollars outside of the U.S. at all? And I recognize you've had fits and starts on global. And the message pre-COVID was focus on the core markets here in the U.S. I'm just wondering if the returns have been driven down to such low levels here and there's so much competition, whether that you have an advantage of going global given your operational and investment expertise. Joel Marcus : Yes. So that's a really good question. And you know a little bit of the history of back in the '05, '06, '07 era, pre-crash, we entered both China and India. After getting into India, it became pretty clear, the Indian Supreme Court invalidated the Glivec patent. It was pretty clear that novel research wasn't going to India. And it's a tough place to operate from a Foreign Practices Act. So we terminated -- we sold our operation there.  China, we have -- we only did 2 projects. We sold one. We have one remaining. The problem in China is -- and we refused to tie up with the local partner, even though that was kind of recommended. But what happens is the government builds crappy buildings around your nice building. It'd be putting like something like a mini storage unit next to a first-class lab and then telling the Chinese to go in there and operate a lab, which they do at free rent because the government told them to do it. And so that's a hard business model to follow.  But I think November 3 or thereafter, we'll be revealing of the answer to that question. I don't think I could answer it at the moment. But if it turned out there was a blue wave, and it turned out that they dramatically increased corporate taxes, then I think the answer is you'd have to look at the possibility of thinking overseas because the government would have just done the exact opposite of what makes compelling sense to keep companies in this country at competitive tax rates and keep their critical operations here. So I think November 3 or thereafter, we'll be revealing of that question. Michael Bilerman : Yes. I was thinking more so Europe, U.K., Canada rather than going back to China or India, but we can certainly have the discussion at Investor Day. Joel Marcus : Yes. And if we go into New Zealand, I'm sure I'll be down there to help start that office. Operator : The next question comes from Sheila McGrath of Evercore ISI. Sheila McGrath : On the acquisition in RTP, that was a market you previously had a smaller presence in. I was wondering if you could talk about the market dynamics there that may have changed you to be more bullish, details on demand drivers and any insights on the embedded growth opportunity at that asset. Joel Marcus : Yes. So what -- we've been in the Triangle since 1998. We were early in there. And we've always been attracted because in the early days, North Carolina was very aggressive in providing incentives to companies wanting to move down there for -- in the biotech space, in particular. And we really like that market anchored by Duke, UNC and NC State. Duke and UNC in the health care arena, and NC State more in the ag arena. And I think we saw that the market, though, had pretty slow growth and, in fact, lost rental rate increase momentum for quite a long time during the -- from like '08 through, say, 2016 or something. So almost a decade, it really struggled. And when the urban cores were kind of being the most popular, people didn't want to go down to kind of sleepy Research Triangle and hang out in a wooded beautiful area by a lake. That has a little bit reversed its course, as you could imagine, given what's going on in New York and some of these other cities that have seen a lot of both rise in crime and obviously, the impact of COVID and homelessness and things like that.  So we have -- as I mentioned in my comments, we have a large number or certainly an important number, large square footage, of existing tenants who've expressed interest in creating either expansion or new space down in Research Triangle, and so that really motivated us in a substantial way. Also, our market share there now has moved to about 40%, which gives us the scale of 3 mega campuses where we have a lot of existing solutions and a lot of to-be-built solutions. So that's kind of where we wanted to get to. Sheila McGrath : Okay. Great. And then could you give us your updated thoughts on the downtown San Francisco market, the plans for 88 Bluxome and insights on Stripe subleasing its space? Joel Marcus : Yes. Steve? Stephen A. Richardson: Yes. Sheila, it's Steve here. Yes, Stripe's plans for subleasing, I think, were always the case with the relocation of South San Francisco. They haven't done anything official yet. I think they're just putting some feelers out. So that's very much a TBD. And then with 88 Bluxome, we have important preconstruction activities that we'll be undertaking in the next several quarters here. When you look at that building, it is a lab-ready shell. So as Peter was highlighting that contrast between office product and lab product, we'll have the floor to floor, the live load, the capability, shipping and receiving. So when you start looking at a mid-rise facility, a lot of outdoor space, the capability to go lab, we think it's going to be an extremely desirable product. So we'll see this time next year where we're at. Operator : The next question comes from Rich Anderson of SMBC Nikko. Richard Anderson : Peter, you referred to Prop 15 and the triple-net nature of your leases pass-through tenant recovery increases and all that sort of stuff. But someone's going to be left holding the bag if this thing passes, and I'm wondering how you guys might feel about the vulnerability of California. In general, it's kind of a complicated state to begin with. If you think that Prop 15 passing ultimately does kind of slow down rent growth or create some sort of motivation for companies to exit at an increasing pace someplace else. Joel Marcus : Yes. So let me make a comment before I ask Peter to answer that question, Rich. I think everybody is looking carefully at California. Healthpeak just announced the relocation of their headquarters, I guess, from Long Beach area or wherever it is to, I think, Denver, if I'm not -- my memory serves me. The founding shareholder of our company, who put in the principal amount of money when we started Jacobs Engineering, left Pasadena for Plano, Texas, a couple of years ago. Obviously, tax motivated. So there is a historic number of companies and people looking at California today and wondering, is this the state going to save itself? And are the cities going to save themselves? Obviously, homelessness has been a big problem in a number of cities. Obviously, you've got fires. You've got earthquakes. You've got the natural disasters, different than other parts of the country, but everybody has got something. But more important is really governance, sensible governance. We're working pretty intensively. In fact, we had a long call internally yesterday on trying to assist the city of San Francisco on homeless solutions, thinking about could we bring the OneFifteen, Dayton solution for opioid addiction to homelessness in San Francisco as a model to try to help solve that problem. The numbers show something like over 70% or 80% of homeless people generally have some kind of addiction or mental health issue. So just putting them somewhere doesn't work, you've really got to bring intensive services there. So I think all companies are really looking at California in fairly realistic and important ways. But with that kind of long-winded intro, Peter, fire away. Peter M. Moglia: Yes, sure. Rich, I mean, it's obviously a great question. Look, would it be much better if this doesn't pass? It would be because it would just maybe give people confidence that California isn't necessarily going to continue to search for revenue sources from business. That said, as I mentioned, we pass through the cost. And you inferred, well, eventually, your occupancy cost is going to go up. It will. But our analysis is that it would be in the low or low single digits overall for a company.  And I would take you back to a lot of questions we get about just when rents are rising in a market very quickly, people are always like, well, at what point is it going to just get so expensive, people will go elsewhere? And the answer is, well, it really won't because these companies need to be anchored where they are because they're typically located where they are because of institutions that they collaborate with.  So the increase in operating expenses is not something anyone wants to see. Is it going to cause them to move? We would think probably not. And then the overwhelming amount of annual revenue that comes through Alexandria is from very large pharma and biotech, where the OpEx, that rent and operating expenses in the context of their overall cost structure is like 1% to 3%. So it's not going to move that needle. It's going to be an annoyance. But again, wanting to be near the institutions, which is why work in these markets, is going to really win the location selection at the end of the day and an annoyance about property tax increase will ultimately be absorbed. Richard Anderson : Okay. In the interest of time, I just have a real quick yes or no one. On the Pinterest building, will that now be redesigned for lab use? Or how will that be modified since you haven't gone vertical yet? Stephen A. Richardson: Rich, it's Steve. Again, from the very outset, we designed that as a lab-ready shell. So we do not need to make any modifications. And we have the ability to both accommodate lab and technology users. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Carroll of RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll : Yes. Just to touch on the Research Triangle acquisition again. And I think you -- Joel, you mentioned a little bit this earlier in the call. But with the Durham site, how different is that from the AgTech site and the Advanced Technology campus? I mean I know the AgTech buildings have a different build-out. But are each individual campus that you have down in North Carolina better suited for different tenants? Or could they -- could each -- could they take all types of tenants at either of these campuses? Joel Marcus : Well, the AgTech campus will -- and they're all in pretty close proximity. The AgTech campus is really dedicated to AgTech. And the Advanced Technology campus will be primarily life science, and it also sits next to a building we have that is chock full of small growing tenants. So there's a natural growth trajectory there. And then the Durham campus, we just bought in are in the process of doing quite a bit of retrofitting and redeveloping, will be primarily life science as well. Michael Carroll : Okay. And then the demand that you've seen in the Research Triangle market, I mean, is it from the life science demand or the AgTech demand? And I know you have a lot of space under construction right now, but is that enough demand supports another ground-up development? Or you just want to complete what you guys have going on today? Joel Marcus : Well, it's primarily life science, although there is AgTech activity. It's not quite as broad or as deep, obviously, because the industry is just a very different structured industry. But we do have 2 developments on our Advanced Technology campus going up, and we've got pretty robust demand from existing tenants there. And one build-to-suit that we're doing.  And then on the Durham campus, we're accommodating a number of existing tenants or relationships that have expressed they want immediate existing solutions, which we really didn't have, and that was a big motivator for us. So we hope to do both, and we think there is good pent-up demand. Hopefully, the tax -- if there are tax changes, they won't screw it all up. Because, obviously, some companies who might expand here in the U.S.A. today, maybe next year if things go in a different fashion, they might go overseas, and we would be sad to see that happen. Operator : The next question comes from Dave Rodgers of Baird. Dave Rodgers : Yes. Maybe first question for Peter and Steve, just with regard to San Francisco. You talked specifically about 88. But maybe go back to your comments, Peter, on 975 (sic) [ 945 ] Market. Just with respect to -- you said it made a lot of sense for a lot of reasons to sell that. But there's a pretty quick turnaround for you. And obviously, price maybe wasn't the motivation. So if you could talk about why exit that and then why that doesn't have an implication on how you think about Bluxome, that would be helpful. Peter M. Moglia: Steve, do you want to take that? Stephen A. Richardson: Sure. Dave, it's Steve. Yes, when we looked at that asset, to receive an unsolicited offer and then also to look at its location along Market Street, was somewhat of a one-off kind of at the edge of the cluster at best of SoMa, it really did make sense to go ahead and exit. And I just think the scale and the size of 88 Bluxome is much, much different and qualitatively in a different position. You're really at the edge of Mission Bay there. So I do think we have the opportunity at scale to help life science or technology. Whereas the Market Street location was just a -- ultimately, a smaller project there. We weren't really going to build a cluster adjacent to that. And again, as Peter said, receiving an unsolicited offer and recycling that capital with these other opportunities just made great sense. Peter M. Moglia: And I would just add -- I was just going to add that 88 Bluxome is a much closer extension of Mission Bay than Market Street. So it makes a lot more sense to be our next development to build on that cluster than Market Street would. Dave Rodgers : And is that -- I mean, the sale is just indicative in -- of your mind of maybe -- I don't want to say shrinking San Francisco market, but obviously, the lab market is going to be one component of it. But office maybe in a deterioration mode here. Is that indicative of that thinking? And is that how we should think about it? Stephen A. Richardson: I think you just have to look at that in isolation, Dave, and the circumstances that led us to make that decision. Dave Rodgers : Okay. And then maybe, Dean, just on the ARE ventures investments that you guys have, $1.3 billion, including the unrealized gains. Do you just anticipate continuing to want to sell more of that? I mean do you want to manage that to a certain size of the portfolio and with the gains embedded in there? Do you want to try to get that portfolio size down in any particular way? I guess maybe not necessarily guidance on quarter-by-quarter or 2021, but how you want to kind of manage the gains in there to realize those as quickly as you can. Dean Shigenaga : Dave, Dean here. I'd say that the overall strategy for the venture portfolio has been to carefully manage that aspect of our business. If you look back over several years now, I think the aggregate dollars invested from a cost perspective has actually declined as a percentage of total assets or assets have grown on the real estate side over time. And like I shared in my commentary, we've -- from a cash flow perspective, the venture portfolio has been about neutral this year. So still always careful about selective new investment opportunities.  But given what Joel had mentioned, if you look back over -- since 2013, there's been a real acceleration of innovation. So we're seeing a lot of exciting opportunities, but still being very selective, Dave.  I think we've commented that the size of the venture portfolio will always moderate in size somewhere in that 3% to 5% from a cost basis perspective, and it's closer to 3.5% today, down from where it was a couple of years ago. Operator : Next question comes from Tom Catherwood of BTIG. William Catherwood : Just a quick clarification on the RTP acquisition. I believe that the Parmer park also had a few office assets in it that didn't look like they were part of your acquisition of the 16 buildings. Is that correct? Joel Marcus : Peter, you want to talk to that? Peter M. Moglia: Yes. No. There are -- I think it's -- I don't have the exact number, but there are a few assets that are currently used as office and leased as office that we consider as future upside. There's either 1- or 2-story buildings that could be converted to labs. So there are -- all of the assets that were on the campus were sold to us, and we own all of them. William Catherwood : Got it. Got it. Got it. Okay. The -- then switching over to Cambridge, Joel, you had mentioned how hard of this to bring supply on in that market. And this quarter, you moved 325 Binney from the intermediate development bucket into near term, and you were able to add another 48,000 square feet of density. How soon do you think you can get to that site and begin that project if you have a tenant? And are there differences between the types of tenants or tenant requirements that are looking at your Cambridge site versus 15 Necco in the Seaport or 57 Coolidge in Watertown? Joel Marcus : Yes. So maybe I'll give an intro to that and maybe let Peter talk about it. But we had substantially upzoned, I think, about 2x from what was the as-of-right square footage. I think the square footage we've got is north of 400,000. We just got design approval just the other night. So we're moving full steam ahead. We have a handful of existing tenants who are looking for expansion space. So we're -- likely, this building will be a little bit like what we did in Seattle at 188 or 1818 -- Eastlake, 188 Blaine -- I forgot the exact address there, where we created almost 200,000 square foot building, multitenant life science building and accommodated most of our -- many of our existing tenants who needed more space. I think that's what's going to happen to 325 Binney.  I think companies that are in Cambridge would prefer to be in Cambridge. The Seaport, I think, offers some nice opportunities, but I think Cambridge would be first choice. But Peter, you could comment. Peter M. Moglia: Yes, absolutely. I mean Cambridge is still the place everybody wants to be. The opportunities there are very limited. We fortunately have one. But we've been very proactive to figure out where people could go that need to be in close proximity. Watertown was one of our strategies. It's working out very well. The demand there has been even stronger than we would have imagined. And it makes a lot of sense that the Seaport would also be as attractive, in a way, maybe a bit more to those that are more Cambridge-centric because it is linked by the Red Line, you can get from South Station to Kendall Square in about 12 to 15 minutes. And obviously, the amenities and the Fort Point Channel area mimic what you can find in Cambridge as well. So we think it's a good, natural extension for those that may not have the ability to be in Cambridge but needed to be close by. Operator : Next question comes from Tayo Okusanya from Mizuho. Omotayo Okusanya : I just wanted to go back to the Durham acquisition. And I'm trying to understand a little bit better the tenant base in that building. You made some illusions of the proximity to Duke and UNC is the major reason for holding the asset. And I'm just curious, is this kind of more kind of traditional life sciences? Or does it have an aspect of kind of the university-based, R&D-based life sciences that you often hear Ventas and Brandywine talk about in Philadelphia? And if it is, I'm just kind of curious why you're not going to find that type of life sciences attractive or not. Joel Marcus : Okay. I'm not sure I could hear you when you described about Philadelphia. Could you repeat that? Omotayo Okusanya : Sure. I think -- again, Ventas and Brandywine, I mean, often talk about Philadelphia as university-based life sciences. And again, I think with some other comments around Durham about being close Duke and UNC, I'm just kind of curious, do you also consider this university-based life sciences? And if it is... Joel Marcus : No. No. Yes. I don't -- yes, we don't think like that. This is not -- yes, that's just a different, I don't know, way of thinking. This is a -- this is originally the Glaxo campus that was bought and redeveloped. I think the timing and the job that was done by the seller was really good. We came in, there are a strong number of existing credit tenants, among which is Duke. Duke has an important lab presence there that's attractive to us, but that wasn't the major reason for it. The major reason was it had good, existing solutions and a number of future solutions that would accommodate existing tenants' expansion and growth of ours that we had. And it gave us a 3 campus -- 3 mega campus opportunity down in the Triangle.  This is in the park. The park is not adjacent to Duke. It's not adjacent to UNC. It's some miles away or NC State. So I wouldn't compare it at all to -- it's nothing like Philadelphia. Just totally different ballgame. Peter M. Moglia: Yes. And Joel, it's Peter. I can add -- I mean there's a total of 6 tenants there, 5 of the 6 are credit tenants. The sixth one's actually probably also a credit tenant now. And only Duke is university related. So I'll echo what Joel said, this is nothing like a university play that Ventas would have done. Joel Marcus : Yes. And the challenge, if you do universities, is if you're entirely dependent on the university, and universities can be up and down and so forth, and you have no commercial tenant base, you're really at the mercy of the university, which we've never wanted to be. That's why we've never really gone after that business model. Omotayo Okusanya : Previous comment, if not international, would you actually consider any new markets within the U.S.? Joel Marcus : Yes. We said we might. I think our hands are full in our existing markets because they're so vibrant and keeping us busy. We have a big budget this year to fulfill. And so at the moment, we're not focused on -- or ready to announce any expansion markets because we're pretty occupied in where we are. But who knows what the future may have given -- post-election, what may happen there. Operator : And the last question today will come from Daniel Ismail of Green Street. Daniel Ismail : Great. Just a few quick ones for me. Another good quarter of cash re-leasing spreads. So I'm curious on a portfolio-wide basis, where in-place rents sit relative to markets. Joel Marcus : So Dean, maybe a comment? Dean Shigenaga : Yes. So I just want to be sure it was off mute. The overall portfolio, I think, over the last number of quarters have been in the upper teens on average, both GAAP and cash. So I think the continued overall constraints and supply and good fundamentals in our core markets, I think, has held up good upside on the overall portfolio. Daniel Ismail : Okay. And you -- I appreciate the clarity on the concessions and leasing costs. But can you frame how net effective rents have grown, say, year-over-year across your portfolio? Are we talking 5% up? 10% up? Dean Shigenaga : It turns out, I don't have that specific analysis for this quarter. But if I think back to the last several quarters, net effective rents have trended nicely. I think the only change in -- that I can see that might make that picture a little bit harder to see as we go forward is you've got to -- through the acquisitions, we've got a broader mix of assets in the portfolio, including this Research Triangle project as well as The Arsenal on the Charles as a couple of examples. But net effective rent generally has been trending very well for the last number of years as well as the last several quarters. I can't tell you specifically for this quarter right now, though. Daniel Ismail : Okay. And just last one for me. The H-1B visa program and potential changes have been more highlighted towards the potential impact to the tech industry. But can you comment on the potential impact it might have to life science industry in terms of employment and hiring? Joel Marcus : Yes. I think -- I'm not an expert in that. But I think it's pretty clear that there are quite a number of scientists from other countries who have unique skill bases that are here under that visa category or designation, and it would be positive to keep that going, for sure. I know there is some sensitivity on -- and there have been a bunch written about people coming over from China working in universities with professors. And maybe there being some national security issue there that I know the government has looked pretty carefully at. But set that aside, I think it's been a very positive -- a positive program and certainly very helpful to the life science industry. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks. Joel Marcus : Okay. Thank you very much. Sorry for a long call during this third quarter of COVID. Look forward to talking to you on fourth quarter and year-end. Thank you. And everybody, please stay safe. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz. Please go ahead. Paula Schwartz : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains Forward-Looking Statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The Company\u2019s actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the Company\u2019s periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Joel Marcus : Thank you, Paul, and welcome, everybody, today. With me, as usual, Jenna Foger, Steve Richardson, Peter Moglia and Dean Shigenaga. Want to welcome everybody and extend our thoughts and prayers to each one of you to continue to be well safe and state COVID free. Just over one year ago, January 21, 2020, the United States had its first reported case of COVID-19 in Seattle. And just today, a little more than a year later, we have lost more than 443,000 Americans, a number that is actually quite astounding to imagine. And that does not even count the number of - the millions, probably tens of millions of Americans who have suffered really irreparable personal, mental and financial arm due to the worldwide pandemic. President Roosevelt on Pearl Harbor Day referred to that day as a day that would live in infamy. And I think we will all feel that 2020 is a year that will live in infamy in all of our memories. Talking about the pandemic, there is much work to do to control the virus\u2019 spread. We need to enhance manufacturing supply chains as well as a big effort on distribution, administration of the vaccines as well as continued testing. And we, as a country, I think, for decades, have been ill prepared and behind the curve to respond to a true worldwide and kind of a 100-year pandemic, I think our readiness just has not been there, unfortunately. Much work to do to rebuild businesses and lives so devastatingly impacted. And I would say it is going to take a good part of this decade to do that for many people who\u2019ve been really so devastated. We still have not discovered the root cause of the virus, natural or human made or brought those responsible to an accounting. We at Alexandria at the Vanguard, the heart of the life science industry, are honored, proud and yet humbled to serve this mission-critical industry, which has been on the forefront, 24/7, really as the savior of human kind in this pandemic. It really doesn\u2019t get more important or impactful than that truly. There are two primary causes behind the COVID vaccines rescue of humanity from this pandemic, I firmly believe. The first one is our free market system here in the United States, the economic system that facilitated the innovation, competition and cooperation between our biotech and pharma industries and government, that literally doesn\u2019t happen in other countries around the world. There would likely be no multiple COVID vaccines today that they are not being venture capitalist prepared to invest before product or profit was really visible and no corporate leadership would be willing to double down other than those in our country with the company\u2019s own money in the spring of 2020 to fund a crash effort to produce a safe and affected vaccine by year-end, really truly unheard of. Jenna Foger : Thank you so much, Phil, and good afternoon, everyone. So really echoing Joel here. As the entire world looks to the power of science, the life science industry and specifically to our tenants to lead us out of this devastating COVID pandemic. 2020 has underscored why Alexandria has dedicated our business, our passion and purpose helped drive this mission-critical industry forward. Without a doubt biopharma, essential R&D engine has persisted with amazing productivity and resilience throughout the past year, which has further magnified our tenant\u2019s role as the key solution to overcoming today\u2019s greatest health challenges, bringing unprecedented positive sentiment to the sector, as Joel mentioned. The achievements in COVID vaccine development from our tenants, Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, Novavax and AstraZeneca many others in the fourth quarter, specifically of 2020 and into the beginning of 2021, have marked the culmination of a full year\u2019s worth of tireless, truly collaborative efforts across the industry with significant aid of federal funding. Stephen Richardson : Thank you, Jenna. A tremendous deep dive. Good afternoon, everyone. A clear insured vision fused with undaunted determination during 2020 from the Alexandria team has enabled the company to thrive during this unprecedented and challenging time. At a high level, consider the truly exceptional growth during the past 12 months. The operating platform has grown from 26.9 million square feet to 31.8 million square feet, an increase of 18%. The redevelopment pipeline has grown from 12.1 million square feet to 17.8 million square feet, an increase of 47%. And it is important to note that this development pipeline has been smartly derisked with 45% of this value in significantly pre-leased projects well underway, 40% in covered land plays and just 15% of this value in land. The total Alexandria Real Estate platform then have grown during 2020 from 39 million square feet to 49.7 million square feet, an increase of 27%, a truly remarkable achievement. The Company\u2019s leadership and central role in the nation\u2019s life science ecosystem is clearly evident in only increasing in each of our core clusters. The year 2020 demanded the very best from our teams, from operational excellence to the vision and execution of critical strategic growth initiatives. Alexandria is pleased to prevent its outperformance highlights for Q4 and 2020. Operational excellence. The company collected 99.8% of its accounts receivable during COVID from April 1 through December 31, 2020, and we are at 99.6% for the month of January. Alexandria\u2019s labs were deemed essential infrastructure and have been operational from day 1 in the pandemic. Leasing outperformance. During Q4, we leased approximately 1.4 million square feet and a total of 4.35 million square feet during 2020, which is meaningfully above our 10-year average of 4 million square feet and consistent with our 5-year average of 4.4 million square feet. The current and near-term development pipeline is 78% leaser negotiating, a significant metric when 1 considers the active pipeline is now at 4.8 million square feet, up from 4.1 million square feet just three months ago at the end of Q3. An exceptionally strong core. I want to pause for a moment and underscore that during the challenging time, we achieved the highest annual rental rate increases during the past 10-years with cash increases of 18.3% and GAAP increases of 37.6%. The fourth quarter was also strong with cash increases of 10.7% and GAAP increases of 29.8%. We are honored to work with the most innovative life science companies in the world and believe these metrics further validate the value we are providing to the life science ecosystem. Solid occupancy. We are at 94.6% across 31.8 million square feet in the operating portfolio. And again, context is important here as we have increased the operating portfolio from 26.9 million square feet, as mentioned before, providing strategic embedded growth opportunities through lease-up of available suites in the coming quarters. I just want to emphasize this last point, as the recent acquisitions provide very near-term increases in cash flows and strategic expansion of our tenant base. Market health. Demand continues to be broad-based across our innovation clusters as each of the markets have made meaningful contributions to the company\u2019s overall growth during 2020 and Alexandria continues to capture a dominant market share in each of these clusters. We have discussed potential supply in our core clusters the past several quarters. And as we highlighted during our Investor Day, the conversion of generic office product into mission-critical Class A laboratory facilities is brought with significant fault insufficient clear heights and live loads, compromise hazardous material storage areas, dysfunctional shipping and receiving areas, impaired HVAC capabilities and performance, amongst others. We continue to monitor all potential supply closely, but do not see significant high-quality Class A products being delivered during the near-term in our markets. Also a note on the San Francisco Bay Area as this has been a focus in the press. As we have stated, the life science market continues to be very healthy with low single-digit vacancy of 3.4% and demand of 2.6 million square feet, enabling Alexandria to successfully lease-up our Haskins and 825, 835 project at increasing rental rates, all while the city of San Francisco\u2019s tech office sector is struggling with direct vacancy now at 12.4%, above the 15-year average of 8% and sublease space pushing the availability rate to 20.2%. In conclusion, year 2020 accelerated Alexandria\u2019s leadership role in the life science ecosystem. Our team is energized and enthusiastic to continue our partnership with world-class enterprises and the fight against COVID-19 and in the broader mission of building the future of life-changing innovation. With that, I will hand it off to Peter. Peter Moglia : Thanks, Steve. I\u2019m going to follow-up on some remarks we made about our valuation on Investor Day. And then I\u2019m going to update you all on our development pipeline and briefly comment on a new acquisition. As the inventor and pioneer of the essential life science real estate asset class, we have created our campuses and clusters in the best locations with the market\u2019s best assets. By combining our irreplaceable locations and our world-class campuses and ecosystems with meticulously designed, highly functional buildings and a world-class tenant base, Alexandria has aggregated the best life science real estate base in the world and it isn\u2019t close. During Investor Day, we highlighted our views that the private market has been sending strong signals that there should be significant upside in our stock price. This included a comparison of Ventas\u2019 acquisition of the Genesis property in South San Francisco for $1,260 per square foot, which has since been updated to $1,301 per square foot. And Blackstone\u2019s recap of BMR at a value of $1,100 per square foot against a very simple back of the napkin, $767 per square foot implied value of our operating portfolio, which was based upon the difference between the closing price of our common stock on September 30, 2020, and the book value of other significant assets such as construction in progress, venture investments and cash divided by our total operating square feet. We acknowledge that the implied value of our operating portfolio can vary up or down depending upon the valuation of our other assets and liabilities as well as adjustments for joint ventures, but we believe the underlying thesis remains true, which is that Alexandria is significantly undervalued. The Genesis property is vastly inferior to our South San Francisco asset base. It is located on the opposite side of the 101 Freeway, making it part of the cluster by address only. The original South Tower is an office building conversion, which sat vacant for years and required some jerry rigging to make it work and will require more work to complete the conversion of the top floors. And the North Tower has relatively small floor place, which causes it to have a load factor that exceeds what is typically acceptable in the market. Both buildings have relatively low floor-to-floor heights that will dictate a lower finished ceiling than the market prefers. And as a result, the two buildings did not attract a high-quality tenant base. Blackstone has done well reforming and adding to BMRs original somewhat older and tired asset base. But given Alexandria superior locations, assets and tenants, our asset base should command a premium valuation on the real estate alone. Taking all this into account, our assets should be valued significantly higher than what is implied by today\u2019s stock price. Since Investor Day, more evidence from the private markets has come to light such as the sale of the 2.3 million square foot former Forest City lab portfolio from Brookfield to Blackstone BMR for $3.45 billion, which implied an approximately $1,500 per square foot total valuation according to Green Street. Approximately 90% of the portfolio is concentrated in University Park, which was the original Cambridge development area before the emergence of Kendall Square. And according to CoStar, the allocation to those assets yielded a value of $1,800 per square foot and an implied cap rate of 4.2%. This value, and therefore, the overall value of the transaction would have likely been materially higher if not for the fact that those assets are in relatively short to medium-term ground leases. When comparing this portfolio to Alexandria\u2019s primary Cambridge asset base located in the preferred Kendall square location. It should be apparent that the location of our assets are superior as we are aggregated at the front door of MIT, proximate to the Kendall square tea stop in the center of gravity of the East Cambridge ecosystem versus being on the western edge of MIT, far from the heart of the campus in the less desirable area of Cambridge port. Some sell-side analysts seem to agree with this premise. The five that have NAVs above our current stock price ranging from $175.54 to $184 per share, value our operating portfolio within a range of $824 per square foot to $1,062 per square foot. These same analysts have price targets ranging from $185 per square foot to $206. So they seem to be factoring in the private market activity we are seeing. If you are still not convinced and want to look at it from a different angle, I would encourage you to compare Alexandria\u2019s multiple to the sector FFO multiples published in cities weekly REIT and lodging strategy published on January 15. Even with all of the momentum in life science real estate, the single-family home sector\u2019s FFO multiple is 1.1 higher than ours. The industrial mixed ratio is 3.9 higher and the manufactured homes and data center FFO multiple ratios are 3.8 and 5.6 higher than Alexandria\u2019s, respectively. We are in the early days of the biology revolution with 10,000 known diseases and less than 10% of those are addressable treatments. COVID-19 has brought unprecedented positive sentiment to the sector as the world recognizes the life science industry\u2019s contributions to solving today\u2019s greatest health challenges. The five fundamentals that signals strong demand, government funding, medical research philanthropy, FDA regulatory environment, venture capital and public market investor sentiment and commercial R&D funding continue to have tailwinds and there is no reason to suspect that, that will change anytime soon. The life science industry is one of the few bright spots in the world today, and Alexandria is well positioned to enable and participate in its outside growth. We invite you to reassess your valuation and future prospects in light of the private market data presented and the significant prospects for growth in our underlying industry. On to development. We are pleased to report that we continue to make great progress with our development pipeline. We delivered 177,953 square feet and three projects in the fourth quarter including 100% of the 9877 Waples Street project in the Seromas submarket of San Diego, which was featured at Investor Day because it illustrated the power of our brand. When an existing tenant needed to expand, and we did not have space for them, they found a building and effectuated the sale to us by telling the owner it would only lease it from us because the facility was mission-critical to them, and they would not entrust its development and operation with anyone else. Leasing activity has been robust since the third quarter with over 913,000 square feet of leasing completed and approximately 50,000 square feet of space put under LOI in the development redevelopment pipeline, led by significant leasing at 201 Haskins in South San Francisco. The Alexandria center for Life Science San Carlos, 3115 Merryfield in San Diego, and the newly acquired Alexandria Center for Life Science, Durham, which significantly increased their pre-leasing percentages in the range of 27% to 58%. Overall, with the addition of 6 new projects, we now have approximately 3.3 million square feet under construction, that is 74% pre-leased, an increase of over 1.3 million square feet from last quarter\u2019s project aggregation, which was only 63% pre-leased. And as Joel mentioned, I would like to conclude by expressing our great pride and enthusiasm with the acquisition just recently closed 401 Park Drive, 201 Brookline and a continuous development site that will provide Alexandria operating income and an ability to realize upside by marking rents to market, converting certain office and retail space to lab, completing the lease-up of 201 Brookline and developing the future 400,000 square foot development opportunity into a world-class laboratory office building in the Fenway. We are also pleased to be developing this campus in a collaborative venture with esteemed local developer Samuelson associates, who has been the visionary for the Fenway for more than 20 years. With that, I\u2019m going to pass it over to Dean. Dean Shigenaga : Thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. Our team is super passionate about our strategic initiatives to drive unique, disruptive and highly impactful solutions to tackle society\u2019s most complex and pressing challenges. Now they are also very pleased with continued recognition as a leader in ESG. From our 115 projects focused on solving the opioid epidemic, combating the COVID-19 pandemic, the GRESB sector leadership and leadership in health, wellness and safety. Our team\u2019s passion goes well beyond operational excellence and strong financial and operating results from our real estate business. Our fourth quarter and year-end 2020 financial and operating results were outstanding. For 2020, we reported strong growth in total revenues of 23.1%, NOI growth of 24.8%, and adjusted EBITDA growth of 17.4%, EPS and FFO as adjusted of $6.01 and $7.70 per share diluted, respectively. Now our high-quality properties in tenant roster, combined with our outstanding execution by our best-in-class team, continue to generate strong performance, including many results representing some of the top in the REIT industry. Investment-grade rated or large-cap publicly traded companies generate 55% of our annual rental revenue, consistently high and timely payment of rent and well into the 99% range each month. Strong 5.1% cash same-property NOI growth. Strong leasing velocity with record rental rate growth of 37.6% and 18.3% on a cash basis, an adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%, highlighting operational excellence, occupancy of 94.6% or 97.7% adjusted for vacancy at recently acquired properties. And please see Page 25 of our supplemental package for details on vacancy at these recently acquired properties. Now I should briefly mention that our quarterly rental rate growth related to lease renewals and releasing of space does vary occasionally, since it is only 1/4 of our annual leasing volume. For example, in the third quarter of 2020, we reported 30.9% cash rental rate growth. And then in the fourth quarter of 2020, we reported 10.7% cash rental rate growth. I think the key takeaway is that rental rate growth for 2020 was very strong at 37.6% and 18.3% on a cash basis. And importantly, our outlook for 2021 reflects continued strength in the financial and operating performance, including rental rate growth on lease renewals and releasing of space at 30.5% and 17.5% at the midpoint of our guidance ranges. Now our team is executing extremely well. We are projecting strong growth in net operating income and cash flows. We anticipate significant growth in occupancy in 2021 and 2022, as our team executes on lease-up of recently acquired properties with vacancy. Additionally, as Peter highlighted, we have a very highly leased pipeline of projects undergoing construction and a very large volume of deliveries in 2021. Now it is important to highlight that our Board has been very consistent with our common stock dividend policy, given the high amount of operating cash flows after dividends that we generate each year. Now in 2020, the growth in our annual common stock dividend was 6%, and cash flows from operating activities after dividends is projected in 2021 to be approximately $230 million at the midpoint of our guidance. Now on Friday, we completed the purchase of what has been rebranded as the Alexandria Center for Life Science, Fenway. It is a campus of 1.8 million square feet upon full build-out. Now as a result, we expect to settle the $1.1 billion in forward equity sale agreements in March, and that was related to our January common stock offering. So huge kudos to our entire team for outstanding execution on this transaction and upon full build-out, this will represent another awesome collaborative campus in our asset base. It is super important to have one of the best teams in the country, since real estate transactions move quickly from selection by the seller to closing. And in this case, the seller selected Alexandria as the best party for this transaction on December 9. On the real estate disposition front, we provided our initial range of guidance for 2021 at a midpoint of $1.375 billion, and we will provide more information on dispositions quarter-to-quarter. Our team has really positioned us very well with our pipeline of redevelopment and development of Class A properties. The key highlights include execution over one million rentable square feet of leasing in 2020 related to our development and redevelopment pipeline. Projects undergoing construction aggregate 3.2 million rentable square feet or 74% leased, about 2.5 million or plus square feet of this is projected for delivery in 2021, making 2021 the largest year of deliveries for Alexandria. And this to generate annual net operating income of about $135 million, which on average, commences in the third quarter of 2021. Now we have a number of well-located near-term projects, aggregating 4.9 million rentable square feet including approximately 348,000 rentable square feet that is 79% leased with vertical construction commencing in the second quarter. And in January, we added two key projects under construction, aggregating 640,000 rentable square feet with pre-leasing in the 20% to 25% range. Now our venture portfolio continues to perform extremely well. Realized gains on our venture investments included in FFO per share were $21.6 million and $71.6 million for the fourth quarter and 2020, respectively. Now as a percentage of adjusted EBITDA, our venture investment gains were approximately 5.5% for 2020, up slightly from approximately the mid-4% range for 2019. And as we look forward into 2021, we expect venture investment gains to increase slightly as a percentage of adjusted EBITDA as we look to capture a portion of the unrealized gains in the portfolio. Unrealized gains on venture investments as of December 31 were $776 million on our adjusted cost basis of $835 million. Now thank you to our team for hitting our key balance sheet goals, and we are well positioning our balance sheet to support our strategic business initiatives. We are very pleased to have corporate credit ratings that rank in the top 10% of companies within the REIT industry. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 5.3 times for fourth quarter annualized with slight improvement to 5.2 times by the end of 2021. Now our fixed charge coverage ratio is 4.6 times for the fourth quarter annualized and is also expected to improve by the fourth quarter 2021. Liquidity was very solid at $4.1 billion, and we continue to view long-term capital to fund growth in our business and are very fortunate to have access to efficient cost of capital. Now to put this into perspective, pricing for 10 and 30-year bonds today for Alexandria is extremely attractive at approximately 2% and 3%, respectively. Our prior shelf registration expired in December 2020, three years after we filed it. An odd aspect of the ATM program is that each program is associated with a specific shelf registration versus the program that can be used as long as you have an effective shelf registration in place. Now in our case, our ATM program expired in connection with the shelf registration statement that expired in December. And as a result, we expect to file a new ATM program over the next 4 weeks. Moving on to guidance. Please refer to our detailed underlying assumptions included in our 2021 guidance, beginning on Page 12 of our supplemental package. Changes were limited to a breakout of our range of real estate dispositions from the overall equity type capital guidance. The midpoint of our guidance for dispositions, as I mentioned earlier, is at $1.375 billion. And we also provided an update on acquisitions completed in January 2021, most of which was previously disclosed. Now there were no changes in our 2021 guidance for EPS diluted of a range from $2.14 to $2.34 and FFO per share diluted of a range from $7.60 to $7.80. Now embedded in our overall guidance is continued strong growth in cash flows as we execute on the lease-up and occupancy growth in 2021 and 2022 and continued execution on an important year of record deliveries in 2021 of our highly leased redevelopment and development projects. With that, let me turn it back to Joel. Joel Marcus : Operator, if we could go to questions, please. Operator :  And the first question will come from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. James Feldman : I guess I want to start off with the Fenway acquisition. I\u2019m hoping you can talk a little bit more about what do you like about that submarket? What do you like about those - the 3 buildings or properties for the future? And then how should we be thinking about just your Boston strategy going forward, given - it just seems - now that you have moved to the mega cluster model, it just seems like there is a lot more submarkets to choose from. Where does Fenway fit into kind of the larger Alexandria footprint we might see? Joel Marcus : Yes. So thanks, Jamie. This is Joel. I will ask Peter to comment in a minute. We don\u2019t want to say too much about Fenway at this point. Peter has given a little bit of detail. He can talk a little more about it. I think it is pretty clear that the location of Fenway which has good proximity to the other submarkets, obviously, to Boston itself and Downtown and Cambridge, but it is also pretty proximate to the collection of important Harvard hospitals, et cetera. And it has been a submarket that has been, I think, quite vital for several decades, and we just think that time is right for the kind of change to a more life science orientation there. And so that is one of the motivations that certainly attracted us. It is pretty clear that the greater Boston region still is the number one region or I should say the number 1 cluster market in the world and still the major destination for so many companies because there is such a rich amount of science, talent capital and the location is certainly one that is excellent. So Peter, just general comments? Peter Moglia : Yes. Thanks, Jamie. Look, the 401 Park asset is a really nice office R&D building. It has some dry lab in it. It has a great tenant roster. It is got great duration and leases. And there is going to be opportunities for us to convert some of that to lab over time. The development of 201 Brookline is doing really well ever since we\u2019re awarded the transaction. There is been great activity. We will be reporting on that in future quarters. There is some opportunities at the 401 Park building as well to mark some rents to market. So overall, just typical Alexandria value creation play here with combination of using our brand to increase rents to bring new product to market, and ultimately, another building to create a nice urban campus. James Feldman : And then $1.5 billion, obviously, a very large transaction. Is this something we should expect to see from Alexandria going forward as just\u2026? Joel Marcus : Yes, I don\u2019t think you - people ask about that all the time about when we acquire something or become involved in a transaction. We never know what is - and I\u2019m sure Blackstone has the same feeling. You never know until a - like the University Park assets came forward when or if that will ever happen. So I don\u2019t think you can make any general assumptions about things like that. I think they\u2019re very opportunistic, and they\u2019re very dependent upon the time play space. So I wouldn\u2019t take anything, read anything into it or out of it. All - every one of these is just quite unique on their own. James Feldman : Okay. And then my last question is, if you look at your TIs in the quarter, definitely above-average for the year. Is there anything to read into about concessions? Joel Marcus : Steve and Dean, you guys maybe want to? Stephen Richardson : Hi, Jamie, it is Steve. Yes, that was really driven. We had two opportunities in core markets with two very exciting tenants to refresh buildings that were 15 to 20 years old. So we go - we went ahead and did that. The incremental yield was exceptionally strong, well into the double-digits. So when we see opportunities like that, we are going to move. So if you excluded those, I think we were in much more of a normal range. But it was opportunistic to go ahead and refresh buildings, secure great tenants. And have exceptionally strong yields as well on the incremental capital. James Feldman : Okay. And those are life science projects or office? Stephen Richardson : Yes. Joel Marcus : Well, yes, they... Operator : And the next question will come from Sheila McGrath with Evercore ISI. Sheila McGrath : I guess, Joel, I was wondering your thoughts on the new administration, if you believe there will be more or less favorable to biotech research and investment and also bringing manufacturing of pharma back to the U.S. just your big picture thoughts there? Joel Marcus : Yes. So we don\u2019t fully know what the health side of the administration is going to look like. We have some indication. But I would say it is too early to tell. I think, though, that when it comes to the enormous substrate, which exists in the NIH and in much of the funding that goes on at really the basic research level. That has remained, I think, very favorably bipartisan for decades now. And I don\u2019t think there will be any change in the increase-- the rate of increase with respect to that. I think the biggest worry would be a knee-jerk reaction by some to raise corporate taxes to try to somewhat either address deficits or just because it seems fair. But the challenge with that and policymakers and lawmakers should really know better and understand that plants can revert back to Ireland or more favorable tax havens and cash can go overseas if the incentives aren\u2019t made to do those things in America. So I hope that people take a long-term view of that. But at the moment, I think, by and large, it looks, I would say, favorable but still too early to tell. Sheila McGrath : Okay. And one other question. The investment portfolio had very strong gains in fourth quarter. Just - I know Dean touched on it a little bit, but I\u2019m just wondering, given where biotech indices are, if your thoughts on taking some more meaningful profits from that, those investments to invest in the pipeline - development pipeline? Joel Marcus : Well, we do, and we have done that from time to time. So the answer is, I\u2019m sure we will review that almost real-time and certainly consider that for sure. Operator : And the next question will come from Emmanuel Korchman with Citi. Emmanuel Korchman : Joel, just wanted to sort of circle back on the early remarks you made on the call about scale, and especially the scale you have in your cluster markets. Can you just elaborate on sort of the direct advantages of having the market trend and the scale versus an environment where the tenants are growing quickly? And at the same time, there is new supply being created. So are those kind of going to match up naturally where tenants are just going to slot into space that is available, maybe rather than working through a relationship they have had with you to build space years from now? Joel Marcus : You have revealed the office playbook because when you have a generic commodity product, that is true. But I think as Peter indicated or Steve, when you have a mission-critical project, much like the Waples in Sorrento Mesa with Cue Health, you don\u2019t just turn it over to the cheapest guy on the Street or the one who maybe has something available. It is much more careful than that. Office space, that is true. But when you have critical R&D and critical next-gen manufacturing, that just doesn\u2019t happen that way. Operator : Next question is from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Richard Anderson : So was looking back in time a little bit about your Moderna exposure, went from about 382,000 square feet in the first quarter to 615,000 square feet in the fourth quarter. I guess, my broader question is, is - can we consider COVID a new line of business? Perhaps, as Jenna mentioned, more leaning towards the therapy side once we kind of get beyond this year and now? Or is what I see, not something I should be reading through to in a broader sense? Joel Marcus : Well, I think maybe two things, Rich. One is, I think, COVID and pandemic virus, we have been through a number of mini ones over the years. But certainly, this is one of the biggest ones we have ever seen in our lifetime, different than HIV aids, which we did turn into a chronic condition. So I think and Jenna said, it will be with us for a long, long time, and there will be continual efforts not only on the vaccine side and the booster side, the testing side, this testing is going to be critical going forward, and then obviously, on the therapy side because if you can take a quick - if you can have access to therapy that is maybe not infusible, but 1 that is a pill like, just as you get a sour throat, you get a fever, that would be a whole lot better than trying to - or being very sick and looking for an infusion site. So there is a lot to do there. And I do think COVID will be a continuous business and these companies will be very busy. But I think one of the things about Moderna, in particular, we have bought into the mRNA revolution back almost a decade ago when Moderna was founded. And I think today, if you just separate out the COVID-19 stuff, Moderna represents really one of the most impressive and important platforms for many different - to address many different illnesses. Imagine if the body could replicate erythropoietin, so you didn\u2019t need to have constant external injections, et cetera, where the body itself could address different - or insulin where you could do it by regulation in a sense. So the opportunity is pretty big, and that is what we have looked at when we look at companies like Moderna, and there are obviously many more that have enormously big technology platforms. It is not simply a one product company. Richard Anderson : And then just 1 question on Fenway Park. Although not specifically, since I know you want to kind of keep it a little tight to the vest for the time being. But if memory serves the Longwood Medical Area perhaps did not pan out as well, if I - and correct me if I\u2019m wrong on that. But it is a further afield from Cambridge. If I\u2019m right on my recollection of Longwood - and I\u2019m not making enough judgment about you, I think your peers were invested there. What makes you think Fenway pretty close to Longwood would sort of work out this, using\u2026? Joel Marcus : Yes, your recollection is correct. We dipped our toe into the Longwood Medical Area, and it turns out, it is a pretty institutional area and one that is not a really vibrant one at night. But I think what\u2019s happened in Fenway, and certainly, our partner has been at the forefront of that is it is - they have really created a 24/7 live, work, play environment. Certainly, the park itself has been a major part of that. So I think it is a totally different submarket and a totally different feeling. So I think we have no qualms at all about the future there. Operator : The next question is from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll : And I think, Joel, you kind of touched on this a little bit earlier, but can you provide some color on the supply outlook for the space? And I know a few years ago, there were some concerns in South San Francisco, but those seem to have abated. Are there specific markets that ARE is tracking that we should kind of look out for? Joel Marcus : So I think Steve touched on that, Steve, do you want to maybe get the question? Stephen Richardson : Yes. Hi, Michael, it is Steve. No, you are right. We were monitoring South San Francisco closely with combination of Kilroy, PEAK and Blackstone at the time. And those projects have all been substantially leased. And look, we track literally building by building, parcel by parcel in each of our markets very closely, and we just don\u2019t see a lot of new Class A high-quality product being delivered. There has been a lot in the press about conversions. And I think at Investor Day, we kind of went through that chapter inverse, and I highlighted it in the comments today, so we stay very vigilant in our analysis of that. But at the current time, we just don\u2019t see significant supply disruptions happening in the market. Michael Carroll : Okay. Great. And then, I guess, can you talk a little bit about, I guess, the Mercer Mega Block deal. What\u2019s the time line on that potential acquisition and/or, I guess, the development you do acquire, what\u2019s holding it up? And what should we be expecting there? Joel Marcus : Yes. I think we don\u2019t know precisely, but I think sometime over the next 6 months, part of it is diligence and part of it, as you know, the city has gone through quite a shock over the last probably since, what, late May. Triggered by the death of George Floyd and has had its share of tumult. And obviously, the city - both the Mayor and the counsel have been fighting. Obviously, there was a defund police effort going on there. So I think part of the effort is, hopefully, for the city, I think there is a Mayor election coming up, I think, maybe later this year to get back into a more normal environment. We hope that is true. And this, certainly, I think you will see activity on this over the next six months. But I think Seattle, certainly, South Lake Union remains a very safe and really good area. Seattle\u2019s got a strong, obviously, on the technology side anchored by the likes of Amazon and Microsoft across the water and the big Facebook and Google and the big things are up there other than Netflix different way. So I think that is been all positive. The life science industry, as you know, Peter, I think, talked about our pricing on the partial interest sale we made in a couple of assets. Seattle has attracted a lot of institutional money and the life science industry certainly is growing well, anchored by the Fred Hutch and the University of Washington. So it is a pretty positive outlook there. Operator : And our next question will come from Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Thomas Catherwood : So Steve and Dean, you both kind of alluded to this topic, but I wanted to dive into it a little more. We know that the same-store NOI growth guidance on a GAAP basis is 2% for the year. But you have done nearly $6.3 billion of acquisitions over the last 25 months. And I assume most of those, if not all of them, are not in the same-store pool. So how should we think about NOI growth in 2021 from the lease-up and mark-to-market on these non-same-store assets? Dean Shigenaga : Well, as Tom, it is Dean here, just to clarify. As I mentioned in our commentary, and you have our guidance for 2021, which our guidance for occupancy covers the entire asset base in the operating portfolio, and you have got something in the range of, I think, 170 basis point growth in occupancy, and then that continues into 2022 as well. We\u2019re actually likely to pick up something approaching 300 basis points over the two calendar years. So you are going to see occupancy growth from the acquisitions be a key driver and it is not - we find the asset that fit our business profile nicely. And occasionally they come with some vacancy that we need to manage. But fortunately, we feel comfortable about making good progress on that in 2021. So that is going to be a key driver, and you will see that continue to benefit into 2022 as well. So that is important to note. It is just not a one year trend. I think 2022 will benefit probably as well in the same-property pool because some of those properties will start to drop into the same-property pool over time. Thomas Catherwood : Got it. That is really helpful, Dean. And then kind of along the same lines, looking at newly acquired assets and all and development assets as well. So a number of development projects shift between your intermediate classification and your near-term classification. But one that had kind of a real marked jump was the Arsenal on the Charles, where 200,000 square feet of future redevelopment moved from the future bucket to near-term, it is kind of a 2-phase jump, and you also picked up an extra 81,000 square feet of potential redevelopment. Can you speak a little bit to the demand that you are seeing in Watertown and how that is driving this acceleration of your redevelopment plans? Joel Marcus : Yes. So I don\u2019t want to get into too much there at the moment because nothing has been formally announced. But one thing that has been announced that you have seen in a lot of the papers is the next-gen innovation technologies and manufacturing consortium with ourselves, Fujifilm, MIT, Harvard have selected that site as the home of this enterprise. And then there are a host of other, I would say, advanced technology companies, life science companies and other things that have sought that location as being, I think, very proximate to Cambridge and transportation being easier to deal with than some of the other submarkets that are, I think, harder to get in and out. Alewife is a good example. We stayed out of Alewife because we believe that transportation in and transportation out have been super problematic. And so that is been one of the challenges that when we have looked at acquisitions in that submarket, they have kind of confounded us to figure out how we can solve the transportation problem, but Watertown is, I think, in much better shape. So I would say stay tuned. Operator : Next question is from Tayo Okusanya with Mizuho. Omotayo Okusanya : Most of my questions have been answered, but quick one. One of your largest tenants, not top 10, but just outside top 10, bluebird bio is doing some type of spin-off of one of its units. Just kind of curious... Joel Marcus : I\u2019m sorry, what? Omotayo Okusanya : One of your tenants, bluebird bio? Joel Marcus : Yes? Omotayo Okusanya : They\u2019re doing a spin-off of one of their business units. Just curious if that has any implications for their current lease with you guys? Joel Marcus : I\u2019m sorry. So the question is what? Omotayo Okusanya : They are spinning off one of their business units. Does that have any implications for the current lease they have with you? Joel Marcus : Well, we don\u2019t know the answer to that. They may sublease, and they may not. Jenna, do you want to maybe just comment on the nature of that change? Jenna Foger : Sure, for sure. So bluebird bio, basically announced. They haven\u2019t disclosed the details other than that they\u2019re basically dividing the company between severe genetic diseases and oncology company. And so we usually have exposure to them in Greater Boston, specifically in Cambridge and then in Seattle. And so basically, they\u2019re - everything that they\u2019re retaining in place is what they have kind of with us, both in terms of their H2 in Cambridge and then manufacturing in Seattle, so we\u2019re really not concerned about that at all. Joel Marcus : Yes. And it would be easy to backfill space if we had it in those locations, I can tell you. Operator : The next question is a follow-up from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. James Feldman : Just quickly, I wanted to go back to Dean\u2019s comment on - you said that investment gains as a percentage of EBITDA you expect to be higher this year than last year. Can you maybe quantify that? How big of a portion of EBITDA do you think it can be? Dean Shigenaga : It is just - Jamie, it is Dean here. It is slight. I think what my comments were - in 2019 was probably in the 4.5% range, 2020 was probably about 5.5% of EBITDA and just a slight growth anticipated as we look out to 2021 on top of that. So it is still staying pretty small as a percentage of overall EBITDA. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks. Joel Marcus : No closing remarks other than to wish everybody be safe, be healthy and COVID-free, and we look forward to talking to you on the first quarter call. Thank you again, everybody. Operator : Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz with Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Paula Schwartz : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The Company\u2019s actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the Company\u2019s periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel. Joel Marcus : Thank you, Paula, and welcome, everybody to our first quarter call. And with me today are Dean Shigenaga, Steve Richardson and Peter Moglia. And we want to wish everybody a safe and a healthy go forward year. We want to welcome all to this first quarter call as well and recognize and thank the entire Alexandria family team for the operationally excellent and truly stellar first quarter earnings report by all metrics and measures. We collectively continue to operate at an outstandingly high level into this second year of the COVID-19 pandemic. And as I\u2019m often fond of quoting Jim Collins of \u201cGood to Great\u201d theme, commented on Alexandria\u2019s feature in our Annual Report. Alexandria has achieved the three outputs that define a great company : Superior results, and we believe the first quarter is emblematic of that; distinctive impact, and we believe that our social responsibility programs have truly made a difference; and lasting endurance. And with respect to lasting endurance, we sit here at literally several decades after we were founded in 1994. And I\u2019ll talk more about that in a moment. We\u2019re particularly proud of the six pillars of our highly impactful and longstanding social responsibility efforts, accelerating groundbreaking medical research to advance lifesaving treatments and cures; harnessing the entire agrifood ecosystem to combat hunger, improve nutrition, and support human health at its most fundamental level; thirdly, bolstering the resilience of our military, our veterans and their families; fourth, conquering the opioid epidemic and revolutionizing addiction treatment; the fifth pillar that we\u2019ve spent a tremendous amount of time in over the last year and for a good part of the last decade, educationally empowering underserved students to achieve long-term success, and reach their potential as important principled leaders in the community; and then, finally, building a model for comprehensive sustainable solution to address homelessness. Alexandria is also proud to be the focus cover story of the January-February 2021 NAREIT magazine, showcasing that we have pioneered a novel data-driven comprehensive care model to overcome the opioid epidemic launched in Dayton, Ohio. We\u2019re now focused on adopting a similar model but in different respects to the homeless problem, which has really become pretty out of control in many urban cities. And it is fraught with a lot of complex stratified issues and actually is more of an issue of healthcare than it is simply of one of housing. We\u2019ve been recognized as a leader and continuing, and we continue to enhance our leadership in the area of sustainability. And we\u2019re on pace to achieve our first net zero energy building in South San Francisco, one of our important sub markets, and only one of 70 of such buildings in the entire world. So, we\u2019re very proud of that achievement when we finally get the designation. I always try to think about a theme on each quarter, and they are so different given macro and micro circumstances. And I would say, the theme for the first quarter has to be exceptional core and internal growth, and really stellar value creation and external growth, both of which have driven our continued outstanding earnings results. And as the absolute go to landlord and life science real estate. Leasing demand for Alexandria\u2019s owned and operated first-in-class assets is at a historical high. And as I alluded to a moment ago, first quarter of 1994, 27 years ago, this quarter, we completed our Series A financing led by Jacobs Engineering for $19 million. And here, we sit 27 years later to the quarter, with a total market cap of $32.5 billion and among the top 10 of all REITs. I remember attending the first REAT conference, I think it was in New Orleans in 1994, and I didn\u2019t know a single soul. So, we\u2019ve come a long way. And we still are in our fourth consecutive quarter of COVID-19, something we -- none of us will ever forget. The stellar results by any measure or metric is we\u2019re very proud and we thank each and every one of our great team members. Dean will speak to the outstanding core and internal growth results, driven in part by strong rental rate growth, and particularly featured this quarter in the San Francisco Bay region among others, one of our highest leasing quarters ever. And Steve and Peter will also speak to our stellar value-creation growth in part driven by our collaborative Fenway blockbuster transaction, and we greatly appreciate and recognize the team that put that together, a very highly leased valuation creation pipeline which will provide continuing growth for Alexandria. And so, we\u2019re very proud of that. Also important to note, and I think Steve, Peter and Dean will also allude to this. Our partial interest sale this quarter, I think set a true benchmark valuation for Alexandria owned and operated first-in-class lab space in the South San Francisco submarket, led by both Steve and Peter. And Peter in particular, who we brought here in 1998, who had special and unique joint venture talent and a stellar network, and we\u2019ve been added under his guidance there for 20-years. So, we thank those two very much for that execution and the teams that supported them. We completed our first quarter with a very strong balance sheet, Dean will talk about that with no debt maturities until 2024. And as some of you are aware, we filed an S-1 with the SEC to raise $250 million for an Alexandria sponsored SPAC, importantly, because we believe there was a real need for this in our core agrifoodtech industry. And as we are in a quiet period, we won\u2019t be discussing this at all. Moving on to life science industry for a moment, the velocity and continuing demand for Alexandria lab space across our cluster markets is as strong as we\u2019ve ever experienced. The pace of FDA approvals during the first quarter remained very strong with FDA approving 14 new drugs, 36% of those were Alexandria client tenants. We also note strong bipartisan support, and a proposed whopping 20% increase for the budgets of NIH, CDC and HHS. We don\u2019t know about FDA at this moment, and hopefully, the administration will select, in the not too distant future, a true great leader there, and we\u2019re hoping for that. Public markets continued their strong pace with $4.5 billion raised in 29 IPOs this past quarter and 100 -- I\u2019m sorry, $12.6 billion raised in follow-on offerings, truly kind of a stellar capital markets quarter. Biopharma continues to invest heavily in its own R&D, likely north of $225 billion for all of 2021. Let me comment a moment about some proposed corporate tax changes that were announced by the current administration, which if enacted in the law would foolishly and directly hurt U.S. manufacturing, U.S. R&D and the repatriation of crucial supply chains that became evident in the pandemic that we were really woefully unprepared and relied on 70% of our supply chain efforts outside of the United States. I would say mission-critical sectors, including biopharma certainly will not be will not be helped. In essence, the threat to the American competitiveness is way bigger and way more important than the everyday life of Americans, and higher rates -- than higher rates and a sad commentary and poor public policy. It\u2019s interesting to note, the paradox of this pandemic moment, large corporations have oftentimes been politically villainized derided by the left and the right, yet the main and perhaps only reason COVID-19 scourge is easing is the vaccines that were developed by biopharma and some in connection with the government in a groundbreaking effort with the warp speed effort. And we\u2019re very, very thankful for that. I think to quote, Alex Gorsky, CEO of J&J, he made a pretty important quote recently and said, \u201cWe fundamentally believe that having a market-based, innovation-based biopharmaceutical industry, as well as a medical-technology environment is critical long term to produce the best overall outcomes for healthcare.\u201d And I think that absolutely reigns true. So, as I do each quarter, let me finish with a -- or I did last quarter and will each quarter, a quote, kind of a timely quote. I quoted Confucius last quarter. Let me quote this quarter, Steve Prefontaine, one of the world-class runners of his time. \u201cTo give anything less than your best is to sacrifice the gift.\u201d And with that, let me turn it over to Steve Richardson. Steve Richardson : Thank you, Joel, and welcome everybody as well. As we presented during the last quarterly call, 2020 represented an exceptional year of high-quality growth for Alexandria, as we increased the asset base by 27% to nearly 50 million square feet. Now, the first quarter of 2021, a truly blowout quarter by all metrics, has clearly signaled the continuation of this exceptional growth trajectory and definitively affirms Alexandria\u2019s leadership role in the now core life science asset class, and it\u2019s highly valued status within the broad life science ecosystem. The Company\u2019s 27-year commitment to operational excellence at every level fuels the following outperformance highlights for Q1. Accounts receivable, we\u2019ve collected 99.4% of our April AR billings as of today. And again, Alexandria\u2019s labs are essential infrastructure and have been operational from day one of the pandemic. Some detail on leasing outperformance. During Q1, we leased approximately 1,677,000 square feet, which notably represents the second highest quarterly leasing activity during the past five years, an amazing statistic considering the broader turmoil in the office market. Peter will touch on this in more detail, but the current and near-term development pipeline continues to deliver value in a de-risked manner as we are at 76% leased and negotiating, even while adding 1 million square feet of new starts during this quarter. The core in particular is exceptionally strong. We continue to highlight and bring everyone\u2019s attention to the embedded growth and value within the core operating platform, comprised now of nearly 34 million square feet with cash increases this quarter of 17.4% and GAAP increases of 36.2%. On occupancy, also very, very solid with 94.5% which has grown in excess of 2 million square feet this quarter, compared to Q4 through our strategic acquisition activity. And we want to continue to bring to everyone\u2019s attention the near-term opportunity for increasing cash flows through the lease-up of 1.2 million square feet of existing inventory provided by these recent acquisitions. Overall, on market health, demand continues to be robust in our core clusters, and our mega campus offerings provide a significant competitive advantage to the Company. Importantly, subleases are in tight check as since the start of 2021, just two subleases have been brought to market in one of our clusters, and both of those subleases have already been put under LOI. Supply more broadly is constrained for 2021 across all of our markets. And in the two largest markets for 2022, we\u2019ve seen nearly 50% of the supply is pre-leased in Greater Boston, and in the San Francisco Bay Area, we\u2019re monitoring just two projects for potential vertical activity in 2022. And as we\u2019ve stated before, Alexandria\u2019s mega campus, high-quality Class A product offerings continue to outperform any inferior one-off Class B office conversions in isolated locations. The year 2020 was truly an amazing year for Alexandria at the vanguard and heart of the life science ecosystem. And now, the first quarter of 2021 has exceeded those accomplishments with stellar performance. And in conclusion, I\u2019d like to add to Joel, shout out to the entire Alexandria team for this quarter\u2019s achievements. With that, I\u2019ll hand it off to Peter. Peter Moglia : Thanks, Steve. I\u2019m going to update you all on our development pipeline, comment on construction cost escalations and discuss a couple of life science sales. We continue to work at a very productive pace, delivering 376,645 square feet during the quarter, including the full delivery of 9804 Medical Center Drive in Rockville, Maryland to a high-quality cell therapy company at an 8% cash yield, which was 80 basis points above our initial disclosure. The project\u2019s outperformance was the direct result of our best-in-class team who were able to drive down overall cost savings through a combination of adept schedule management, alternative construction techniques, and highly effective coordination with the tenants. In addition, we fully delivered the 100,086 square-foot, 1165 Eastlake Avenue East building in Seattle to Adaptive Biotechnologies, a cutting-edge public immune medicine company on the front lines of fighting COVID-19. This building is highly unique as it sits on the edge of Lake Union offering expansive views of the lake\u2019s clean end in downtown Seattle. Leasing activity on our pipeline continues to be robust with approximately 789,000 square feet leased during the quarter and another approximately 450,000 square feet in executed LOIs. Highlights include completing the lease-up of 3115 Merryfield Row, well in advance of its 2022 delivery date. Incremental progress at Alexandria Center for Life Long Island City, which is approaching being half leased and committed and a surge of activity in both, SD Tech and our newly acquired 201 Brookline asset in the Fenway area of Boston.  At SD Tech, we executed LOIs increasing its lease negotiating status by 37% as tenants affirm the attractiveness of our transformation of this historical midsized tech campus into a highly amenitized science and technology mega campus. As impressive as that is, the response by the market to our Fenway transaction and 201 Brookline has been even more remarkable. When we closed on that transaction in late January, the asset was 17% leased. As we sit today, we have letters of intent that when converted to leases, will bring that percentage up to 84%. This is a testament to the trust life science companies have in our best-in-class brand as these opportunities came to 201 Brookline in large part because of Alexandria. Overall, with the addition of five new projects and the full delivery of 9804 Medical Center Drive, we now have approximately 4 million square feet under construction that is 66% pre-leased and 76% committed when including signed LOIs. That is only 2% below the committed leasing percentage from last year\u2019s -- or from last quarter, and as Steve alluded to, despite the fact that we\u2019ve also added 1 million square feet of new projects. Given the recent news on anticipated inflation, we wanted to give you guys an update on construction cost escalations as it relates to our pipeline. Before we get into what is happening in the construction market, we want to note that the projects listed on page 42 that make up the 4 million square feet under construction, are largely subject to guaranteed maximum price contracts, which protect us from any escalations not already negotiated into the pricing. Under construction projects that are still in negotiations, those that -- well, the ones that are still in negotiations have been conservatively underwritten with a conservative escalation range applied in our underwriting. The 80 basis-point yield at 9804 Medical Center Drive that I spoke about earlier is a testament to our conservative underwriting and outstanding budget management. As we all know, coming into 2020, we all expected growth in the real estate sector to continue. And we were all taken by surprise when the global pandemic created disruption in our personal and professional lives. As reported in our 1Q call last year, Alexandria was required to temporarily suspend seven projects during the quarter due to COVID-19. But with life science being deemed an essential business, we were able to restart relatively quickly. That wasn\u2019t so for many other developers and a large number of projects were put on hold or cancelled altogether. That caused general and subcontractor backlogs to shrink. And for a moment, in the middle of the year, most major contractors assumed the worst and laid off workers. Demand for materials also diminished and for a brief period of time, overall construction costs trended lower than pre-COVID levels. We know in California that costs dropped as much as 2% during that time. However, as news of the effectiveness of vaccines came to light towards the end of the year, the construction industry experienced a V-shaped recovery led by residential and advanced technology, with life science and healthcare contributing to the sudden increase as well. One of our major contractors had to pivot quickly and today is still spending 10 hours a week on hiring as backlogs grow. In addition to the shortage of labor, costs are being materially influenced by a shortage of subcontractor shop capacity. The makers of glazing, duct work and other prefabricated materials have more work than they can handle, so many are increasing pricing to control their backlog. On top of that, the demand for raw materials is putting pressure on steel, copper, lumber and plywood. Steel is up 20% from April 2020 to February of this year. Copper is up 37% and lumber and plywood are up 62% over the same period. Although these percentages are high, materials are only 30% to 35% of the total cost stack. So, we\u2019ve been advised to plan for 5% to 6% annual escalations in the aggregate over the next 12 months. Rest assured, Alexandria constantly stays in front of this data, factors it into our underwriting and employee strategies to mitigate its impact. As a major developer with a number of significant major contractor and subcontractor relationships, we are able to leverage preferred pricing and priority in the queue. We have a great reputation among our vendors as we treat them like partners, and that enables us to continue to deliver on time and on budget in any market condition. I\u2019ll conclude my commentary by talking about some private cap rates that you should factor into your NAV models. Our own partial interest sale of the 300,930 square-foot 213 East Grand building in South San Francisco was executed at a record 4% cap rate and translates to a value of $1,429 per square foot. This should be very impactful to our overall valuation as South San Francisco is one of our largest submarkets as we hold 3.3 million square feet in operation or under development. Despite the fact that the rent is approximately 20% to 25% below market on that asset, the lease goes for another 12 years. So, we believe the yield is very reflective of what investors are willing to pay today for first-in-class Alexandria owned and stabilized assets. We\u2019d also like to report that Blackstone sold 454,000 square-foot, 96% lease Science Technology Park at Johns Hopkins to Ventas for $272 million or $600 per square foot, which is a 4.8% cap rate. Although the asset has strong tenancy, the neighborhood is tough. So, this was a positive outcome for Blackstone and another testament to the high demand for life science assets today. With that, I\u2019ll pass it over to Dean. Dean Shigenaga : Peter, thanks. Dean Shigenaga here. And good afternoon, everyone. I just want to kick off with a huge congratulations to our entire team for just a spectacular quarter of exceptional execution. The first quarter of 2021, when you compare it to the fourth quarter, reflects one of the strongest operating and financial results in the Company\u2019s history, with our unique and differentiated life science real estate platform really at the core of this very strong growth. Our highly experienced team, trusted partnership to the life science industry and high-quality campuses and key centers of innovation continues to generate significant growth and value. Now, I want to kick off with allocation and sources of capital. We continue to remain very-disciplined with the allocation of capital in the projects that have and will generate significant long-term cash flows and tremendous value for our company and shareholders. Now, let me take a moment to highlight again the exceptional execution by our team. During the first quarter, we strategically increased our current and future pipeline of development and redevelopment opportunities with $1.9 billion in acquisitions. These value creation-related acquisitions also included in-place cash flows that contributed to a very strong NOI growth in the quarter. Importantly, though, through these acquisitions, we added a number of very high-quality current and future development and redevelopment projects to our pipeline. Another key driver of strong NOI growth in the first quarter was the delivery and completion of development and redevelopment projects, aggregating 376,000 rentable square feet that were 100% leased. And on average, these were delivered mid-quarter. As of March 31st, we had 4 million rentable square feet of some of the best laboratory space under construction that was highly leased negotiating at 76%. And this included 1 million rentable square feet of projects that were added in the first quarter. Now importantly, over the last four quarters, our team executed leases aggregating almost 1.8 million rentable square feet related to the development and redevelopment projects. And this included 789,000 rentable square feet of leases that we executed in the current quarter. Now, these are truly spectacular stats, highlighting that we are the trusted partner to the life science industry. Now, we are very pleased with our allocation of capital to these value-creation projects as these projects are on track to generate significant value, as highlighted by the partial interest sale we completed in the first quarter at a spectacular cap rate of 4%. We have a great pipeline of near-term and intermediate-term projects aggregating 9.2 million rentable square feet, and we\u2019re in a strong position to meet the demand from our broad and diverse network of life science and agtech relationships. We have also been very strategic and disciplined with sources of capital and have for many years been taking advantage of the continued exceptional growth in private market valuation for our properties. As Peter highlighted, we completed a 70% partial interest sale at $301 million in a Class A property located in South San Francisco that is leased long term to Merck. Now this transaction, as Peter highlighted, sold at a record cap rate of 4% at $1,429 per square foot and really generated a spectacular profit margin of 53%. Now, this transaction highlights continued tightening of cap rates and growth in price per square foot for our high-quality life science properties. Proceeds from real estate dispositions remain an important low-cost component of our sources of capital each year. And we have completed real estate dispositions aggregating $324 million to date and have several transactions moving along that will allow us to hit our real estate disposition forecast range from $1.25 billion to $1.5 billion, and we expect to provide more details on real estate dispositions next quarter. Now additionally, we expect to generate capital for reinvestment from our venture investment program and more on this topic in a moment. Next, I wanted to really turn to real estate, which is at the core of our strong growth. We reported total revenues in the first quarter of $480 million or $1.9 billion annualized, up 9.1% over the first quarter of \u201820 and over double total revenues reported five years ago in the first quarter of 2016. Now, we continue to report exceptional real estate financial and operating results, resulting in solid growth in our outlook for 2021. We delivered the following outstanding results in the quarter. Very strong cash net operating income growth of 10.3%. And again, congratulations to our leasing team for truly awesome execution of leasing. We hit the second highest quarter of leases executed in the history of the company at 1.7 million rentable square feet, continued strong rental rate growth on lease renewals and re-leasing the space at 36.2% and 17.4% on a cash basis. And we\u2019re in a great position today and updated our outlook for rental rate growth for 2021 by 100 basis points to a range from 30% to 33%, and from 17% to 20% on a cash basis, and again, record leasing on the development and redevelopment projects over the last four quarters at 1.8 million rentable square feet. That includes the 789,000 square feet that we executed on in the first quarter. Now, we\u2019re off to a great start, and we\u2019re on track for strong same-property NOI growth for 2021. First quarter same-property NOI growth was strong and up 4.4% and 6.1% on a cash basis. And the strength of our real estate vertical drove improvement in our outlook for same-property NOI growth for 2021. We increased our outlook by 50 basis points to a range from 1.5% to 3.5% and 30 basis points on a cash basis to a range from 4.3% to 6.3%. Our EBITDA margin was very strong at 69%, one of the best in the REIT industry. And our occupancy remains very strong at 94.5% and represents a key area that will drive growth in cash flows in 2021 and 2022. And please refer to page 25 of our supplemental package for details on the recently acquired vacancy aggregating 1.2 million rentable square feet. 26% of this 1.2 million rentable square feet -- a vacancy is leased with most of this 26% taking occupancy over the next two quarters. And we\u2019re forecasting solid occupancy growth in 2021 of 100 basis points, with half of this increase forecasted in the third quarter and the remaining growth in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re also forecasting stronger occupancy growth into 2022. Now, briefly on venture investments. Our venture investment portfolio continues to perform exceptionally well. And as of March 31st had unrealized gains of $729 million on an adjusted cost basis of $912 million. Now, our adjusted cost base has represented only 3.2% of gross assets as of March 31st. Realized gains on our venture investments included an FFO per share were $24.3 million, up only $2.7 million over the fourth quarter of \u201820. Now looking forward to the rest of 2021. Realized gains from our venture investments should be in the $25 million to $27 million range per quarter. Now, importantly, we also realized an additional gain of $22.9 million that related to an investment in a privately-held clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused in the oncology area that was acquired by a large equity cap biopharma company. Now, this significant gain related to 1 transaction and was excluded from FFO per share as adjusted. We have significant unrealized gains of $725 million in our venture investment holdings, and we hope to have additional opportunities to generate capital and reduce the portion of our future equity capital needs by approximately $100 million in 2021. Now, turning to our very strong and flexible balance sheet, which really supports our strategic growth initiatives. We\u2019re very proud of what our team has accomplished over recent years. Our overall corporate credit ratings from Moody\u2019s and S&P ranks within the top 10% of all equity REITs. Over the past nine quarters, our team has issued $6.2 billion of unsecured senior notes payable, representing 72% of our total outstanding debt at a weighted average effective rate of 3.26% and a term of almost 16 years. Now, the debt capital consisted of both, growth capital and refinancing capital that significantly extended our weighted average remaining term of outstanding debt to 13 years and locked in very attractive long-term fixed rate debt. The February 2021 bond offering was a key example. We took advantage of very attractive interest rate environment and opportunistically issued $1.75 billion in unsecured notes, with a portion of the proceeds used to refinance $650 million of notes that were due in 2024. Now, these new notes were issued at an amazingly low rate of 2% for 11-year notes, 3% for 30-year notes. Also, we just wanted to highlight other balance sheet statistics for the quarter and the year. We remain on track for continued improvement in net debt to adjusted EBITDA to 5.2 times by year-end. Our fixed charge coverage ratio is very strong and has increased to 4.7 times for the first quarter annualized. And we continue to maintain significant liquidity of $4.3 billion. And as Joel had touched on earlier, no debt maturities until 2024 and only $184 million coming due in 2024. Touching on guidance here, as we wrap up, as a reminder, just want to refer you to pages 11 and 12 of our supplemental package for detailed and updated guidance assumptions for 2021. Our improved outlook for 2021 over the prior guidance captures the strength of our real estate performance, including an improvement in rental rate growth and growth in both same-property and overall net operating income. Now, EPS diluted was updated to a range from $1.58 to $1.68, and FFO per share as adjusted was updated to a range from $7.68 to $7.78. And the midpoint of that range for FFO per share of $7.73 is up $0.03 over the prior guidance and represents projected growth of about 5.9% over our strong FFO per share results for 2020 of $7.30. With that, let me turn it back over to Joel. Thank you. Joel Marcus : So, operator, if we could go to question-and-answer, please? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Manny Korchman with Citi. Manny Korchman : Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Maybe this is for Steve or -- maybe this one will go to Steve. As you speak to your tenants about the markets that they\u2019re looking at, it looks like you\u2019re going out of your sort of core cluster markets, spending close to buy but out of those core clusters. Is that tenant-driven or is that just where the opportunity for this Company now lies? Joel Marcus : Yes. Well, this is Joel. So, maybe let me address that in a macro way. I don\u2019t think you could say we\u2019re going after our core cluster markets. The core cluster market you\u2019re referring to, maybe Fenway, is really, if you look at the Greater Boston market, Cambridge has been the hallmark, but there have been a set of inner suburbs, if you will, that are somewhat -- have somewhat adjacency to the Cambridge area that have been attractive. Seaport\u2019s been there for quite a while and many others have had life science activities. So, I think, it\u2019s part of just growth overall. And we\u2019re very selective about where we go and how we do it. And Fenway was a natural. I think I said last quarter, we\u2019ve been eyeing Fenway for more than a decade as it is kind of a connection from -- to Longwood, where we\u2019ve had activity and certainly one of the core markets, core cluster markets at Cambridge. But, I don\u2019t think -- I wouldn\u2019t characterize it out of the core market by any means. I don\u2019t know, Steve, if you want to comment on that. Steve Richardson : Yes. I would add to that. Manny, it\u2019s Steve here. It is an expansion, incremental expansion of the core clusters. So, it\u2019s not new markets or new clusters. I would absolutely characterize it as expansion of existing core clusters. Manny Korchman : And Dean, I know you mentioned that you can give more detail on dispositions in the coming quarters. But, should we expect those to be similar to what you\u2019ve done this quarter with a large JV sale, or do you think you\u2019ll actually exit some assets outright? Dean Shigenaga : Manny, it\u2019s Dean here. The bulk of the dispositions that are targeted for the remainder of \u201821 are focused on -- bulk of the dollars are focused on partial interest sales. So, these will be high-value, low-cap rate, extremely attractive cost of capital transactions. It\u2019s possible we have some amount over the next year or two of outright sales as well. But, stay tuned on that. Joel Marcus : Yes. And I would say, let me add a footnote to what Dean said. I think, Manny, you saw us make a move to sale of the Stripe and Pinterest buildings, which we developed early on in -- starting in 2014 circa in San Francisco opportunistically and made a sale of those entire buildings. And there are some assets that we are eyeing for that. So, it could well be a combination. Operator : Our next question will come from James Feldman with Bank of America. Please go ahead. James Feldman : I guess, my first question, can you just talk about market rent growth? I mean, I know the condition is very tight. You guys are talking about very strong fundamentals. But, what have you seen across the markets year-to-date? Joel Marcus : Yes. I think, I\u2019ll ask Steve to comment. But I think it's fair to say that across almost all the markets, maybe New York City would be the exception. We've seen, as I say, exceptional demand for Alexandria owned and operated first in class assets and I think that's really cut across all markets. But Steve, you could give some macro color? Steve Richardson : Yes, I do want to underline that it has been across all the markets, certainly, Research Triangle in Maryland, we've seen nice growth there as well as Seattle, San Diego, Cambridge, San Francisco. And I guess, Jamie, when you look at our re-leasing and renewal stats, this quarter, it's 17% plus cash and 36% GAAP. In the last four quarters, 2020 in entirety, was in that range as well. I think that really speaks for itself as you see rent growth overtime here on these Class A assets. James Feldman : So can you quantify how much you think rents are up today over a year ago? I know you have lease spreads with the actual market rents? I guess I'm curious based on the rising construction costs and pricing power, just how it's holding up? Steve Richardson : I would broadly say that lease rates are exceeding the anticipated construction costs increases. So it's all positive. Peter Moglia : I can just give anecdotally our analysis showed that just quarter-over-quarter, so 4Q to 1Q, market rents were up over 3.5% just for the quarter. So you can annualize that you know double digits. James Feldman : And then can you talk about the business plan at Watertown mall and why focus on that sub-market versus some of the other Boston sub-markets? Joel Marcus : So the answer is we won't talk about that specifically. But we've been in Watertown for maybe as much as 20 years. We've felt that was an attractive adjacent sub-market to the Cambridge market. Life Science has always enjoyed going there. We clearly made a big move with the Arsenal on the Charles and that campus and what we're doing to redevelop and develop that. The Watertown mall is kind of an adjacency. And what you're looking at is kind of a mega campus in Watertown. We're seeing some great R&D continuing to favor that market. I think if you look at that versus some of the sub-markets in and around the Greater Boston Market where transport is really, really difficult, I think Watertown is one which is, I think, easier to both ingress and egress and that's been a real attractive thing as well. But as far as this specific asset, I don't think we want to comment. James Feldman : And then finally, you guys have commented on constrained supply in '21 and '22. I think you were talking mostly about new construction. Can you just talk about conversions and what you think will be competitive in '21, '22 and even into '23 as you look across the major markets? Joel Marcus : Yes. I mean, Steve can comment on a macro way. We just haven't -- there's a lot of smoke but not a lot of fire and we have some anecdotal evidence of even some that have been attempted that have really kind of totally failed. And they're not an attractive alternative for first in class companies that are looking for high quality space. We just haven't seen this tsunami of conversions that people are talking about. But Steve, you could comment broadly. Steve Richardson : Look, you can put a flyer out. You can send out blast e-mails and say your office building is going to accommodate lab users. But until you go ahead and actually start making investments in the base building infrastructure and advancing that, tenants are not going to be attracted to that type of offering and that type of entity with a one-off building. Again, they're in kind of isolated locations. They're not always in the core life science clusters. So as Joel said, I think there's a lot of talk out there but we don't see a lot of action. Inevitably, there will be a handful of 50,000 to 100,000 square foot offerings but nothing that really competes with the million plus square foot mega campus that's fully amenitized with brand new or newly redeveloped Class A product that we're offering. We monitor every market very closely. Peter Moglia : I'd like to add, purpose-built, which is what we have trumps a conversion every day of the week. When conversions generally are going to require compromise to the tenant's plans, there are areas in the building where the structure is not going to work for heavy equipment, the plumbing or the shafts won't be available because there's another tenant in the way. I mean, it is just a very challenging thing. We've done it ourselves a number of times. We know the challenges we've been able to overcome them and provide great product. But at the end of the day, purpose built will always be much more attractive than an office conversion. Operator : Our next question will come from Sheila McGrath with Evercore ISI. Sheila McGrath : I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on the One Investors Way transaction in the Route 128 submarket. Just what kind of yield that should be since you brought the tenant with you and just the plans for that expansion as well. Joel Marcus : So I think the -- Dean, correct me if I'm wrong, I think yields will likely come out in future subs. I'm not sure we want to quote anything at this point. But I think, Sheila, Moderna has turned out to be one of those monumental companies, and vaccines were really almost nonexistent or a sideshow in their business plan for the last decade. But it's pretty clear that we own the adjacent location where it is mission critical manufacturing for the vaccine. And as you can imagine, they're looking at lots of opportunities to expand that because the vaccine is not a one or two and done. This is likely to be like the flu, where you're going to have to get boosters on a fairly regular basis. So this is really part of their strategic plan to be able to supply both the United States and part of the world with much needed vaccines now and into the future. And it's going to be iterating, because the variants are going to cause changes in what the vaccine needs to do. And so we felt that as the go to landlord for Moderna, this was in both of our interests to make happen. So I hope that's helpful as just kind of a framework. But you can expect yields to come out, I guess, either next quarter or shortly thereafter. Sheila McGrath : And I was wondering if you could comment on two markets. Research Triangle Park following Apple's announcement. Just remind us what your holdings are there and how proximate you will be to Apple's expansion, number one. And then number two, just you haven't touched on New York City in a while. Just wondering if you could update us on life science demand and that third building that you have. Joel Marcus : So let me maybe take those in reverse and maybe speak to New York City. So as everybody knows, many on this call either live or work in New York and have seen, over the last year, what's happened there, still a somewhat tough place to be. Security is still an issue. Unfortunately, crime rates and shootings have gone up, really skyrocketed in enormous fashion. So we're very focused on the security of our campus. Our campuses is almost full, although, we're creating some additional space in the existing two buildings and moving a number of tenants around to accommodate growth. And we're also filling up Long Island City, which is kind of a nice relief valve. We're in discussions with the city on the North Tower. We are going to break ground here over the past many months. But clearly, because of what's going on there and the change in the macro environment, we didn't go forward instantly. We had to rejigger kind of what we're thinking about but we're in discussions with the city to see how best we can move that forward. I think you have to remember, New York, growing a cluster is like having a baby for 25 years, and it's painful, right? And we're just finishing the first decade. And literally, New York, when we came and launched our first building there in 2010 and then into 2011 and beyond, literally no life science research was done there, world class academic work, world class clinical work, one incubator up on the Columbia campus. Pfizer had a headquarters there. But by enlarge, no research. Since then, we've made enormous strides. We've gotten venture capital off the ground there. A lot of companies have started. But we don't see big companies. They're reluctant and haven't really been successful in moving any big companies there. The recent tax efforts by the state certainly are aggressive to, I think, growth in New York, adding on to the tax burden in New York City, New York State, et cetera, and then a federal is kind of hurtful. So New York has a range of issues. It's great substrate, great NIH money, venture is formed. But it's going to take another decade or part of a decade and a half to really grow that into a real life secondary market like some of the others that you know much better. So it's a work in process. We see some company formation. There's certainly institutional demand and so forth, but it's different than the other markets. So maybe moving to Research Triangle, and I might have either Peter or Steve give any macro comments as well. But we made a move last summer. We felt that Research Triangle was an important part of the life science landscape, it has been for many years. We have both several mega campuses, both on the life science side and now the first one of its kind here in the US, maybe in the world, on the agri-food side, agri-food tech. And so we think it's a very, very good location. It's attracted a lot of brains from many places around the country, anchored by the three great universities, UNC, Duke and NC State. And it's been just a really, really good place to be. It used to be looked at as kind of a manufacturing or kind of a tertiary kind of location. I think today, it's moved up and become one of the hot and truly important places. And people like to live there, I think that's going to be important going into the future. Is it a good place to live? And if you compare walking around in the Triangle versus New York City, New York City is tough these days. You see what's going on in the subways. And hopefully, governance will get better, security will get better and improve and hopefully, COVID will recede. But walking around in the Triangle is like being in heaven. So I think that's why a lot of companies have been moving there and we've increased our footprint pretty dramatically. But Steve, you really started a lot of our efforts down there. So maybe a comment or two for you. Steve Richardson : Yes, the Apple footprint, I think, will be transformative for the park for sure. And we do have one of our campuses in the Kit Creek area with a number of buildings that are in close proximity there. So we think that will help continue to really invigorate the campus going forward, as Joel has been outlining, and in particular, really help these specific assets. So we're very enthusiastic about their presence there. Operator : Our next question will come from Richard Anderson with SMBC. Richard Anderson : Joel, you mentioned your frustration with the corporate tax sort of narrative going on and impact on repatriation. Were you seeing any tangible evidence of kind of the onshoring of the supply chain and impacts positively to your tenants that could actually reverse course if this were to happen? I'm wondering if it's more of a storyline as opposed to something concretely underway at this point. Joel Marcus : Well, no, I think it's been dramatic and not just in the biopharma industry and the medical technology industry. There was pretty dramatic tax reform in 2017 where multinationals previously charged with full US corporate tax rates and they kept much of the cash overseas, it's called the GILTI tax. They kind of opened that up, lowered that dramatically. And you saw a lot of companies, including a lot of big pharma and companies like Apple, Facebook, Google, others, Microsoft, other big techs bringing back large amounts of capital to invest in this country. So we had a couple of years of really positive repatriation not only of capital but reinvestment in the United States, which was really positive. I think COVID then shone a very bright, or shined a very bright light on the medical supply chains where, as I said, 70% of medical supply chain, many of it intermediates to create pharmaceutical products, et cetera, even just normal plastic gloves and all the stuff that we call PPE, 70% of that was sourced overseas, and we were seeing dramatic movement of that back to the United States. It's not just pills and stuff like that, it was very broad. And I think to reverse that or even to put out the word that you're going to start to shift that, I think, is one of the worst things you could do in the middle of a -- or midway in the pandemic. I'm not sure what inning we're in. We'd have to ask Fauci or some of those folks based on what they see. But I think it's fair to say I was in a Zoom call with a company just getting off the ground here in the United States. And the first thing they did was set up operations and IP in Ireland, which has a 12.5% tax rate where we're going to be going to, I don't know whether it will be 28% or something like that. China is at 25% and most of the world is sub-28%. There's only a handful that are above that. So that's not a good place to be if you want to create jobs and want to really jolt this economy forward, given the damage that we've suffered over the past year from the pandemic. So I don't know. I have pretty strong feelings. And I think many people who are in corporate America believe that there are better ways to do that than become anti competitive. And I think the administration's comments about, well, they're going to try to arrange a kind of a global tax kind of arrangement where everybody is charging the same rate, it's done through what's called the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a global minimum tax. Well, okay, that's a total joke. There's no one that's going to sign on to that. So yes, bad news. Richard Anderson : So it sounds like it was having a tangible impact on your business, clearly, it was happening. But you were seeing\u2026 Joel Marcus : Yes, it's way broader than biopharma, I mean\u2026 Richard Anderson : Second question I have is absent from today's presentation was Jenna and which, no offense to her, kind of makes me feel like things are getting better because she wasn't giving her [up team]. But I do have a question for the team there and maybe she's around. The vaccine success is wonderful. You mentioned this is not -- there's more to come, treating it more like a flu. But I wonder if the shift will turn maybe more to therapies as opposed to vaccines in a sense that if we feel like we can be treated for it, and even if we -- if it is an annual event, we know there's a thorough flu out there to take care of it beyond remdesivir. I'm just wondering if you can comment on that at all. Joel Marcus : So if by popular opinion, we'll bring Jenna back next quarter maybe, but we decided not to do that just because vaccines are kind of at the forefront, the country is making, I think, good progress. We'll see how that goes. But you are seeing India has hit an all time high. And if you look at pictures of what's going on there, it literally breaks your heart. We've got some severe outbreaks throughout the United States. Michigan, which has been one of the toughest shutdown states, so go figure that out, is having some tough time. So we're still, I don't know, we may be in the fifth inning, something like that. I don't want to be Dr. Fauci here, but we got a long way to go here and it's going to be with us. This just doesn't go away. It comes back in various forms. But I think when it comes to your question on therapies, I think if people rely on therapies like flu therapies or other kinds of therapies for COVID, I think that's a huge mistake. And we'll, next quarter, address that. I'll ask Jenna to specifically address it. But what I think is the challenge is if you get COVID, there is a cohort of patients. Right now, people, if you ask Scott Gottlieb and others, right now, it's maybe 10%, 15%, don't know if that number is too low or too high, but my guess is it could be right about right and could be higher, who are experiencing the long haul symptoms. If you ever look at some of the articles on COVID, COVID attacks almost every system in the body. And it's something that you would not want to get and just get over because you don't know what the long haul results are to the brain, to the immune system, to all the systems of the body. So I don't think the therapy is the answer. I think it's immunization and hopefully, herd immunity, although, there's a cohort of people here in the United States who simply won't take the vaccine, which there maybe medical reasons, there maybe religious reasons. But I think it is hard to understand the assumption of the risk for one's self and others if you don't have those issues, not to take the vaccine. So long winded answer. I hope that's helpful. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll : I wanted to touch on the repatriation of the drug supply chain real quick again. I know it's important, I guess, for the industry and the country. I mean, does that drive the demand in cluster markets at all? I mean, does it impact your business materially one way or another? Joel Marcus : Well, I think it's incrementally. I was talking more macro because to bring back supply chains for intermediates for pharmaceutical products so we don't have to rely on India or China or Ireland or other places, that's critical. That's national security, it seems to me. And yes, there's been certainly impact to the demand, especially in the manufacturing, in the next gen manufacturing. I think people are not going to put cell therapy, gene therapy and a range of next gen manufacturing, which are so tied to R&D in the biopharma industry overseas unless tax rates absolutely force them to do that, which would be stupidest policy I ever heard. So yes, the impact has been clearly in a positive fashion and we hope that doesn't get reversed. Michael Carroll : And then just, I guess, last question for me. Can you talk a little bit about, I guess, the mentioned in the earlier prepared remarks about the model to help combat homelessness in Seattle. I mean, how far along is this process? And I guess, what type of time line do you have in mind or when you'll be able to provide us more details on what that plan is and how it's going? Joel Marcus : So it's still in the early feasibility stage. I think understanding homelessness, much like drug addiction, is hard. If you imagine the homeless population, it's highly stratified. There are those that are down on their luck, have financial issues. There's a large cohort that have serious addiction issues. There's a large cohort that have serious mental illness, et cetera. So it's not just saying, okay, let's just find housing. That's a solution that many jurisdictions are pursuing but it doesn't help. It's like detoxing somebody who's addicted to opioids and then putting them back on the street, that doesn't work more than 28 days. So we're trying to adopt this or adapt, I should say, not adopt, the [115] model, the continuum of care, the complete care, data driven but with deep research, and so we're in the feasibility stage. So I'm not sure I can give you yet. Maybe over the next quarter or so, I'll be able to give you more details. But we think it's an imperative that we attack this problem, and I think we may have a model that will help a lot of people here. But it's no easy thing. It isn't like putting up a few simple apartments. It's way, way more complicated than that. Operator : Our next question will come from Dave Rogers with Baird. David Rodgers : On the leasing front, I wanted to ask a question about, you had two really good quarters of leasing and a number of quarters come together. Curious if you're seeing any slowdown, like there was some backlog maybe that had built up through COVID and that may get metering out a little bit more. Is that more a function of what you're offering in development? Just curious on kind of the pace of leasing into the second quarter? And then maybe the flip side, what's missing from the leasing pipeline, if anything, in terms of kind of your core tenant base? Joel Marcus : I'm not sure I fully understand the first part of the question. David Rodgers : I think earlier, you made the comment about demand and some of the slowdown that was related to just not being able to build, for a little while, and there was a little\u2026 Joel Marcus : I don't think we said that. Are you -- who said that? David Rodgers : Just in terms of new -- anyway. I guess, the question was, it seemed in leasing going from kind of the first quarter into the second quarter. Any evidence of a slowdown or any evidence that there had been a backlog from COVID that might be dissipating at any point? Joel Marcus : No. I think our comments should address that pretty directly, Dave. No, we don't see any of that. David Rodgers : And then not essentially related to SPAC, but is there anything in your own guidance at Alexandria that would be dependent upon that getting done? Joel Marcus : No. Operator : Our next question will come from Daniel Ismail with Green Street Advisors. Daniel Ismail : Joel, I appreciate all the comments relating to ESG. There are a variety of taxes or fines on greenhouse gas emissions proposed or in discussions across your markets. It seems like lab buildings are generally lumped in with office buildings in these proposed or enacted regulations despite the difference in use and potential energy intensity. Is that a fair characterization? And then does this come up in tenant discussions about the potential for, say, higher taxes or fines on building greenhouse gas emissions? Joel Marcus : I think it has not, at the moment, doesn't seem to be a significant issue for tenants at this moment, although, they're looking for obviously very green and environmentally positive sustainable buildings, both inside and outside. And I think we've kind of been a leader here in the US and maybe even worldwide in the whole fit well or healthy environments inside. But Dean, do you want to comment because you're closest to that? Dean Shigenaga : So Danny, I agree with what Joel highlighted. Our tenants haven't focused on your specific question but they have focused on really environmentally friendly, sustainable real estate solutions. If you look across their business, if you take just a sample of our top 20 tenants as an example and look at their ESG initiatives, sustainability is a high priority across their entire business, real estate being a very small component. They actually touch on real estate a little bit on a few of the top 20 tenants. And as Joel highlighted, carbon neutral, energy neutral buildings, et cetera, just beyond lead today is super important. Most of these biopharma companies today have set carbon neutrality goals that are well inside the broad 2050 type of target dates that some have put out there. And so I think overall, it's super important. I think for us, when we think about building green and sustainable buildings, it plays not only strategically important to our business but plays right into the strategies of our tenants as well. So I think it works well. And I think you pointed the obvious challenge that all companies are facing today is how do you read carbon neutrality today at a pace that needs to be faster than maybe possible at the moment, given technologies and solutions that are available. But if we don't put our best foot forward to be impactful here, we won't get anywhere close to some of the deadlines in different jurisdictions. But they're all different so it's hard to comment on broadly across the portfolio. Daniel Ismail : And then just last one for Peter, on the cap rate on the South San Francisco trade. How would you compare that cap rate across market cap rates, or how would you compare market cap rates across San Diego, south San Francisco and Cambridge? Are cap rates heading to parity in these markets or are there still decent spreads across these markets? Steve Richardson : Actually, I think your comment on heading to parity, that's actually -- when you started asking your question, I was like the geographic differences that used to be obvious are being blurred. Once you get down to 4% caps, I would not be surprised -- obviously, 4% cap is being achieved in Cambridge. I would not be surprised to see it go below 4% in Cambridge at some point soon. A high quality asset in San Diego was probably at 5%, low 5% cap two years ago, and I would expect that to be a low 4% cap today. So things are starting to -- or the difference, the geographic difference that cap rates had before are really starting to narrow. And it's probably obvious that there's so many people out there looking for exposure to Life Science that the geography doesn't matter as much as it does to get the exposure to Life Science. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks. Joel Marcus : I'd just say thank you, everybody, and please stay safe. We'll talk to you next quarter. Thanks, everybody. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Please note, this event is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz with Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Paula Schwartz : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The Company\u2019s actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the Company\u2019s periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel. Joel Marcus : Thank you, Paula, and welcome, everybody to our second quarter call. With me here today are, Jenna Foger, Peter Moglia, Steve Richardson and Dean Shigenaga. We want to welcome all to this second quarter call and also as I always try to do to recognize and thank the entire Alexandria family team for one of the best quarters in the entire history of the company with an operational tempo really like none other, while working virtually for many of us for most of the past, now we into our second year of COVID. Michael Jordan once said some people want it to happen, some people wish it to happen, others make it happen. Alexandria makes it happen. We are deeply mission-driven and thankful for all that we do and urge you to read about many of our important programs and activities in the corporate social responsibility area in our press release. For a moment keys to the second quarter, historic high demand for Alexandria's lab space and our critical lab operations, which go along with that. Alexandra is at the vanguard of meeting the historic and high unprecedented demand from many of our more than 750 tenants for growth needs now, and a critical path for future growth very importantly. Fundamental drivers of demand are the strongest we've ever seen. Rental rate growth continues unabated and no excess supply on the horizon at this time. We're very proud that we've got almost 7% quarter-to-quarter per share FFO growth, more than 40% rental rate growth, almost 18% NOI growth, almost 8% same store NOI growth and a $1.3 billion plus annual NOI run rate, not to mention about $545 million in incremental revenue in our development and redevelopment pipeline. Alexandria truly has a demonstrable pricing power advantage in each of our cluster markets. And when the Life Science tenants choose, they almost always prefer Alexandria's lab space and our operational excellence based on our critical lab operations. Nature, a biotechnology magazine back in April wrote the following; 2020 was a year that smashed many records, biotech savior role in the pandemic, attractive a stampede of private and public investors alike. The pandemic apparently reinforced the requirement for long term value based investors of any kind to have exposure to life sciences. And life science demand has in fact, at an all-time high as the world has recognized the importance of next generation therapies to solve current and future really difficult healthcare challenges, and Jen will talk a bit more about it. Jenna Foger : Thank you so much, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. As Joel highlighted last quarter, we continue to be reaffirmed by the fundamental future's shares is a tremendous paradox of this pandemic moment for the life sciences industry. Despite the challenges of these past many months, COVID has illuminated the power of science and the industry's ability to transform the future of human health. Not only as so many of our tenants in the industry, as Joel mentioned, risen to the challenge of combating this global pandemic, but R&D and bio innovation broadly have persisted with amazing productivity, resilience and expediency throughout this time and we cannot stress enough how critical it is for us as a whole to preserve and prioritize, and continue to catalyze this groundbreaking innovation has and will continue to save so many lives. Now turning to COVID specific update for a few moments. According to the World Health Organization, as of this morning on a global scale, over 194 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 including over 4.1 million death. A total of 3.7 billion vaccine doses have been administered worldwide with nearly 10% of these doses in the US alone. Roughly 57.5% of the vaccine eligible population in our country that's  over have been fully vaccinated by either tenant Pfizer or Moderna 2-shot mRNA-based vaccine or tenant Johnson & Johnson single-shot. This is just over 49% of the total US population and we hope this number of fully vaccinated individuals will continue to steadily rise. These numbers are astounding. And before we get into the where are we now, I want to emphasize that despite the COVID fatigue, we all continue to feel even despite some relief from the easing of restrictions over the past few months, albeit with the likely return of some new ones, none of where we are in the recovery process can be taken for granted. The fact that the biopharma industry spearheaded by many of our tenants was equipped with the know-how, resources and technology to create safe and effective vaccines to combat a novel viral pathogen would have been unimaginable just a few decades ago. The fact that our tenants Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson were able to develop, run robust clinical trials, manufacture and distribute billions of vaccines at scale in less than 12 months is absolutely unprecedented. These vaccines achieve such astounding safety and efficacy in the 90-plus percent range when the FDA has set the original bar at 50% with an amazingly low incidence of side effects reported from the millions of people who have now received that is truly astounding. Steve Richardson : Thank you, Jenna. I'd like to take a step back at the start of my comments and provide some historical context for the accelerating demand, which really translates into leasing at warp speed for Alexandria's mega campuses. At Alexandria's Annual Investor Day during December 2017, we presented a bold framework to nearly double the company's annual rental revenues from a little more than $800 million to $1.5 billion by the end of 2022. We are pleased to share those annualized revenues for Q2 2021 are in fact in excess of $1.5 billion, and so the Alexandria team has accomplished this lofty goal in an accelerated time frame more than one year sooner than anticipated. The company has also grown from a mission critical operating asset base and development pipeline of 29 million square feet at the end of 2017 to a total of 62 million square feet at the end of Q2 2021. Truly exceptional growth, more than doubling the footprint of the company, and importantly, concentrated in our core clusters with disciplined execution, enabling the continuation of high quality cash flows. And as we fielded questions during the 2020 as to whether the healthy leasing activity for Alexandria's mega campus platform was perhaps a short term blip driven by COVID-19, the second quarter of this year's leasing volume of more than 1.9 million square feet, the highest quarterly leasing volume in the history of the company is again evidence of the company's unique position as a trusted partner to the growing life science industry, providing a durable and sustainable competitive advantage in the market. I'll go ahead and review a few of the exceptional highlights, including the following, leasing outperformance. As we just stated, the 1.9 million square feet lease represents the highest quarterly leasing activity during the 27 year history of the company. Truly leasing at warp speed. I'll direct you to Page 2 of the supplemental where it indicates the 3.4 million square feet under construction is 80% leased and the additional 3.6 million square feet anticipated to commence construction during 2021, 2022 is 89% leased and negotiating. So robust leasing and our growth pipeline provides exceptional clarity, and these projects in total will drive incremental revenues in excess of $545 million. We also have exceptional core results. Cash increases this quarter of 25.4% and GAAP increases of 42.4%. Occupancy remained very solid at 94.3% in the operating portfolio, which would have been 98.1% if we're not for the 1.4 million square feet of vacancy in recently acquired properties, which provide for near term incremental annual rental revenues in excess of $55 million. In market health, demand, as we've outlined, continues to accelerate and Alexandria is branded in highly desirable mega campuses. And supply does continue to be restrained during 2021 across all of our markets, and we do not see any disruptive large-scale projects delivering 2022, '23. We're closely evaluating Greater Boston's ground up pipeline, which is 56% leased. And in the San Francisco area, we are monitoring leasing activity at two or two ground-up lab projects. And as we've stated before, there have been no significant lab sublease spaces put in the market for several quarters now. So in conclusion, the first half of 2021 continues the very strong outperformance by Alexandria and our intent focus on operational excellence has positioned the company very well to enhance its industry leading brand. With that, I'll hand it off to Peter. Peter Moglia : Thanks, Steve. I'm going to update you all on our development pipeline and construction cost trends, comment on our recent asset sales and report on a couple of comps that reflect that the private market appetite for life science assets is still very healthy. As Steve and Joel both noted, we're experiencing historic demand and have responded by executing our differentiated life science strategy at an accelerated pace through expanding our collaborative campuses and asset base in each of our cluster markets. A significant sign of the health of the underlying life science industry is that we're expanding significantly in almost all of our markets. In many of our submarkets, the supply and demand imbalance has been exacerbated by lack of near term opportunities to expand, leading Alexandria to push the boundaries of those markets. Examples of this are successful forays into Watertown and Seaport in Greater Boston, new mega campuses in Sorrento Mesa and expansion of San Diego Science sector to the north and east, and a highly successful mega campus underway in San Carlos. This high demand paired with our highly experienced development teams resulted in another very productive quarter for Alexandria. In the second quarter, we delivered 755,565 square feet, spread over five assets located in South San Francisco, San Carlos, Long Island City, San Diego and the Research Triangle. This is double what we delivered in the first quarter and these deliveries will provide more than $31 million in annual rental revenue over the next year. In addition, this historic demand has led to improved quarter-over-quarter leasing and leases under negotiation numbers despite adding two new assets that have had little marketing time. Assets contributing notably to this outcome include; 840 Winter Street and Waltham Mass, which is a testament to our ability to capture demand from companies needing facilities for next gen manufacturing; 3160 Porter Drive in Palo Alto, a joint effort with Stanford to commercialize the University's most innovative science; and 5505 Morehouse in Sorrento Mesa, which is benefiting from Alexandria's place making expertise and strong demand drivers in San Diego. As illustrated on Page 2 of the press release, this historic demand and our corresponding strategic response has led to our current pipeline growing to 3.4 million square feet in 33 properties that are, as Steve mentioned, 80% leased or under negotiation. In addition, we expect to have another 3.6 million square feet in 19 properties commenced construction this year and next that are already 89% leased or under negotiation. As Steve also mentioned, these properties will cumulatively add approximately $545 million of annual rental revenue once fully delivered. I felt it necessary to remind everybody of that. Construction costs remain elevated from some trades and commodities holding study and others continuing to be unexplainable and unprecedented levels. Lumber is a positive story and could be a microcosm for what will happen with other commodities. A year ago, lumber was $500 per thousand board feet, which was about $100 above its historical norm. It climbed to $1,700 per thousand board feet in early May but has since dropped back down to $600 per thousand board feet and is still dropping. The reason for the drop was a large number of residential projects were put on hold due to the price of lumber. With this pullback in demand, the mills have been able to catch up, leading to stabilization in pricing. A correction due to a decrease in demand is essentially what's going to eventually normalize all construction commodities. Copper has shown signs of signs of dropping but it's still 2 times above historical norms. Alternatives such as aluminum are being considered to alleviate the pricing pressures. And if there's enough adoption, it could lead to a stabilization in pricing. Despite the promising news with lumber and copper, rolled steel remains very volatile and is not showing any signs of stabilizing. Rolled steel is used for things such as metal decks, metal studs and duct work. So it's very impactful on multilevel buildings with large HVAC needs, such as lab buildings. So we have to keep our cost escalation assumptions on the high end despite the noted drop in some commodities. The reason being reported is both a commodity and labor issue at the shops that create the products from raw materials. COVID caused many to shut down. And then when demand exploded, the shops had a hard time getting the labor to come back. The shops try to solve this by scheduling longer shifts but the amount of rolled steel showing up was not enough to support those shops. Thus, prices remain very high with metal studs up 75% since January. We want to assure you that we're keeping a very close eye on commodities and have been developing strategies to counter these increases. And together with our prudent underwriting, we will continue to deliver our projects on time and on budget as we always have. I'll conclude by commenting on our recent sales and provide a couple of comps that were announced recently. I discussed our record 4% cap rate at 213 East Grand last quarter, but I want to add that in addition to achieving that cap rate, we also achieved an unlevered IRR of 9.6% and a value creation margin, which is calculated by dividing our gain by gross book value of 56%. This quarter, as disclosed on Page 3 of the press release, we once again demonstrated our ability to create tremendous value for our shareholders by selling 70% interest in 400 Dexter, located in the Lake Union submarket of Seattle for 4.2% cash cap rate with a gross value equaling $1,255 per square foot. We achieved 12% unlevered IRR on this sale and a value creation margin of 61%, a truly remarkable outcome and it's very reflective of the high quality assets we've developed and continue to develop in the Seattle region and elsewhere. Outside of those Alexandria transactions, there are a couple of transactions of note in our submarkets that reflect the high value that private investors are putting on life science assets today. In Sorrento Mesa, an asset known as The Canyons, which contains a little over a third of lab and manufacturing space with the balance being office sold at 4.48% cap rate and a value of $575 per square foot. The cash flow is from a credit tenant and there is no near term upside, so the cap rate really reflects the yield a private investor was willing to pay in a submarket that a couple of years ago would have commanded a cap rate with a six handle. In a similar vein, the other comp we're reporting comes from Rockville, Maryland, which was received to be a seven cap rate submarket by some analysts not too long ago. 9615 Medical Center Drive, located in the Shady Grove submarket and adjacent to a number of Alexandria properties, was sold to a US insurance company for 5.18% cap rate and a valuation of $610 per square foot. The asset is a leasehold interest subject to a long term ground lease that happens to be owned by Alexandria. Thank you. And with that, I'll pass it over to Dean. Dean Shigenaga : Thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. We reported exceptional operating and financial results for the first half of '21 and provided a very strong outlook for the remainder of the year. Revenue and net operating income for the second quarter was up 16.6% and 16.8% over the second quarter of 2020, respectively. And NOI for the second quarter was up 6.9% over the first quarter of '21. Now venture investment gains included in FFO per share were $25.5 million for the second quarter and was consistent with the first quarter of '21. Now looking back over the last two quarters, we raised our outlook for FFO per share $0.03 when we reported first quarter results. And during the second quarter, we raised our outlook for FFO per share again by another $0.02. Now this $0.02 increase was announced in connection with our Form 8-K filing date at June 14th when we were substantially through the second quarter and had solid visibility into the strength of core results for the quarter. Same property NOI growth for the first half of '21 continue to benefit from our high quality tenant roster with 53% of our annual rental revenue from investment grade rated or large cap publicly traded companies. Same property NOI growth for the first half of '21 was very strong at 4.4% and 7.4% on a cash basis. High rental rate growth on lease renewals and re-leasing the space was the key driver for the improvement in our outlook for 2021 same property net operating growth to 2% to 4% and 4.7% to 6.7%, an increase of 30 basis points and 40 basis points, respectively. Now while the primary focus of our acquisitions for 2021 has been driven by strong demand from our tenant relationships for both current and future development and redevelopment projects, certain acquisitions have also included operating properties with opportunities to drive growth and cash flows through lease-up of vacancy. Now these operating properties have contributed to NOI growth in the first half of '21, it's important to highlight that the lease-up of 1.4 million rental square feet of vacancy at these properties will provide further growth in annual rental revenue in excess of $55 million. Now occupancy that we reported for June 30th was 94.3% and 98.1% on a pro forma basis, excluding vacancy from recently acquired properties. And it's also important to highlight that if we set aside recently acquired properties, our occupancy is on track to improve by 100 basis points in 2021. Now we believe it's important to highlight the strategic benefits of having the team with tremendous experience and expertise with designing, building and operating sophisticated laboratory office buildings and the team with decades of trusted partnerships with our highly innovative tenants. As mentioned earlier, we have one of the highest credit tenant rosters in the REIT industry. We have one of the highest adjusted EBITDA margins in the REIT industry at 69%. We reported our lowest AR balance since 2012 at $6.7 million, truly amazing when you consider that our total market capitalization was over $26 billion as of June 30th. And we continue to consistently report high collections at 99.4% for July. We reported record leasing velocity at over 3.6 million rentable square feet executed in the first half of this year. And this run rate is significantly exceeding the strong leasing volume for 2020 and on track for exceptional rental rate growth in the range of 31% to 34% and 18% to 21% on lease renewals and re-leasing the space, that last figure is on a cash basis, by the way. Now as a trusted partner with access to over 750 tenants in our portfolio, we are well positioned to capture the tremendous demand from our tenant roster and life science industry relationships. We have a super exciting pipeline of projects under construction, aggregating 3.4 million rentable square feet, 80% lease negotiating. Near term projects starts 89% leased were under negotiations, aggregating 3.7 million square feet. Now this aggregates about 6.9 million square feet, 90% of which is related to space requirements from our existing relationships. These projects will generate an amazing amount of incremental annual rental revenue exceeding $545 million or 34% increase above the second quarter rental revenues annualized of $1.6 billion. Now importantly, we also expect to start additional projects between now and December of 2022. Our venture investments portfolio continue to highlight the exceptional talent of our science and technology team for underwriting high quality innovative entities. As of June 30th, unrealized gains were $962 million on an adjusted cost basis of $990 million. Realized gains on our venture investments for the second quarter were $60.2 million, including $34.8 million of realized gains excluded from FFO per share. Now for the first half of '21, we realized gains aggregating about $57.7 million that related to significant gains in three investments that were excluded from FFO per share as adjusted. Now we're pleased that the venture investment program is generating capital exceeding our initial forecast for 2021, and we hope this will be in the range of about $100 million plus for the entire year. Now continuing on to our very strong and flexible balance sheet to support our strategic growth initiatives. We continue to be very pleased to have one of the best balance sheets in the REIT industry, providing us access to attractive long term cost of capital. We remain on track for net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 5.2 times by year-end. Our fixed charge coverage ratio for the fourth quarter has increased to greater than 5 times. We continue to maintain significant liquidity of $4.5 billion as of June 30th. We're in a solid position with debt maturities with our next maturity, representing only $184 million comes due in 2024. And while it's challenging to predict when owners of real estate will decide to sell, two to three transactions drove most of the amount of acquisitions and accounted for about half of our target for 2021. For the remainder of the year, our goal is to remain very selective with acquisitions. Our team is advancing a number of important decisions, primarily focused on partial interest sales in high value, low cap rate properties for reinvestment into our strategic value creation development and redevelopment projects. Now to date, in 2021, we have completed $580 million at cap rates in the 4% to 4.2% range. And we have about $1.4 billion in process at various stages and expect to move along other dispositions that will push us well above the top end of our range for dispositions, which are currently at $2.2 billion. Now we are targeting about $1 billion in dispositions to close in the third quarter and the remainder in the fourth quarter. Importantly, each of these key pending transactions will continue to highlight the tremendous value we have and continue to create for our stakeholders. Now as a reminder, please refer to Page 6 of our supplemental package for a detailed and updated guidance assumptions for 2021. This guidance is an update to our guidance for the year that was disclosed on our Form 8-K dated June 14th. We narrowed the range of guidance from $0.10 to $0.08 for both EPS and FFO per share. EPS was updated to a range from $3.46 to $3.54 and FFO per share as adjusted was updated to a range from $7.71 to $7.79 with no change in the midpoint of FFO per share diluted as adjusted of $7.75. Now as a reminder, since our initial FFO per share guidance for 2021, we have increased the midpoint of our guidance by $0.05 for growth in 2021, representing an increase of 6.1% over 2020. Now before I turn it back over to Joel Marcus, I just wanted to highlight that we recently published our annual ESG report, highlighting continued leadership in sustainability, social and governance matters. I also wanted to express our team's appreciation for continued recognition by an independent panel of judges for a six NAREIT Gold Award for Communication and Reporting Excellence to the investment community. So congratulations to our team for outstanding execution, and I'll turn it back to Joel. Joel Marcus : Thanks very much, Dean. Operator, we can go to questions, please. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session . Our first question will come from Manny Korchman with Citi. Michael Bilerman : So Dean, in your last comment, you talked about going forward being more selective on acquisitions. I was wondering if you can, or maybe Peter, sort of talk about what's going to change in your approach or your underwriting, or the yields you're targeting relative to the feracious appetite that you've had in putting capital out, how will deals going forward be scrutinized versus the deals that you've done? Joel Marcus : Maybe it's best to amend that word, selective, and think about it as being a bit more patient. We've had -- if you just look at the quality of deals we've done, we don't change our underwriting. We don't change our focus. It hasn't changed for a very long time. We look at -- if you look at the two big deals we did this year, both were aimed at, one, creating a new submarket in Boston and the other was extending the Alexandria Center for Life Science at Kendall Square. Both of those to meet kind of historic high demand. But we're mindful of the overall capital markets. So I think we're being just a bit of a slower pace, but I wouldn't say the selectivity or the change in the underwriting or how we do things, or what we do is any way shape or form changed. Michael Bilerman : And from the capital markets, you've shown a lot of discipline in prefunding a lot of these deals through forward, through deb, or through straight equity offerings. Is it more of a concern about where the markets are going, Joel, in your mind about funding future deals? Joel Marcus : Well, I think one has to just be mindful that if you look at -- we\u2019re probably at a historic high with GDP right now. We're probably peaking. And it's just hard to know where the market might go. So we're just going to be careful about, stepwise about how we do things. We also have no anticipation of when -- I think Dean said this pretty clearly. We don't know when an owner is going to bring an asset to market. And so that oftentimes drives decisions as to the 750 tenants, many of whom have active current requirements and many of whom want a path to future growth. So we just have to be -- maybe the best word to use is judicious rather than selective and that's not necessarily parsing words. So I think we're just going to be judicious about how we go forward. There's only so many big acquisitions one can continue to do and that actually exists. So I think the market will determine that. Michael Bilerman : I think judicious, it definitely sounds like more of the word rather than selective in the comments. And then secondly, just on supply, Joel, in your opening comments, you basically said that it's not a concern of yours. Now you're obviously, as an entity, building a ton, others are building a lot. Is it just the level of preleasing and tenant demand that causes you not to worry about the levels of development going on in life sciences and just the overall excitement that there is on behalf of a lot of corporate landlords to do it? Joel Marcus : So I'm going to ask Steve to comment. But I would say we're always worried about everything. I think when you look at -- and we're fans of Jim Collins. We always have productive paranoia. And so we're always -- every day we wake up, we assume nothing and we have to prove everything. And so I don't think it has to do with our not or our not worrying or so forth. But I think if you look in each of the key markets, you look in the Bay Area, you look at the Greater Boston area, the supply chart really is focused out several years. It's not focused on '21, '22 or even '23. You start to see bigger blips, for example, Kilroy's capability to do large scale projects in the Oyster Point area in South San Francisco. Pretty large numbers but those are out quite a number of years. They're also at a disadvantage because they have a substandard location to kind of the gateway location. But Steve, do you want to comment on kind of on the supply overall issue? I think you have a good perspective on that. Steve Richardson : Look, we have been in these markets for more than two decades. We track this on a building-by-building parcel-by-parcel basis. So we have absolute granular information and insight on these projects. And just to add to what Joel said, when you look at Greater Boston in that pipeline, projects that actually have gone vertical that are under construction, more than half of that is already leased, and those will extend into 2022 and 2023. So when you look at that, you really don't see very significant pieces being added to the overall inventory from that basis. Other people may be talking about supply but again, four or five years out, inevitably, the markets will change. Office will always be an alternative for all of these new entrants as well. And then in the Bay Area, as Joel said, there's two or three projects we're monitoring. There is leasing activity there. So there is additional supply but we don't see large, disruptive, very large projects that are well under construction that have no leasing activity. So again, we do monitor it on a very granular basis and that's what we're seeing over the next year or two or even two and half years. Operator : Our next question will come from Sheila McGrath with Evercore ISI. Sheila McGrath : Acquisition cap rates have compressed for life science as we can see at 400 Dexter. How should we think about the development yields for your current pipeline? Should we expect some of the newer projects to have a little bit or some compression in the development yields versus historic yields? Joel Marcus : So Peter\u2026 Peter Moglia : I think it's fair to say that there's been a tremendous amount of growth in rents. So that will help keep the returns buoyant, but with that has come a growth in the cost of land. There's been some, obviously, some cost increases that I just went over in my comments. But I think it's fair to say that our goal of development, redevelopment, having a minimum spread of 150 bps over exit cap rates will continue. And so that's a very important number for us. We often exceed that well over 200 bps in many cases. But yes, just the cost of capital is advantageous. So you can develop something to a six and it'd be very accretive, especially if you can sell it for a four. Sheila McGrath : And then I was wondering if you could provide a little more detail on the Sorrento Mesa acquisition of existing buildings. Will you redevelop those buildings and add density or knock some down, what are the plans there? Peter Moglia : I think we've got a number of scenarios that Dean and team have explored. But you're right, I mean the advantage or one of the great things about that acquisition is the ability to combine it with an existing property and create a 2 million square foot mega campus. Will that certainly contain new buildings? Whether they're all new and some are redeveloped is still to be undertaken or to be decided. But we're very comfortable with our basis there and we've got a lot of optionality with the existing buildings, but also our basis is good enough that if we take a couple down, we can build bigger ones at good yields. Sheila McGrath : Okay. And last question. Leasing spreads were almost a record quarter. Was that driven by any one particular transaction or market? And where do you think in-place rents for your portfolio compared to market right now? Joel Marcus : Yes. So, pretty broad, Sheila, and not based on any single one. But Steve, you could -- or Peter, you can give some view on that, on the uptick. Steve Richardson : Yes. The mark-to-market, Sheila, it's Steve here, has actually increased over the past several quarters. We're roughly 23.5% on a mark-to-market basis across the entire portfolio. So, I think, that's clear evidence of the continued healthy demand and rent growth. Peter Moglia : We were in the mid-teens not that long ago. So, that's a pretty significant increase. Operator : Our next question will come from Anthony Paolone with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Anthony Paolone : Joel, you mentioned some of the record capital formation in the form of venture capital IPOs, and I think the NIH as well. In the past, that -- those numbers have ebbed and flowed. I'm just wondering what you think happens to space demand, if there's any sort of pullback in that capital formation this time. Joel Marcus : Yes. So, that's a really good question, and welcome to the call, Tony. This is a kind of a historic biotech bull market. It's really been going into its seventh year, which is pretty historic. I think, which gives us good comfort is on the private side, a number of the venture firms -- quite a number of the venture firms have raised record amounts of money, and those funds usually take multiple years to invest two, three, sometimes four. And so, that's going to give a runway to private companies, let's say there was a black swan event or something forbid happens that just causes the market to sell off pretty drastically. I think we're very fortunate. As Dean said, we have a historically high credit profile in our asset base. So, that's good. I think the companies that would be most at risk would be newly public companies now that are outside of the private venture or private equity financing. They're public now. And if the markets shut down, they have capital, they'll have to adjust their burn rate and be careful because they won't be able to go back to the capital market. So, I think that -- we saw that in '08 and '09. It was the newly public companies, companies that were preclinical particularly or in the clinic and needed a number of years of runway. So, that would be a downside scenario. But as I said, I think for -- at least for the coming couple of coming quarters, we see a pretty steady flow of capital. We don't see any interruption. But, you never know. If China decides to make Taiwan like Hong Kong or something like that and decide to reunify, that could cause the markets to certainly freeze up. I mean, they're already attacking a lot of the tech companies and so forth. So, I think, China remains a huge question as to the impact on the market and what their intention is. Anthony Paolone : Okay. Got it. Thank you. And then, just the other question I have is you mentioned your pricing power advantage and tenants wanting to be in your portfolio. Are you being asked to go to either new markets, new submarkets to satisfy some of the demands of your tenants? And just updated thoughts on potentially going to those places, if so? Joel Marcus : Well, I think what is true of this industry for a long time, and I've said this for a long time, the life science clusters generally take a generation to grow, 25 years or more. And we see, for instance, New York\u2019s now just into the 12th year of that gestation period. And because of the density of players, the ecosystem being collaborative and cooperative as opposed to tech, which is more a little bit those guys like to be more isolated, there's an employee base there. Most companies looking to expand are opting to stay in the existing markets. I do not see and have not seen, and Steve or Peter can certainly comment, any big move toward new markets or other locations. Obviously, if somebody wants to go somewhere, I mean, we'll look at it and we'll think about it, but it's got to be a pretty convincing and persuasive situation. Operator : Our next question will come from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Jamie Feldman : Thanks. If I could just add on to Tony's question. I mean, what about on the international? I mean, clearly, your platform has absolutely proven itself. Do you have any thoughts about trying to do it again in other markets around the world? Joel Marcus : Well, I think if you look at this quarter's results, you would ask the question why would you ever want to or need to. We spent time in India and exited India, realized that the Indian Supreme Court invalidated the Gleevec patent and so novel research just isn't going on there. We have one remaining project in China, which is partially leased up. We compete against government properties that get free rent for three years for Chinese tenants. So, that's not a really great market to grow in. I mean, Europe is fine, but it still is, by and large, their socialized medicine system. So, not a place you would think about booming R&D. So, we're very happy with the markets we're in and with our current operational view of things, Jamie. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then -- that's helpful. And then, thinking about New York, can you give us an update on when you think you might start the new project there? And with Long Island City, it looks like 100% leased in the supplemental. Just how are you thinking about other opportunities there away from the center? Joel Marcus : Yes. I'll have Peter comment on Long Island City. We're not 100% leased there. That's been a slower lease-up than we would have wanted, partially in due to what happened with Amazon and so forth kind of put a chill on that submarket overall. We're working with the city right now going through a process. And I would just say, stay tuned there. I think, New York is the one market that brokers tout like this big demand, but the reality is the demand is much less. And the demand is primarily organic companies that are starting up, being formed, spinning out. You don't see any big companies moving to New York for obvious reasons, high taxes, governance issues to some extent. And just it's an expensive place to be. So, we're doing great at our center. But, it's a tough market. It's a heavy lift market. You really have to create the entities that stay there, and we've helped do that over the last decade. But it's different than Boston, which is experiencing record high boom. So, just fundamentally different. Jamie Feldman : Okay. So, you said the Long Island is not 100% leased, the supplemental\u2026 Joel Marcus : Yes. So Peter, do you want to talk about Long Island? Peter Moglia : Yes. Long Island, according to supplemental is 41% leased and -- 41% leased and under negotiation on page 38. So, that's actually -- the leased percentage went up 10%. So, we have started to make some progress. We meet weekly about demand there and the different companies we're talking to. Essentially, there's a lot of slow decision-making going on there. I don't know if it has to do with just the state of New York City and if people are wondering when COVID is going to not be as impactful to life there, could be one reason. But as Joel mentioned, it's definitely a market where we've had to almost create demand. It's very organic. The tenant prospects we're talking to are almost exclusively New York-created companies. And we're not getting a lot of help from in-migration. But, we are seeing everything and capitalizing on some. And admittedly, it's been a slow process, but we do think we'll get that stabilized in the near term. Jamie Feldman : Okay. Thanks. By the way, I was looking at Page 34, which I think showed that it is, but I see what you're talking about. Thank you. Peter Moglia : 34, Jamie, is what we delivered to date. Joel Marcus : Yes. Parts of the building already delivered not the full building. Operator : Our next question will come from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Please go ahead. Rich Anderson : So, on the dispositions, you're looking at $2 billion for this year. And I look back at what you've done in previous years, and this is -- this will be the most by a fair margin in other years. And I'm curious, obviously, you described capital flowing into the business, like I think used the word stampede, and we're all seeing that for all the good reasons. But, are you getting any reverse inquiry where you would have maybe not sold a partial interest or whatnot, but you were just giving an offer that was too good to refuse. Is that happening to you, or is this stuff you would have sold one way or another eventually? Joel Marcus : I don't know. So, Peter, you could comment on that. Peter Moglia : Yes, Rich. I mean, I'm very confident in saying that if I made a few calls and said, hey, anything you like, want to make an offer? And the other party thought we'd sell anything that they wanted. There'd be a lot of them. So, we have been the ones that have selected what to sell. And obviously, we've done quite well. The typical profile is something that we have already really maxed the value out on at least in the near to medium to long term. So, it's a good time to monetize. But, it's fair to say that our whole portfolio is very attractive to many investors today given the shine on the life science industry. Rich Anderson : Okay, great. And then on the development side, Peter, you mentioned you're underwriting cost inflation despite the comments on lumber. Can you say what type of inflation you're assuming when you underwrite a development? And on the other -- on the numerator side, what your assumption is for market rent growth? And, are you taking a discount to what you're seeing? I'm just curious if you could get a little bit more in the weeds of how you're underwriting a deal that so it pencils and it makes sense to go forward with it? Peter Moglia : Yes. I'm not getting -- not to give away too much secret sauce, but I -- last quarter I mentioned when I addressed the cost that we look at escalations in the 5% to 6% range right now. And that may not seem like a lot, but labor is fairly stable. So, these large commodity increases and with materials being about 30% of the project, you can get to a weighted average of about 5% to 6%. Now, that's -- that could be double what a normal year of escalations could be. In certain times, things obviously fluctuate. But we, along with our real estate development team, the underwriting team, communicate constantly about these things. So, we make sure we get them right. And the proof is in the pudding. The yields that we publish, we hit like pretty much 100%. So, other than that, we don't underwrite spikes in rents. I've talked about that before. We have a very good idea of what long-term growth looks like. We're probably more conservative than what actuals end up being, but that's great. Surprise the upside is always good. But yes, we're very comfortable with our current pipeline and the way we've underwritten it. And I think -- and I've been here for 23 years, been an underwriter for all that time and feel very comfortable with our process and that we'll continue to meet the numbers that we're publishing. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Michael Carroll : Yes. Thanks. Joel, in your comments you discussed the need for the U.S. to be the leader in next-gen drug manufacturing. I'm not sure if I heard you correctly or not, but did you say the U.S. only produces 11% to 13% today. I'm not sure if you're referring to semiconductor production or next-gen manufacturing? Joel Marcus : Yes, that was semiconductors. Michael Carroll : Okay. Where is the next-gen manufacturing being done right now? I think, given the advancement we're seeing in technology, is it safe to assume that's going to be a bigger life science demand driver in general and for your industry? Joel Marcus : Yes. The answer is yes. One, it's still, in the early days; number two, because it's more integrated with the research and development side, they will tend to be either at the same location or nearby as opposed to a random manufacturing, if this was just normal synthetic chemistry pills and so forth. You could put it anywhere. You could put it in overseas or in any state. But, I think you'll see these will be much more integrated with the R&D function. And so, my guess is, the clusters as they are today, will be mostly benefited as opposed to other regions. Michael Carroll : Okay. And when you're looking at this, I guess, this demand driver, I guess, how close do they need to be to, I guess, the headquarters? I mean, are they going to be in Cambridge, or is it going to be in like suburban Boston, or how close does the manufacturing need to be to get that synergy with the mines within the headquarters? Joel Marcus : Yes. Well, I think, it depends on the stage of scale-up. But, in the early clinical, preclinical and clinical, you could see that being a part of the R&D effort. But then, when it goes to full scale, you could see that being in adjacent locations. I mean, Moderna's example is a great example. They did a lot of work inside Tech Square, but then they rebuilt their plant in Norwood, et cetera. So I think that's not -- although that's a vaccine, but that's somewhat emblematic of what you could see happen. Michael Carroll : Okay. And then, I just want to -- I think, I heard you correctly, but this is going to be a driver for every cluster. I mean, is there some clusters that could benefit more than others? Joel Marcus : Well, I think, the clusters that would benefit more are the really established clusters, obviously, the Boston market, San Francisco, Seattle, San Diego, Maryland, RTP, I mean, the ones that we're focused in. I think, secondary markets probably wouldn't do as well because you also need skilled workforce and you just don't find them. You're not going to find them in Charleston, South Carolina, per structure. Although that's a great place to be. Operator : Our next question will come from Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Please go ahead. Tom Catherwood : Peter, maybe turning to the dispositions. Obviously, partial interest sales have been an important part of your capital sources over the past few years. When you're evaluating assets for disposition, past few years. When you're evaluating assets for disposition, how do you decide between an outright sale and a partial interest sale? And are you able to maintain enough control over the joint venture to make decisions kind of holistically across your cluster instead of prioritizing certain assets kind of to the detriment of others? Joel Marcus : Yes. So maybe, Peter, let Dean take it first and then maybe you can kind of add the color around that. Peter Moglia : Sure. Dean Shigenaga : Yes. So Tom, one part of your question really touches on the complexity of managing good governance around your joint venture relationships. And I think that's what our team has tried to do is to be very respectful of these important relationships that are being established in markets and sometimes across markets. We want to be long-term partners and be mindful as much as we've got joint venture assets and wholly owned assets in a particular market. And so, that's important. From a technical control perspective, I think we're working with partners that understand that we have the expertise to make these successful and we've asked for reasonable leeway in the relationship to be able to execute in that fashion. And so, that's been important, I think, as an attribute from a partner perspective for us. So hopefully, that helps a little bit there, Tom. Tom Catherwood : Yes. That's really helpful. Thank you. Thank you, Dean. And then, maybe just focusing on a specific market, down in North Carolina. So back in August of 2020, you acquired the Alexandria Center for Life Science in Durham. And expectations at the time or that tenants would both expand within the research triangle ones that were there already, and then some would relocate to RTP from other areas to kind of looking for more talent. In the second quarter, occupancy in that Durham campus picked up I think almost 400 basis points alone. And then, you added another 885,000 square feet of development rights kind of in and around that campus. So, as you're now almost a year out from that large acquisition, how has the market performed there compared to underwriting? And then, what are your expectations for that going forward? Joel Marcus : Yes. It's been pretty spectacular. Peter, do you want to maybe give color on that? Peter Moglia : Yes. I can tell you that we're certainly above our rental assumptions, probably close to 10%. And then, we have definitely absorbed the vacancy faster than we had underwritten it. Yes, I give Joel a lot of credit. He definitely saw this trend coming towards RT when we made this deal and we've knocked it out of the park. It's really been great. Tom Catherwood : And is the idea with the expansion adding the additional almost 100,000 square feet. Is that... Peter Moglia : Demand. There's great demand there, and that campus itself has built-in amenities. It has existing space that some tenants have gone into. And we know that those tenants will need to expand. Joel Marcus : Yes. Tom, I think, what has distinguished Research Triangle for many years, it was kind of a 50-year-old backwater place that few companies went to and had a -- was a nice place to be. And then over the last number of years, it's emerged as a really powerhouse cluster. I mean, Apple is just now taking a gigantic stake down there. And I think what people see is, what they're looking at other places in the United States, people see a great quality of life, a modest cost environment, beautiful place anchored by three world class institutions and a really, really great workforce. So, we're seeing the incoming -- I mean, we kicked off the Beam next-gen manufacturing project. That's a company that's in Cambridge, but they came to us for their next-gen manufacturing gene therapy aimed at cancers and sickle cell, et cetera. And that was the best place because of the workforce. So, I think that, to me, has been the hallmark of that market. Great place to be, live, work, play, and really talented people, which you just can't find everywhere. Tom Catherwood : No. That\u2019s really helpful. And it does sound like very different than what it was historically. So, that\u2019s it from me. Thanks everyone. Joel Marcus : Yes. Thanks. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks. Joel Marcus : Just to say thank you, everybody. And we look forward to talking to you on the third quarter earnings call. Take care. Be safe. God bless. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Paula Schwartz with Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Paula Schwartz : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The Company\u2019s actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the Company\u2019s periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel. Joel Marcus : Thank you, Paula, and welcome, everyone to Alexandria\u2019s third quarter \u201921 earnings call and our seventh consecutive quarter in the COVID-19, which for sure has forever changed our world and our lives in very fundamental ways. With me today are, Jenna Foger, Peter Moglia, Steve Richardson and Dean Shigenaga. In honor of my favorite NCAA Basket Ball Coach and in his final year as Head Coach for Duke men's basketball, Coach K has said imagination has a great deal to do with winning. And I'd like to say to our extraordinary Alexandria family, thank you from the bottom of our hearts for a spectacular third quarter, and operational pace and execution tempo that really defines the terms operational excellence, and for your great imagination as Coach K said in all things big and small. Moving on the keys to Alexandria's stellar third quarter performance by all metrics amid a historic demand environment, I think, and importantly, the best is yet to come. Continuing historic high demand for Alexandria's best-in-class lab space, the niche which we invented, and our mission-critical and operationally excellent lab operations. Year-to-date, and others will talk about this, we've leased 5.4 million square feet and looking for a great fourth quarter to end the year. Alexandria is at the vanguard in the heart of meeting this historic high in an unprecedented immediate lab space demand from many of our over 750 client tenants. Moderna is a prime example, and another one which Dean will talk about, a big tenant in South San Francisco for a full building, as well as critical paths for future growth which is so needed. Thus the need for acquisitions, redevelopment and developments, and has been repeated time and time again, by life science tenants and their brokers, if any other company is going up against Alexandria for leasing space, the tenant will almost always pick Alexandria. We are proud to partner with Moderna on their Cambridge headquarters and core R&D facility. And as Dean and others will talk about, it'll be the most sustainable lab building in Cambridge with very strong economics and really great value creation. We're very honored and proud that Alexandria has had very strategically significant tenant relationships, and stellar brand reputation across all of our cluster markets. We're also very fortunate to continue to have to truly demonstrate pricing power in each of our core cluster markets. And by the way, the war for talent, like other industries in the life science industry is creating an even greater space need, set of space needs and demands in the core key Life Science clusters and that is very good for Alexandria. And we see an accelerating leasing demand even above and beyond what we see this quarter in several of our key cluster markets continuing. Rental rate growth continues strongly and excess supply is not a current threat. Alexandria's differentiated expertise and unique platform with its compelling internal and external growth drivers and outlook translates into genuine earnings power. As indicated in the press release and supplemental, our visible multi-year highly leased development pipeline is expected to generate approximately $615 million in future incremental revenue. And beyond that the future leasing prospects really look extraordinary as I've said. The biotech boom and historic Life Science demand driven by the strong industry fundamentals is evident. The 21st century is really the biological century as biology is in transition from an empirical science of trial and error to really an [ indiscernible 0 :05:19.8] science with much more predictable and scalable outcomes. We're witnessing the industrial revolution in biotech. As we accelerate the application of new and innovative tools, we will see an acceleration in value creation. Products will come to market faster, for less capital and with fewer failures. The Life Science industry and its ecosystem and its positive impact on humanity is truly a crown jewel of the United States, and a testament to the free enterprise system of innovation. I think it's important to remember politically, those who seek to create a cradle to grave entitlement society should not use this industry as if fully covered. And then finally, I want to turn to the second anniversary of our OneFifteen Project in Dayton, Ohio, which this month we celebrate. Sad to say that overdoses have claimed a staggering 96,000 lives during the 12-months ended March of 2021, up 30% increase in the year before.  OneFifteen is an innovative data-driven non-profit evidence-based healthcare ecosystem dedicated to the full and sustained recovery of people with addiction and as I said, Dayton, Ohio, OneFifteen is revolutionizing the way addiction is treated through its tech enabled care platform, which applies analytics to measure the effectiveness of various treatments, and choices throughout the full continuum of care, and continuously evolves its approach based on insights derived. Since its opening in 2015, OneFifteen has served almost 4,000 individuals struggling with addiction, and conducted over 9,000 telehealth visits since the start of COVID-19 pandemic. With our OneFifteen partners, we\u2019re unwavering in our commitment to help people recover from addiction, live healthier lives, while revitalizing the community. We would like to see this model replicated across the country. But politicians seem wholly ineffective, even given the large amount of capital that came to the cities and states during COVID-19. And our goal is not only to have OneFifteen be a model for the success against opioid addiction, Dayton, Ohio. We hope to bring that model in a varied way to address the homeless crisis on the Wes Coast. And so, with that, I'd like to turn it over to Jenna Foger, who's going to comment on some important COVID-19 matters, the NIH and the FDA. Take it away, Jenna. Jenna Foger : Thank you so much, Joes, and good afternoon, everyone. As we begin to turn a new corner on this COVID-19 pandemic, which I'll speak to in a moment, life science industry fundamentals as Joes highlighted continue to be very strong, and provide the industry with the unique structural integrity to weather broader market volatility and cyclicality. The confidence of these drivers and key advances in our understanding of biology and next generation modalities will continue to fuel life science demands well into the future. So, as we spoke about last quarter, owing to the expediency at which the industry and our tenants move to protect the country in the world, we now have the tools and a roadmap at our disposal to end this pandemic, while also ushering in a historic new era for biotech and scientific innovation are none. So turning to our COVID-specific updates, by the numbers according to the World Health Organization, there has been a staggering 242 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, about 20% of these reported in the U.S. alone, including over 4.9 million cumulative deaths. In the U.S., the incidence of new COVID-19 cases has welcomingly declined over 55% from its recent September peak of over 160,000 new cases to now 70,000 new cases, and we hope to see this trend and decline continue, of course. Three of the most widely distributed vaccines worldwide and authorized by the FDA has been developed by [ indiscernible 0 :09:36.3], Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson. And roughly 67% of the vaccine eligible population in our country that's 12 and over have been fully vaccinated. So this is just over 57% of the total U.S. population. And we hope with boosters and expanding indications that this number of fully vaccinated individuals will continue to rise. As we saw last week, the FDA authorized the use of Moderna and Johnson and Johnson boosters, in addition to Pfizer's already authorized booster shots, as well as the mixing and matching of booster doses between Pfizer Moderna and J&J in eligible populations. In light of the evolving data on the duration of immunity and COVID-19 variants concerns, including the common Delta variant, and now the Delta plus variants hitting U.S. soil, it's highly likely that COVID-19 vaccines will be required long-term. With regard to vaccine efficacy, in a study evaluating the real-world effectiveness of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines at preventing symptomatic illness, the Moderna vaccine had an efficacy rate of 96% and Pfizer at 89%. So as we've all heard, breakthrough infections have occurred in a high single digit percentage of vaccinated population. But, while current vaccines may not entirely prevent transmission or contraction of COVID-19, they do significantly prevent severe disease and deaths, with over 90% of all hospitalized COVID cases represented by unvaccinated individuals. With regard to vaccine safety, there have been very few vaccine related adverse events, less than seven per million reported overall, with nearly all cases resolving and without long-term side effects reported to-date. Given such a strong efficacy and safety profile, the FDA granted full approval for Pfizer's mRNA-based vaccine for people 16 and older, and Moderna\u2019s mRNA-based vaccine is likely to achieve full approval for its vaccine for 18 and older in the fourth quarter. With regard to pregnancy in women of childbearing age, based on the safety data generated to-date and how we know vaccines work in the body, the CDC and top health officials have encouraged any Americans who was pregnant, planning to become pregnant or currently breastfeeding to get vaccinated against the Coronavirus as soon as possible. With regard to children, Pfizer reported that its COVID-19 vaccine for ages 5 to 11 was safe and nearly 91% effective. And on the basis of this data, the FDA is expected to authorize Pfizer's vaccine for this population in the fourth quarter. Moderna also just announced yesterday that its COVID vaccine is both safe and highly effective in children ages 6 to 11, which they will also submit to the FDA. For young children ages six months to four years, vaccine authorization will likely come in early 2022. So despite these advances in vaccines, given that COVID will likely remain on the planet for the foreseeable future, albeit as an endemic virus, with seasonal and sporadic geographic peaks therapies are going to continue to be important in mitigating the severity of COVID-19. And so most notably this past month, Alexandria tenant Merck in collaboration with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics submitted an EUA application to the FDA for oral antiviral molnupiravir.  This drug demonstrated a 50% reduction in hospitalization or death in patients with mild or moderate COVID-19. If authorized, molnupiravir will be the first oral antiviral therapy for COVID-19 is a big deal. It's far easier and more cost effective to administer broadly compared to current antibody treatments in the mild and moderate COVID-19 population. So despite the COVID fatigue that we all absolutely feel on the multitude of challenges that this pandemic has placed on our countries or society and the world, of course, the scientific advances achieved at an unprecedented speed is the one saving grace of this tragic period in our history. The scientific attitude and adaptability of so many of our tenants to translate their broad platforms, and decades of work into safe and effective vaccines, therapies and testing in really a year's time is remarkable. And application of these tools will forever transform the way we develop vaccines against novel targets. It will also augment future surveillance testing and our nation's pandemic preparedness overall. So, to touch on another topic on the NIH and FDA leadership, the pandemic has also underscored how critical these agencies are, and that solid support for these key federal agencies is paramount for national security, for ensuring that the U.S. maintains its leadership in advancing scientific and biomedical innovation, and for maximizing our ability to address current and future health challenges. So interestingly, over the past several weeks the leadership positions at these two agencies have received increasing attention. On October 5, long tenured NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins announced that he would be stepping down as the Director of the agency by the end of the year. Dr. Collins is the longest serving presidentially appointed NIH Director, having served three U.S. Presidents over more than 12-years. During his tenure, the NIH has received increasing bipartisan support, and the agency's budget grew from $30 billion in 2009, when he started to nearly $50 billion in the upcoming fiscal year. The Biden administration is undergoing a formal process to name Collins replacement, which is expected later this year or more likely early next, and we're optimistic that his successor will continue to bolster biomedical and public health research in this country. As for the FDA, Acting Commissioner, Dr. Janet Woodcock has led the agency since the beginning of the Biden administration. Under her leadership in addition to the COVID-related emergencies authorizations that I just spoke about, the FDA\u2019s CDER has approved 40 new molecular entities through the third quarter, putting the agency on pace in the 2020s near record high of 53 approvals. So because Dr. Janet Woodcock sort of fires on November 15, the administration now needs to select and appoint a new Commissioner in the coming weeks. So similarly, on October 14, the Biden administration announced that it\u2019s likely to nominate Dr. Robert Califf as the next Commissioner of the FDA. Dr. Califf is a Cardiologist by training, and current Head of Clinical Policy and Strategy for Verily and Google Health.  Dr. Califf also served as FDA Commissioner from 2016 to 2017, end of the Obama administration after being appointed Deputy Commissioner in 2015. Dr. Califf is also very well-known and dear to us at Alexandria as a regular participant in the Alexandria Summit for the past several years, and a partner in our OneFifteen Project to address the opioid epidemic, as Joes just spoke about. Dr. Califf's nomination would be viewed very favorably by the life science industry, key investors and stakeholders. Clearly, the strength of the FDA is instrumental for ensuring the continued pace and vitality of biomedical innovation in our country. And I just wanted to highlight, in addition to the COVID-19-related updates that we'll likely see in the fourth quarter, the FDA will also announce a handful of major approval decisions before the end of the year. Decisions that have positive will bring critical new drugs to patients as well as billions of dollars of additional revenue to the sector. For example, Eli Lilly is expected to submit an application for accelerated approval of an Alzheimer's therapy, known as donanemab. And given all the controversy surrounding FDA\u2019s positive approval of Biogen's Aduhelm in the same application, the approval of Lilly's drug would likely inform future approvals in this area. There's also a major decision regarding a new class of drugs for severe atopic dermatitis from Pfizer and AbbVie, and several other awaited approvals for growing biotechs, including the approval of [indiscernible] for the treatment of bipolar disorder from longstanding Alexandria attendant and investment intracellular therapies. So just to wrap up, before I turn it to Steve, I wanted to share a quote from former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb in his new book, uncontrolled spread by COVID-19 cross death and how we can defeat the next pandemic. In his book, Gottlieb writes, the brief history of COVID shows that innovation can't always be predicted, we don't know which platform will yield answers for future threats. As part of our national preparedness, it will be important to stockpile countermeasures to some of the known risks. But it's equally important to support the development of novel technology platforms that have broad applicability over a range of potential threats. The use of mRNA to customize synthetic vaccines show the value of having agile competencies at the ready. These are the technologies we will need to produce our nation's vulnerability. So does this opportune focus and unique ability and responsibility as a life science industry that continues to reaffirm why Alexandria has dedicated our business, our passion and our purpose to help drive this mission-critical industry forward. And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve. Thank you. Steve Richardson : Thank you, Jenna. Good afternoon, everyone. Alexandria\u2019s brand power in the market is not only delivering the exceptional results today that you've seen, but also provides clarity for the potential trajectory of the company's future growth and enhanced dominant position in the life science ecosystem. Peter and I just completed an intensive on the ground tour through a few of our cluster markets. And the energy and enthusiasm for Alexandria's entirety of offerings as an integral part of the life science ecosystem was abundantly evident. The Class A plus quality and the mission-critical nature of the facilities that is so important during this time of COVID-19, coupled with the creation of true renaissance, like science centers on our mega campuses, provides for a set of highly desirable and sought after destinations. And the numbers the team are posting bear out this leadership position. The highlights include superb leasing milestones, year-to-date leasing is 5.4 million square feet. The highest annual leasing run rate in the company's history achieved during just these first three quarters of 2021. And as noted earlier by Joel, featuring the largest lease in the company's history to Moderna at 325 Binney Street for their 462,000 square foot state-of-the art headquarters. It's critical to note two important aspects of this leasing activity. One, it is occurring in our core sub-markets where we have high barriers to entry, low vacancy and a first mover advantage. And two, it is also occurring in the development and redevelopment pipeline at an accelerated rate, with the 1 million square foot of leasing in the segment during Q3 reaching the second highest leasing level for development and redevelopment projects, further validating Alexandria\u2019s strategic and robust acquisition activity during 2021. Let's turn to the strategic expansion of our asset base. Q3 was a very productive quarter with completed acquisitions totaling 5.6 million square feet. And a number of key aspects of this expansion of our asset base include the following : 4.9 million square feet of this total were highly accretive value creation opportunities. We are also able to continue either doubling down in our course of markets, as evidenced by 325 Binney Street or strategically expanding the boundaries of these sub-markets. These critical decisions on acquisitions are informed by our unrivaled network of 750 tenants to meet their current needs and provide a path for future growth. And in total, we have now increased the total asset base from 47 million square feet to 64 million square feet during the past four quarters, a significant increase of 36%. The core is also outperforming as renewal in releasing spreads of 19.3% cash and 35.3% gap during Q3 are impressive. But I also want to underscore and highlight that our mark to market across the portfolio has moved up to 25% on a cash basis today, nearly doubling and significantly up from 13.6% in Q1 of 2019. AR balance of 99.4% in October, continues our hard work there. And we really do have a dream team in the operational realm. And a big shout out to the folks who make this happen every day. Occupancy is increasing. As we've noted throughout the year, we expected occupancy to increase excluding the recently acquired projects with vacancy, we've delivered on those goals. We were at 97.1% as of June 2020, and we're now at 98.5%. Turning to market health, on the demand side, Joel and Jenna highlighted the key components driving demand in the life science industry. However, the seasoned executive Life Science management teams driving this demand are requiring high quality facilities and deeply experienced operational teams, as clearly evidenced by our leasing volume and velocity. These companies are investing hundreds of millions of dollars in life changing therapies, and require exceptional performance from a world-class team and technically sophisticated facilities. Downtime or mistakes that may destroy experiments in years of work are unacceptable risks. Alexandria, as a pioneer of this life science niche has earned a reputation as a trusted partner to provide operational excellence for these mission-critical facilities. On the supply side, as I mentioned earlier, Peter and I recently toured a few of our regions firsthand to also evaluate the competitive supply on a granular level. And it is clear that there is no aggregation of disruptive large scale projects delivering during the 2020 to 2023 timeframe. There are in fact a handful of one-off buildings in the market. But we have seen our qualitatively superior mega campuses compete very well against this type of offering. We are also closely monitoring the potential for projects beyond this timeframe that definitively advances genuine Life Science competition, but in many cases, they require many quarters or even years of entitlement, permitting, and horizontal infrastructure work before any decision to go vertical might be made. So in conclusion, as we close towards the end of 2021, the first three quarters of this year have yielded a tremendously productive foundation to continue the company's integral and indispensable role in the life science ecosystem. With that, I'll hand it off to Peter. Peter Moglia : Thanks, Steve. Hello, everybody. I'm going to update you all on our high value creation development pipeline and construction cost trends. And then I'm going to comment on our recent partial interest sale in Mission Bay, and some market activity that we believe represents overzealous behavior by new entrants in the life science real estate market that should lead to challenges for such groups. As Joel mentioned in his opening, historic demand for our differentiated life science campuses has continued in the third quarter, and we expect this to continue to at least the near to medium-term, as record levels of government, venture capital and biopharma investment continues to disseminate into Alexandria's cluster markets to discover, develop and manufacture new modality, such as cell, gene and RNA and DNA therapies. The resulting growth of our underlying industry gives us high conviction to continue as an elevated pace of development, redevelopment and to acquire assets to backfill the pipeline we're advancing today. This historic demand paired with our long tenure development experience and expertise, resulted in another outstanding quarter for Alexandria.  We delivered 238,163 square feet spread over six assets, including Arsenal on the Charles in Watertown, which continues to be one of the hottest markets outside of Cambridge, 3160 Porter drive, which is now materially oversubscribed with tenants looking to tap into this unique partnership we have with Stanford, and our two ground up developments in Research Triangle, which are capitalizing on strong demand for research development, manufacturing space from therapeutic and agricultural technology companies. These deliveries will contribute $14.3 million in NOI over the next year. And as Joel and Steve noted in their comments, during the quarter we were very excited to add 325 Binney Street to our under construction pipeline. This new 462,000 square foot high performance development targeting LEED Zero Energy certification showcases Alexandria\u2019s climate resilient design solutions, as well as our mission-critical efforts to catalyze positive change to benefit human health and society. It is 100% leased to Moderna, an example of a highly disruptive and visionary company that has grown with Alexandria since shortly after it was founded. Early on, we identified the team and the transformational potential of its mRNA platform, and we have both invested and provided the company with mission-critical real estate over the past 10-years. This is truly a testament of our ability to recognize and become a trusted partner of the most impactful life science companies in the world. Including three to 325 Binney, we have added over 1.1 million square feet of new development to our pipeline, and net of deliveries increased assets under construction from 3.4 million square feet to 4.3 million square feet. This increase in our pipeline is warranted by the demand I mentioned previously, and evidenced by the tremendous leasing activity of over 1 million square feet for the quarter, truly a historic demand from the life science industry and tremendous execution by our leasing professionals. I\u2019ll now comment on cost trends, as reported over the past two quarters, construction costs remain elevated, driven by supply and demand dynamics for material. But two other factors have begun to exacerbate the problem, labor shortages and supply chain problems. Nine months into 2021, previous year projects that had been put on hold due to COVID and new 2021 projects have created a double barrel demand for construction resources at a time when fabrication shops are struggling to procure raw material and restart due to labor shortages. The result has been record escalation for concrete, steel, wood, aluminum and glass. Most of these commodities are sourced from the United States. But there are still a number that come from foreign sources such as steel from Canada, Asia, Mexico and Brazil, glass from Thailand and resins used for pipe and specialty products such as benchtops for labs from Asia and Europe. As we all know, there have been significant supply chain disruptions around the world, none more apparent than the backlog of cargo ships in Southern California, which last Tuesday reached an all-time high of over 100 ships waiting to unload thousands of containers outside the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, a bottleneck that is expected to continue into next year. In addition to supply disruptions, construction costs are being impacted by labor shortages. There is a lack of skilled workers to keep up with the accelerated demand caused by a number of factors including GC, finding that some of the workforce laid off or furloughed during COVID are not returning because of retirement or finding other jobs. And it could get worse, if OSHA adopts vaccine mandates, as the construction industry is one of the highest unvaccinated workforces. Unfortunately, higher costs are not the only consequence of material and labor shortages. Material shortages caused longer lead times that can delay deliveries. Based on our deep experience and expertise, lead times have generally increased by six to eight weeks for most common materials. Even longer for materials that are comprised of metal and PVC or have a need for computer ships, such as building control. Alexandria is employing a number of mitigation measures to offset these impacts. And to-date, we've been very successful in staying on budget and schedule the vast majority of our projects. Increases in rents have enabled us to maintain our yields, but future projects may trend slightly lower as escalations and longer lead times impact our underwriting. However, we are fortunate in that the demand for Life Science real estate investments continue to drive lower cap rates for stabilized buildings, allowing us to maintain our spread. And speaking of cap rate compression, during the quarter, we sold additional interest in our 409 and 499 Illinois and 1500 Owens assets, while recapitalizing them with a new partner. In our original recapitalization done in December 2015, we achieved a total valuation of $1,021 per square foot, and a blended cap rate of 4.6%. In this transaction, we achieved a blended cap rate of 4.2% and a price per square foot of approximately $1,362, representing 33% appreciation over the whole period. To-date, we've achieved a healthy unlevered IRR of 10.4% on those assets. Finally, an observation on those clamoring to position themselves to capture the growing Life Science real estate demand, I referenced earlier. City office REIT sale of two parcels in Sorento, Mesa to Sterling Bay and Harrison Street for $576 million illustrates a gold rush mentality proliferating across our markets. City REIT\u2019s announcement stated that the south portion of the site was allocated $181 million of purchase price. A rendering of the site shows a very tight 2.0 FAR density of development that would imply a purchase price of $261 per square foot of land. To give you some context, our basis in the recently acquired land at 6250 to 6460 Sequence Drive a far superior location in the same Sorento, Mesa sub-market would have a basis of approximately 25% of that, if we were to build it to the same density. Our plans contemplate a much more inviting campus with open space and amenities, so our basis will be more like 50% of theirs, but you get the point. This is a great example of why we are in an incredibly advantageous position to capture any tenant requirement we want to capture. We are highly disciplined and have superior locations, superior basis, superior execution and the superior brand. And with that, I'll pass it over to Dean. Dean Shigenaga : All right, thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga, here. Good afternoon, everyone. Year-to-date 2021 really has been an exceptional year of financial and operating performance for Alexandria. Our brand trusted partnerships with some of the most innovative Life Science entities combined with operational excellence has allowed our team to generate strong results. Our internal growth has been very strong. Statistics from our pipeline of development and redevelopment projects are record breaking, and provide visibility for growth into the future. Total revenues, net operating income and adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter were very strong, and were up 20%, 21% and 22%, respectively, over the third quarter of 2020. All really amazing and impactful results. And I should point out that these stats exclude the impact of the termination fee that was recognized in the third quarter of 2020. Now internal growth and operating results continue to reflect the strength of our unique and differentiated business model and strength of our brand. Our same property performance represents one of the highest quality growth engines within the REIT industry, of which we are immensely proud. We have one of the highest quality tenant rosters in the REIT industry with 53% of our annual rental revenue from investment grade or large cap publicly traded companies, and an important statistic that should be noticed. And occupancy has been very strong and improving this year to 98.5% about 80 basis points from the beginning of the year, excluding the impact from vacancy and recently acquired properties. Now importantly, 1.4 million rentable square feet of vacancy from recent acquisitions represents about 4.1% of our operating rentable square footage, and is a significant opportunity to increase cash flows. Additionally, 41% of this 1.4 million rentable square feet of vacancy is leased or under lease negotiations. And as Joel has stated earlier, we are seeing increasing leasing demand in a number of our key Life Science cluster markets. Now same property NOI growth was strong at 4.1% and 7.3% on a cash basis, and headed toward the upper end of our ranges for 2021 guidance. Same property NOI growth projected for the full year of 2021 is very solid, and is up 100 basis points and 70 basis points on a GAAP and cash basis respectively, from our initial guidance for 2021, really highlighting the improvement in our outlook since the beginning of the year. And once again, very proud of the strong internal growth engine we have. Leases executed in the nine months ended September 30 at over 5.4 million rentable square feet, another company record and this leasing volume was completed with exceptional rental rate growth up 39% and 22.3% on the cash basis. Now let me take a moment to highlight the seasonality of operating expenses related to higher utility expenses. With warm summer weather, we had higher repairs and maintenance in the summer months versus what might occur during the winter months, and higher property insurance premiums were their policy renewal which took effect June 1. Now with 92% of our leases being triple net these increases are generally recoverable from our tenants, and therefore have minimal impact on net operating income. However, the increase in operating expenses has a slight and only temporary negative 1% to 2% impact on operating and EBITDA margins for the quarter. Additionally, vacancy from recent acquisitions also slightly reduced margins. But it's important to recognize that our adjusted EBITDA margins remain one of the top within the REIT industry, and we expect the favorably resolved vacancy from recently acquired properties over the next number of quarters. Now turning to real estate, our trusted partnership with key Life Science entities, our brand and operational excellence among many other items is really standing out today as highlighted by strong demand for our pipeline of development and redevelopment projects. We have 7.7 million rentable square feet either under construction or construction commencing over the next six quarters, with projects approximately 80% leased or under negotiation, highlighting continuing historic demand, 93% of which represents transactions with existing relationships, including a number of deals coming from our tenant base of over 750 entities. Now the 7.7 million rentable square foot pipeline is up 731,000 rentable square feet over June 30. And some of the key highlights in the quarter included that we commenced construction on 1.2 million rentable square feet that is on average 60% leased or under negotiation, including 325 Binney Street, which is 100% leased, and 751 Gateway in South San Francisco, which is 100% under negotiation. These are pretty amazing leasing statistics, and we just commenced construction. And in both cases, stellar existing relationships resulted in full building users. Now we added approximately 480,000 rentable square feet of space targeted to commence construction over the next six quarters, that\u2019s about 20% of the space is under LOI negotiations today. And importantly, our team executed 1 million rentable square feet of leasing in the third quarter related to the development and redevelopment space, including the 462,000 rentable square foot lease with Moderna for 100% at 325 Binney Street. And we expect demand from our development sites and projects will provide us the opportunity to commence construction of other development and redevelopment projects. Now turning to our venture investments, just want to shout out a huge thank you to our science and technology team for their leadership in underwriting life science industry trends, and high quality investment opportunities. Now our venture investment cost basis only represents about 3.2% of gross assets, and unrealized gains were $930 million on a cost basis of about $1 billion. In the third quarter, we realized individually significant gains from three separate transactions aggregating $52.4 million. And year-to-date through September 30, we realized individually significant gains from six separate transactions aggregating $110.1 million. Now this represents over $100 million of capital that we did not anticipate at the beginning of the year that we were able to reinvest into our business. Our team is very pleased for recognition of the overall improvement in our corporate credit profile, S&P just upgraded our rating to BBB plus with a positive outlook, highlighting our unique and differentiated business model, strong brand and execution, high quality cash flows and strong credit profile among many other items. So thank you to our entire team for continued solid execution across all areas of our business. We remain on track for net debt to adjusted EBITDA at 5.2 times, at fixed charges greater than 5 times by the end of the year. As we close in on the end of 2021, we are focused on wrapping up several key partial interest sales and high value low cap rate transactions and other dispositions. Each transaction is moving along as expected and we are targeting completion of the sales later this year, which will generate about $1.7 billion in capital. The timing of a couple of the key dispositions were subject to lease negotiations before we were able to put the deals in front of potential investors, and therefore are targeted to close in the fourth quarter. As our team continues to focus on making a positive and lasting impact on the world, they were very pleased for continued recognition of leadership in ESG. MSCI just released results highlighting an A rating for Alexandria, representing one of the top ratings within the REIT industry. GRESB also recently released results of the 2021 assessment, highlighting Alexandria as a global sector leader and a five star rating in the diversified sector for buildings and development, and one of the top two in the science and technology sector for buildings and operation. And our team commenced construction the 325 Binney Street, which is the ground up development fully leased to Moderna and is designed to be the most sustainable laboratory building in Cambridge. Now, key items of the design include use of geothermal energy for heating and cooling and innovative building envelope and building management system, and other sustainable attributes that is designed to eliminate 95% or more fossil fuels and achieve LEED zero energy.  Now this building has also been designed to mitigate risk associated with flood precipitation under a business as usual scenario. And we are extremely excited to be an important strategic partners to Moderna for about a decade now, and super pleased that they select their team to assist them with their strategic priorities, including development of their next super innovative and sustainable lab building. Now turning to guidance, we updated our conservative guidance for 2021 including narrowing the range for EPS and AFFO per share from a range of $0.08 to a range of $0.02 per share. Our 2021 guidance for EPS diluted is ranged from $3.91 to $3.93. And FFO per shares adjusted diluted to a range of $7.74 to $7.76, with no change in the midpoint of $7.75. Now, continue strong demand for space and our asset base has increased our outlook for rental rate growth on lease renewals and release in a space by 2% and 1% on a GAAP and cost basis, respectively. And we also updated our 2021 guidance for dispositions, and have four transactions in process that will generate $1.7 billion, as highlighted a moment ago. We updated construction span for an increase of about $200 million at the midpoint, primarily due to acceleration of leasing and tenant space requirements related to our development and redevelopment projects. And as a reminder, we are about five weeks away from issuance of our detailed guidance for 2022, and therefore, we're unable to comment on 2022 guidance related matters. Let me end there and turn it back to Joel. Joel Marcus : So, operator, if we could go to Q&A. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Manny Korchman with Citi. Please go ahead. Manny Korchman : Hey, good afternoon, everyone. The topic of labor and materials potentially being an issue has come up, I think a couple of times in this call. I was wondering just from your tenants perspective, is labor an issue there? Certainly, this is a hot spot within the economy. And these companies are doing well. But are there enough scientists and other talented staff members to staff all these up incoming companies? Joel Marcus : Yeah. So Manny, welcome. This is Joel. And so, I alluded to that in my comments that there is in fact, truly across the U.S. for many industries kind of a war for talent. And this is true in the life science industry. So far, we haven't seen any egregious shortages. But what I did say is that if somebody is going to not only create a company, but try to scale a company, you've got to be in the critical key existing clusters. You can't wander off and try to scale a company in Chicago or Denver or someplace like that in a way that you could otherwise do say in Boston or San Francisco. It just doesn't work that way. The pool of talent doesn't exist if you look at R&D, commercial, clinical, et cetera. So, at the moment, the existing clusters things seem okay. But there clearly is a war for talent. Michael Bilerman : Joes, just taking that one step further, it's Michael Bilerman here with Manny. Good afternoon. As you think about sort of just the overall space in the life science facility, outside of people, there's obviously an increased use of robotics and other things that have just gotten smaller over time. I think about our PCs that used to be the hunks on our desk that are now in our pocket. How do you think about sort of just the evolution of what's being done in your labs and life sciences buildings, just from an efficiency standpoint? And could you see that evolve, like the law libraries went out the window? Is that at all a risk? I'm not trying to undermine the demand of the business, I understand that side of it very well. But I'm just trying to think about the use of space and the use of robotics and all that to do more in less space. Joel Marcus : I think that trend has been going on for quite a while. There is a whole lot of innovation that have made things that are repetitive, and by nature lend themselves to a more automated approach. But, science is in fact executed by people with pretty sophisticated backgrounds, and so forth. And so the need, not only can't you do science at home, but you can't do science purely robotically. You've got to make a lot of judgments and a lot of insights. And I don't know, Jenna, you've worked at the bench. So maybe you can comment directly. Jenna Foger : Yeah, I think on that point, I was just going to say that I think, robotics innovation broadly, I think, allow a lot these companies to build larger and broader and more robust platforms. So companies are working more efficiently, but they're working on kind of parallel streams at once. So I don't really think that that -- I think robotics has enhanced what companies are looking for, but not really change necessarily real space needs, I think just the whole because the track of the entire industry. I don't think that's like a real thing, Michael Bilerman : A real threat that you're sort of mindful of. Jenna Foger : Yeah, Joel Marcus : No. Michael Bilerman : Okay. Thank you. Jenna Foger : Yep. Operator : Our next question will come from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Please go ahead. Rich Anderson : Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. So I want to ask my first question on CapEx, and I looked at your supplemental looks like it's a lumpy number, TIs have been running anywhere from $20 million to $50 million in the past five quarters. I'm wondering, when I think about the triple net nature of your portfolio, the relative newness of your portfolio born from your own development largely, and just the strength of life science marketplace, do you feel as though that CapEx which seems to be all over the map, from the sell side perspective too is trending down? Or, relatively speaking to the size of your company? Joel Marcus : So, Dean, you want to take on that? Peter, and Steve, you can chime in there. Dean Shigenaga : Hey, Rich, it\u2019s Dean here. I would say there's one overlay to your question, Rich, I think what you're highlighting is the newer assets may have a little longer time before it starts to generate some requirements for capital. But our portfolio has a range of assets generally, much on the newer side. But if you look back over an extended period of time, our CapEx, I'll call it the bad bucket of CapEx, anything except for redevelopment and development CapEx has ranged anywhere from 10% to 13%, maybe just a tad beyond that in a given year. So, I don't think it has generally moved in any one particular direction in the last five or eight years. It's been relatively consistent in that direction, Rich. Rich Anderson : Okay. And Dean, while have you the $1.7 billion of dispositions targeted for the fourth quarter is a key variable to getting to your leverage target, I assume. What is the risk that one or some of that can kind of fall off completely or delay into next year, you'll have to sort of explain a little bit higher, at least temporary leverage position until they get done? Dean Shigenaga : Well, I mean, the reality is there's always some risk, but I think we've moved the transactions along in a good fashion and have expressed expectations from both sides really, to bring closure to these transactions this year. So we feel comfortable, Rich, but we need to get them done as you point out. Rich Anderson : Okay. And just a quick one maybe for Joel. Dr. Califf, new incoming FDA Commissioner, sort of a friend of the firm. Obviously, he's going to do his job, not play favorites, I'm not suggesting that. But what is his awareness of Alexandria? Is there anything beneficial that can come to you as a result of that relationship that you have? Or, is it just business as usual? Joel Marcus : No, I mean, I think that's something we would never even think about or have a mindset about. I think the relationship we have, I mean, Rob, was a practicing cardiologist, he worked at Duke for many years. So he has a wide network across the United States. And I think how we look at him is, he's served in the position before he's well liked. He's a very smart guy, he\u2019s a very compassionate.  And I think that nomination -- or if the nomination happens, he seems to be at the top of the administration's list, I think, would be very good for the industry as a whole, not singling us out in any way, shape, or form. Because he's been there, he's been at the FDA, he knows how to get things done, and I think that's the big benefit for the industry as a whole. Rich Anderson : Okay. Thanks very much. Joel Marcus : Yep. Thanks, Rich. Operator : Our next question will come from Anthony Paolone with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Anthony Paolone : Yeah. Thank you. My first question relates to just the mark to market, just listening to Steve's comments about how that's changed and also just looking at your guidance for cash leasing spreads over the last several quarters. It seems like the market rents have been moving the last couple of years high single digits annually. And so, my question is, one, do you think it continues at that pace? And then two, it would seem that we haven't seen your peak mark to market leasing spreads yet. Is that fair? Joel Marcus : Yeah. So maybe, Steve, do you want to comment on that, because I think there's some pretty good observations there. Steve Richardson : Sure. Yeah, Tony, Steve, here. Look, this is across the entire portfolio. So this, number one is very broad based. I think that's important to emphasize here. And, as we've been seeing, when you see these leasing statistics, and the acquisition work we're doing, it's responding to the industry. So, with that, we'll see what's to come in the future. But, we do have a lot of confidence based upon our network of what the future holds. And, that relates to the mark to market as well, and the potential for further increases. Anthony Paolone : Okay. And then for Peter, in the past, you've done a nice job going through cap rates. Can you can you maybe touch on that through your markets? Peter Moglia : I mean, I guess I\u2019d broadly say that a couple years ago, there were markets like Research Triangle or Maryland, where people thought you're in the 6.5 to 7.5 range. And I would say today, I would doubt that there'd be any asset we would sell on our balance sheet in any market that wouldn't have a cap rate with a handle greater than a 5. So that way, we're going to -- you're going to see sub 4 cap rates, you're going to see nothing really go below -- I mean, until interest rates go up and then all real estate kind of gets hurt by that. I don't think you're going to see anything above a 5 something cap rate, at least in life science for the near future. Joel Marcus : Yeah. In the core cluster markets. Peter Moglia : Correct. Anthony Paolone : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Sheila McGrath with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Sheila McGrath : Yes, good afternoon. Joel, I was wondering if you could give us more detail on your thought process or strategic thinking on which buildings or which markets you're choosing to sell partial interest in. Is it -- are you looking to lighten up in California given the business environment? Just a little more color on that? Joel Marcus : Yeah, I want to be real careful there because we have transactions underway. So maybe I would say defer that to the next quarter, where we could come in on the full year. I think the mantra that we have is where we have assets that are -- where we've really maximized value for Alexandria in a sense are ones that we certainly think about and look at. But it's a sophisticated set of issues and thoughts that we go through, but I think I don't want to come in given just pending transactions. Sheila McGrath : Okay. And then if you could give us some insights on the recent entitlements that you received at Fenway Park, was the timing and square footage in line with your expectation? And will this extra 450,000 square feet be near-term project? Joel Marcus : Yeah. So Peter, you could comment on the underwriting? Peter Moglia : Yeah, Sheila, we actually underwrote a lower amount of -- more conservative amount FDR [ph] that we get on that additional side. So we're quite pleased with the outcome. And we are already set to design a project on that site. It's underway. The leasing that was done at the current development on the site there has been terrific, as you can see we're in the in the 90% leased and negotiating, and we're just wrapping up any leases that we haven't ramped up so far over the next quarter. So, the Fenway market is exceeding our expectations. The outcome of the entitlements was tremendous and we'll be capitalizing on that in the near future. Joel Marcus : Yeah. And you guys, either Steve or Peter, you can comment on the leasing that was done there from when we started early in the year till now, and how we've been able to really bring our client base to that project. Peter Moglia : Yeah, I'll start with and then Steve, you can add anything. But, one of the things when we bought that asset, the one that was under developed was 17% leased at the time. And within, I think a quarter, I was looking at the statistics of when we were preparing their supplemental, and I called up our team and I said, guys, like you're making incredible progress here, what is going on. And what they told us was, what they've been -- what they were told by the market was essentially, this is a great project. And the developer was a very, very good developer, but not allowed developer and that the market was waiting to see who was going to acquire it. And once they saw it was us, then people were ready to commit to it. So we went again, from 17% to in the 19%, at least in negotiating in I think within two quarters. And it was all because, our brand was put on the building, and people could trust that we would do an excellent job of not only finishing the development, but operating it down the road. Sheila McGrath : Okay, great. Thank you. Joel Marcus : Thanks, Sheila. Operator : Our next question will come from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Jamie Feldman : Thank you. Steve, in your remarks, I think you had commented that you and Peter just kind of made the rounds around the markets, and felt very good about supply through \u201822 and \u201823. Can you talk more about some of the details of what gives you that comfort? Steve Richardson : Sure, Jamie, Steve here. I think, as we toured through the markets and you drill down on a parcel by parcel or building by building basis, as I did comment, there are a number of single buildings that may be either redeveloped potentially from office to lab, or being advertised for that, or you may see a project or two that has some horizontal work going on, and people are talking about vertical for lab. That timeframe is here and now. So you actually have to see that activity to have a true delivery in \u201822 or \u201823. A lot of what is being talked about, still needs to be entitled, still needs to be permitted, still needs to actually have the horizontal work done before someone's going to make the decision to go vertical, and potentially go vertical without an anchor tenant. So I think it's just important to really bracket the timeframes here. And we just saw that time and time again, and each of these sub-markets really on a specific building and parcel by parcel basis. Joel Marcus : Yeah. And I think if you overlay that, Jamie, with what Peter said, about construction issues, it makes it all the more unbelievable that people could maybe broadcast something when in fact, they couldn't accomplish it. So I think that's the reality as well. Peter Moglia : It\u2019s Peter. I just would add that, we really didn't see anything that was going to reach the scale that we can provide our tenancy, as Steve mentioned. Lots of projects named, but they're essentially one-off. And, as we've discovered over the past few years, as we've assembled our mega campuses, there's just a lot of power and attraction that tenants have to that aggregation. And what we see in the markets when we were touring on our decent sites, but nothing that would compete with us on that scale. So anyway. Jamie Feldman : And then, are there certain markets that you'll be watching more than others that maybe -- I mean, sounds like you're talking about 2024 at this point, but just generally, where do you see the most potential supply risk? Steve Richardson : We\u2019re tracking each and every one of the markets very closely, Jamie. Certainly, San Diego, San Francisco and Cambridge, tracking those closely, Seattle, Maryland and Research Triangle as well. I don't know that there's any one market right now that is most concerning. Over the others, we're just monitoring it very closely broad based. Joel Marcus : Yeah. And I mean, the other thing, Jamie is, that's more than two years out, so we don't know what the macro environment will be or the micro demand environment as well. So, hard to predict. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then Joel, just listening to your comments at the outset of the call, couple \u2013 it sounds like you're somewhat frustrated with the political environment. Can you\u2026 Joel Marcus : I think, every -- yeah, that's just not me. I think we're speaking about everybody that days, the old days of bipartisanship are kind of gone. And everybody seems to want to railroad their ideas. I mean, I spoke about the infrastructure package, which is being held up kind of as ransom for this much broader cradle to grave social entitlement thing. And if infrastructure is so important, why isn't it just done, because that is bipartisan. But I've said, I think it's a 20th century infrastructure package, not a 21st century infrastructure package. And if we don't watch out China's going to eat our lunch here over the next decade or two. Jamie Feldman : Okay. So I guess just to ask the question, I mean, what concerns you the most as it pertains to your business specifically? Joel Marcus : Well, I mean, I think the way \u2013 I think the folks that are in there, nobody knows who they are that are pushing this 3.5 trillion, but now slimmed down, because of likely Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema to some number that still seems outrageous. It's like going into a store, buying things and then figuring out Gee, I don't have a credit card, I don't have a check, I can't cover this. What am I going to do to pay for this? That's what it seems to me, that's a good analogy. And the items are pretty crazy, too. Certainly, we can do much better in a bipartisan fashion, not just crazy stuff. Jamie Feldman : Generally, it sounds like you're comfortable with the life science part of things. Joel Marcus : Well, I mean, I think early on they're going after all kinds of sources, without any regard to policy. This is maybe the point here, Jamie. It's not a policy decision. It's, oh, where can we try to get $1 trillion or $2 trillion or $3 trillion or $4 trillion or $5 trillion from a bunch of sources without thinking about tax policy or health care policy. It's all about -- let's just steal somewhere and put it somewhere so we can get the goodies we want. That's not how to run a government. Jamie Feldman : Okay, understood. Thank you. Joel Marcus : Yep. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Please go ahead. Tom Catherwood : Thank you so much. Good afternoon, everyone. Great to see the lease with Moderna at 325 Binney. And Dean, thank you for the color on that. In the past, you've worked with the Citi to add more density to your Cambridge sites. With the acquisition of One Rogers and One Charles Park, what\u2019s the opportunity for further densification in Cambridge? Joel Marcus : Yeah, so we don't want to give anybody else a roadmap. But I'd say there are unique opportunities we're looking at. And we think given our position in that market and our knowledge of that market, much like three to five, which we were able to substantially up zone, we had actually underwrote that site for something like 200,000 or 250,000 feet, and we're able to do much better. I would say, just wait and see. But there are things that we are doing and we will be doing that are pretty amazing. So, let me leave it at that. Tom Catherwood : Got it. Thanks, Joel. And then last one for me. We've heard numerous examples of life science companies facing challenges with small molecule manufacturing, and especially products that have short half-lives, like radiology treatments. In the past, you've talked about specialized domestic drug manufacturing as an area of opportunity. And what's your current view on manufacturing up kind of build outs or development for Alexandria? And given the mission-critical nature of these, are tenants looking to own these instead of lease them? Joel Marcus : Yeah. So Peter, you've got a whole lot of recent experience on the integration of the R&D with the manufacturing. So maybe just kind of a quick overview of how to kind of think about that. Peter Moglia : Yeah, Tom, what you were alluding to more small molecule as -- the issue there's more just onshoring the materials that go into that, and hopefully, eventually manufacturing things there. But that's really not the opportunity we've been touting. The opportunity we've been touting is the next generation manufacturing of cell and gene therapy type, or even DNA and RNA type of drugs like Moderna manufacturers. Those drugs need to be near the research. They're living and breathing biologics that will take constant tweaking until they can be gotten right. And so, the tenants tend to need those facilities within even probably preferably 10, 20, 30 minute drive versus across the country, or in an area where maybe there's cheap labor. So that's the opportunity for us and we've taken advantage of it in acquiring some properties that will do well for manufacturing. There's certain attributes to a building that makes it better for manufacturing. But we've been also very careful in setting ourselves and putting ourselves in a good position to do that, by ensuring that where we're buying this real estate and real estate that we're buying would also work well for R&D. And so it's easy to do, because, as I said, the tenants will want these facilities to be very close to where they're doing the R&D now. And so, down the line, if we have a building or 20 in a market that is being used for manufacturing, and then they become available, they could also easily convert to R&D down the road. Hopefully, that answers your question. Tom Catherwood : That that was really helpful. Thanks so much, everyone. Joel Marcus : Thanks, Tom. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Michael Carroll : Yeah. There was a sizable increase, I guess, in your staff related projects under construction, or expected to break ground over the next six quarters. I know this stuff was about 57 versus 52 in the prior stuff. I know there's a lot of moving parts within these numbers, though. But I guess, my key or that my question is, how much of that increase is due to new projects who\u2019re planning breaking ground before 2022 versus kind of starting to bleed into maybe the beginning of 2023 into those numbers? Joel Marcus : Yeah, so I'll let Dean comment. But I would say keep in mind, the key driver here is immediate demand by our tenants and a path for future growth. So we're trying to kind of juggle both requirements. So Dean, you could comment. Dean Shigenaga : Yeah, Michael, I think what you're trying to understand a little bit is as we look at the full year \u201822 versus something going into \u201823. And I think you'll see us quarter-to-quarter extend that horizon a little bit. It's nothing to do with timing of transactions slipping. You can actually see a number of changes, if you were in supplemental, a supplemental where we had a number of projects across the spectrum from near-term, intermediate to future, get accelerated forward in the timeline. And as we highlighted in our commentary, all of this has been driven by as Joel mentioned, as well, demand for the space and an acceleration of our timing outlook as a result of the requirements that we're dealing with, with our tenant base and other relationships as well. Michael Carroll : Okay. So, I guess if I'm understanding correctly, this is more of you're seeing near-term demand, so you're willing to break ground on new projects over the next six quarters, and that's driving the large part of that increase? Dean Shigenaga : Yeah, exactly. And as I mentioned in my commentary, almost all the activity you're seeing has some level of leasing on it. So we're sitting in a pretty nice spot right now. Michael Carroll : Okay, great. And then can we talk a little bit more about the fundamental backdrop, I guess, particularly market rent growth? I mean, can you quantify how much market rents have increased this year compared to prior years? And is there any big differences among the top clusters, I guess, particularly Boston, San Fran, or San Diego? Joel Marcus : So Steve, maybe give a top side view of that. I want to be careful. We don't benchmark each and every market, Steve Richardson : Michael, look, again, it's been broad based. I know, we've said that, but it really is. And, I think you're probably in the mid to single digits in some of the markets and maybe even double digit, low teen growth in some of the markets. We are just going to have Investor Day in a number of weeks here, so why don't we push a little bit of this question to Investor Day? Michael Carroll : Okay, great. I appreciate it. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks. Joel Marcus : Okay. Thank you very much, everybody for your time and attention. And stay safe and god bless. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Paula Schwartz : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel. Joel Marcus : Thank you, Paula, and welcome, everybody, to our fourth quarter and 2021 year-end call. With me today are Peter Moglia, Steve Richardson and Dean Shigenaga. And with that, welcome. I wanted to thank you for joining, and wish everybody a happy Chinese New Year starting today, the year of the Tiger. We, at Alexandria, are very honored and pleased to report on a truly historical -- historic and remarkable fourth quarter and 2021 year-end results, really demonstrating operational and strategic excellence by really each and every metric. And what I think is truly unique and audacious is that Alexandria has operated during this past 2 years, the 2021 -- 2020 and 2021 will be known as the COVID era, really at the highest operational tempo ever and as the sophistication and scale that few REITs could ever accomplish.  And in the words of Jim Collins, Alexandria has truly achieved 3 outputs that define a great company : superior results, distinctive impact and lasting endurance. And I want to thank profoundly each and every one of the extraordinary Alexandria family team members on a sensational performance during 2021. Napoleon I said, strength and growth come only through continuous effort and struggle. And over the last 25 years, we came public in May 97. So we'll have our 25th anniversary in May. We took this small company public 3 years after we started it with $19 million Series A. And as of the end of the year, December 31, 2021, we had reached a phenomenal total market cap of $44 billion. For the period of COVID, the 2020 and 2021, Alexandria's TSR approximated 45-plus percent, exceeding by a wide margin in the office index with a total return of minus 0.5%. And since our IPO 25 years ago in May '97, we've been proud and fortunate that our total shareholder return has exceeded 2,500%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 and office REIT indices at 939% and 552%, respectively. And we're always playing the long game. Speaking about fourth quarter and year-end, very robust results. Our life science markets, as evidenced by our fourth quarter and full year results, truly were a blowout in many respects and most of which in -- as clearly highlighted, has been leasing. And that really sets us up nicely for a very strong 2022 and beyond. The continued robust demand from really 1 of the most innovative and transformative industries in the United States, the life science industry, one which is not really cyclical, but which is event driven, I think, does set us up and enables us, our brand and our talented and special operational lab space, affords us a very strong pricing power in each of our cluster markets. And really, in many ways, sets us up to have a very strong earnings growth year here in 2022 and into '23 and '24.  We continue to create highly accretive value creation opportunities to meet the current demand of over our 850 innovative tenants and importantly, provide a path for future growth. And although we've reiterated 2022 guidance, and Dean will speak more about that in a moment, the $8.26 to $8.46 FFO per share, we will clearly revisit and update that in the first quarter earnings release. We have very strong momentum at our backs. As most of you know and we often comment, with 10,000 known diseases to human kind, less than 10% really have addressable therapies today, and we are truly in the early days of the golden age of biotechnology and biology. Advances in innovation are happening at unprecedented speed and driving human health and quality of life in a positive direction. Steve Jobs commented many years ago when he predicted he thought that the biggest innovations of the 21st century would be the integration of biology and technology. We've achieved historic milestones in many respects. And hopefully, you enjoyed the press release and supplement where we tried to highlight those in both graphical and word form truly. And others will speak about this in a moment, the highest leasing volume in the company's history, 9.5 million square feet, just an awesome achievement. Doubled annual revenues. At our 2017 Investor Day, we gave a framework that we would hope to double annual rental revenues in 5 years, and we exceeded that about 1.5 years ahead of time. We also concluded the largest acquisition in the company's history during 2021, our entry into the Fenway submarket and over 1 million square feet was leased to our longtime tenant and very close relationship, Moderna. And I would say probably most importantly, and I think Dean, Peter and Steve will probably all comment on this, our historically high and strong leasing value-creation pipeline really foreshadows outside growth coming for the -- coming into the upcoming years, including 2022. Nearly 8 million rentable square feet under construction are expected to commence over the next 6 quarters to generate over $610 million of incremental annual revenue, we think really sets us up in an extraordinary fashion. So with that, let me turn it over to Steve for some important commentary. Steve Richardson : Thank you, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. Steve Richardson here. 2021 was indeed a year of historic demand, as Joel has just outlined in the life science industry. And for leasing milestones from the Alexandria team, the 9.5 million square feet of total leasing was a record shattering figure and the 4.1 million square feet during Q4 alone doubled the previous highest quarterly leasing run rate. The highlight, however, may have been the 3.8 million square feet of leasing in the value creation, development and redevelopment pipeline with the emphasis on quality. We had 2 large-scale ground-up Class 8 plus facilities featuring long-term leases to credit tenants. The 462,000 rentable square foot facility at 325 Binney leased to Moderna for their lab headquarters and the 231,000 rentable square foot facility at 751 Gateway for Genentech Roche's lab facility were ably led by our teams on the ground in Greater Boston and the San Francisco Bay Area. And important to note, both Moderna and Genentech Roche are long-time lab tenants of Alexandria, and a hearty shout out as well to our teams for a superb year during 2021. We also look to the metric we don't normally analyze but consider the following : the 9.5 million square feet of total leasing provides in excess of $6 billion of contractual triple-net base rents. $6 billion of contractual base rents are a significant financial metric, but maybe more important is the market reality of this leasing success. The meaningful expansion of the formidable moat the Alexandria team has carefully and strategically created since the company's inception 28 years ago. Also, consider that this 9.5 million square feet of total leasing comprised 318 lease transactions with 280 different life science tenants in our core clusters. This dynamic activity could not be a starker contrast with other entities and random groups who may be leasing 25,000 to 50,000 square feet and occasionally 100,000 square feet here or there to a handful of life science tenants oftentimes outside of our core clusters. As an investor, the value proposition offered by Alexandria is very clear. We are laser focused on the life science industry. This is not a side car or a new initiative for the company. And as we continue to execute on creative and long-standing relationships to drive growth in our core markets, the dominant presence of our brand and mega campuses provides a singularly compelling story in the life science real estate market with our stellar reputation for delivery of high-quality, on-time and on-budget infrastructure and incomparable complex lab operations. Now let me elaborate on a few additional highlights for our milestone late in 2021. The core continues to outperform with impressive renewal and re-leasing spreads of 22.6% cash and 37.9% GAAP during 2021. And we have significant embedded upside with mark-to-market now at 31% plus. This is nearly double the mark-to-market of 17% at the end of Q4 2020. AR for 2021 was 99.9%, huge kudos to our best-in-class operations teams for their continued close relationships with our tenants throughout COVID, these past 2 years. Early renewals during 2021 were 82% compared with our historical 71% rate. And the exceptional health of Alexandria's value creation pipeline at scale, 7.4 million square feet is 1 of the largest and highest quality pipelines amongst our REITs. We've increased the lease negotiating percentage to 83%, and Peter will comment on the details later, has significantly derisked the delivering of the incremental revenues of $610 million noted on Page 34 of the supp. Let me turn to supply and demand for a moment. On demand, as we've highlighted throughout the recent Investor Day presentation and these fresh statistics clearly indicate, Alexandria's compelling by proposition for tenant base at our unique mega campuses has enabled us to capture not only a very large market share but also the highest quality tenants in our core clusters. And as we analyze supply, again, we do not foresee any major supply disruptions during 2022 and 2023. And the delivery of large-scale supply actually materializing is highly uncertain during 2024 and beyond for other potential new entrants. They face entitlement risk, operational risk for tenants considering unproven landlords, capital market risk with the recent increased volatility related to construction starts, supply chain risk as they consider plunging into a new technical and complicated product type and the very significant underwriting risk posed by the nature of the biotechnology in your street. So we are monitoring supply closely, but consider these risks to be very strong headwinds for others. So in conclusion, as we start 2022 with enthusiasm for the highly disruptive therapies for huge unmet medical needs on the horizon by our more than 850 innovative tenants, we look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming months. With that, I'll hand it off to Peter. Peter Moglia : Thanks, Steve. I'm going to update you all on the value creation pipeline. I'm going to discuss what we're seeing with construction costs and supply chain issues and summarize our fourth quarter asset sales, which should bring to light the great opportunity investors have right now to benefit from the disconnect between our stock price and NAV due to overlooking the strength of our fundamentals and the reality on the ground in favor of macro themes. Just look at our quarterly and annual performance, even in volatile times, we've been able to post exceptional results. Less than a handful of REITs can operate at the scale of operational excellence, and even fewer have a dominant share in each of their major markets, a high-quality tenant base and own the vast majority of a scarce asset class. Investors seem to be missing this. Projects that are either under construction or expected to commence construction in the next 6 quarters are projected to deliver greater than $610 million in incremental rental revenues, primarily from the first quarter of this year through 2024. What Joel and others termed as the Golden Age of biotech today and during Investor Day, due to the accelerating discovery and development of effective new modalities, such as cell gene and RNA and DNA therapies, continue to accelerate demand for life science real estate throughout the year and especially in the fourth quarter, resulting in Alexandria shattering a number of leasing records, including the total annual and quarterly leasing volumes of our development and redevelopment pipeline. In addition to this outstanding leasing, our best-in-class development teams have done a tremendous job continuing to deliver high-quality purpose-built laboratory space to our tenants on time and on budget, even in challenging environments, which I'll touch on in a moment. During the year, we delivered a little over 2 million square feet in 14 projects with at least 1 project located in each of our core markets, illustrative of the depth and breadth of demand we see in all of our markets. During the quarter, we delivered 600,000 square feet, spanning 10 of those markets, which when fully delivered, will add approximately $34 million in NOI to our bottom line. Stabilized yields for these projects averaged 6.2% on a cash basis, which is a very healthy spread to the cap rates we are seeing in our partial interest sales, which I will also discuss later. Our current projects under construction are largely pre-committed with 75% of the space leased and 82% leased or under negotiation. Near-term projects expected to commence construction in the next 6 quarters totaled 10.2 million square feet and are already 67% leased and 83% leased or under negotiation.  These projects include ground-up development at Arsenal on the Charles, a development in the Seaport submarket of Boston at 15 Necco, which is fully committed; 2 ground-up projects at Torrey Pines that will aggregate properties on North Torrey Pines Road and adjacent streets into our new 1 Alexandria Square Mega campus; 2 fully committed ground-up developments at Alexandria\u2019s Point Mega campus in the UTC; and 3 ground-up developments at our Alexandria Center for Life Science Mega campus that are 89% committed in aggregate. Truly a remarkable pipeline to fuel earnings growth for years to come. We continue to monitor construction costs and supply chain disruptions with a laser focus. As reported in past calls, 2021 was a very challenging environment with overall cost indexes indicating a full year inflation of 13-plus percent, driven largely by materials costs and a lack of available labor. Conversations with general contractors and examination of industry reports are consistent in concluding that things are improving. And it's expected that as factories, ports and logistics issues settle down, materials pricing will become favorable. Expectations are things will remain elevated in 2022, but we will see a return to normal in 2023. For example, according to IHS Global Insight, steel increased by approximately 27% in 2021, but is expected to increase by approximately 14% this year before decreasing by 13% in 2023 and again by 9% in 2024. Almost every material line item tracked by IHS is expected to start decreasing in price by 2023, with the remaining items increasing at historic inflation rates. The bigger risk we face is delay caused by supply chain problems. A poll of our project managers indicated that although we have some problems with items we typically include in our core and shell development, such as generators being delayed by 6 to 8 months, we are, by and large, able to mitigate delays by making early commitments on design and equipment specifications, a luxury we have because of our years of experience in developing life science buildings, enabling us to make quick decisions based on proven standards we have developed over 2 decades. A status few others have and the result has been no material delays in the core and shell delivery of our project. Experience matters.  However, it's a different story with FF&E, which puts most of the burden on our tenants. Things like benches and other fixtures such as glass watching equipment are tough to get right now. Fortunately, we're able to leverage our scale and relationships for our tenants and ensure the advantages we have and nurture their benefit, so they can get up and running with little inconvenience. In the fourth quarter, we completed the previously disclosed recapitalization of 1,500 Owens at 409/499 Illinois in Mission Bay and completed partial interest sales at 50-60 Binney in Cambridge, 455 Mission Bay Boulevard and 1,700 Owens in Mission Bay with the Binney assets raising nearly $800 million in proceeds at a sub-4% cap rate, realizing a profit of approximately $450 million over cash invested, and the Mission Bay assets raising nearly $400 million of capital while achieving a 3.8% cap rate. We also sold our 49% interest in our Menlo Gateway Tech Office Project, generating almost $400 million in proceeds and achieving a profit of a little over $100 million in just under a 5-year hold period. Overall, these sales generated $1.97 million in proceeds at an average cap rate of 4.3% and a per square foot value of $1,497.  When you put that into the context of yesterday's $194.84 closing price of our stock, which implies a per square foot value of our operating assets of only $906. It supports my earlier statement about a disconnect between the stock price and the reality on the ground. High-quality life science assets with high-quality tenants are scarce, and we have hundreds of them. We are a bargain right now. With that, I'll pass it over to Dean. Dean Shigenaga : Thanks, Peter. Dean here. Good afternoon, everyone. 2021 was a historic and record year of financial and operating performance for Alexandria. We are very well positioned for another exceptional year. We are the go-to brand. Our team delivers a very high level of operational excellence. We benefit from our important and strategic life science industry relationships plus over 850 tenant relationships. We generate strong core growth through same-property NOI growth. We have tremendous visibility into future growth with $610 million of incremental annual rental revenue from our value creation pipeline. Our team has delivered consistent execution of bottom line FFO per share growth year-to-year, and we have 1 of the strongest balance sheets in the REIT industry. We reported total revenues of $2.1 billion, up 12.1% over 2020 and FFO per share as adjusted per diluted share of $7.76 for the full year, outperforming our initial outlook for 2021 by $0.06 per share. 2021 generated many financial metrics that reflect outperformance relative to our initial guidance for the year, which I'll cover throughout my commentary. Core growth in key financial statistics were exceptional. Growth in cash NOI of $280 million to $1.4 billion for the fourth quarter annualized was supported by 1 of the highest quality tenant rosters in the REIT industry with 51% of our annual rental revenue from investment-grade rated or large-cap public companies. We had an industry-leading EBITDA margin of 71%, highlighting efficient execution by our team. We had 100 basis points growth in occupancy for the full year of 2021, excluding the impact of vacancy from recently acquired properties. Now importantly, 48% of the 1.8 million rentable square feet of vacancy from recently acquired properties is expected to commence occupancy and rental revenue over the next 2 quarters. That's pretty amazing execution by our team. Now turning to 2022. The midpoint of our occupancy guidance is 95.5%, which is 150 basis points higher than occupancy of 94% as of 12/31/21. Now demand for space from our life science industry relationships and tenant relationships drove record leasing volume with over 9.5 million rentable square feet executed, double the rentable square feet of leases executed annually in recent years. And we achieved record rental rate growth of 37.6% and 22.6% on a cash basis. Now rental rate growth outperformed our initial outlook for 2021 by 740 basis points and 510 basis points above the midpoint of the range of our guidance, again, pretty spectacular results. And importantly, for 2022, we expect continued strong rental rate growth on lease renewals and releasing the space at roughly 32.5% and 20% on a cash basis at the midpoint of our guidance. Same-property NOI growth was very strong for 2021 at 4.2% and 7.1% on a cash basis. GAAP rental rate growth was about double and cash results were up about 40%, above the midpoint of our initial outlook for 2021. Our outlook for 2022 same-property NOI growth at the midpoint of our guidance is also very strong at 6.5% and 7.5% on a cash basis, above our strong performance in 2021 and reflects 170 basis point growth in same-property occupancy for 2022. Now leasing activity in the fourth quarter continued to reflect a very favorable environment for Alexandria. Occasionally, though, there is a lease or 2 that skews this particular statistic in the quarter. The fourth quarter included lease extensions with 2 tenants with higher tenant improvement allowances and leasing commissions. But the key takeaway is that net effective rent, which is GAAP rent less the impact of tenant improvement allowances and leasing commissions, is up 50% on average for these leases. Now TIs and leasing commissions for lease renewals and releasing of space, excluding these leases was about $34 per square foot and consistent with historical amounts.  Now we are in an outstanding position today with tremendous visibility for future growth in annual rental revenue of over $610 million from 7.4 million rentable square feet of development and redevelopment projects that are 80% leased or under executed LOI or advanced lease negotiations. Now what truly stands out as exceptional is that 94% of the 7.4 million rentable square feet that is leased or negotiating is from existing relationships, highlighting the strength of our brand, operational excellence, our mega campus offerings and many other features. Now during 2021, we completed a record level of leasing with 3.9 million rentable square feet of development and redevelopment space leased, including a whopping 1.8 million rentable square feet in the fourth quarter. We delivered about 2 million square feet of development and redevelopment projects in the year with about $1.6 billion in basis that was on average completed in July of 2021. Now looking forward, NOI from development and redevelopment projects is expected to increase significantly in 2022 in comparison to 2021, and we expect significant year-over-year increases in NOI from development and redevelopment projects to continue into 2023. Turning to venture investments. The investments performed really well in 2021 and generated $216 million in realized gains, including $106 million that was included in FFO per share. Now unrealized gains as of December 31 was almost $800 million, up about $44 million from the beginning of the year. And looking forward into 2022, venture investment gains, we expect to include an FFO per share, should be relatively consistent with 2021 at roughly flat to up 10%. Turning to our balance sheet. Looking back, actually, it was about 10 years ago that our team completed our debut investment-grade bond offering of 10-year notes at 4.66%. Now 10 years later, our team is very pleased with Alexandria's corporate rating that ranks in the top 10% of the REIT industry. So congratulations, team. Now thinking about where rates are today, we could issue 10-year bonds at an all-in rate just under 3% today, highlighting very attractive long-term fixed rate debt for our company. In October, S&P upgraded our credit rating outlook to positive, highlighting our unique and differentiated business model, strong brand and execution, high-quality cash flows and strong credit profile among many other items. Now we met or exceeded our strong balance sheet goals with net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA at 5.2x and our fixed charge coverage ratio at 5.3x, and we ended 2021 with over $3.8 billion in liquidity. Now turning to guidance. There were no changes in the detailed disclosures for 2021 guidance. We reaffirmed our strong outlook for 2022, included EPS diluted ranging from $2.65 to $2.85 and FFO per share as adjusted diluted ranging from $8.26 to $8.46. Now as a reminder, please refer to Page 8 of our supplemental information for detailed underlying assumptions included in our guidance for 2022. And with that, I'll turn it back to Joel. Joel Marcus : Thank you very much, and let's open it up for questions, please. Operator :  Our first question will come from Sheila McGrath of Evercore ISI. Sheila McGrath : I was wondering if you could go into a little bit more detail on some of the recent acquisitions and your vision or the opportunity you see, specifically the land purchases in Research Triangle and maybe comment on the demand drivers in RTP. The acquisition of the Strip Center in San Diego. And finally, Texas, what drove this new market decision? Joel Marcus : Yes. Sheila. Let me start your couple of questions in North Carolina. We have substantially increased our holdings there in a number of ways and recent land parcels are aimed at creating and expanding -- actually expanding the mega campus, which was the former Glaxo campus there that we bought and have turned into kind of a mega campus, if you will, that will be well over 1 million square feet. Leasing has been very, very strong there, and we're adding some adjacent land to expand that campus and the capabilities there. You asked about what's driving the demand in North Carolina, particularly in the triangle. And I think you could argue -- it goes back to our thesis when we started the company that, clusters are really by 4 factors : one, you got to have a there's there, here's here, so to speak. So the Triangle is they're there, here's here, anchored by North Carolina, UNC, Duke and North Carolina State.  The talent base is a second critical factor and one, as you know, there's kind of a war for talent across America in corporate America, even in just average individual-owned companies, small businesses I guess, as you would call them, with so many people leaving the workforce. And North Carolina has an amazing blend of great talent and highly trained skilled people, especially for life science, agricultural tech and certainly technology industries. The third factor is risk capital. There's a good abundance of capital in that market that are fueling companies. And then finally, there's a real plethora of scientific and technical -- you might say, technology where translational work is coming out of the labs and moving into companies.  So those are the 4 things that are really driving. And also next-gen manufacturing is found North Carolina to be an important place. I think Lilly announced today, they're building a billion campus, I think just outside Charlotte, a little surprised it wasn't closer to the Triangle, but they also have operations there. But that's what's driving North Carolina. In San Diego -- I think you asked about San Diego was the second location? Sheila McGrath : Yes. I think you acquired a strip center there to redevelop or something? Joel Marcus : Yes, that is a -- Dean has been working on that for quite a while. That is a really great location in the heart of University Town Center, which has been a hallmark of our presence down there since probably 1998 and an attempt to create a mini campus there in a really great location driven by -- heavily by great transport. And obviously, you know the history of the San Diego market, San Diego has really emerged as 1 of the top markets with a great talent base and really strong capital base, strong scientific prowess and obviously, the land there has been very cherished. And I think the final market you asked about was Texas. So for a variety of legal reasons, I can't say anything until the first quarter, and we'll talk about that. But much like New York, when we started in New York, we really spent before we opened the Alexandria Center for Life Science in 2010, we had started an effort in New York back in 2001 as part of Sandy Wild's effort to bring commercial life science to New York City, where none literally existed. And I would say the same is true of Texas. Literally, no real presence of commercial life science down there today, but our intent is to create a market and really bring early-stage commercial life science to Texas, much like we did in New York. So with that, hopefully, long-winded answer. Operator : The next question comes from Jamie Feldman of Bank of America. Jamie Feldman : Alexandria recently put out a press release saying that you\u2019re the number 1 most active corporate investor in biopharma in terms of new deal volume, and I believe it was for the last 5 years. I just want to get your thoughts on your appetite for investment now. Our economists are calling for 7 rate hikes this year, fed funds for hikes this year and more next year. I want to get your thoughts on both what \u2013 how ARE thinks about putting capital to work in a rising rate environment and just what your sense is of deal flow and capital raising we\u2019ll see in biotech and biopharma in this environment? Joel Marcus : Yes, Jamie. Thanks for your question. It\u2019s a really good question. So remember, and I said in my earnings commentary just a few minutes ago, the industry is not a cyclical industry. The mature companies have large amounts of revenue and operate at scale and aren\u2019t really influenced by the cyclicality in any way quite like the very interest rate sensitive industries are. So that\u2019s number one.  Number two, you have to remember that this industry, hopefully, the compression time for bringing new therapies to market to address so many really terrible things that we don\u2019t currently have therapies for \u2013 takes a number of years. It\u2019s not like tech where you can create a software program and bring it out instantaneously. So when we met and began our work with Moderna was 2011, that was a pretty tough year, as I recall. We were just getting our investment grade rating. As I remember, Steve, I always said we didn\u2019t have a single tour at Mission Bay for maybe 18 months and the capital markets were pretty, pretty bleak. So we think long term. So investing now for the future, there\u2019s \u2013 this is a good time to do it especially as Peter said, the new modalities will change the face of, I think, health care of the future. So we\u2019re very bullish on that. And I\u2019m not sure what more I can say, but interest rates and the economy really are \u2013 you have to obviously pay attention. We\u2019re very mindful. We certainly lived through a number of ups and downs, the \u201899, 2000 tech bust and then the \u201808, \u201809 financial meltdown. So we\u2019re pretty judicious about what we do and how we do it, but we\u2019re out there looking for the next Moderna\u2019s. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And have you sensed the change in the market \u2013 competitive investment market, given the pullback we\u2019ve seen in the stocks? I know it hasn\u2019t been very long, but any\u2026 Joel Marcus : For sure. I mean, yes, the \u2013 it certainly is well recognized that the public markets have had major adjustments in valuations over the last, say, 3 quarters. I think that\u2019s starting to leak into the private market because a number of companies who have clinical programs are selling at cash, which is a bargain today. So investors are looking at those with big appetites. So I think you\u2019ll see some of that froth go out of the private markets. My guess is you\u2019re seeing the same thing on the tech side as well. Public markets are resetting valuations in the private markets. But truly great companies are going to get funded. There\u2019s a huge amount of venture that\u2019s been raised over the past couple of years, gigantic amounts, historic amounts. And those are investable dollars for the coming handful of years that those aren\u2019t running out anytime soon. Jamie Feldman : So in terms of demand for your portfolio, do you think it will be a noticeable change or no? Joel Marcus : Well, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll be able to repeat the high watermark of 9.5 million square feet for 2021 on over 4 million square feet for 4Q. But as I think Peter and Steve has said, we have a huge wind at our back. We\u2019ve got over 850 innovative tenants most of whom we service for their current demand and future growth. So we\u2019re pretty comfortable about where we are. And certainly, our value creation pipeline super highly leased. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re at risk, but we\u2019re mindful. I mean, if Russia invades the Ukraine, then things are going to change pretty rapidly for everybody, right? Operator : The next question comes from Rich Anderson of SMBC Nikko. Rich Anderson : So earlier on the call, I was -- I think, Joel, you mentioned had this incredible quarter and year of leasing and that you'll take another look at guidance, not making any commitments, of course, the following quarter. But is it not true that you -- when you issued your guidance in the -- on December 1st, you had already seen what was happening at that point? Or it was part of what you're reporting today, a surprise to you even from the beginning of December, hence, you could have like an earn-in type of event for 2022 as the success in the fourth -- late part of fourth quarter rolls into the coming year? Joel Marcus : Well, I think I'll let Dean answer that, but I think the commentary is we try to be conservative with how we project the future until we start to see things roll out, December was a record-breaking leasing year. We have a good amount of leasing on the precipice of happening. And I think we feel pretty good we gave a range, and I think you'll see us go forward in the first quarter and give you a fulsome update.  But Dean, do you want to make any comments on that? Dean Shigenaga : Yes. Maybe just to somewhat reiterate what you said, Joel, Rich, the way to think about it, we had good tailwinds behind us last year -- this time last year, as we started '21, and we were able to outperform a lot of our underlying guidance assumptions, including overall bottom line FFO per share. We're off to a great start at the very beginning of 2022 with good tailwinds behind us. So we're pretty optimistic, but stay tuned, I guess. Rich Anderson : I guess the answer is record December, which didn't happen until after the earnings Investor Day. So next question, maybe to Peter. You mentioned the $906 per square foot valuation on the stock. Can you kind of book in that for me? Because there are few ways to skin that analysis depending on what you have in the denominator. So is there a high and low end range depending on some of the assumptions you put into that math? Peter Moglia : It's the same back of the napkin formula we used a while back when I was commenting on this kind of once the stock implied per foot doesn't match up with our asset sales. And you just take our total market cap at the close -- or I'm sorry, at the end of the year of about $39.5 billion and then you take out our CIP from our developments, our venture assets and our cash and restricted cash, and that gives you the estimated value of our properties divided by our operating square footage. So that's plus or minus, I'm sure, it's not completely specific, but it's in the ballpark. Even if it was way off, there's still a huge disconnect. Rich Anderson : And then following on the investment side for you. When you -- a lot of times when you guys make acquisitions, there is a component of operating assets and very often a future development or redevelopment opportunity to your credit. When you -- would you allocate total cost to those types of transactions that have kind of multiple layers of opportunity in them? How do you do that? I mean is there a rule of thumb of how much the operating assets get versus the development assets in a given transaction? I'm just curious how that -- how we should think about that? Peter Moglia : Yes. So Dean, maybe -- Dean Shigenaga : Yes, Rich. I wish there was a simple answer to help for your modeling. But as you can imagine, every transaction is very unique and specific. And the component of operating relative to value creation is also very unique. So there's nothing general that I could guide you towards. We did include, though, for modeling in our acquisition disclosures, in the footnote there, there is a breakdown of how much NOI was brought on board for the current quarter acquisitions and the exact date on a weighted average basis that, that was added for the fourth quarter. So at least you have the NOI to model, but the basis is much harder to get to, Rich. Operator : Next question comes from Manny Korchman of Citi. Michael Bilerman : It\u2019s Michael Bilerman here with Manny. Peter, I wanted to come back on this valuation question, and I recognize this is a drum that you beat for a little while as the stock has traded below where you\u2019ve been able to sell assets and certainly where private market values are. How do you think about \u2013 the last 2 years, you\u2019ve issued, I think it\u2019s about 30% of your share base, clearly a pretty significant discounts to what you perceive market to be?  You\u2019re obviously investing that capital accretively into highly pre-leased development and redevelopment as well as acquisitions. But at some point, if your view is that the stock should be worth significantly more than illustrating today, you\u2019re issuing that equity at a massive discount. Hence, you need the things you\u2019re investing in to offset the dilution that you\u2019re putting on the company from issuing at such a low value below what you think NAV is. So can you just sort of step back from it because if you had issued 5% of your share base, it\u2019s 1 thing, but you\u2019ve issued 30% over the last 2 years. So how do you sort of put all that together as you\u2019re thinking about capital allocation and raising? Joel Marcus : Yes. So maybe, Dean, do you want to comment on that first and maybe let Peter give color. Dean Shigenaga : Sure, Joel. So Michael, I think what you described at a super high level, generally has been a challenge that the growing company like Alexandria has faced. As you know, as we grow cash flows pretty consistently quarter-to-quarter take the macro environment way, our stock price should be higher the next quarter. If we wait too long to use stock then we have an equity overhang. So I think \u2013 what we\u2019ve tried to do, Michael, is to be balanced here. I think Peter\u2019s commentary from time to time is just to highlight the opportunity on the stock price performance. Hopefully, it catches the attention of investors. While we do our job to execute the business and do it as best we can to grow cash flows in a prudent way and fund it in a reasonable way with both debt equity as well as proceeds from dispositions. So yes, I think on average, we\u2019ve done a pretty good job being mindful of that overall challenge and opportunity in front of us. We are making money as we invest our capital at the price points that we have raised both debt equity as well as recycling capital from dispositions. So there\u2019s a balance we need to navigate that I think you\u2019re pointing out. Joel Marcus : Yes. So Dean, could you maybe just highlight the historical equity level to say a lot of -- Dean Shigenaga : Yes, that\u2019s important, too. And Michael, you might remember this from Investor Day, we had touched on just looking back at how much equity do we \u2013 common equity do we use to fund our growth. We all know that at our leverage profile at a stabilized basis, an asset might require 65-plus percent of equity, the remainder being debt funded. And if you compare that to what we\u2019ve done historically, we\u2019re actually only using about 40% to 42% of common equity to fund growth. And what that\u2019s highlighting is tremendous cash flow is being reinvested in the business, which for $22 million is north of $300 million, but we\u2019re also taking advantage of recycling capital from high-value, low cap rate partial interest transactions and then EBITDA growth gives us some incremental benefit as well. So I think that also just highlights that we\u2019re being very disciplined in our approach, trying to minimize the amount of common equity we issue while being mindful. We want to keep our balance sheet in a super strong position. Michael Bilerman : Yes. And I get all those things and certainly tapping the asset sales and joint ventures over the last number of years has been another source of capital, but you\u2019ve also enlarged your acquisition opportunities, both development as well as straight transactions. And it just strikes me that sometimes, Peter, when you get on and you say we\u2019re a bargain or a bargain and throwing out $1,500 a foot, I think people start to really try to get into your head of, what do you perceive in to be \u2013 we recognize the most recent sales are indicative of where the market is for life sciences, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what you\u2019re trying to guide people towards that your entirety of your portfolio is worth $1,500 a foot and every $100 per foot is, call it, almost $20 a share of NAV. So trading at $900, what is the value that you have in your mind? You must have a sense of when you\u2019re issuing \u2013 a couple of weeks ago, right, you issued $1.7 billion at 186. You must have had a view whether that equity in your view, is worth 250. Is it 275? Are you saying it -- Joel Marcus : Yes. I think, Michael, the point of that is we were at an all-time high, and we felt very comfortable in taking the market risk of issuing equity, especially before a pretty \u2013 what\u2019s likely to shape up is a pretty volatile year. NAV is a little bit like beauty. It\u2019s in the minds of the beholder. And I think that we felt at that point, we were very comfortable issuing equity at that level. Let\u2019s just put that point to rest. Michael Bilerman : Yes, I was just trying to get to understand how the company thinks about is cost. The cost of equity and when it puts into what you\u2019re using it for, just how you\u2019re thinking about the accretion dilution from that, especially if you\u2019re telling investors that the stock is cheap. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of how you thought about it -- Joel Marcus : I didn\u2019t say that, Peter giving a view on an asset-by-asset basis, but at an all-time high, issuing the equity we did. We felt very good about what we\u2019re doing and the accretive uses we could put that equity too. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Carroll of RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll : So I wanted to dive into the leasing stats a little bit. I know volumes were pretty high in the fourth quarter, both in the operating and the development portfolios. In the operating portfolio, I'm trying to connect the dots with the strong volume, but occupancy dipped albeit very slightly. Is this in part due to leases being signed but not yet commenced or is it explained by the lease extensions that Dean mentioned in his prepared remarks? Joel Marcus : I think it's primarily acquisitions, but Dean, you could comment. Dean Shigenaga : So the acquisitions have been driving almost every quarter, face rate declines in reported occupancy. But if you strip that out, Michael, pretty consistently every quarter or 2, we're driving growth in overall occupancy. As an example, we highlighted in 2021, we had a 100 basis point increase in occupancy, if you exclude vacancy from recently acquired properties. And I think I highlighted in my commentary that we do expect, if you put any future acquisitions to decide that we can't model because we're not aware of them, we're expecting 150 basis point growth in occupancy in 2022. And I would suspect that given the tailwinds for our business and our portfolio here, that could continue looking out beyond '22 as well. Michael Carroll : Okay. No, great. That makes a lot of sense. And also, I like the new disclosure, at least the highlight disclosure that about 63% of your operating properties are in mega campuses. I mean, is there a way to quantify the importance of having these larger campuses? Do those buildings in these campuses drive stronger revenue growth and buildings outside of those campuses? Joel Marcus : Yes. I think if you remember back to Investor Day, Dan gave a specific example in San Diego, where our mega campus leasing effort was substantially above on a lease rate above a nearby building, which was owned by another REIT and demonstrated that is just kind of a sheer apples-to-apples. And 1 of the reasons it makes a big difference is because it provides not only the highly amenities and tailored services and facilities for tenants, but it gives them a space for growth right now, but a path for future growth in our industry today, that's kind of mission-critical. Michael Carroll : Great. And then, Joel, within the development pipeline, I guess do you have the percentage of the buildings that further build out your existing campuses or create new campuses? Joel Marcus : We do. I don't think we have that in any specific disclosure place. But if we go campus by campus, clearly, we do. Operator : Next question comes from Tom Catherwood of BTIG. Tom Catherwood : Steve, I appreciate your commentary on the new supply in your markets and demand is obviously strong, given record leasing volumes this quarter and year. With that said, though, can you provide some additional color on the demand in your markets and maybe how that demand is split between your core and emerging clusters if you have that information? Stephen Richardson : Yes. Tom, it\u2019s Steve here. Certainly, on the demand side, and we\u2019ve said this now probably for a couple of years that it is broad-based in each of our core clusters. So it\u2019s not just 1 or 2 clusters with a proportion contribution. So Joel touched on what\u2019s happening on a research triangle, that\u2019s very encouraging, very healthy demand in Maryland and Seattle as well. And then certainly, San Diego, San Francisco and Greater Boston, very healthy there. So on the demand side, absolutely broad-based, and we continue to see that going forward in the future as well. Tom Catherwood : Makes sense. And given that you\u2019ve added some of these emerging or new cluster locations, is it a case of, if you build it, they will come where you\u2019ve seen demand move as you have moved? Or has the demand kind of remained consistent from before and now after you\u2019re in those markets as well? Stephen Richardson : Yes. I\u2019m not sure I would characterize it as new markets, Tom. I think what we\u2019ve done is either 1 double down literally in our core markets. I mean, look at 325 Binney as an example, here in Cambridge. Certainly, what\u2019s happened. Peter referenced the projects down in San Diego and Tory Pines. And then the second aspect of it is really expanding through adjacent expansions, but no real kind of new greenfield core markets as we\u2019ve talked about this broad-based demand. Tom Catherwood : Got it. Makes sense. And last one for me. In the summit, you laid out next, I think, 11 developments and redevelopments that are slated to start over the next 6 quarters and their 89% leased store negotiation. Outside of those, are there others that could commence in the same time frame if pre-leasing gets done? Or are you kind of limited by entitlements or design or local approvals? Dean Shigenaga : Tom, it\u2019s Dean here. There are projects beyond that 2.6 million square feet that is currently disclosed at 89% lease negotiating. So those are the projects that could start over the next 6 quarters. In addition, to be real clear here, we expect the potential for other starts. But we just wanted to highlight in these disclosures here that we\u2019ve got a very active pipeline under either leased or advanced negotiations. It just highlights how much we\u2019re working closely with our relationships to meet their current and future space needs. Operator : Next question comes from Vikram Malhotra of Mizuho. Vikram Malhotra : Just maybe 2 questions. First, just on -- just pricing power across your markets. You've referenced really good rent spreads seems like they're sustainable given your guidance. But I'm wondering if you can just talk about how we think about the sustainability of these spreads maybe from 2 different perspectives. One, just in your view, what's sort of the mark-to-market of the portfolio today in your various clusters, but also just maybe top down, can you talk about just what life science tenants are paying in rent as a percent of their own revenue? Is there just an elongated runway, given where that is today? Joel Marcus : Yes. So the answer to your first question, I think, Steve addressed. Generally, on a mark-to-market basis, the portfolio would be about 31% up. So that gives you a good sense of how that would play out. And then when you look at life science companies, pharma, biopharma, small, medium, rent is generally a smaller part of -- I think, Steve or Peter, you guys may have the stats, but a fairly small part of the overall G&A, whereas if you go to service companies, law firms, securities firms, it's a much larger part. But I don't know, Steve or Peter, do you have that percentage in mind? It's sub-5%, I believe. Stephen Richardson : Well, for our large cap bio and pharma companies, it's actually 1% to 2%. And then the kind of the mid-cap is in the 5% to 6% range. Vikram Malhotra : Okay. That's helpful. And then just to clarify on some of your newer developments or in general, 1 of your office peers, I should say, referencing kind of a lot of demand even for life science assets from other categories, tech, especially, given the need for newer buildings and amenities. Are you seeing just unsolicited interest from just other groups given sort of where your buildings are? Joel Marcus : Yes. We've seen that for a decade or more. I mean, Steve, maybe just a tutorial on Mission Bay for a moment, which is kind of where a lot of this started. Stephen Richardson : Sure. Yes. In Mission Bay, might know, we had a significant influx of technology with Uber establishing a 4-building million square foot campus there. So the combination of not only UCSF as a center of learning there, but waterfront location. Now the Chase Center really did make that very desirable for technology companies -- and a lot of those other elements are true when you look at all of the attributes of our mega campuses in San Diego, Seattle, certainly Cambridge and Greater Boston as well. So -- and then you have -- and Joel mentioned this too, you've got the integration of science and technology, really spawning new companies and new growth, and those are all happening in each of our clusters. Operator : Our last question comes from Dave Rodgers of Baird. Dave Rodgers : Joel, I just wanted to ask about New York. Most of my other questions were answered. With the New York cluster, I know over time, you\u2019ve talked about it in kind of the long-term development track for some of these clusters. I think historically, demand was 1 side but also crowding out of investment capital in things in New York City was an impact on that particular cluster. With a weaker New York City office market. Are you seeing either more tenants interested? Or are you seeing more capital or ARE more interested in kind of moving more aggressively in New York to take advantage of the weak office market like you see maybe in San Diego or is that just not really a foot? Joel Marcus : Yes. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s happening. I think we won the RFP for the first commercial life science campus in 2005 under Mayor Bloomberg\u2019s direction. We delivered our first building in 2010. And at that point, there was only a single commercial 1 incubator up in the northwest side of Manhattan that had commercial life science tenants. And that was it. Everything else was clinical, academic, but not commercial. And so over the past decade, we\u2019ve built New York. We have our campus today over 800,000 square feet, and we have the prospect of going significantly more. We\u2019ve got some 60-plus companies there, only 1 of which really existed before we started the campus in the city. And so the New York City market is still \u2013 it\u2019s a small company market. It\u2019s a small market. We felt that it was a good one to enter because of our cluster model and the drivers. But if you look at last year, there were only about 250,000 square feet of new leases. So in Boston, that\u2019s probably a day\u2019s work. So you have to look at it with respect to all of the clusters. And it still is \u2013 it\u2019s a 25-year gestation period, as I\u2019ve said, to build a cluster. And we\u2019re just now entering the second decade. So New York has got a long way to go. And over the past couple of years, New York has been a tough slog with crime and civil disturbances and things like that. So that\u2019s been a challenge. Big companies aren\u2019t going to go to New York, New York State because of high taxes. So it remains a small company market. We\u2019re committed, and you build it from the ground up. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks. Joel Marcus : Well, thank you, everybody. We look forward to updating you on our first quarter call. Be safe. Take care. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation and you may now disconnect.",

Joel Marcus : Thank you, Paula, and welcome, everybody, to today's call, April 26, 2022, previewing or highlighting our first quarter. And I want to also let everybody know with me today are Dean Shigenaga, Peter Moglia and Stephen Richardson. I want to make a shout-out happy birthday to someone very special listening here today. I want to welcome and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call, and want to wish everyone got blessings and just watching the war in Ukraine gives us pause to appreciate everything we have. The good to great author, Jim Collins has spoken about Alexandria. We have achieved 3 outputs that define a great company : superior results, distinctive impact and lasting endurance. And I want to congratulate the entire Alexandria family team on a first quarter earnings performance really by all metrics exemplifying Alexandria exceptionalism at its finest. Our -- in fact, as Jim Collins said, our superior performance.  I want to thank the entire family team as well for what they do each and every day for this mission-driven company, profoundly committed to driving forward our distinctive impact approach to address some of society's most pressing challenges through our long-standing bedrock social responsibility pillars.  As Jim said, our distinctive impact, and we have worked in these pillars, accelerating ground breaking research, medical research, harnessing the agro food ecosystem to combat hunger, empowering underserved students to achieve long-term success, bolstering the resilience of our military, conquering the opioid epidemic, building a model for comprehensive and sustainable solutions to address homelessness, one of our newest programs, addressing the mental health crisis with a focus on helping children cope with suicide loss, another new focus, and supporting museums to preserve our history and honor our greatest heros, also a new focused pillar. I want to also share that next month, May 2022, we'll celebrate our 25th anniversary of Alexandria's initial public offering since our IPO in 1997, we've maintained the highest standards of excellence and continue to drive long-term value for our stockholders, significantly outperforming major indices and companies. With the total shareholder return through the end of the year from '97 of 2,532%, which has beat the NASDAQ average for that time of 1,291%, we'd beat Warren Buffett at Berkshire during that time at 953%, the MSCI REIT index, all REIT index at 939%, the S&P 500 for that time frame, 790%, the Russell 721% and the FTSE NAREIT Office Index at 552%. As Jim Collins said, Alexandria is lasting endurance. I want to move to the first quarter, characterized by Alexandria's preserving its very strong core, while stimulating strong and continuing future growth. Alexandria continues to have pricing power in each of our core markets. As Dean will talk about, our very strong NOI growth in the first quarter and out of a sense of conservatism, we raised our midpoint of our guidance $0.02 given the macro environment. But on the other hand, we have very strong conviction for the coming 3 quarters of 2022 and the delivery of strong NOI growth, both internally and especially from our stellar external value creation pipeline. Steve will highlight our second highest leasing quarter in the company's history, and Alexandria continues to experience the strengths across each and every one of our markets here in our overall portfolio. Dean will highlight our very strong same-store performance and increased guidance as we continue to see positive occupancy gains and strong rental rate growth. With our extreme attention to each and every detail of our unique and special life science real estate business, we're seeing modest increases in our development yields as well as we're highly focused on tightly managing all aspects of our business with a tough macro environment and with rising recession risks. Today reminds me of 1979 with government policies failing the American people.  Alexandria has been very focused on tenant quality, and 50% of our annual rental revenue is from investment-grade or publicly-traded large cap tenants. I think it's pretty amazing that Alexandria's tenants have made an astounding -- have made astounding progress in developing groundbreaking medicines. 48% of FDA novel therapy approvals have been granted to Alexandria tenants since 2017, almost half of all approvals.  The life science industry has seen the explosion of biotech over the last -- over the past decade from 2013 to 2021, with fund flows up generally 5x historical averages, advancing broadly innovative pipelines for large unmet medical needs. And every one of us knows either a family member, a friend who suffers from some form of disease still not treatable effectively with today's medicines.  The move in inflation starting in the first quarter of '21. Now we're 5 quarters into it, coupled with the myriad of problematic U.S. policies and macro threats have ended that boom. And over the last 5 quarters, what has emerged are the haves and have not. They have not or a range of small and mid-cap biotech companies with programs that are preclinical as well as many are in the clinic have seen their values drop and the open markets of the last 9 years, by and large, are closed. The haves are large biotech as well as biotechs that have reached commercial stage together with big pharma and are as flush with cash as ever being estimated to be over $500 billion of available immediate cash. Alexandria's tenant selection has been a cornerstone of our unique business model, and has enabled us to select and grow with the best and highest quality and most innovative tenants, one of the absolute bedrocks of our -- really our business model.  And with that, let me turn it over to Steve for some details on the quarter on the growth side. Stephen Richardson : Thank you, Joel, and good afternoon, everybody. Steve Richardson here. As we bring Q1 2022 to a close, I'd like to highlight 2 critical factors driving the continued momentum and success of Alexandria. One is the demand for Alexandria's unique and highly differentiated facilities. Operational excellence services and mega campus offerings continues at a very COVID and post-COVID level, with leasing during Q1 totaling 2.5 million square feet. And within that total, 1.4 million square feet in our development and redevelopment pipeline. This activity is the second highest quarterly leasing volume in company history in each of these 2 categories following historically high leasing during 2021 and particularly Q4 2021.  And two, importantly, the exceptional quality and long-term nature of Alexandria's leasing results overall and especially this quarter, is truly noteworthy in 1 to double underline. We signed a long-term lease for a ground-up Class A laboratory office flagship facility comprising 427,000 rentable square feet with Bristol-Myers Squibb a company with a market cap of $164 billion as they chose Alexandria to design, build and operate their mission-critical innovative research hub at our Campus Point Mega campus.  Let me just say that this type of outcome is the result of Alexandria's historic pioneering efforts in establishing the life science asset class, we started working with BMS during 1998 some 24 years ago and began building trust and confidence at every level of the organization. Bristol-Myers Squibb is now our top tenant and present in 5 of Alexandria's core clusters, a truly unique partnership and a distinct and compelling competitive advantage. The entirety of Alexandria's brand value and BMS's decision to select Alexandria was crystallized with this inspiring achievement. First, a deep and meaningful trusted and mutually respectful historical relationship with further cemented. Second, the unique ability to scale a facility featuring design and infrastructure was realized; and third, a marquee destination at campus point with a highly curated and first-class suite of amenities to meet BMS's imperative and to retain and recruit the absolute best talent sets a new mega campus gold standard.  We also signed this quarter another Class A plus laboratory office facility comprising 334,000 rentable square feet at our Seaport campus with Eli Lilly, a company with a market cap of $280 billion, for their state-of-the-art Institute for genetic medicine. Eli Lilly is a similarly exceptional story. Our teams first worked with Lilly during 2000, and embarked upon a journey together to create world-class laboratory office facilities in 5 of our core clusters as well as the Lilly's team pursues its cutting-edge research. The foundational work during these past 22 years provided a bedrock of trust, and enabled our teams to envision the profoundly positive impact upon Lilly's ability to compete for the best and brightest scientific and entrepreneurial talent in the greater Boston cluster, with a premier high-visibility waterfront site offering expansion optionality, adjacency to transit and unparalleled amenities in an iconic design certain to be a landmark for generations. These are showcase examples of Alexandria's formidable and irreplaceable position deeply embedded within the life science ecosystem. The strength of our internal growth engine is unassailable. We have now more than 1,000, tenants providing us with unmatched insight into not only their current and future space needs, but more importantly, the ability to stay ahead of the curve to deliver sophisticated operational expertise for these mission-critical facilities and curate the precise amenity mix to drive the holistic recruiting and retention of talent platform essential to these innovative company's success. These leasing accomplishments are a testament to the entirety of the Alexandria team's passion, commitment and unwavering work ethic towards our shared mission. And the continued demand for our facilities is also borne out by the following stellar results, growth within the core provides critical and immediate value to the company with impressive renewal and re-leasing spreads of 23.2% cash and 39.8% GAAP when excluding the block of short-term swing space for BMS as we begin construction on their flagship facility noted earlier. The portfolio mark-to-market remains strong at approximately 30%, and as we noted on the last quarterly call, this is significantly greater than the mark-to-market of 17% at the end of Q4 2020. Accounts receivable for and again, huge kudos to our best-in-class operations team. Early renewals for this quarter were 51%, somewhat below our historic rate, but a clear sign that our tenant base continues to actively seek to lock down their valuable laboratory office facilities. Healthy demand is also evidenced by the exceptional health of Alexandria's value creation pipeline.  As mentioned earlier, the 1.4 million square feet in the pipeline is the second highest total in the company's history and further contributed to the highly derisked nature of the pipeline as 77% of this 8 million square feet, which is projected to generate $665 million of incremental revenue, is leased or negotiating. Peter will provide additional detail and color on the pipeline during his comments as well. Moving on to supply and demand. Demand overall, as we highlighted during Investor Day back in December and on the Q4 '21 earnings call and now on this call, for Alexandria's mega campus continues. And our irreplaceable set of relationships and central role in the life science ecosystem positions us very well to engage and secure the very best innovative companies in the country. Market supply. We continue to monitor market supply in a granular level, including the actual assets, the operators and the capital sources behind potential projects. When we look at 2022, important to note that the vacancy rates are very low in each of our 3 largest clusters and the overall new supply is either leased or adding very incrementally, say, 1% or so in our key markets.  In 2023, projects that are actually -- and I want to emphasize actually under construction are much more modest, say 25% of what various broker reports might indicate as those reports include planned or proposed projects. The 2023 deliveries are again either leased or contributing just 3% to 4% of availability to the total market size, which will likely be further reduced during the coming quarters. And in 2024 and beyond, in these 3 markets, there are no projects actually under construction with delivery dates in this time frame. Yes, there are a number of planned or proposed projects or dirt being moved around, but we'll have to see if the operators, and more importantly, the capital partners behind these projects actually commit significant capital to the projects on a purely speculative basis to their often time inexperienced development operators. And let me finish the supply summary with a reminder of the significant difference and highly valued difference by quality life science tenants between Alexandria's Class A plus facilities as part of our fully amenitized mega campuses and one-off buildings in commodity locations. So in conclusion, the first quarter of 2022 was a very strong quarter and positions the company very well to drive immediate and long-term value through our core operating base as well as our substantially lease negotiating 8 million square foot REIT-leading development, redevelopment pipeline. With that, I'll hand it off to Peter. Peter Moglia : Thank you, Steve. I'm going to update you all on the value creation pipeline, discuss the continuation of construction costs and supply chain macro issues and comment on the 100 Binney disposition. Leveraging our unique market industry insights and the proven expertise of our best-in-class team, our value creation pipeline is tactically broadening our core clusters to meet the needs of our world-class tenant roster. Reflecting the continuing strong demand referenced in Steve's comments, and our ability to capture it due to our trusted brand, AAA locations, inspiring aesthetics, operational excellence, curated amenities and capability to elevate the tenant experience, our value creation pipeline of projects that are either under construction or expected to commence construction in the next 6 quarters has increased to 8 million square feet that is projected to add more than $665 million in annual rental revenue, primarily commencing from the second quarter of this year through the first quarter of '25, a $55 million increase over what was discussed last quarter. As of quarter end, 77% of this remarkable pipeline was either leased or under negotiation, which means we have an executed LOI. With an astounding 94% of the activity coming from existing relationships, highlighting the incredible loyalty to our stellar brand. Our tenant base is an award for talent and recognize that space at an Alexandria's campus is mission-critical in that fight. Without question, our ability to offer our tenant-based scalability and comprehensive amenity offerings through our mega campuses is a truly unique differentiator and why Alexandria is the clear choice to provide mission-critical facilities to the life science industry's most innovative and successful companies. During the first quarter, we delivered 566,655 square feet from 10 projects located in 8 different submarkets, reflecting the diversity of our pipeline made possible by strong demand across all regions. The deliveries provide strong GAAP yields at approximately 6.7%, translating to approximately $36.1 million of annual NOI. Alexandria's tremendous execution on our value creation pipeline represents a key component of our compelling growth engine, and an example of this is the extraordinary job our highly seasoned development teams are doing in managing cost escalations and supply chain disruptions that continue to proliferate throughout the construction industry. Approximately a year ago, in our first quarter call for 2021, we included commentary on construction cost trends because construction cost inflation was anticipated to be outsized due to double demand for materials and labor caused by the simultaneous restart of paused and new projects, combined with shortages in materials and labor due to closing of mills and fabrication shops, weather events and the loss of workers who migrated to different careers. It was all expected to be transitory, and even last quarter, we noted expectations for things to start normalizing in 2023. However, war, COVID in China and transportation issues have become the latest antagonist in the story and reversed any thoughts to the near-term stabilization. The war in Ukraine's biggest impact on construction costs is an astronomical increase in fuel costs. Sustainability experts will tell you that the embedded carbon of constructing a building is equal to the carbons used to operate the building for 30 years, much of it coming from fuel earned by the trucks delivering materials to the site and the machinery that produces the earthwork on the build.  In addition to fuel, the war has reduced the supply of critical semiconductor materials such as palladium and nickel, exacerbating the chip shortage, which affects such things as building control systems and emergency generators, the latter of which can now take up to a year to deliver. Other raw materials that come from the area are used to make certain metals like aluminum and contributing to their inflation. Transportation issues proliferate throughout the economy and construction is no exception. If you spend any time on a construction job site, you will marvel at the amount of coordination that needs to take place as trucks come in and out of the job delivering materials or hauling things away. In addition to the cost of fuel, inflationary pressures coming from an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 trucker shortage emanating from outdated compensation models and the allure of last-mile delivery companies reducing the pool of candidates. In addition to trucking, we're keeping our eye on labor negotiations for over 22,000 dock workers on the West Coast. The deadline to reach an agreement is July 30. And if they strike, it could place pressure on alternative ports and further delay delivery of materials. Specific material problems today include steel, copper and aluminum, roofing materials, elevators, HVAC equipment, switch gear, transformers and emergency generators. Materials and equipment are both expensive and tough to get. Many of these items take twice as long to get than in normal times and continue to go up in price by double digits. Rest assured, we are tightly managing these conditions.  As mentioned last quarter, the biggest asset we have to leverage is our decades of experience in developing purpose-built laboratory buildings, enabling us to mitigate delays. Currently, approximately 82% of our costs, or development and redevelopment projects, aggregating to 5.4 million square feet are subject to guaranteed maximum or other contracts that enable us to mitigate the risk of inflation. We have contingencies behind those contracts to account for scope creep and unknowns. The other 18% is from projects that are currently pending guaranteed maximum contracts that are in process, and those disclosures include larger contingency allowances. The voracious demand for high-quality life science assets in key cluster markets led to a highly competitive bid for our 100 Binney asset. Our excellent execution led to our third asset sold with a valuation exceeding $1 billion, and the fourth to achieve a sub-4% cap rate. We sold a 70% interest in the 432,932 square foot lab office building anchored with long-term credit tenants for a purchase price based on a total valuation of  through which we received proceeds exceeding $700 million. The cash cap rate was a record for our capital recycling program at 3.5% and enabled us to harvest a profit of approximately $410 million. The price per square foot of $2,356 exceeds the record price we set last quarter in the sale of 50 Binney to 60 Binney in by 3.7%, which is meaningful considering the uncertain interest rate environment we were and continue to be in during the quarter and the disruption caused by Russia's and Beijing of the Ukraine that happened on February 24. With that, I'll pass it over to Dean. Dean Shigenaga : Thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. We reported very strong operating and financial results for the first quarter of 2022, highlighting that we are off to a great start and on track for 8% plus growth in FFO per share. Now this is impressive considering the consistency of bottom-line growth year after year and following the historic year in 2021 of operating and financial performance and significant achievement of historic milestones. We reported first quarter 2022 revenues of $576.9 million or $2.3 billion annualized, up 24.4% over the first quarter of '21, and NOI was up 22.7% over the first quarter of '21, highlighting very strong growth and outstanding execution by our team. Bottom line, we beat consensus this quarter and raised our outlook for FFO per share growth to 8%. More on this in a moment. Alexandria has tremendous scale in key innovation cluster submarkets across the country that allows us to provide optionality for innovative life science entities looking for high-quality laboratory space from a trusted partner. We have a very high quality and diverse tenant roster consisting of over 1,000 tenants that provides Alexandria a unique and strong position to address current and expansion space requirements. We continue to reap the benefits from these attributes as shown in our continued strong operating and financial results. We generated a REIT industry-leading adjusted EBITDA margin of 71%, highlighting highly efficient execution by our team. Occupancy was up 70 basis points to 94.7% since December 31, and our team is on track to achieve our exceptional growth in occupancy by the end of 2022 of 150 basis points in comparison to 12/31/21. Now the key takeaway from our leasing activity in the first quarter beyond achieving the second highest leasing volume in the company's history, is that the strong rental rate growth in the first quarter of 39.8% and 23.2% was higher than the annual rental rate growth reported for the full year of 2021 and 2020. We are also on track to hit our very strong rental rate growth projections for 2022 ranging from 30% to 35% and 18% to 23% on a cash basis. Same-property NOI growth continues to benefit from strong demand from our tenants as they look to renew and expand with Alexandria. We reported same-property NOI growth of 7.6% and 7.3% on a cash basis. The primary driver of this exceptional performance was strong rental rate growth on renewals and re-leasing of space in recent quarters, a larger impact this quarter from a number of leases, and same-property NOI in the first quarter also benefited from 110 basis points in growth in occupancy. And for the full year of 2022, we expect a total of 150-basis-point increase in same-property occupancy. During the first quarter, $36 million of annual net operating income commenced on average on February 14 related to the 567,000 rentable square feet of development and redevelopment projects that were completed and placed into service, including a couple of projects that were completed earlier than projected. We completed acquisitions in the first quarter, aggregating 7.3 million square feet of development and redevelopment opportunities. Acquisitions in the first quarter also included some operating rentable square feet that added $75 million in annual net operating income that commenced on average on January 23. Now looking forward, our team has uniquely positioned Alexandria with excellent visibility of growth within the REIT industry with $665 million of incremental annual rental revenue to commence from the second quarter through the first quarter of '25. Now this represents significant year-over-year growth in net operating income for 2022, 2023 and 2024, from deliveries of development and redevelopment projects for the next 12 quarters. This represents 8 million rentable square feet that is 77% leased under advanced lease negotiation or subject to an executed LOI.  We are pleased to have a super strong and flexible balance sheet, with credit ratings that rank in the top 10% of the REIT industry. As of March 31, we had $5.7 billion of liquidity, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA is forecasted to be 5.1x by the end of the year, representing a slight improvement from 5.2x as of the beginning of 2022. And our fixed charge coverage ratio is expected to be very solid at greater than or equal to 5.1x. And we remain disciplined with our strategy for long-term funding our business, with a focus on maximizing bottom line growth, maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet and reinvesting capital from real estate dispositions and partial interest sales and intend to minimize the issuance of common stock. A typical operating property at stabilization of NOI for Alexandria would generally require long-term funding with 35% to 40% debt and 60% to 65% equity capital.  Now the 60% to 65% amount of equity capital is much higher than Alexandra's average common equity issuances over the past 5 years, which has ranged roughly between 40% and 45% of our capital plan. The key reason for a lower amount of common stock issuances is due to the significant amount of value we monetize through real estate sales and partial interest sales for reinvestment into our business. Importantly, common stock issuances for 2022 is projected to be lower than the 5-year average of 45% of our capital plan due to the continued execution of real estate sales, both 100% outright sales and partial interest sales. Now as Peter Moglia highlighted, 100 Binney Street achieved a record $1 billion valuation based upon the partial interest sale of 70% of the property. We generated almost 140% profit on this development project that we built a handful of years ago, truly spectacular value creation and opportunity to reinvest capital back into our business.  We also have another advanced negotiation for a sale of approximately $350 million range, plus up to an additional $1.5 billion plus in real estate sales and partial interest sales targeted for the remainder of the year. We are very pleased with our very proactive and opportunistic bond offering consisting of $1.8 billion in 30-year and 12-year unsecured notes, with a weighted average rate of 3.28% in a term of 22 years. Now to put this into perspective, if we had to issue 10-year and 30-year unsecured notes today, the rate would be in the low 4% and mid-4% range, respectively. Importantly, we remain on track for continued improvement in our balance sheet and credit profile. Now realized gains included in FFO from venture investments were $23.1 million in the first quarter, and over the last 4 quarters were $104.4 million or $26.1 million per quarter. Unrealized losses this quarter were $264.4 million, reflecting a decline in fair value of venture investments. Importantly, unrealized gains in our venture investments were $533 million as of March 31. Our team continues with their journey and leadership in ESG. Our next annual ESG report will be released in a couple of months in June. Key ESG leadership highlights since year-end include Alexandria's ranked the number 5 . 685 Gateway located in our South San Francisco submarket, which is on track to achieve zero energy certification, was awarded and recognized for excellence in wood building design by Woodworks. Alexandria earned the first ever fit well life science certification at 300 Technology Square located at the Alexandria Technology Square mega campus in our Cambridge submarket.  We received lead platinum certification at 9080 Campus Point Drive, which is home to GredLabs, a dynamic proprietary platform purpose-built to accelerate the growth of promising life science companies. And our team is executing on the construction of what has been designed to be the most sustainable laboratory building located at 325 Binney Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Now strong operating and financial results for the first quarter supports our improved outlook for 2022, with EPS diluted ranging from $1.08 to $1.18 and FFO per share as adjusted diluted from a range from $8.33 to $8.43 up 8% plus over 2021 at the midpoint of guidance. Now we increased GAAP same-property NOI growth by 40 basis points to a range of 5.9% to 7.9%. Straight-line rent is up $4 million to a range from $154 million to $164 million, and we increased the upper range of guidance by $500 million for real estate sales and partial interest sales to a range from $1.3 billion to $2.6 billion. Please refer to Page 6 of our supplemental package for detailed underlying assumptions included in our outlook for the full year of 2022.  Thank you, and I'll turn it back to Joel. Joel Marcus : So with that, operator, if we could open it up to questions. Operator :  And our first question will come from Jamie Feldman of Bank of America. Jamie Feldman : So I guess just a big picture here. There's been a lot of concern on the biotech funding outlook in light of capital markets volatility. It's sort the CRO stocks at the life science stocks. Can you just give us your latest thoughts on how this might be impacting demand, the funding backdrop, any signs of weakness in areas? And then also, just thinking about leasing timing, are you seeing any delay in lease decision-making? Just how should we be thinking about reading the tea lease here? Joel Marcus : Yes, Jamie, thanks for the question. I think what I said in the prepared remarks is I think how you should frame the cornerstone and kind of bedrock demand situation; I think you've got haves and have not. So the have nots, as I said, our company's public companies by and large because most private companies are generally well financed and the venture firms have raised mountains of capital. So they've got pretty long runways. But I think people who've gone public and some of who went public too soon, are caught in a bit of a squeeze with cash burn, either if they're preclinical or somewhat into the clinic at various stages and maybe don't have early readouts of data. And so, for those, I think you can expect they will not be on track to expand. And in fact, some will contract and reduce their workforce and maybe their space. We've seen some of that in different markets. But I think it's fair to say that the haves are those companies that are the big cap companies, big pharma, plus the companies that have reached commercial stage are really very flush with cash, and we see no real change in growth trajectories of those companies plus many in the private side who've raised massive amounts of cash. So I think you're going to find that operators who have leased to, and I can think of 1 group in Boston who lease to a variety, thank goodness, not us, of course, lease in new construction, lease to a variety of companies that are in the clinical stage, they're seeing -- I can think of this 1 building, I won't say who the operator is, so I don't -- it's not in Cambridge, it's out in the burbs. But they're going to see many of their tenants either sublease or try to give space back. So I think it's a tale of 2 worlds and luckily, we're, I think, extremely well positioned in that. Hello, operator? Operator : Next question comes from Sheila McGrath of Evercore. Sheila McGrath : I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more detail on the partial sale where in-place rents might have compared to market and the weighted average lease term in that building? And was the pricing set before the shift in interest rates or just on the timing there? Joel Marcus : Yes. So Peter, do you want to handle that? Peter Moglia : Yes, sure. No, the pricing was set during the heat of everything, the war, interest rate volatility. So it is reflective of today's market conditions. The -- I don't know what the -- I don't have the  memorized, but just looking at the top 2 leases, it was very likely close to 10 years, probably maybe 9. So definitely a long time before you realize any upside. And there is upside there probably somewhere in the neighborhood of about 27%, 28%. The rents were overall below market. But again, I think the price is reflective of the fact that someone is going to have to live with that return for a while. The credit there was really good. So there's nothing to worry about. But it was a very fair price considering the amount of demand is looking for high-quality projects, and that was probably the most high-quality project anyone could have found this year. Joel Marcus : Yes. I mean, perfect tremendous location in the heart of Cambridge, brand-new construction more or less. And as Peter said, pretty good lease duration with very strong credit. So a real iconic, I think, investment. Sheila McGrath : Okay. That's great. And then just curious, inflation everybody, is talking about it. Wondering like when you look at new projects, would you consider most of your leases are with 3% escalators. Would you consider having a minimum with tied to inflation or that's just not the market? Joel Marcus : Yes. So I'll come in and then maybe ask Steve and Peter to comment. So over the history of Alexandria, we've kept kind of 2 approaches. One has been annual rental escalations, generally 3%, sometimes a little less, sometimes it's more, but average about 3%. And during different time periods, we have gone to a minimum, maximum of minimum 3 and max 6 based on CPI. We are involved in a number of negotiations where those -- both of those are being discussed, and you will likely see some of those over time. But I don't know, Peter or Steve, if you guys have any other color on that. Stephen Richardson : Yes. Joel, just to echo that, it's Steve, Sheila. That's exactly what we're doing. And we're being very targeted and thoughtful with the particular segments of the portfolio that we might do that for. So we think it's going to be very fair and reasonable. And so far, it's been understood and well received. So just at the beginning of the process here. Operator : The next question comes from Manny Korchman of Citi. Manny Korchman : Peter, maybe 1 for you. Just as you think about which assets you want to keep, you guys have used the term iconic when referring to 100 Binney, how do you think about keeping iconic assets versus selling iconic assets? And especially in a market like that, that is so supply constrained, part of me wants to say why not keep the longer-term upside there, and part of it is you're getting a 3.5% cap rate. So how do you weigh all that? Peter Moglia : Yes. I mean as you said on the latter part of your comments, I mean being able to take advantage of market conditions where you can get a sub-4 cap rate and then plug that back into your next iconic asset at a 6 plus, it's just -- it's hard not to do that. And remember, we are keeping a pretty material part of each of these assets that we're selling. We are also accrue fees. And so there's some operating leverage that we can achieve there. So it is -- you look at the market, you see what you can monetize at the best price. And you only make that decision, though, if you have opportunities to reinvest that in something that's special. And if you look at our development pipeline today, we think it is full of the next wave of iconic assets. So we don't want to get too in love with things that are legacy. We appreciate them. We, again, don't sell them in whole, but there are other frontiers for us to conquer, and such as the Fenway where we believe there's going to be an incredible rent growth and appreciation as well. So we need to get the cash to make those accretive investments, and we pick carefully, but strategically. Manny Korchman : And then maybe on that deal specifically, how much was about managing tenant risk, if at all, with selling BSM and then having new projects with BSM coming in at the same time. I'm sorry, the tenant risk with BMS? Was a bit about managing your Bristol-Myers exposure? Or did that not -- Joel Marcus : Not at all. Not at all. Operator : The next question comes from Rich Anderson of SMBC. Rich Anderson : So on the topic of dispositions, as much as $2.6 billion potentially this year. Last year, you had a whole lot of activity at the end of the year. year before, I think you did about $1 billion. So you're clearly identifying with some opportunities to raise capital in that format. But with rising interest rates and all that talk, do you think 2022 will be more of a ratable sort of level of dispositions across the year? Or do you think it could still be lumped towards the back half of the year, maybe in the sense of urgency to get some things done before just rates perhaps do play a role on cap rates? Joel Marcus : Dean, you want to -- Dean Shigenaga : Rich, maybe it's helpful to look back to last year, just to give some context to the late year transactions. And you might recall our commentary over the last few quarters. The reason why we had a number of transactions really weighted into December last year had everything to do with specific leases that were significant to the transactions being extended and it was super important to complete that before we went out and got deep in the marketing of the underlying asset for sale. And so a number of those transactions had that aspect, which delayed the transaction for execution until later in the year, but it was an important component to the valuation as well. So as you can imagine, important to get done. This year, we don't have that same issue across the transactions we're looking at today. So I think you'll see it be a little bit more spread out through the year than you did last year by far. We don't have those same challenges this year, Rich. Rich Anderson : Okay. Great. And, Joel, you mentioned your haves and have nots comment. But one name that jumped out to me when speaking internally with my -- our biotech team was a name like Novartis, which is kind of registers as 1 larger cap name in your top 10 that is seeing some significant layoffs. I'm curious if you guys have any comment about their situation specifically as it relates to demand? And any examples of larger cap names that despite your comments might also be considering some significant levels of employee reduction. Joel Marcus : Well, I mean, Novartis is one of the strongest, certainly, pharma companies in the world and certainly one of the strongest companies in the world. All companies of large size, as you know, from your long history in this industry go through rationalizations of different groups. I mean, Glaxo is an example, sold their oncology group at 1 point, which was a core, seemed to me to be kind of an odd thing to do. And then later on, essentially kind of restarted it. Different people are shuffling around different lines of businesses whether they be high-value ethical pharmaceuticals or more commodity-type products. So I think I would view that as having nothing to do with the the industry itself, the state of the industry at this point, but rather a rationalization of that company's own operations. And whenever you get a new CEO or a change, a number of these companies kind of shift focus. And so that's something else that you're seeing from time to time. But I wouldn't read anything into that in particular. Rich Anderson : Okay. And then real quick, Peter, I think, as you said -- or maybe it was even Joel that said development yields are modestly -- development yields are modestly up for you. I assume that's not a comment generally about the industry. So do you have a sense, based on all the things you talked about, about delays about how far down development yields have come for your competition, not so much you? Peter Moglia : Joel, do you want me to take that? Joel Marcus : Yes, please. Peter Moglia : Yes, Rich, the -- I think we -- just getting back to my comments, our team has done an incredible job in helping to mitigate cost escalations. And locking things in early. And so because of that and because of the rent growth that we've experienced in all of our markets, we've been able to marginally increase our yields, as Joel mentioned. I -- what other people are doing, I'm not sure. They don't -- certainly don't have the scale advantage that we have, the relationships that we have, probably not even close to the personnel we have. So I'd imagine that they wouldn't be able to do the same thing. Operator : Our next question comes from Dave Rodgers of Baird. Dave Rodgers : Just again, with your comments about maybe recession as well as the have not. Maybe this question is for Peter. Is there anywhere on the life science investment sales spectrum that's being impacted by those types of comments or by interest rates and spreads? And I guess I'm just trying to get a better understanding if there's other competitive assets where maybe we're just not seeing enough of a spread between what's trading, and any examples you might have off the top of your head? Peter Moglia : I can tell you, I mean I was looking at our comp database yesterday, just seeing what changed from quarter-to-quarter. There's -- a lot of things are still trading with the quality of tenancies completely all over the place, and things are getting for cap rates or more just a certain portfolio that BioMed sold in San Diego with a lot of cats and dogs was a sub-5 cap rate. So there is a lot of demand for exposure to life science assets. And so, unfortunately, for a number of investors, tenant quality probably hasn't been the focus. But we -- rest assured anyone who is looking at our portfolio, we -- our tenants are highly vetted and that doesn't become a question. It's more about the location and lease expiration. Tenant quality is usually soon to be great because it is. Dave Rodgers : And then maybe just 1 follow-up question. I don't hope this is for Dean or maybe Steve, but it looks like Apple and Alphabet joined the top tenant list. I don't know if that was a function of acquisitions or perhaps sales or just new leases there, but they had some shorter duration. So I was curious if those were added and if those were kind of intermediate term redevelopment opportunities or just kind of good stand-alone investments? Joel Marcus : Yes, this is Joel. Yes. The answer is yes and yes. Operator : Next question comes from Michael Carroll of RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll : Just real quick back on to the have nots. I think Joel, you were mentioning that there might be some have nots to have to give back space in the suburban markets of Boston. I mean how much of that could come back to the market? Is it big enough to alter any of these markets where you could see vacancy rates kind of uptick? Or is it just more of a one-off type thing? Joel Marcus : Yes. I don't think it's -- we haven't seen any sign that it's a material impact, and we'll monitor that quarter-to-quarter. So I think, right now, it's pretty building and location specific and, obviously, tenant specific. But we haven't seen anything that I would say material as an overall trend at this time. Michael Carroll : Okay. And then related to the have nots. I mean, I think in your prepared remarks, you said is basically companies that went public too quickly. What about the small to mid-cap private companies that you kind of indicated? Did they raise enough equity or capital, so they're really not an issue? Or is it more a muddle than that? It's kind of depending on the company that we're talking about? Joel Marcus : Yes. So certainly, not all companies I would put in, they went to -- went public too early. I would probably put those on preclinical. So if you've not even entered the clinic, and you're going public, probably that's too early. I mean it's obviously case-specific, depends on what the technology is, what the opportunity is, what your shareholder base is from the private side and so forth. But by and large, there's a host of those that were preclinical that just went too early, maybe grew too fast and realized they still got the clinical ahead of them. And then those that went public in the clinic, I think that's generally been a good game plan, but then didn't realize that after 9 years, I mean, I've been saying that for a while, a 9-year bull market in the sector just doesn't continue unabated. So it tends to rationalize itself. And as I said, 5x the capital volume was being raised and kind of went into the industry, which is a lot. On the private side, as I say, many -- I mean, again, it's very case specific, but many of the companies who have blue-chip founder groups or investor groups who've raised large pools of money have good runway. So generally, a lot of those are not going to suffer maybe some of the challenges that may face a host of the public companies in the have-not sector, if you will. Michael Carroll : Okay. Great. And then just last 1 for me. Steve, you kind of highlighted in your prepared remarks that there's no projects under construction that will be delivered in 2024 at least as of now. I mean, when would a developer actually need a break ground or go vertical to achieve the 2024 delivery date? Do they have another, what, 6-plus months or so? Is that kind of fair to say? Stephen Richardson : Michael, it's Steve. Yes, I think it's within that window. And the key is whether someone is going to actually start doing that and going vertical to deliver in that time frame. And what we've really done is drill down to the capital behind these operators. Obviously, the operators are going to be positive and bullish. But we just haven't seen that from the capital sources actually committing capital as of today. Operator : Next question comes from Daniel Ismail of Green Street Advisors. Daniel Ismail : Great. Maybe going back to 100 Binney Street and the cap rate compression in Cambridge. I'm curious if you're seeing a similar level of price appreciation across markets, or are any markets accelerating? Or maybe moving slower than that clip you guys you're seeing in Cambridge? Joel Marcus : Well, yes, I'll ask maybe Peter and Steve. I would say, on your end, I think you guys need to revisit our NAV. I think you guys are off. But in any case, I think it's -- when you look at Binney, Binney is in the heart of the Kendall Square and Cambridge epicenter. So the cap rate there is not real surprising for relatively new construction, high credit quality and just an iconic location and building. And I think you can see across most of our markets, cap rates have held, I think, very strong and continue to be very positive in our favor. But I'd ask Steve and Peter to comment more detailed. Yes. Peter Moglia : Yes. This is Peter. All the markets where there -- I guess, said another way, none of the markets we're in would have a cap rate that would have anything greater than a  handle on it, which is, as you know, remarkably different from a couple of years ago when people were thinking certain markets had 6% or 7%. Some of those markets now are in the 4s or 5s. So I would generally just say, as Joel mentioned, Cambridge is a special place. There are going to be a few submarkets where you probably go below 4% to the mid-3s like we just did. But who knows? I mean there's certainly a lot of money chasing these assets and the competition for high-quality assets, when the investors are thinking, \"Hey, there's great rent growth here. I'll pay the price for it today,\" who knows? We could certainly see breaking through 4% in other markets. But in general, cap rates for lab are like industrial, like logistics, storage or apartments. I mean it's just a hot industry. There's a lot of money out there to be invested and they want to bet on winners and winners are expenses. Daniel Ismail : Maybe the last point, I'm curious across those property sectors you mentioned, we've been noticing cap rates go either at or below borrowing costs. And I'm curious if that's a similar dynamic you're noticing across life science as well. I assume 100 Binney is -- I believe it's unencumbered, but I would assume that the debt would be closer to that cash cap rate or if not a smidge below? Peter Moglia : Well, you bring up a good a good point that actually we don't really talk about too much. But I mean, yes, our large partial interest sales are done with partners that are not buying with leverage. So they're putting this money to work and not looking to lever it up. They're accepting these returns. -- frankly, we don't go into the secured market and buy anything on a levered basis. So kind of hard for me to comment, but I would imagine just seeing where rates are today, that negative leverage is probably the only leverage available if you want to buy a really high-quality asset. Daniel Ismail : Great. And then maybe just last 1 for me. On the Mercer Mega Block, can you remind us if the plan was always to bring in a partner? And if so, why not retain the entirety of that development for ARE? Joel Marcus : Yes. Peter, you could comment. Peter Moglia : Sure. We have a strategic partner in a couple of nearby assets that made a lot of sense for them to participate with us. I can't really go into the details. They'll become apparent later on. But this is a partner that is -- we're in multiple markets with. They have a lot of trust in us. They're a great source of capital that's very attractive compared to common, and they were highly interested in getting involved, and we're keeping the majority share there, but it's also a good opportunity for us to finance something upfront rather than after the fact to keep the capital flowing to other projects as well. Joel Marcus : I would also say we've seen great activity with credit tenants in that -- for that location. Operator : The next question is a follow-up from Jamie Feldman of Bank of America. Jamie Feldman : I appreciate your color on the construction pipeline, breaking out '23, '24 and beyond. Would you say that your appetite for speculative has changed at all in the last 6 months or so or even the last 3 months, just given it seems to be a growing pipeline and maybe more questions on the demand side? Joel Marcus : Well, I think, Jamie, somebody mentioned, I don't know, or if not, we haven't really done speculative development since before the '08-'09 crisis when we were forced under contract in New York. We're building 2 towers. We stop one after Lehman collapsed, we built the East Tower. And then luckily, we secured Eli Lilly is our anchor tenant there. But we haven't generally built specs since then. And when we tend to put up, if we go vertical, we generally always have either a signed lease, signed LOI, or we have, as a case of one project I can think of a series of companies who have told us they need growth at this point, and we've decided to go forward and working through the mechanics of documenting that. But we wouldn't just put up steel on the hope that they will come, not because of the current market, but we just haven't done that as a matter of policy in the company for literally more than a decade. Jamie Feldman : Okay. That's helpful. And then if you think about your investment activity in the quarter, the projects you bought or even some of the more covered land plays, is it safe to assume there's also tenant interest in those projects, or the stuff you've been buying really is kind of a future land bank without the tenant in mind? Joel Marcus : Generally, we like to -- I can think of a number of situations in San Diego or other markets where absolutely specifically or the Bay Area, the Peninsula, where we have specific tenant interest. Remember, Peter, Steve and Dean have all mentioned, we've got now more than 1,000 innovative tenants. So the amount of information and the amount of requirements really come to us in a way that there's nobody else that could marshal that kind of a resource. And that gives us the confidence to make some moves where we know that we will be successful. There have been a recent -- we're not going to confirm or deny anything, but a recent San Francisco Peninsula report on something on a project we're doing there, and that we have signed an LOI. I mean that's a good example. And again, I won't confirm or deny, but that's an example of if that was true, where it makes sense to do what we did. And that's kind of how we operate. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then I was going to ask a follow-up to my original question on this call, which was, you started talking about the haves and have nots. Is there a way to handicap the -- like the percentage of the portfolio NOI that even is what you would consider more at risk type tenants? Joel Marcus : When you say more at risk, what do you mean? Jamie Feldman : Well, you had talked about tenants that either -- maybe they're running -- they may run out of capital to fund their pipeline. Just not as well capitalized and so may end up needing some sort of recapitalization or running out of capital. Joel Marcus : No, we diligence tenants before we sign leases or even letters of intent, and we monitor them oftentimes usually quarterly, but sometimes monthly. And if you look at -- on Page 17 of the supplement, we give you a breakdown of our tenants. Half of our tenants are investment grade or large cap. We've got about 7% of the portfolio, which is private. We feel very good about the majority of -- the vast majority of those companies because they generally well-funded, and they've got a pathway for additional funding. We've got -- in our public biotech, the vast majority of those, again, are well funded with cash runways that go out, oftentimes beyond leases. And if not, certainly multiple years or are waiting for readouts oftentimes for Phase III. So we feel pretty good about where we are. And if there's anybody that runs into a problem, we kind of know about it. I mean, a good example might be Nektar, which had a is in our Mission Bay portfolio. We have watched them for quite a while. We're very close to them. They're going to, I think, sublease their office space, which is with Kilroy. They've got  space with us. That project is partnered, but we already have demand for backfilling that space should they decide to give it up, but they said they're going to keep a big chunk of their lab space, so I wouldn't expect them to give the majority of that up. So we've already -- I mean that might be an example of something you're referring to. We're already well ahead of the curve there and could backfill that space probably at much higher rates. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then on that lease, so 2030, I believe? Joel Marcus : Yes, I don't have it in front of me, but it's a long-term lease. And the truth of the matter is, in some cases, and I would never say that with specifics to Nektar. But sometimes, you might hope a company would decide to give up a lease because you could backfill it at a much higher rate. So some of that you'll see happen, I'm sure in -- I mean mission-based still, the vacancy rate there is literally 0 at this point for built-out lab space. And so the demand is significant. There's a high credit quality in that submarket that has a huge pent-up demand for space. I'll tell you that. Operator : Our last question comes from Anthony Paolone of JPMorgan. Anthony Paolone : So I just want to make sure I understand what the -- again, this have, have not discussion. And then looking at your mark -- your mark-to-market of the overall portfolio. I think it was pretty flat from what you mentioned last quarter, I think 31% and now about 30%. So are market rents still going up? Or have market rents kind of just holding steady at this point? And what is the outlook for the rest of the year? Joel Marcus : Yes. So, Steve, you could comment on that. Stephen Richardson : Yes. Tony, it's Steve here. Yes, I don't know that drilling down on one specific quarter really tells a trend there. You are right. It's generally flat, but it's flat from an exceptional perspective. I mean, maintaining a 30% mark-to-market, I think, is extremely healthy. Look, again, as I said before, we are still in very low single-digit vacancies in these core markets, particularly for Alexandria's portfolio as you see with our occupancy. We continue to see healthy demand. So our expectation is we will continue to see pricing power in the market. Anthony Paolone : Okay. Great. And then just last 1 for me. You closed on your Texas investment in the foray there. Can you tell us where you went? A \u2013Joel Marcus : Yes. So let me comment maybe on your first question first and then your second question. So I think if you \u2013 if somebody owns assets, I think the assets, and we\u2019ve seen this in other cycles that are going to be the most at risk will be buildings in non-cluster environments, one-off buildings in suburbs and so forth that are not really high-quality buildings or in the best of locations. And so I think those are the ones that may end up \u2013 they\u2019re getting probably the poorest quality tenants and the ones that may have a struggle there. And luckily, we don\u2019t have much of that at all in our entire portfolio. With respect to Texas, we\u2019re still under a series of transactions. So I\u2019m unable legally to comment on that, but I do hope that, at the next call, I said that last call, but we\u2019re still in pending transaction. But hopefully, we\u2019ll be able to give you color on the next call, Tony. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks. Joel Marcus : Simply to say thank you, everybody, be safe and God bless. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Paula Schwartz : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws. The company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel. Joel Marcus : Thank you, Paula, and welcome, everybody. Thank you for joining Alexandria's second quarter 2022 earnings call. With me today are Hallie Kuhn; Steve Richardson, Peter Moglia and Dean Shigenaga. In a very challenging macroeconomic environment, for sure, we are very blessed and thankful to have a truly one-of-a-kind public company, which has a uniquely visionary mission to create and grow life science ecosystems and clusters that ignite and accelerate leading innovators to advance human health by curing disease, saving lives and vastly improving nutrition, our mission for sure. We at Alexandria have worked tirelessly to earn the trust and have carefully and meticulously constructed our client tenant base within our best-in-class asset base. In 1994, we uniquely set out to be the trusted lab space real estate partner for life science companies. Today, 28 years later, we have earned the trust of over 1,000 diversified high-quality companies who have chosen our brand and rely on us to deliver on our reputation. Daily, they entrust us with their most precious assets, their talent, thousands of hard-working science, technology and business professionals reliant on our lab space and on the life science ecosystems we cultivate to attract and retain the best talent to advance their science. We provide them with a truly inspirational and healthy place to work. Daily, they entrust us with billions and billions of dollars of research and development platforms to be safe, secure and operational. Daily, they entrust us to be aligned with their mission to partner together at the highest level of operational excellence to improve human health. In this market, our results really stand out in the macroeconomic environment we're all experiencing, a slowing economy, the weaken consumer, higher interest rates and ranging structural inflation. Huge congratulations to our Alexandria family on a great 2Q '22 report. As Dean will talk about in a while, we've updated guidance for the second quarter to $8.41, FFO per share, representing an almost 8.5% growth for this year and combined with a 3% plus dividend. We think that's an excellent combination of 11.5% in this macroeconomic environment. We've experienced very powerful continuing rental rate increases and leasing activity. It's important to remember, 87% of our existing -- of our leasing comes from our existing tenants. We have uniquely crafted our own demand driver in our more than 1,000 tenants and 92% of the first half of 2022 leasing comes from this tenant base. 2.3 million square feet were signed in the second quarter, a third all-time high. with cash all-time high of 34% rental rate increase, highest ever, and a 45% GAAP rental rate, truly epic and historic. And then keep in mind, 50% of our annual rental revenue is from investment-grade or big-cap companies -- public companies, and 80% of our tenants are not private or development-stage biotech companies. Peter will discuss in detail our outstanding progress in capital recycling to the tune of about $0.5 billion in the second quarter as we harvest great value, which we have created over the last decade. He will also talk about strong external growth engine, which we fine-tuned in the new economic environment. Dean will discuss our fortress balance sheet and strong liquidity. More important now than ever with turbulent capital markets and fortunately, with our great team, we have no debt maturities until 2025. So no FFO dilution due to refinancings. Steve will discuss very strong internal growth and make sure to look at Page 33 of the supplement. And also Dean will mention the burn-off of free rent providing strong visibility for future growth. Our margin continued to be strong at 70%, and we're very proud of our tenant collections at 99.9%. So no real credit issues whatsoever. Hallie will speak to our awesome and non-replicable tenant base of over 1,000 tenants and the continuing health of the broader life science industry. The life science industry is not synonymous with simply early-stage biotech. Alexandria and its best-in-class tenant base is very well positioned and prepared for this shifting environment. With our best-in-class assets, decades-long relationship, we in fact, beat the so-called competitive product and much future theorized product, which will never be built. Last but not least, I want to make a couple of comments about Steve Richardson, our retiring Co-CEO. I want to express on behalf of all the extended family here at Alexandria a profound thank you for the last 22 years, the best ever. Your humble service leadership has set the bar for all of us. Queen Elizabeth recently talked about leadership at her birthday celebration in which -- and you exemplify these words precisely, finding ways of encouraging people to combine their efforts, their talents, their insights, their enthusiasm and their inspiration to work together. And if I may just finally make a quote from the famous movie Band of Brothers. Of course, it could be all genders, of course, and the Requiem For a Soldier, we're all one great Band of Brothers. And one day, you'll see we can live together when all the world is free, have you lived to see all you gave to me, you in fact have, you're shining dream of hope and love. We're all one great Band of Brothers. And with that, I want to turn it over to Hallie Kuhn. Hallie Kuhn : Thank you, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm Hallie Kuhn, SVP of Science & Technology and Capital Markets. Today, I'm going to start by covering the bedrock of Alexandria's business. Specifically, as Joel mentioned, Alexandria's world-class and leading stable of over 1,000 tenants. As part of this review, I will cover the health of the life science industry and then pivot to a number of recent FDA approval that reflect the industry's collective drive to develop life-saving therapies. The life science industry is large, diverse and complex. Alexandria's tenant base reflects the diversity with over 1,000 tenants that span multinational pharma, public and private biotechnology companies, life science products such as enabling research tools and manufacturers of complex medicines and top-tier investment-grade companies and institutions. So let's break this down segment by segment, starting with multinational pharma. Alexandria is proud to call 17 of the top 20 biopharma companies our tenants, including BMS, Eli Lilly, Sanofi, Takeda, Merck and Pfizer, just to name a few. Looking at large cap focused indices such as the Dow Jones U.S. Select Pharmaceutical Index, you'll see that these companies continue to outperform broader indices, including the Dow, S&P 500 and NASDAQ. Biopharma deployed over $200 billion into R&D in 2021 and the top 20 biopharma have an estimated $300 billion cash on hand to put towards M&A and partnerships as they look to bolster their pipelines with innovative new medicines. Next, public biotech companies. With small and mid-cap companies have gotten outsized focus over the past several months as indices such as the XBI have tumbled, this segment contains many of the most innovated and well-funded large-cap companies in the industry with names such as Alexandria tenants Alnylam and Vertex. Indeed, the majority of our ARR across public biotechnology companies is from those with marketed or approved products. Across pre-commercial companies, we have a deeply technical and experienced science and technology team that employs a rigorous underwriting and monitoring process to select the fastest-growing and most promising companies. Our over decade-long relationship with Moderna is a great example. Just three years ago, Moderna was in this pre-commercial category and is now a leading global commercial stage biotech. On to private biotechnology. While funding has slowed across all industries compared to 2021 due to macro market conditions, venture funds continue to raise historic levels of capital and deploy it at a sustained pace. $30 billion was deployed into private biotechnology companies in the first half of 2022 compared to a record-breaking $39 billion in the first half of 2021, and still up over 50% compared to the first half of 2019 and 2020. Indeed, companies like incoming New York and Bay Area tenant, Icon Therapeutics, with a stellar management team and highly differentiated platform recently raised over $0.5 billion. This is not to say that investment thesis haven't shifted. With downward pressure on valuations and are refocusing towards the most innovative companies with experienced management teams, but market resets are ultimately healthy for a sector in the long run as companies are forced to double down in their core strength and talent is diverted to the most promising applications. Now for life science products, services and devices. This diverse set of companies enables breakthrough research from the bench to bedside. It is the companies like Illumina developing cheaper, faster and more efficient research tools to understand the genetic underpinnings of disease. If company is identifying diseases at the earliest stages when treatments can be more effective, and it's the contract manufacturers producing complex medicines for next-gen therapies. As the picks and shovels, so to speak, of the industry, these companies' business models are not the same as those developing novel medicines with a quicker path to market and revenue. So while there is no simple index or measure that is a perfect proxy for the strength of our top-tier tenant base, from the beginning of the year through the second quarter, the Dow Jones U.S. Select Pharmaceutical Index, which captures many of our top 20 tenants, outperformed the Dow by 11 points, the NASDAQ by 25 points and the XBI by 29 points. Moreover, the life science industry is less cyclical than other industries as products are developed over a longer period with novel medicines taking an average 10 years from early development to commercialization. Developing new medicines is not easy and market dynamics aside, companies will experience challenges and even failures along the way. But with 1,000 tenants and over 87% of leasing stemming from preexisting relationships, our unique model and deeply experienced team positions us to proactively manage potential risks and bumps in the road. To end, I'd like to take a step back and acknowledge the mission-critical nature of the life science industry to our society. Each approval from the FDA marks the potential for a healthier, longer life for each of us listening on the call today and our loved ones. New therapies improve and extend quality of life, prevent costly hospitalizations and ultimately, reduce long-term health care costs. We are proud and humbled that as novel therapies approved by the FDA in 2022, half by Alexandria tenants, a stat that holds true for the past decade. Approvals from tenants this quarter include an RNA-based treatment of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis, a small molecule treating obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and a first-in-class immunotherapy targeting metastatic melanoma. To paraphrase Roger Perlmutter, former CSO of Merck and the CEO of the previously mentioned Eikon Therapeutics, novel medicines can change the world and most have yet to be discovered. And with that, I'll pass it over to Steve. Stephen Richardson : Thank you, Hallie. The second quarter of 2022 was an absolute blowout quarter in nearly every regard, the demand and really the intensity of the strong commitment to Alexandria's brand of highly differentiated mega campuses and operational excellence continue to provide for superior financial outperformance. I'd like to give a big shout out to the entirety of the Alexandria team as following the results are amongst the best in nearly every category. As Joel noted, Alexandria is truly a one of a kind company and hence definitively proven its ability to deliver excellent results throughout a wide array of macroeconomic condition. As we've discussed and Hallie referred to as well a number of times over many years, the companies in the life science industry have a long-term horizon for their pursuit and commercial life-saving and life changing novel medicines and therapies. Research and discovery in the laboratory, multi-stage clinical trials, commercial rollouts can and do take a decade or more. Alexandria's unique capabilities and team have successfully identified the most promising life science companies and ultimately attracted the world's leading investment-grade pharmaceutical and big biotech companies to it's mega-campuses in AAA locations adjacent to the country's leading research institutions. The second quarter exemplifies this powerful combination of trusted relationships with high-quality companies and their long-term horizons and some consider the following. 87% of the leasing activity overall was from Alexandria's existing relationship and absolutely essential and unique to Alexandria-only enabling success during turbulent macroeconomic quarters. And during Q2, 88% of the leasing activity in the development and redevelopment pipeline was from Alexandria's existing relationships. Consider how powerful that statement is for successfully growing the company's high-quality on-balance opportunities not only for a few quarters, but for many years. The stability and trusted nature with Alexandria has become a bedrock in value consideration for our tenants. And as the company has grown to more than 1,000 tenants this past year, this presents an exceptionally powerful competitive advantage for the company's future growth and a substantial barrier for others to be dabbling in a highly sophisticated and technical nature of mission critical life science real estate. Beyond the ground reality for Alexandria this quarter is a vigorous and highly productive effort from across the entire company. The leasing activity of approximately 2.3 million square feet is in the third-highest quarterly leasing volume in company history. Record rate increases with renewal leasing spreads of 45% GAAP, 44% cash represent the second highest and the highest rental rate growth in the company's history, respectively. The portfolio mark-to-market remains strong at approximately 7-point percent and as we noted in the last two quarterly calls this is significantly greater than the mark-to-market of 17% at the end of 2020 and in line with the end of 2021's 30.4%. Accounts receivable for the entire Q2 was a 100% including a 100% from our publicly traded biotech tenants and that continues as we've achieved 99.9% so far during July. Early renewals for this quarter were similar to Q1 at a rate of 50% of leasing, a strong validation again of the health of Alexandria's tenants and their long-term planning horizon that we noted at the start of my comments. We have exceptional health of our value creation pipeline with a total of more than 900,000 square feet of leasing which contributes to a highly de-risk nature of the pipeline as 78% of the 7.8 million square feet which is projected to generate $665 million of incremental revenue is leased or negotiating, and Peter will provide additional detail and color during his comments as well. Let's move on to supply and demand. Demand was consistent with the past two years with no significant drop in our quarters. We do see the demand in the market highly [technical difficulty] life science projects and end market, the actual each HVAC capacity, actual electric capacity, actual operational experience an operator might have [technical difficulty]. We continue to monitor supply at a very similar level, including the actual asset because differences between purpose built Class A facilities and Class B purpose-built we also look at the [technical difficulty] and if you look at capital sources they will actually the decision till we go forward [technical difficulty] the basis for this new [technical difficulty]. So let's build up the specific reality in the field and supply. Current vacancy rates continue to be very tight with [technical difficulty] in our core clusters, [technical difficulty] less than 1% [technical difficulty] which is generally consistent with market conditions during the past several quarters. There is not significant sub leases in the market which is in contrast [technical difficulty] and if they are of high quality, they are moved very quickly. As we look at 2022 the unleased new supply is adding very incrementally 1% to 2% of our key market, [technical difficulty] earlier comment on healthy demand. So we would expect to supply would be substantially leased by year-end. If we look ahead to '23, again we drill down on each and every project at our core markets and determine which projects are actually vertical and well underway. The unleased 2023 deliveries will be [technical difficulty] 3% to 5% availability to the total market size. And again, we expect these deliveries will be further reduced during the next six quarters. Beyond that, 2024 and beyond, we do closely monitor hand waving and flyers in the market that indicate creative tech space or life science space alternatives and as of today, we do not see any large disruptive set of Class A lab projects well underway in our core markets that are preparing to go vertical on a purely speculative basis. Ultimately, Alexandria has significant differentiation in the market and as I mentioned at the outset of my comments, this group new projects is only becoming more intensive and accelerating as companies need a trusted and eminently capable operator for the mission-critical operations. So we actually see the difference between Alexandria's Class A facilities as part of our fully-amenitized mega campuses and one-off buildings and commodity locations becoming more highly valued. So in conclusion, the first quarter of 2022 was a very strong quarter, and now the historic strength of the second quarter continues to definitively highlight Alexandria's positioned for the near term and the long-term. Life science companies intrinsically have a long-term horizon and their mission critical laboratory facilities are essential for their success. Alexandria has a combination of a tenant roster that has both a long-term horizon in high-quality investment-grade credit portends a very bright future for the company. And as this is my last earnings call with the announcement of my retirement, I want to say, it has been the honor of my life to work shoulder to shoulder with the entire Alexandria family at this one of a kind company. I have the highest regard and deep affection for this incredible team. Our unique culture of respect for one another, high expectations for one another and a passion for the company's mission is a rare blend that has enabled us to thrive and work as a trusted partner with one of the country's most strategic and choice industries. I also want to thank the broader investment community for your deep engagement and support for the company over these many years we worked with one another. And finally, it has been an exceptional privilege in particular to work so closely during the past 22-plus years with the team, an extraordinarily insightful and eminently capable leader, Peter, who is the ultimate Co-CEO, providing the heart and soul of the company and perfectly complementing my shortcomings with his formidable talents, and Joel, an inspirational leader, a genuine line of the industry and a once-in-a-generation Founder and American business. I have been truly blessed. And with that, I will hand it off with energy and enthusiasm to my brother Peter. Peter Moglia : Thank you, Steve. I'd like to start by thanking you for teaching me so much about teamwork, managing people, operational excellence, the necessity of taking a deep breath every now and again, expanding my vocabulary and being a sounding board and confidante throughout our partnership. I started this Co-CEO relationship with alacrity. The use of that word is an example of your influence, and I was not disappointed. I will greatly miss our regular chats, but I'm glad you will be around when a good talk is needed. With that said, I'm going to update the audience on the progress being made on our value creation pipeline and related construction costs and supply chain trends then conclude with remarks on the dispositions completed this quarter. As Hallie referenced in her overview, our 1,000 plus tenant base is of the highest quality as it includes 17 of the 20 biopharma companies, the most innovative and well-funded large cap public biotech companies in the world and a stable full of the most promising and fastest growing private companies in the industry, which have been rigorously underwritten by a deeply technical and experienced team. This highly curated tenant base provides opportunities that have been consistently fueling our external growth for over a decade. And if you connect the dots, it's no coincidence that 87% of our leasing activity comes from it. The best companies are those that grow and we have grown along with them. The past quarter, we completed over 915,000 square feet of leasing in our development and redevelopment pipeline which aggregates to an excess of 2.3 million square feet for only half a year at a time when people are worried about the product type we invented, because others pretending to be equals are struggling with their tenant base. Our results in the wake of others struggling should tell you something. Life science real estate is not for everyone, success takes years of experience in designing and building the right product in the right location, deep relationships with the highest quality life science companies and company creators, operational excellence and most important during times like these, a very deep understanding of the industry. We delivered 375,394 square feet in the second quarter spread amongst six projects including the full deliveries of the 8 and 10 Davis, part of our Alexandria Center for Advanced Technologies in the Research Triangle, and 5505 Morehouse Drive in Sorrento Mesa. The weighted average yield of these delivered projects was a healthy 7.8% and they will contribute over $20.6 million in net operating income moving forward. The remainder of the pipeline that is either under construction or expected to commence construction in the next six quarters has decreased by approximately 200,000 square feet from last quarter, but is still projected to add more than $665 million in annual rental revenue over the same number of quarters reflecting higher revenue per square foot developed. As of quarter end, 78% of this remarkable pipeline was either leased or under negotiation, meaning we have an executed LOI with 95% of the activity year-to-date coming from existing relationships, reinforcing the quality of our tenant base given that this category of leasing is typically driven by consolidation necessitated by growth. It also highlights the extraordinary loyalty of our tenants and the trust we have earned through many years of high-quality service. I'm also pleased to report that despite continued volatility in construction costs and supply chain disruptions, our pro forma yields are neutral to slightly improving relative to last quarter and there have been no adjustments to our delivery timing. That is a good transition to our construction costs and supply chain update. The bad news first. There are still upward pressures on construction and material prices stemming from high energy costs and now labor costs are becoming a bigger issue than in the past. As the U.S. exports more natural gas to Europe, it becomes more expensive here, and one direct impact has been an increasing glazing costs of 20% to 40%. In addition to a 35% increase in aluminum over the past 12 months, glazing is impacted by the cost of natural gas as it's heavily used in its production. As mentioned last quarter, elevated diesel prices have a significant impact on construction costs as earthwork machinery runs on it and our contractors have been seeing fuel surcharges in the billings from these subs. Crude oil was up 71% from February '21 through February '22, and although pricing is slightly improved since then, it's not providing any significant relief. Other costs that continue to be overly elevated over the past quarter include construction machinery, which is doubled, Gypsum, which is up over 1500%, one of our contractors blames this on elevated housing construction, which uses about 50% of the supply, semiconductors are up 276% due to heavy demand by the automotive industry and switchgear and other industrial and electrical equipment is up 73% due partially to demand and partially to elevated cost of components that go into that equipment. Labor which accounts for approximately 60% to 70% of construction costs has been relatively stable over the past couple of years due to pre-arranged wage increases negotiated into labor agreements, but many of those are now up for renewal and negotiations are reported to be intense. Due to career changes for many in the industry after layoffs caused by COVID-19 work stoppages, there is a smaller pool of labor, and combined with the higher cost of living wages are expected to be much higher in the future. Supply chain issues remain despite improvements in transportation, mainly due to the war in Ukraine and a ripple effect from shortages in components. One of our surveyed contractors closely track supply chain related impacts to their jobs nationally and found that from September of 2020 through February 23 of this year, supply chain impacts averaged 5.89 per day. From the beginning of the war on February 24 through June 8 of this year, there have been 38.12 impacts per day. As a result, extraordinary lead times remain for equipment used in our product type, including generators, building controls, transformers, switchgear, electrical panels, air handlers and chillers, all of which have lead times that are double what they normally are, many exceeding a year. Much of the delay is due to a ripple effect of missing components, a generator can be 90% complete, but can take an additional six months to finish because of the missing component or two from a vendor with a huge backlog. The good news is that despite the shortage in skilled labor productivity is improving. Contractors are starting to see cancellations or projects being put on hold, lightening their backlogs, which will eventually reduce demand and ease, both pricing and supply chain problems. This can be seen in expected escalations from one of our major GCs who projects them to be 6% to 8% this year with a bias towards the longer end but a reduction to 4% to 5% in 2023. We continue to closely manage these conditions and approximately 80% of our cost for development and redevelopment projects under construction are subject to a guaranteed maximum or other contracts that enable us to mitigate the risk of inflation. We have contingencies behind those contracts to account for scope creep and unknowns, the other 20% is from projects that are currently pending guaranteed maximum contracts that are in process, and those projects include larger cost contingency allowances in their performance. Moving to our asset sales. Interest rates are certainly influencing real estate pricing broadly and we've been told by our investment brokers that they are seeing a 25-basis-point widening and other hot product types such as industrial. So we may see it with lab office assets as well. It is certainly reasonable expect that may happen, but we do believe that the scarcity of well-located Class A lab office assets will help mitigate that. You can certainly find industrial product almost anywhere, but for sale Class A lab product is still very hard to find. So despite the increasing interest rate environment, there continues to be strong demand for life science assets demonstrated by our partial interest sales in Cambridge and Mission Bay and our outright sale of 12 assets in the Route 128 and 495 suburbs of Boston. The partial interest sale of 300 Third Street in Cambridge closed at the end of the quarter and was sold to an existing partner relationship for a 4.3% cash cap rate at a price per square foot of $1,802, a $113 million gain over book value. As of as the sale date, we have achieved an 11.6% unlevered IRR on this asset. The partial interest sale at 1450 Owens in Mission Bay was also purchased by an existing relationship and as a development asset that included reimbursement for infrastructure and pre-development costs. Parsing those reimbursements out, yields a land value of $324 per buildable square foot indicative of the high-value of our land bank. Lastly, our 12 assets suburban portfolio sale in Greater Boston sold at a strong cash cap rate of 5.1% and the sales price per square foot of $542. Although these assets served our tenant base well for a number of years, we believe we can create more value long-term with the capital from this sale by reinvesting it into our development and redevelopment pipeline focused on the creation and expansion of our mega campus platform. The great progress made on the construction and leasing of our high-quality value creation pipeline paired with our ability to realize strong exit cap rates during the quarter, once again demonstrates our ability to create significant long-term enduring value for our shareholders. Thanks for listening. And with that I'm going to go ahead and pass it over to Dean. Dean Shigenaga : All right, thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. Our team is very pleased for their 7th year of recognition as winner of the Large Cap NAREIT Communication and Reporting Excellence Award, 6-time Gold Winner plus one Silver Award, which is truly awesome. So congratulations team. At the end of June, our team published our Annual ESG report highlighting key areas of our leadership in ESG and our focus on making a positive and lasting impact on the world. Key topics included in our ESG report include among many others, first, managing and mitigating climate-related risks, including continued development of our science-based targets to reduce emissions. Two, highlights of the design of what is expected to become the most sustainable lab building in Cambridge and to future all electric buildings in our San Francisco Bay Area market. And then three, our eight unique and important social responsibility pillars. Now turning to the quarter and the first half of the year. Our first quarter and first half results were very strong and significantly beat consensus. We also raised our strong outlook since our initial guidance for 2022 by $0.05 including $0.03 with the second quarter results here. Our projected growth in FFO per share is very strong at 8% over 2021. Total revenues for the first quarter and the first half of the year were strong and up 26.3% and 27.2% respectively over the same periods for 2021. FFO per share for the second quarter was strong at $2.10, up 8.8% over the second quarter of '21. Now huge thanks to our entire team for truly exceptional execution in 2022. We have generated one of the most consistent and strong operating and financial results quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year within the REIT industry. Now, as you've heard from us today over 1,000 plus tenants and other life science industry relationships is really driving strong demand for ARE's brand. ARE is the go to brand and the trusted partner to the life science industry, we have the best team, the highest quality facilities, the best locations and tremendous scale for space optionality to address demand. Our EBITDA margin was 70% and is one of the best in the REIT industry. This strong EBITDA margin also highlights the efficient execution of operational excellence by our team. We had strong occupancy at 94.6%, up 60 basis points since 12/31/2021 and our occupancy guidance range for 2022 from 95.2% to 95.8% highlights continued strength in occupancy growth. Record leasing volume and rental rate growth for the second quarter of 45.4% and 33.9% on a cash basis and really strong rental rate growth outlook for the entire year at 32.5% and 20.5% on a cash basis, highlighting the strength, again of our brand and execution. We have very high collections of July rent at 99.9%, as of July 22, which was about three weeks into July and consistently low AR at $7.1 million as of June 30. These are pretty amazing statistics for one of the largest REITs in the industry and not surprising given the high credit and diverse tenant roster our team has curated over the years. Our strong same-property NOI growth for the second quarter was 7.5%, 10.2% on a cash basis. This strong performance highlights the strength of our brand and trusted partnerships that continue to drive strong demand for lease renewals and re-leasing of space and expansion of space with ARE. Now, same-property occupancy was very exceptional for an asset base with consistently high occupancy, but it was up 140 basis points in the second quarter compared to the second quarter of 2021. Now turning to our strong and flexible balance sheet. We have one of the top overall credit ratings in the REIT industry ranking in the top 10%. We've got no debt maturities until 2025. Over 98% of our outstanding debt is subject to fixed interest rates, we have $5.5 billion of liquidity. The weighted average remaining term of outstanding debt was 13.6 years and one of the highest in the REIT industry. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA is on track to hit 5.1 times by year-end, really highlighting our focus on continuous improvement in our balance sheet and credit profile. Forecasted cash at the end of the year of about $250 million is expected to reduce our incremental debt capital needs for 2023, and this is really important in this higher interest rate environment. And then we really have achieved really strategic execution in 2022 on our capital plan with only slightly above 10% of our overall growth sources of capital remaining for the rest of 2022. Now at the midpoint of guidance for this year on dispositions, we have $740 million remaining and we have the potential to exceed the midpoint of that guidance. Our updated capital plan reflects a significant reduction in uses of capital for the second half of the year aggregating about $635 million across both acquisitions and construction spend as we prioritize our allocation of capital. On acquisitions, and it's important to recognize that activity has been and was expected to decline as a result of having a very attractive pipeline of land for future development in each of our key sub-markets, combined with the considerations for the overall challenging macroenvironment and capital markets. Now briefly on our dividend policy. Our Board has been very consistent with our policy and really has focused on sharing our high quality growth in cash flows from operating activities with shareholders, while also retaining a significant portion for reinvestment into our highly lease pipeline of development and redevelopment projects. We are on track to reinvest about $2 billion of cash flows from operating activities after dividends over a 10-year period ending on December 31, 2022. Now this includes about $300 million in cash flows from operating activities after dividends at the midpoint of guidance for 2022. Turning to our Venture Investments. This program and component of our business is really and consistently generating realized gains. Realized gains for the second quarter were $28.6 million and $51.8 million for the first half of the year and we are on track with projected realized gains for 2022 that should be consistent with the $105 million in realized gains in 2021 or almost $26 million per quarter. Now, the mix of realized gains is varied period to period. However, on average over the last 5.5 years gains from our investments in publicly traded securities represented only 30% of our total annual realized gains and historical gains over the years, where most often triggered by traditional liquidity events including M&A activity and IPOs. From a balance sheet perspective, we've got strong gross unrealized gains of about $565.5 million relative to our cost basis of $1.1 billion. Now, our team has delivered very strong operating and financial results in the first half of 2022 and our improved outlook for the year remains very strong with EPS diluted ranging from $2.14 to $2.20 and FFO per share as adjusted diluted from a range of $8.38 to $8.44. FFO per share is up $0.05 from our initial guidance provided at Investor Day on December 1 of '21, including the $0.03 increase with second quarter earnings here, and we expect strong FFO per share growth of 8.4% now for 2022 over 2021. Now, we refined our capital plan for the back half of the year, including the following items. We're really just focused on real estate sales for the rest of the year. We have no equity required for the remainder of the year and we significantly reduced our forecasted uses of capital by $635 million really on the back half of this year, which is a reduction of forecasted acquisitions and construction spending. Please refer to Page 6 of our supplemental package for detailed underlying assumptions included in our outlook for the full year of 2022. With that, I'll turn it back to Joel. Joel Marcus : Thank you very much. And I want to apologize, Steve was on cell phone and his line cut in and cut out, we'll work with the transcript providers and make sure the blanks are filled in. With that, we'd like to go to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Anthony Paolone of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Anthony Paolone : Thanks. And first best wishes to Steve and thanks for all the help over the years. So I appreciate that. My first question is, as it relates to just the demand you guys continue to see in the portfolio, do you think the $3 billion in development spending and effectively roughly about the same amount of deliveries is sustainable and how we should think about what things look like going forward or is the second half of the year drop in spending likely to persist into next year and kind of indicate just slowing the pipeline? Joel Marcus : Yes. So Dean, do you want to take that? Dean Shigenaga : Yes. Tony, it's Dean here. When we did look over the last couple of months here at our capital plan on around construction spend, we did announced a significant reduction in spend here for the back half of this year. But as you would expect, we look very carefully at spend for 2023. There were significant reductions there, but I don't want to get into the details of the capital plan specifically for next year, we'll get into that at Investor Day. What we are focused on though Tony as you can tell from our disclosures, the $665 million in incremental annual rental revenue as well call our priority focus, that's a fairly significant pipeline, both in revenue, but also 7.8 million square feet most of that, as you guys know is leased or negotiating at roughly 78%. So I'd call it we've refocused where we're paying attention to on allocating capital this pipeline is super important to us. So there is dollars that we will incur as we look into '23 related to that, but we're being mindful and disciplined and scaling back where we can. Anthony Paolone : Okay, got it. And then just in terms of in the portfolio, can you maybe take us inside some of the spaces and give us a sense as to how tenants are utilizing their space and whether or not just their own funding environment being more challenging is slowing up their hiring or growth plans, or just anything you see on that side? Joel Marcus : So when you ask about how they're using their space, do you mean, I'm not quite sure what you're asking. The laboratories are operating full time, we've said, as you know, many times, you can't do lab work from home. Most of the life science tenants have a flexible work from home schedule. So they are, yes white color folks are in several days a week and kind of move that around. I think that's kind of the norm. But there have been, I was at one of our mega campuses, not too long ago and the parking lot was jam, so people are back in a pretty important way. But I think the office part of the component still is kind of a hybrid work schedule, if that's what you're asking. Anthony Paolone : I'm trying to think through if capital was last point to fall and they have growth plans, do they slow up the need to take down as much space as maybe they would have otherwise right now? Joel Marcus : Yes. Tony, you have to go back to what Hallie said, the industry is not a cyclical industry, the industry is event-driven and if one is working on a particular blockbuster drug or whatever, they're going to allocate capital obviously as prudently and as disciplined fashion as possible, but they're going to have to move forward, because that's where the value of the pipeline is part of the key value. So I think it's different than other sectors, whether you're in a law firm or a financial sector where you can move a whole bunch of things around, because of just macroeconomics. But this is a very different industry. So I don't think you can kind of compare the two. Now tech tenants are well known, obviously, those guys clearly have slowed the pace of hiring, some of them have done some layoff work and so forth and so we see that, we've got what 8% or so, less than 10% of our portfolio is tech related. So that is, I think, well-characterized out there. Anthony Paolone : Okay. That's all I had. Thanks. Joel Marcus : Yes. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Jamie Feldman of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Joel Marcus : You may be on mute. Jamie Feldman : Thank you. To start off, just congratulations also to Steve. It's been a pleasure to work with you all these years and we wish you the best going forward. I guess, we appreciate all the color, the additional disclosure on tenant segmentation, but can you talk maybe let's fast forward six months, nine months here and we look back and I'm sure there's going to be some distressed or something of some sort in your portfolio, like what do you think that actually looks like in terms of what the cycle does actually bring? Joel Marcus : Well, I think it's pretty clear if you go back to the '08, '09 timeframe that there will be tenants and oftentimes they tend to be small publicly-held companies, either preclinical or into the clinic, who have a certain amount of cash that are trying to kind of manage their resources to get to value inflection milestone so they can either finance further or potentially reach a milestone that they could partner or sell either the company or the product to a bigger company. And so, I mean that goes on all the time, and I'm sure we'll see that evolve from time to time. I mean, the great example that I like to use as a company that had that problem back in '08, '09, they moved out of a big -- actually, they had the entire building of 500 Forbes, they moved out on one day, the next day, Genentech-Roche took that entire space and I think that's what you see we've described, I think last time, Steve described on the last call a tenant in San Diego, or maybe we've done that on some of the analyst calls, that wanted to leave, I forgot 20,000 square feet or so. We brought in another tenant who wanted that space and the mark-to-market on the new lease was 50%. So we expect to be able to manage those kinds of issues. But I think we're going to be much better well set than almost anybody else because of the discipline we've used in leasing space in the first place. Now if we buy an asset where we have an existing tenant, and that actually happened at 500 Forbes, then we have to just manage that in a way that is as best we can, because we haven't underwritten a tenant in a sense of choosing them, bring them in or not, obviously, as part of the acquisition. But so far, if you look at collections, receivables and just the general situation across the portfolio, we don't have any credit issues at the moment. Dean Shigenaga : Yes, and Joel and Jamie, if I could add, it's Dean here, just to put things into perspective, just from one simple statistic. If you look at occupancy from the end of '08 to the end of 2009, occupancy only declined 70 basis points, if you brought in that time period, just a tad and you look at the end of '07 to the end of 2009, occupancy actually grew by 30 basis points. And I think the one fundamental difference between that period and today that the life science industry in particular, the biotech industry has really gone through this period where I think you can almost call it the Golden Age of the biotech industry today with tremendous innovation going on relative to 2008. So it's a much more exciting and vibrant environment for the biotech sector. Jamie Feldman : Great, thank you for that. And then I guess just thinking about the cap rates on the asset sales in the quarter. How are those or how are they not representative of the broader portfolio? We've heard from brokers that maybe life science could still be trading in the threes, I'm just curious if that's just no longer a fact or maybe the Binney asset in particular that you sold is not a great comp to talk about kind of the best of the best in the portfolio? Joel Marcus : Yes well, I'll let Peter take that, but let me just say if you remember the Binney corridor and I think you've heard that Jamie. It took us about a decade to assemble in title and build over 2 million square feet there. 300 Third was an asset we purchased before all that it was actually an older building that had been built for Palm. And a converted asset so it doesn't really represent what we developed along that corridor, but that corridor is I think representative of a big kind of mega Class A campus. So I think keep that in mind as you think it's not an one-off one, 100 Binney isn't just one-off Class A building. It actually represents all 2 plus million square feet there. But Peter you can give some details for sure. Peter Moglia : Yes sure Jamie fair question, you saw the 3.5 print last quarter and this is 4.3 the buildings are next to each other locationally. I would assess the difference Joel touched on it may be starting from where I was in my comments I think they were a number of factors it would include interest rate creep since that trade certainly rates have gone up since the sale of 100 Binney so that I'm sure factored into it. The age of building - 300 Third was built in 2000. And as Joel mentioned, it was a build-to-suit for Palm, 100 Binney was built in 2017. So 100 Binney is very new state-of-the-art HMH where 300 was not purpose-built for lab. I've talked and - during other quarters, commenting on non-purpose-built buildings, and this one has similar challenges to others that we've seen in the market, namely because of their low ceilings there or the low floor-to-floors, there's 8.5 foot ceilings. We typically have 10-foot ceilings in our space. So when you shrink the ceiling down like that, it's just not as nice of an environment. And it has some other weird things. There's, the parking lots on the second floor of the building, and that just creates some operational inefficiencies when you're dealing with chemical storage and things. So you have that and then I'd say, maybe one other item is that it's subject to a ground lease versus 100 Binney, which was a fee simple asset and there's certainly a little bit of discount for that. So I think all of those things kind of aggregated to a 4.3 but I would also say in this environment of 4.3 is still pretty good really good if you factor and also that 300 Binney is subjective a long-term lease and the buyer is not going to be able to market-to-market for quite a long time. So they certainly saw great value in the future appreciation. Joel Marcus : And a great tenant in Alnylam. Peter Moglia : Yes. Joel Marcus : Yes. Jamie Feldman : Okay great, thank you. Joel Marcus : Thanks Jamie. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Griffin of Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Griffin : Thanks appreciate you having me on the call this quarter and Steve, congrats on a well-deserved retirement. Just wanted to touch on the suburban portfolio dispositions, can you maybe give some color as to why it made sense to sell these assets? And could you see potential sales from other similar properties in the future? Joel Marcus : So I'll let Peter comment again on some of the specifics, but I would say - and welcome to the call. We aggregated those assets actually 60 West View, if I'm not mistaken, was the first asset we ever bought in the Massachusetts cluster. And we aggregated those assets, many of which kind of early on in our attempt to try to build a presence in the Greater Boston region. In those days, we didn't have enough money to buy anything in Cambridge. And we over -- as I say, well over a decade, we aggregated a nice group of suburban assets, well maintained, well operated, actually pretty good credit throughout the - those assets. But it comes a time when you see values there to harvest and to reinvest and also our move to the - really the mega campus strategy in the greater Boston region with our really big mega campuses. That's where we wanted to focus our capital, and we have obviously a whole host of needs. So it was a pretty easy decision and the timing was, I think, pretty darn good. But Peter, you could comment. I don't know if there's anything specific. Peter Moglia : Yes, I'd just say that I think the time was right. Those - there were 12 buildings in that portfolio. They were really good workforce buildings but relative to the rest of the assets that we have in our market that were on the lower spectrum of quality and given the appetite for life science real estate I think we were able to get the pricing by selling in today that was very attractive and as Joel mentioned and I said on the comments, great opportunity to reinvest that into our value creation pipeline. So I don't think there's really - I think it's just really that simple, just really opportunistic time to sell assets and get maybe more for on than you would in another era. Joel Marcus : Yes and I would say, we don't also have a set of suburban assets like that really in - how they kind of originated and stuff really in any other market. So you can't really say oh, do you have other suburban portfolios. Like in the Bay Area, a portfolio, we would probably exit would be the East Bay, but we exited those before. So we don't have those kind of assets by and large. Michael Griffin : Great. I appreciate the color on that. And then just maybe stepping back a bit, obviously given the continued demand for life science, are you noticing more entrants coming into your markets, particularly on the conversion side of traditional office to life science product? Joel Marcus : Well, I think as Peter said, the reality is data centers have been hot. Obviously, resi has been hot. Industrial logistics has been hot, and life science has been hot. But life science is a very - it's a much, much smaller overall asset base countrywide. And so, the scarcity is an important part of things. And as Peter said, I think a number of important high-quality investors have sought to look at these scarcity assets. But obviously, sometimes people make a decision. They don't like the asset they have. So they're looking at somebody else and saying, Gee, could we try to convert and do that and sure in markets there are those kind of people. But by and large, I mean, we heard pretty big core stories on some conversions in the Boston region by people who have no idea what they're doing and tenants who are desperate to get out. So that's a story that will unfold pretty sadly for those folks. Michael Griffin : Got you, that's it from me, thanks for the time. Joel Marcus : Yes. Operator : The next question comes from Rich Anderson of SMBC Nikko. Please go ahead. Richard Anderson : Thanks and Steve, good luck honor and privilege to work with you. I'll look for you on Celebrity Row at Warrior Games going forward next season. So on the topic of conversion activities, it's interesting. A lot of your office peers have made that the bulk of their development or redevelopment business. Peter to your comments about development costs going up and all that? And again, despite what you just said, Joel about some of the horror stories, do we expect the conversion business to start to whittle down or is it whittling down even though you don't consider it a competitive force for you guys? Is that something that could be an outtake from all of this disruption? Joel Marcus : Yes, so Steve and Peter, you guys want to comment? Peter Moglia : Steve, do you want to go first? Stephen Richardson : Yes, sure. Maybe I'll jump in here, Rich, and thank you for the kind words there. Yes, we're already seeing - that's why I tried to break it down in terms of the properties themselves. So you look at these conversions. And then you look at the operators who are new to this with a one-off building. And then ultimately, the capital partners, and we have seen now projects that have been put on pause that those will ultimately be put on ice. And we just don't see capital that enthusiastic about committing significant dollars to these types of conversions given the overall macro environment, the complete lack of any tenant base mixed with a lack of operational experience. So I think more to come and more to unfold, but that's certainly the sentiment that we're seeing out in the market now and Peter can add to that too. Peter Moglia : Yes I would say we do quite a number of meetings about strategy and market updates on a weekly basis. We're covering we never going to long before we covering what could be coming up what have we heard with all the different regions and I had - by and large we don't hear a lot about potential conversions outside of you might see announced in the press. Most of it is potentially new development, but as Steve mentioned in his comments. We only see limited amount of that in 2022 and 2023 more has been announced, we'll see if it gets built. But I don't see or we don't see a lot of conversions outside of going back to the suburbs in Boston. We certainly know one of our - one of the office suites that has a lot of holdings out there I have talked about doing conversions and I'm sure are underway with a few, but we're not seeing - proliferate throughout our urban core very much at least at this point. Richard Anderson : Okay, great. I'll yield the floor. Good long in the call here. Thanks very much team. Operator : The next question comes from Sheila McGrath of Evercore. Please go ahead. Sheila McGrath : Guys good afternoon, congrats Steve and all the best. Just a quick question on the dynamics of rental rates for new construction. Assuming as Peter outlined construction cost continue to go up and you want to maintain development yields just curious if the new rents on new development to justify construction are like above prevailing market in various submarkets? Joel Marcus : Yes so Peter do you want to talk about Blackstone's kind of market high they just are indicative. Peter Moglia : Yes I mean, I think what Joel is referring to as I think they were at $137 a foot. And that's, by and large, one of the things that sets the market our new developments. And so, you get a rate like that and then a renewal comes up of another Class A property in the neighborhood and the landlord will ask for the same rent. So I would say that the new development kind of helps set the market and then the existing assets follow. So it's a good thing. Sheila McGrath : Okay great. And then on 1450 Owens, I thought that was an interesting structure. I guess, sort of to minimize construction spend. Just wondering if that something you would replicate on some of the pipeline going forward? Joel Marcus : We've actually done it before. But Steve, you could talk about that. Stephen Richardson : Yes I think Sheila, that was a really great situation for both ourselves and the joint venture partner. We had the very left of sold, titled to go. So we have combination of a very attractive intrinsic land value plus preconstruction work that we done. And as we looked at partnering on that project just into the additional capital contribution to build to build will equaling the intrinsic value and the preconstruction work we had in there. So you're right. It's a very mutually rewarding way to move forward with that project. Sheila McGrath : Okay great, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Carroll of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Michael Carroll : Yes, thanks I just wanted to touch back on suburban Boston sales I guess Peter you indicated that portfolio was at the lower quality spectrum. So could you comment how the 5.1 cap rate would compare to the rest of the portfolio. I mean is there an easy way to understand the cap rate difference between let's say newer buildings and the rest of the properties? Joel Marcus : Yes the assets and the locations are even comparable but Peter you could answer. Peter Moglia : Well I think what you're trying to get to Michael is I would say that if we had a - so these were more of one-off buildings. But if we were to sell something in the suburbs that was more campus like - I mean San Diego ago and itself is kind of suburban market. So you look at something like Campus Point right where you have this amenitized campus it's in a suburban spread out environment, but it's Class A and amenitized I mean that's going to have, that's going to be a low 4 cap rate. If we had something in the suburbs of Boston, that was a similar type of development I would expect to similar type of cap rate. But these were lower quality these weren't really campuses they were one-off buildings of significant age and of credit tenancy in there was about a quarter when you looked over the spectrum of the tenant base. So it just as I termed it before kind of workforce they'll be leased over time as tenants need 30,000/50,000 square feet which is about the average size of those buildings. But they're never going to have huge rent growths because they are just not that appealing to have somebody clamoring over it. Michael Carroll : Okay great. And then just really quick and we ensure in time. I know about 80% I guess of your process development projects are protected in terms of I guess development cost increases. Can you kind of talk about the near term starts and how that's protected and if there is an risk to those budgets going higher or yields potentially going lower? Joel Marcus : Yes so, look you can't do a - you get a gross maximum price contract until you actually have something to price. So whenever we start a project we obviously do a pro forma and then within that pro forma I believe that we have a very conservative approach with allowances for cost that should be adequate and then contingencies on top of that. And then we get the entitlements. We get permits and then we're ready to go out and supplying out the project and it just take - you don't but it all out at once you buy out different trades at different times. So it's a process but we do it expeditiously and anything that we have that starts out. Again we have these underwriting contingencies that are in our pro forma so we have a really good idea what the yield would be and more often than not that initial yield can be done. We can do better because as we start to buy things out we can start removing some of those allowances and contingencies and end up by the time it gets put in to the supplemental you know highly confident in that yield. It may not be completely bought out by then but it's very close and if it hasn't been bought out it still contains good contingency to cover any unknowns or unexpected cost increases. Michael Carroll : Okay great thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Dave Rodgers of Baird. Please go ahead. Dave Rodgers : Hi Steve, thanks for the help over the years congratulations and good luck as well. Peter, just on the investment sales side, maybe you've touched on a lot of different ways about this question. But when you talk to your JV partners that have been the consistent buyers of a lot of your better quality assets? Are they specifically asking for or indicating that they'd be interested in a different type of asset or a different price point at this point in time, just with respect to where debt costs are and their ability to kind of finance that spread? Peter Moglia : So the nice thing that we have in our - in the base of our great partner pool, and it really truly is a great group of partners that we've established significant relationships with is that when we do these JVs. They're done on an unlevered basis. So they're not necessarily beholden to what the rates are for secured debt at the time. Now many of them may indeed finance their portfolios outside of asset specific financing, but it is at a very low level. In fact, some of our partners though have so much cash to put out that they don't lever really at all. So it's been one of the things that I think has helped us achieve the cap rates that we've achieved and sell things at an expeditious manner because there is a hunger for those types of assets, and they're not those purchases aren't contingent upon financing. So we hear stories about deals falling out because the lender at the last minute decides not to fund. That fortunately for us, we haven't had to deal with that. And if we did an outright sale, and we've had bidders that have put financing contingencies in their offers, but we've had enough bidders that were willing to not have that contingency that we just so far knock on wood. Everything that we've put out there we've performed on and haven't had any disruption because of debt market volatility. Dave Rodgers : That's helpful thanks. And then maybe just one unrelated question with regard to the Texas investments you detailed, I think, a little bit more this quarter versus last. And I think last quarter, Joel, you had made the comment that you'd want to wait. I guess just more curious in terms of your thoughts, if you can comment further? Are you bringing existing tenants? Are there tenants in that market that want to be in those locations? What's driving that decision and what's your kind of vision for the investment there? Joel Marcus : Yes, so that's a good question. So when it comes to Houston, one of our campus acquisitions was, in fact, made because of a specific tenant. And that tenant will grow there and will be an anchor a larger project. When it comes to Austin, we have a cohort of important lab tenants, both credit and noncredit who want to be in that market. It is a new market. It is one that is not an existing cluster probably will take a decade to start to gel and then probably another 15 years beyond that to get to that 25-year mark. But I think what intrigued us about Texas and Austin in general is - and I've made this statement before, if you look at what Steve Jobs said about the 21st century, it was the century the intersection of biology and technology. And so I think Texas is ripe for that intersection, and that's where this industry is really moving in an industrial fashion. So this is really kind of the first toe in the water with that thesis. Dave Rodgers : Great, thank you. Joel Marcus : Yes, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Tom Catherwood of BTIG. Please go ahead. Tom Catherwood : Thank you and Steve, thank you for everything and best of luck just one question from me. Hallie and Joel really appreciated the commentary on your different tenant segments at the onset. One thing that's always struck us though is the early insights that the company gets through the Alexandria investment platform and incubators like launch labs. On that early stage side of the business, are you getting any leading indicators suggesting a shift that could drive future changes in trends? And is that changing your investment strategy at all? Joel Marcus : So thank you for that question. Not really I mean I think the - I mean technology, and you saw the - if you looked at the cover of the press release and sub, we've highlighted Eikon Therapeutics based on Nobel Prize-winning technology and headed by Roger Perlmutter, who was CSO at Amgen. He was also Chief Scientific Officer at and Head of Research at Merck. And this is a great example of a using to some extent AI in the development of new innovative therapeutics. So clearly that intersection that I just talked about that Steve Jobs described is, we're certainly seeing way more of that today than we did before, but I think our early stage efforts are really aimed at focusing on the next Alnylam's or the next Moderna's, two companies that we became associated with Alnylam in 2003 that started in 3,500 square feet in our Science Hotel and Cambridge and Moderna that started early on in Tech Square a couple of years after it had been founded by the flagship team, and our hope is to find those kinds of companies that have just totally disruptive technologies and lots of product opportunities and shots on goal, because those are the things that are going to move the dial and move the needle when it comes to human health, and by the way, both are huge, huge tenants of ours in many respect. So it all kind of works out, but that's kind of where our focus is, I don't know Hallie if you want to comment. Hallie Kuhn : Yes, thanks, Joel. This is Holly, and I think you covered it well and to kind of parrot some of Joel's comments from earlier earnings calls, we're really in the early innings so to speak of these next-gen type therapies, is that when we think about gene therapies, cell therapies, mRNA therapies, we've seen a handful approved. But when you look at the stable of clinical and preclinical technologies, it's really mind-blowing how exponential it is and just repertoire of types of different therapies and types of different clients that companies are working on. So I would say we're early days and seen kind of what's the next generation of these therapies is going to look like. Tom Catherwood : Appreciate the color. Thanks everyone. Joel Marcus : Yes. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Georgi Dinkov of Mizuho. Please go ahead. Georgi Dinkov : Hi, thank you. First, congratulations on the strong quarter. And Steve, good luck to you. I guess, just a couple of quick questions for me, can you please remind us how you assess credit risk in both the property and the investment portfolio. Joel Marcus : I'm sorry. How you? Georgi Dinkov : How you assess credit risk in both the property and the investment portfolio. Joel Marcus : Well that's, we could write a treatise on that, when it comes to the investment portfolio, if you're looking at early-stage, we're looking at the things Hallie and I just described, great management teams, strong financial capability to attack some really big problems that have major unmet medical needs. I think when it comes to the tenants. We have a much different kind of focus, focus on stability, credit, opportunity. So they're kind of different in that sense, but both are rigorous and we've had a pretty highly disciplined and highly skilled team in place for a long, long time, which is why I think we've been able to do a really good job at those underwritings. Georgi Dinkov : Okay, great. That's helpful. Thank you. And just I guess my second question, you mentioned core office utilization is lower, and we see it in core office tenants giving back space. I'm just curious, have you seen any life science companies giving back like fewer core office? Joel Marcus : I don't think so. But I'd asked. Peter or Steve, have you seen that, I don't think so. Peter Moglia : Well, the laboratory, the office that is associated with our laboratories houses the scientists that are working in the labs and they need that space to do their work, they can't, it's not good lab practices to be in the lab writing things up. So it's typically not possible to just give back lab space -- sorry, office space because they need it, if they're working in the lab. Georgi Dinkov : Okay, great. Thank you. Stephen Richardson : They are fully integrated. Georgi Dinkov : Okay guys, thank you so much. That is all from me. Joel Marcus : Thank you. Operator : Our last question will come from Daniel Ismail of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. Daniel Ismail : Great. Thank you. Steve, I'd like to echo the comments on that. Thanking you for your help over the years and best wishes in retirement. Joel, just a quick question on the comments you made about the Texas expansion. We haven't seen the migration of life science tenant to the Sunbelt like we've seen in the traditional office sectors. Do you think this is a trend that will likely pick up for starts or do you think this is more of a one-off and that the growth of the cluster market will take the time that you stated earlier? Joel Marcus : Well, okay. Well, first of all, I think, by the way, we didn't have a slightly okay quarter, we had a really great quarter. So I would ask you to think about your comments on your review piece. Secondly, it's our intent like it was in New York, we started in New York, there was one incubator in New York alone, there was no other commercial companies really operating. There were a handful of companies, and we've either built or helped move or really helped create that market and so our intent is to do the same in Texas. We're not waiting for tenants just to haphazardly move there somehow, but we have a pretty strategic plan to work with tenants who want to move there. Remember, a lot of cities these days, and you could pick out the names have governance problems, homeless problems, crime problems, high taxes, poor governance. So there are a whole lot of folks very interested. We've seen that in financial services and now Citadel just announcing a big move from Chicago to Miami. So you're going to see with the 1,000 tenants I can tell you we have a whole lot of folks that want to move. Daniel Ismail : That makes sense. I appreciate it. And is cost of living a concern for the tenants or the cost of by science rents in these life sciences customers. Joel Marcus : So it's -- very compared to other business, a very small percentage of their overall cost structure. Daniel Ismail : Thanks. And then Peter, just the last question for you, in bidding terms in the last three months, I'm curious as you're out there acquiring assets or looking to sell assets, have those changed at, has become less competitive or more competitive or what have you seen in terms of bidding terms? Peter Moglia : As far as acquiring things I think there has been fewer buyers in the last couple of months as we've been kind of winding up our program, but pricing is for great quality land that hasn't really been moving down at all. And then in the dispositions, we tend to go to -- we kind of select who we'd like to have purchase our assets or JV with us. So it's hard to say, but I would say the interest in those folks that we typically approach with our opportunities has not waned and they are still very eager to get more exposure. Joel Marcus : Yes I mean, it's based on a pure scarcity of really high quality, well-located laboratory assets. I mean that's the equation Peters laid out. Daniel Ismail : Got it. Makes sense. Thanks a lot. Joel Marcus : Yes. Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks. Joel Marcus : Okay. Thank you everybody. And we'll look forward to our third quarter call. Be safe. Take care. God bless. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz with Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Paula Schwartz : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company\u2019s actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company\u2019s periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel. Joel Marcus : Thank you, Paula, and welcome everybody to the Alexandria\u2019s third quarter earnings call. With me today are Peter Moglia, Dean Shigenaga and Hallie Kuhn. First of all, thank you to our Alexandria family team for their continued exceptionalism in the phase of a challenging macro environment, mostly self-inflicted by a really deleterious set of government actions and policies, coupled with the Fed, which has been slow to act. I think I would characterize third quarter is really an exceptional quarter and when you look at earnings in this challenging macro environment delivering 9.2% and 8.3% FFO per share growth for the third quarter and then 2022 year-to-date is really exceptional especially again given the size and scope of the company with almost 75 million square feet in its total asset base. I\u2019d say the health and resilience of the broad and diverse life science sector, the niche, which we pioneered, remains strong and there is a continuing strong R&D investment, Hallie will speak to this. But in general, we\u2019ve seen life science R&D funding in 2021 approaching almost $500 billion. I think the number is actually about $480 billion, which is astounding and $1.8 trillion since 2017, and we expect totals in 2022 to be very strong continuation of that. I think it\u2019s also important to recognize that the strong life science sector employment trends remain positive, and the core strength of the life science industry and our key cluster markets remains resilient and continuing strong. And I think the overwriting macro observation would be the long-term healthcare needs of this country certainly aren\u2019t going away. Innovation in medicine is really a national imperative and just look at the mental health problem across this country as one simple example. And as I\u2019ve said many times before, there are about 10,000 known diseases to human kind and really that we\u2019ve only addressed as a society about 10% with addressable therapies and very few real cures. Biotech, I think, remains resilient. Clinical data, regulatory updates and M&A can be idiosyncratic events that really are unaffected by economic trends, and Hallie will talk about that. I think demand continues very solidly for our high-quality and well-located assets, which are really powered by asset level operational excellence, second to none. Alexandria has the greatest knowledge, and I think this is a pretty unique experience and expertise by orders of magnitude with respect to life science real estate niche, which we created and informed by our over 1,000 client tenants were 87%, an important number to remember, of our leasing comes from. We have a level of knowledge and understanding of the true life science real estate demand that just isn\u2019t out there if you hang a for lease sign and hire a broker. Alexandria continues to experience strong leasing spreads and rental rate increases. And I think we\u2019re very proud that we\u2019ve got 99.9% collections this quarter, truly stellar. Our industry-leading roster of the 1,000 tenants create drives and create stable long-term duration cash flows, and our high-quality and diverse industry mix is really unmatched. And I think one of the great stories of the day, I\u2019ll talk about in a moment, will be the balance sheet. But among industry-leading fundamental metrics for the third quarter, which are notable and Dean will talk about some of the details there, are a 10.6% same-store NOI growth increasing over the last few years and the significant strategic value creation harvesting of over $2 billion, which Peter will detail. And I think something we\u2019re very proud of having lived through the 2008, 2009, really financial crisis. And with this team steering the ship as an unrated REIT in those days, today we have matured and really have a fabulous fortress balance sheet. We\u2019ve worked very hard to put together over many years. I think it\u2019s important to note Alexandria out of 127 REITs as of June 30th has the second best debt maturity profile of all of them, and that\u2019s pretty amazing. Dean will highlight our liquidity of over $6 billion. And I think we were both, I think, strategically informed and I think executionally aware when we timely executed both equity and debt transactions in both January and February of 2022 earlier this year before the Ukraine invasion. And again, almost coming to the end of my comments, the strong and flexible balance sheet in addition to, I think, fabulous liquidity, our remaining debt term is over 13 years. Our average weighted average interest rate is about 3.5% and we\u2019ve got almost 96% of our debt, which is fixed rate and again no debt maturities into 2025. And I think as many of you know and we\u2019re working on, we are crafting a well-thought-through set of alternative plans for 2023, which we\u2019ll unveil at Investor Day. And as you look out at the world today and you just look at what happened at the PRC meeting this past week, where the President actually had his former person who turned over the reins of power to him kind of ushered out a little bit in front of the entire party Congress there. It creates the impression that we might not only have a ground war in Europe, but we might have a friction over Taiwan in a kinetic sense. And so that\u2019s something to think about. And so we\u2019re planning hard about all eventual outcomes that could be very significant black swan events to the United States of America. So with that, let me turn it over to Hallie. Hallie Kuhn : Thanks, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Hallie Kuhn, SVP of Science and Technology and Capital Markets. As Joel mentioned, today, I\u2019m going to provide an update on the life science fundamentals driving the long-term growth of the industry, tenant health and how Alexandria proactively work with the vanguard of this highly dynamic industry and a challenging macro environment to continue to grow our one-of-a-kind and truly world-class company. First and foremost, while we are in a cyclical downturn, innovative medicines take on average over 10 years to develop, meaning that the life science industry is not cyclical, but is largely event and product driven. And the life science industry is still in its early innings and poised for growth. As the recent expansion of complex modalities such as cell, gene and RNA-based therapies reflect, the pursuit for new and better medicines is truly the growth industry of this century, and there still remains immense challenges to solve. Every day in the U.S., an approximate 1,670 people will pass away from cancer, every four minutes today an individual will die from a stroke and every 37 seconds someone will pass away from heart disease. Not to mention, the 90% of known diseases that have no available treatment. While the macro market conditions are not to be taken lightly, the life science industry is on a steep, long-term growth trajectory. So where do the fundamentals stand to drive and sustain this long-term growth? I\u2019ll start by walking through the multiple sources of life science funding. Notably, through the third quarter of 2022, venture capital funds have raised an all-time high of $149 billion, eclipsing 2021\u2019s historic year with $144 billion raised. Given the average funds investment period is four to five years, the significant amount of dry powder will continue to translate into well-funded private biotech companies for years to come. Companies with the most innovative technologies and experienced founders and management teams continue to successfully raise capital, and we continue to see healthy demand across this segment. Moving on to the equity markets, while the IPO window largely remains closed, the market is responding positively to meaningful data readouts. As an example, two tenants in our San Francisco Bay Area region recently announced positive Phase 1 and Phase 1/2 clinical data, sending shares up 60% and 70% respectively. And just as a reminder, within the public biotech tenant category, the majority of our ARR comes from tenants with marketed products, including many large cap tenants with strong balance sheets such as Vertex and Moderna. Next, large pharma continues to outperform the broader markets with significant cash on hand to put towards internal growth and external M&A and partnerships, which is critical for biopharma as it looks to backfill their pipeline with innovative, new products. Biopharma R&D spend totaled $262 billion in 2021 with the top 20 biopharma putting on average over 20% of revenues back into R&D. Notably, at the end of the third quarter 17 out of the top 20 biopharma where Alexandria Tenants. A stat as of today has increased to 18 of the top 20 biopharma. While M&A has largely focused on bolt-on acquisitions, partnerships continue to be an important source of non-dilutive funding for private and small-to-mid bio cap companies. With respect to government funding, the NIH budget continues to increase year-over-year with broad by bipartisan support. The proposed 2023 budget is $49 billion, a 9% increase over 2022. This space total does not include an additional $12.1 billion proposed for pandemic preparedness and an additional $1.3 billion for program evaluation, which would bring the total NIH budget for 2023 to $62.5 billion. With respect to notable clinical and regulatory developments, this quarter saw critical late-stage clinical readouts and an accelerated approval for indications in schizophrenia, Alzheimer\u2019s and ALS, all of which are devastating diseases with limited treatment options. Tenant BioNTech also published promising early clinical data, demonstrating their novel mRNA therapies can train the body\u2019s immune system to identify and kill cancer cells. A testament to the opportunity of mRNA technology beyond COVID vaccines. On the regulatory front, the FDA continues to approve new therapies at a sustained pace, including 28 new drug approvals from the FDA\u2019s drug division, CDER, this year. The FDA\u2019s Biologic Division, CBER, approved two gene therapies just this quarter, increasing the total U.S. gene therapy approvals from two to four, and there are an astounding 500 cell and gene therapies in clinical development. The fundamentals remain strong amidst the backdrop of a volatile and uncertain economic conditions. Switching to tenant health, as our 99.9%, 3Q collections and historic tenure occupancy of 96% at test, our asset base is in a great position. As you can see on Page 17 of our sup., our life science tenant roster is diverse spanning multinational pharma, life science product service and devices, public and private biotech and institutions, and benchmarking ARE to just one of these segments does not capture the strength and depth of our asset base. Critically, maintaining the health of our over a 1,000 industry-leading tenant roster is not a static process, but a highly proactive effort that incorporates our deep understanding of the life science fundamentals, intimate knowledge of our tenants\u2019 work, preexisting relationships, and a dedicated and passionate team focused on best-in-class operational excellence. Our job is to engineer outcomes. This work comes in many shapes and sizes, whether it\u2019s creatively utilizing our over 40 million square feet operating asset base to provide critical space to accompany ahead of a future delivery or swapping a good but perhaps stagnant tenant with a fast growing tenant and taking advantage of the nearly 30% mark-to-market rental increases across our asset base, all with the goal of continued optimization of leases to innovative high credit tenants. I\u2019ll leave you with a quote from David Ricks, CEO of Eli Lilly, who we had the pleasure of hosting, for not one, but indeed two ribbon cuttings celebrating new Eli Lilly spaces at Alexandria properties just last week. In regards to the life science industry, he said, the games for winners are bigger than ever. Being nimble, fast and attuned to the outside world and having the right people, all these basics matter more than ever. Indeed, this is a sentiment that applies broadly beyond the life science industry and is one we hold deeply at Alexandria. With that, I will pass it off to Peter. Peter Moglia : Thank you, Hallie. I would like to start by thanking all the teams of the company for your never-ending dedication, high quality work product, and collaborative spirit that made Steve\u2019s transition to retirement seamless as we all expected it would be. Steve continues to be actively involved in certain projects and we consider him an invaluable resource to the executive management team. Since Steve is no longer on the calls, I\u2019ll cover leasing as well as updating you on other key topics of the day, such as the development pipeline, construction costs, and the harvesting of our value creation. As we sit here today, Alexandria has an equity market cap and credit rating in the top 10% among all publicly traded U.S. equity REITs. A North American asset base of 74.5 million square feet, 431 properties in operation, development, or redevelopment, and over a 1,000 innovative tenants to inform our investment and operating strategies. We should note that it has taken over 28 years to reach these milestones. One cannot create such a dominant position in an industry overnight, and it takes far more than great real estate to do it. Our vast network, operational excellence and technical know-how are just a few of the many reasons we are one of a kind company in a class by ourselves. The life science industry has grown significantly in recent years with the success of new modalities such as mRNA and cell therapy, and we have grown along with it by capturing the majority of investment opportunities that have come about from those inventions and others. With the onset of market volatility, we are seeing a normalization of demand, and although in the near term we don\u2019t anticipate seeing the same level of activity we saw in our record breaking year of 2021, we continue to see healthy demand manifesting into solid leasing numbers. With respect to the leasing of our value creation pipeline, which is expected to add approximately $645 million in incremental annual rental revenue from 4Q 2022 through the third quarter of 2025, we leased approximately 330,000 square feet in the third quarter. Although that total is approximately one third of the record-breaking 2021 quarterly average, it is 18% higher than the previous five-year average, indicating we have returned to a normal run rate of leasing. With that leasing, our 7.6 million square feet of projects under construction and pre-leased near-term projects reached 78% leased, up 4% over last quarter. During the quarter, we delivered approximately 330,000 square feet at a weighted average yield of 7.1%, which will add approximately $30 million in annualized NOI to our P&L. Transitioning to overall leasing. The third quarter results continue to demonstrate Alexandria\u2019s ability to outperform even in turbulent times due to our significant differentiation among all who seek to participate in life science real estate, which can be summarized with four unassailable attributes. Irreplaceable AAA locations adjacent or in close proximity to the country\u2019s best life science research institutions; operational excellence in the running of our tenants\u2019 mission-critical facilities; mega campuses providing highly valued optionality, scalability and amenities; and a curated roster of over 1,000 tenants, including the most impactful and creditworthy research companies and entities in the world, providing unmatched industry insight. Despite current macroeconomic conditions, demand for Alexandria\u2019s best-in-class facilities continues to be at pre-2021 normal run rate. Examples of this include, in the third quarter, leasing volume was 1,662,069 rentable square feet which is above our 10-year quarterly average of 1.3 million square feet and well above our pre-2021 five-year average of 1.1 million square feet. Year-to-date leasing volume of 6.4 million square feet is above our five-year average of 6 million square feet, and we still have the fourth quarter to add to these totals. In the third quarter, cash and GAAP increases continued to be very healthy, with 22.6% cash increase and a 27.1% GAAP increase. Our operating asset mark-to-mark continues to be healthy at approximately 30%. In our quarterly examination of construction costs, the theme that jumps out at us is that overall cost and supply chain issues are starting to ease, but contractors don\u2019t trust what may happen tomorrow. The disruption brought about by COVID in 2020 was exacerbated by the stimulus implemented to mitigate it, and as we all know, has led to inflation not seen since Jimmy Carter\u2019s presidency. This inflation caused serious losses to the construction industry as contractors were legally bound to deliver projects within lump sum or gross maximum budgets that had become grossly underfunded with every passing month as the economy opened and pent-up demand for construction materials and labor through the system violently out of equilibrium. These losses have caused contractors to keep pricing high despite anticipated reductions in cost. Therefore, we need to remain cautious about projecting any easing of conditions until the construction market can be confident, another sue is not going to drop and that time has not come yet. It\u2019s easy to understand this mindset because evidence of an easing is only anecdotal at this point. Steel, copper, lumber and labor costs had shown signs of leveling off, but escalations from the third quarter of 2021 to the third quarter of 2022 totaled 12.3%, well above normal. And lumber just spiked again two weeks ago. That said, supply has started to catch up with demand. Inventories and materials are still low, but improving. Freight transportation is trending down contractor backlogs, though strong through 2023, are finding openings due to canceled projects and fewer new projects are starting. This opening up of capacity has slowly returned the ability for general contractors to get three bids from some subs. Grassroots to normalization, you could call it. But there are storm clouds on the horizon in the form of billions of dollars of work anticipated to build mega chip factories and the $1.2 trillion infrastructure investment and Jobs Act signed into law last November, which could roll back any easing of construction chain conditions. Overall, we do expect construction costs to begin reverting to the mean due to the easing of contractor backlogs and relatively better availability of materials, but Alexandria will continue to conservatively underwrite construction cost escalations in our pro formas. We have a deep and experienced team that works in lockstep with our underwriters to ensure we are accounting for the latest trends in our current and future projects. Interest rates continue to wreak havoc on investment markets, and we feel fortunate that our scarce product type continues to be in demand during such a turbulent time. Evidence of this can be seen on Page 5 of the supplemental, where we present the results of certain asset dispositions, which have raised $2.2 billion in capital to-date, including $1.26 billion in the third quarter. Included in those dispositions was the completion of the previously announced partial interest land sale at 1450 Owens and Mission Bay to a development JV partner for a land value of $324 per buildable foot. The sale of a portfolio of assets spanning the submarkets of South San Francisco and Greater Stanford for a 5.2% cash cap rate. A one-off asset along the I-15 corridor for a 5.3% cap rate, two assets on Carol Road and Sereno Mesa for a 4.6% cap rate, a partial interest sale of a campus in Sereno Mesa for a 4.6% cap rate and the partial interest sale of a high-quality asset in Merryfield Row and Torrey Pines for a 4.1% cap rate. The low five cap rates achieved in the San Francisco portfolio and the I-15 sale in San Diego are indicative of the age of the assets. Still attractive workhorse assets, they do not reflect the higher end profile of our core. The strong sub-five cap rates for the partial interest sale of the Summers Ridge campus and the Carol Road assets are more representative of our asset base. The Merryfield Row asset is purpose-built lab by Alexandria and like many of our other purpose-built assets is one of the best located and most attractive asset and its submarket. In this case, Torrey Pines. The 4.1% cap rate was influenced by the growth in rents in Torrey Pines since the lease was signed, but the lease is almost 12-years of term remaining before that upside can be realized. So it\u2019s quality and location really drove the value. I\u2019d also like to note that the scarcity value we talk about being a driver for keeping our cap rates lower relative to other product types can be seen in transactions by others. Just last month, Biogen completed a sale leaseback in Cambridge for $2,185 price per square foot value and the Carlyle Group sold a 77,000 square foot Blackstone Science Square building in Mid-Cambridge for a 4.1% cap rate at a price just short of $2,000 per square foot. As the Fed continues to pull levers to battle inflation, we expect we will see cap rates move up, but much less on a relative to other product types and thus, we remain well positioned to fund our value creation pipeline efficiently and at a relatively attractive pricing by harvesting our value creation among other sources. With that, I\u2019ll pass the call over to Dean. Dean Shigenaga : Thanks, Peter. Dean here. Good afternoon, everyone. Our team delivered on truly remarkable results for both the three and nine months ended September 30. Total revenues were up 20.5% and 24.8% for the three and nine months of 2022 in comparison to 2021. FFO per share diluted as adjusted for the three and nine months was $2.13 and $6.28, up 9.2%, 8.3% over 2021 and importantly, beat consensus. The strong financial and operating results reflect the strength of our brand, our scale, high quality and well-located properties and operational excellence, serving the mission-critical needs of some of the most innovative entities in the world. Congratulations to our entire team for truly outstanding executions over many quarters. This really stands out within the REIT industry, especially during this very challenging macro environment. Our strong balance sheet and liquidity management highlights truly awesome execution by our team over many years. Our team is very pleased to have earned our corporate credit ratings that rank in the top 10% of the REIT industry. We are also very pleased to have further improved the strength of our balance sheet in the third quarter with a significant increase in liquidity. We completed an amendment to our line of credit, increasing aggregate commitments to $4 billion, up $1 billion over the prior credit facility. A huge thank you to our important lending relationships for providing significant liquidity for our company. Our total liquidity as of September 30 is now very significant at $6.4 billion. We are one of the very few REITs with no debt maturities until 2025. 96% of our outstanding debt represents long-term fixed rate debt and the percentage of fixed rate debt is expected to be even higher by the end of the year. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA is on track to hit our 5.1 times target by year-end. Our total outstanding debt has a weighted average rate of 3.52% and a weighted average maturity of 13.2 years. The execution of our capital plan this year was exceptional given the macro environment. We did $1.8 billion of 12 and 30-year bonds with a weighted average rate of 3.28% in a term of 22 years, which was completed in February. Most of our common equity for 2022 was completed in the first quarter and entirely completed by June 30. And then we turn to continued execution of our strategic value harvesting through outright sales and partial interest sales of real estate. Through September 30, we\u2019ve completed $2.2 billion in sales, including $1 billion in the third quarter with gains or consideration in excess of book value of $1.2 billion, which is really significant value creation. Now, our focus on real estate dispositions for 2022 leaves us with an advantage at year-end with about $250 million of cash that will reduce our debt needs for 2023. As we look forward, we will remain disciplined and careful with our allocation of capital. Briefly on dividends, our Board has been consistent over the past decade with growth in common stock dividends year-to-year, supported by strong growth in cash flows and our low FFO payout ratio, which is generally in the range of 55% to 60%. Cash flows from operating activities after dividends are projected at the mid-point to be about $300 million for 2022, and to put this into perspective, over an approximate three-year period, this represents approximately $1 billion for reinvestment. Now ARE pioneered our favorable lease structure with contractual annual escalations approximately 3%, triple net leases that provide for the recovery of operating expenses and the recovery of major capital expenditures. Now, our team also curated a tenant roster of high-quality tenants, including 49% of our annual rental revenue from investment-grade and large-cap publicly traded entities. Occupancy is up 30 basis points since the beginning of the year and is expected to continue to increase by year-end, highlighting the strength of our brand and trusted partnership with our tenants. EBITDA margins 69% really reflects the operational excellence and operating efficiency of our business, and this also represents an industry-leading statistic. Leasing was very solid in the third quarter at 1.7 million rentable square feet with rental rate growth on lease renewals and re-leasing a space of 27.1% and 22.6% on a cash basis. TIs and leasing commissions on lease renewals and re-leasing the space for the nine months were down about 20% in comparison to the full year of 2021. And the third quarter included two long-term lease extensions of roughly 10 years with a 47% increase in net effective rent. Now, excluding these two long-term lease extensions with somewhat elevated TIs and leasing commissions in the third quarter, TIs and leasing commissions would have been relatively minor at approximately $25 per square foot. Same-property NOI growth has been very strong for the nine months ended September 30 at 7% and 8.9% on a cash basis. And to put this into perspective, our 10-year average same-property NOI growth was 3.6% and 6.6% on a cash basis. The outperformance in 2022 relative to this 10-year average was driven primarily by 110 basis point year-to-date growth in occupancy with about a 2 times benefit to net operating income. And then really outsized benefit from significant early lease renewals that commenced very early in 2022, providing for a full year benefit this year. Now, we continue to make excellent progress on leasing. Contractual lease expirations for 2023 represents only 6.6% of annual rental revenue down from 9% as of the second quarter. Now importantly, 2023 contractual lease expirations representing only 70% or 4.6% of our annual rental revenue remains in the category of too early to tell, meaning not already leased, not under negotiation or not targeted for redevelopment. Turning to venture investments. These investments have generated consistent gains averaging about $25.4 million, which is included in FFO as adjusted over the last eight quarters. This is very solid and very consistent. Now, it\u2019s important to highlight that on average over the last six years, only \u2013 about only 30% of the realized gains included in FFO were generated from our investments in publicly traded securities, 70% were generated from investments in privately held entities. Gross unrealized gains as of September 30 were $529 million, including $102 million and $427 million from publicly traded and privately held entities respectively. Lastly on guidance, we updated our guidance for 2022 and narrowed the range for EPS and FFO per share from a range of $0.06 or range of $0.02 per share. Our 2022 guidance for EPS diluted is a range of $5.70 to $5.72 and FFO per share as adjusted diluted is a range from $8.40 to $8.42 with no change in the mid-point of $8.41. As a reminder, we are about four weeks away from the issuance of our detailed guidance for 2023. And therefore, we are unable to comment on details for 2023. With that, let me turn it back to Joel. Joel Marcus : Thanks, Dean. And if we could go to questions, please? Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Griffin from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Michael Griffin : Peter, it seemed like you talked pretty favorably about the properties, the attractive cap rate, particularly at the [indiscernible] asset in San Diego. I\u2019m curious if these properties are so attractive, why did it make sense to dispose of these? Peter Moglia : Just we have a number of properties on the docket to do the same thing, too. We\u2019re recycling capital, putting it back into great projects we have in our value creation pipeline. So it was efficient capital to harvest and reinvest. Joel Marcus : Well, and I think one of the other things is we have some fabulously large opportunities up on the Mesa and Torrey Pines, two very large-scale development sites that we\u2019re working on. And so we have no shortage of Class A opportunities in the best submarket in San Diego. Nick Joseph : This is Nick Joseph here with Michael. You touched on the macro concerns and Black Swan events and disruption in the construction market. So when you blend that all together, how do you think about the impact on development plans at least in the near-term? Peter Moglia : Joel, are you taking that? Joel Marcus : Could you repeat the question? Nick Joseph : Yes. It\u2019s on development starts. And I think in your prepared remarks, you kind of laid out some of the macro concerns, you talked about China, you talked about potential for Black Swan events. And then later, you talked about disruption in the construction market and maybe not seeing pricing come back yet. And so I\u2019m wondering how that plays into your expectations on near-term development starts. Joel Marcus : Yes. I think we\u2019ll \u2013 if you\u2019ll hold your question to Investor Day, I think we\u2019ll be able to give you a very good view of that. And I think we have an interesting set of alternative plans given what may unfold in 2023, given how we think about Plan A, Plan B and Plan C that might unfold out in the general economy. But I think it\u2019s fair to say and Dean can comment where we have very strong leasing opportunities, we\u2019ll clearly look for ways to accelerate those opportunities and fund them carefully with the best sources of capital. But Dean, I don\u2019t know if you want to comment any further. I think we wait until Investor Day to give you a eyeballs view of that. Dean Shigenaga : Yes, I think what I would just add to Joel\u2019s comments is that we sit in a pretty unique position. We have the benefit of some of the best located land parcels for life science use in these core cluster markets and really positioned from the standpoint of optionality is the best way of thinking about it. Meaning, we have the tenant roster that, as Joel mentioned, 87% of our leasing activity comes from. We have the land sites. So we really have the option to meet the demand. So we have that flexibility. And so I think that\u2019s the best way of thinking about our pipeline. It gives us options. We don\u2019t have to address it, but it gives us plenty of options. Nick Joseph : Maybe just a follow up on that, just with the impairment charge in the quarter. Can you walk through that project and kind of the decision to walk away from it? Dean Shigenaga : Sure. It\u2019s Dean here. So as you know, the disclosures we had about a little bit more than $38 million in impairment charges. It was primarily related to 1 project that which we no longer chose to proceed forward with. It was a development project, about 600,000 rentable square feet. The parcel was located in California. We did not own the land. We had pretty significant cost incurred, but it was really our investment to date, which was significantly related to the entitlement work for the site. And the reason for not moving forward with the project was very specific to the financial outlook for the project. There was no lease, re-lease negotiation related to the project to be clear. And beyond that, I guess, we\u2019re not in a position to comment much further on the project. But as you\u2019ve heard from us on this call and over the last several quarters, it\u2019s really important to keep in perspective that we did lease about 2.7 million rentable square feet of development and redevelopment space just in the first three quarters of 2022. So it\u2019s very specific to the project. Nick Joseph : Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Anthony Paolone from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Anthony Paolone : Thanks and hi everybody. Your 7 near-term development projects that you plan to start, are those yields locked up? Or is there any room for movement there if the environment changes here given what\u2019s happened to rates or where do those stand? Joel Marcus : Yes. So Dean, do you want to comment on that? Dean Shigenaga : Yes. By and large, they\u2019re getting close to being locked up in the sense of \u2013 as you go through a lease negotiation and execute a lease, both sides of the relationship landlord and tenant will work through a fairly detailed budget. Once the lease is executed, the tenant moves forward their side to refine their cost estimates as they get into really the details. So big picture, we have a sense of the yields. The exact yields will be refined as the tenant finalizes the extreme details of their build-out. And then on the cost side, as you\u2019ve heard from us for many quarters now, we do build in contingencies to protect us from construction cost escalations. And as we usually do, we\u2019ll make disclosures of those yields as soon as we can. And generally, that time line is consistent with once the tenant finalizes the details of their project design. So it usually lags disclosures of lease-up. But I think the important thing to recognize is we had no changes in cost at completion for any of our projects on an unfavorable \u2013 from an unfavorable perspective nor on yields. We did have one project that had an increase in cost at completion, but it corresponded with a pretty significant increase in revenue as well. So we\u2019re generating for solid return on the incremental capital. So our team has done a tremendous job managing costs in a very unusual environment when you have to consider supply chain considerations and just continued escalations in construction costs. Anthony Paolone : Okay. I mean should we think about just expected development yields to go higher given just incrementally higher funding costs? Or I guess, to Peter\u2019s point, maybe they don\u2019t go up quite as much as rates. Just trying to think about where that could go as we start to think about the next round of starts. Dean Shigenaga : I think it\u2019s tough, Tony, to speculate about yields on a specific project because every project is very unique, the location, the nature of the build, the complexity of the build and specifically the back and forth negotiation with our relationship tenants. I would say, generally speaking, we\u2019ll do the best we can to push yields in the right direction upwards by managing our construction costs carefully looking for opportunities to become more efficient, but that\u2019s not a simple task as we all know, you can\u2019t just cut cost. You have to do that very carefully. And hopefully, the rental rate environment continues to support upward movement in that direction, which would translate hopefully into ongoing upward direction in returns or yields. But Tony, just I don\u2019t want to speculate specifically. Every deal is very unique, and we\u2019ll take those decisions incrementally when they do come up. Joel Marcus : Yes. I mean, Tony, the one thing to think about what Dean just discussed about yields, how that bears on our decision-making is useful to think about our decision not to go forward with that specific project. So that clearly is \u2013 weighs on our decision to go or not to go in every single case. Anthony Paolone : Got it. If I could just ask 1 just clarifying question on the accounting. The \u2013 your gains and losses that are realized on the investment book that go through FFO, is that based on the most recent mark against what you realized your original cost? Dean Shigenaga : Generally, it\u2019s the original cost, Tony, unless for some reason, over the years, we\u2019ve taken a write-down, which is a realized loss, i.e., in impairment. But traditionally, it\u2019s against the \u2013 more often than not, it\u2019s against our original cost basis, Tony. And I would also just point out that the key drivers between or around realized gains in our venture portfolio is really driven by liquidity events. So they\u2019re natural events. Occasionally on the public side, which is only about 30% of our gains historically over the last six years, I mean, we ultimately sell a handful of public securities and that\u2019s what ultimately drives some of the gains on the public side. But it\u2019s a small piece of the overall mix on average. Anthony Paolone : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Steve Sakwa : Yes. Thanks. Good afternoon. I was just wondering, Peter, if you could talk a little bit more about the demand trends that you\u2019re seeing, maybe by the type of tenant, by broad industry and maybe by your key clusters. You are seeing better demand on the West Coast, up in Boston, New York. Any color on regional demand would be helpful. Joel Marcus : Yes. So this is Joel. Hey Steve and welcome back. I think we\u2019d like not to answer that question at a granular level. I think it\u2019s pretty proprietary and as we said, 87% of our leases this quarter, for example, came from our tenant base. And I think it would not be useful for us to go into granular detail on that. But I can tell you and Peter can comment broadly demand is solid in all of our markets at the moment. Peter Moglia : Yes. I\u2019d agree with that and as it consistent with my comments, I would say it\u2019s a normalized rate that corresponds to the last few years if you take out 2021, which was an outlier. But it\u2019s broad. And it\u2019s still, we\u2019ve talking about it for a while how all of our clusters have been doing well that continues to be the case. Joel Marcus : Yes, and I would add a gloss on that, Steve. Think about what both Hallie and I said this is not a \u2013 these are episodic \u2013 this is an episodic industry, so to speak, not really driven macroeconomically. And so demand often is generated by clinical data readouts, regulatory readouts and updates and sometimes M&A where somebody buys a company and then wants to expand. We\u2019ve seen that. We\u2019ve seen it on the other hand where they may buy a company and roll it up, but oftentimes companies are bought for their talent unless you\u2019ve got a kind of just a product opportunity. So I think that\u2019s how you have to think about it. Steve Sakwa : Great. And then second question, maybe just on the dispose, Peter, I know you provided a fair amount of detail on the cap rates. I\u2019m just curious, the depth of the buyer pool and maybe how it\u2019s changed? And do you have a sense for kind of where unlevered IRR expectations are for buyers of the various products that you transacted on in the last quarter? Peter Moglia : We\u2019ve had a consistent buyer pool and all of our activities over the last few years. We generally try to keep it limited. We don\u2019t want to disperse too much information to a broad audience. And those players have continued to show up for our deals and it has resulted in the cap rates. So, on an unlevered IRR basis, yes, I\u2019m sure that it\u2019s higher than it was. I know in the peak times people were underwriting to a 5 or less. I can\u2019t tell you what they\u2019re doing today, but obviously it\u2019s gone up. But with our product type, the rental growth, you can pay a 4 something cap rate. And with the annual increases in our leases and with market rent growth, you can exceed 6%, 7% pretty easily on an unlevered basis these days. Steve Sakwa : Great. Thanks. Appreciate it. That\u2019s it for me. Joel Marcus : Yes. Thanks, Steve. Operator : The next question comes from Rich Anderson from SMBC. Please go ahead. Rich Anderson : Thanks. Good afternoon. One of the things that sort of emerged from periods of dislocation, like seen in the REITs in the past as well as in biotech is increased M&A activity and its aftermath. We certainly saw some of that in the REIT space post-pandemic. I\u2019m wondering, if you have a similar expectation in biotech. I know there\u2019s been some sort of fringe type of activity, but is there an opportunity to see more in the way of M&A as a sort of indicator of emerging health from that space? And if so, do you see it as a benefit to you in terms of future leasing and so on? Joel Marcus : Yes, so maybe I\u2019ll comment generally and ask Hallie to also comment. I think Rich I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see any blockbuster M&A deals big company to big company or even big company to moderate size companies that impact what is perceived to be some competitive situation in a therapeutic class. The FTC I think under this administration has been fairly hostile to almost every kind in every industry get together because they claim it\u2019s always not competitive or it diminishes competition, somehow increased prices. So I think that\u2019s \u2013 I mean, we\u2019ve seen this play out a little bit with Illumina and GRAIL, and GRAIL was spun out of Illumina, so none of that makes particular sense. But I think it\u2019s fair to say we will see and I think Hallie mentioned this and continue to see, we just saw recently Lilly just bought a bolt-on acquisition of a hearing loss company. I think you\u2019re going to continue to see a range of bolt-on acquisitions for product opportunities. And I think sometimes it\u2019s going to be a positive, sometimes it may not be. But overall, historically, if we look back at our 25 years of public company, it\u2019s been generally pretty positive for us. But Hallie, any other thoughts you have? Hallie Kuhn : Yes, I agree with everything you mentioned, Joel. And maybe just to say that depending on the company and the outcome, it\u2019s positive for the ecosystem whether or not there\u2019s a real estate outcome. Thinking about some of the bolt-on acquisitions where it really is product driven, we see those executives go off to start new companies. We have deep existing relationships with them. They often go on to establish and grow their next large biotech. So in the long run, these events are positive for the ecosystem. There are a number of examples where M&A over the years has led to really sizable footprints. BMS in San Diego is a great example of that over time with their acquisition of Signal about two decades ago, and then Celgene. And then as you saw in the first quarter this year, we announced their 420,000 square foot in development with us in San Diego. So over time, the acquisitions definitely can lead to additional space needs, but it\u2019s very dependent on the type of acquisition. And again, the overall net positive for the ecosystem is really great as investors go to put their returns to work in terms of new companies and founders go off to start new endeavors as well. Rich Anderson : Okay, great. I\u2019ll leave it with that. Thanks very much. Joel Marcus : Thanks, Rich. Operator : The next call comes from, excuse me, next question comes from Georgi Dinkov from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Georgi Dinkov : Thank you for taking my questions. I guess, you mentioned that\u2026 Joel Marcus : It\u2019s hard to hear you. So could you maybe speak closer to the mic? Georgi Dinkov : Yes. Can you hear me now? Joel Marcus : Oh, perfect. Georgi Dinkov : Okay. Sorry about that. Yes. So you just mentioned that supply is catching up with demand. So my question is, which markets have the most supplier risk? And how do you think about competition from office conversion? Joel Marcus : Well, that\u2019s a complicated question. I\u2019m not sure we have the time or ability on this call to go in market-by-market, not sure we want to do it. But I mean, I think if you look at New York as a great example. We\u2019ve pioneered the first commercial life science center and campus in New York City. There\u2019s millions and millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions of square feet, and there are a number of projects that are being worked on there. The demand has been fairly modest. It\u2019s early stage. And it\u2019s pretty clear that literally almost most buildings in New York can\u2019t be converted from office to laboratory and probably wouldn\u2019t want to be given the market. So, I think you have to look at that on a submarket-by-submarket basis. I don\u2019t even think you could look at it as an overall market-by-market basis. And we know from Boston, there have been a handful of conversions. We know, in particular, a recent case downtown, where somebody kind of jury-rigged an office building, brought in some smaller tenants, and we know the smaller tenants have experience both for the developer who\u2019s never done it before and the tenant massive cost overruns on that conversion. So \u2013 but as I say, just look at, again, 87% of our leases come from our existing tenants, we feel very good about our ability to continue to generate steady demand in these markets. And we\u2019ve been through the cycles. We are through the cycle in 2000, 2001, the big tech up bus bubble, if you will, and 2008 and 2009 with a big financial crisis. So, we\u2019re fully prepared and I think our portfolio or asset base really is in great shape. Georgi Dinkov : Okay. And given the rising recession concerns, how should we think about tenant credit risk or large cap, mid-cap or small cap biotech? And do you see any risk to occupancy in a downturn? Joel Marcus : Yes. So, we\u2019ve been very protected. I don\u2019t know, Hallie, do you want to comment on that? Because you\u2019ve had a number of conversations about the health of the \u2013 and the diversity of our tenant base and the credit quality. Hallie Kuhn : Yes, absolutely. So, I direct you to look at Page 17 of our supplemental, which has a breakdown by ARR of our business types across the life science industry. And as we\u2019d like to stress on other calls, small and mid-cap is a very small percentage of our overall tenant base. And what we\u2019ve done as well in the past two quarters has broken down our public biotech segment by marketed products versus preclinical and clinical products. And as you can see, the majority are marketed. And these are, as mentioned on the call, there\u2019s companies like Vertex, Moderna folks with incredibly large balance sheets and cash to deploy. It\u2019s important to know that our team and our diligence process is truly unique. We have a number of folks, including myself, with PhD backgrounds across the biotechnology space that significantly underwrite these companies, understand what their risk profile is, what their opportunity and growth profile are and then monitor them extensively as they progress. So all things put together, we have a really strong set of companies across all of our different business types, which collectively reflect the strength of our asset base. Peter Moglia : Yes. And this is Peter. You should harken back to Hallie\u2019s comments in the beginning, where she talked about the fact that it takes, on average, about 10 years to get something to the clinic. So demand for life science real estate is much more inelastic and can\u2019t necessarily be varied due to current macroeconomic conditions. The companies need to continue to press on to get their revenue-producing project to market. We look \u2013 we did a look back to the great financial crisis a little while ago and noticed that the change in occupancy from the start to the end was negligible. I think it was maybe a 40 basis point swing at the trough. So our business is extremely resilient and it needs to be \u2013 or just because of the industry\u2019s profile, it will continue to be, nothing\u2019s changed from that aspect. Georgi Dinkov : Great. Thank you. That\u2019s all for me. Joel Marcus : Yes. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Dave Rogers from Baird. Please go ahead. Dave Rogers : Hi good afternoon everybody. Dean, I wanted to start with you. I realize that you guys are going to wait maybe until Investor Day to talk about funding for projects you haven\u2019t started yet. I was just wondering maybe if, Dean, you could give us a little sense of kind of your plan with cash flow, cash on hand and the recent sales to fund the stuff that you\u2019ve already started that you still have to complete going forward. Dean Shigenaga : Hey Dave, it\u2019s Dean here. So, I guess as you acknowledge, we\u2019re going to get into the details of our plan for 2023 in about four weeks at Investor Day. Maybe some high-level thoughts on the capital plan that you\u2019re looking at on our active projects with a handful of projects that we\u2019ve committed in the near term that are leased. So, we have about 7.6 million square feet. It\u2019s 78% leased and this pipeline can generate $645 million of incremental net operating income, which is just spectacular. If you look at the most recent starts or the stuff that\u2019s pending to start near term, just call it some projects could take up to three years to finish. NOI will commence quarter-to-quarter, as you would expect, even starting next quarter on this pipeline. I highlighted earlier that if you look out over about a three-year period at our current run rate for cash flows from operating activities after dividends over three years, you\u2019ve got $1 billion to reinvest. Equity capital \u2013 equity type capital for our pipeline includes this \u2013 we probably are sitting on about $6.8 billion of equity type capital and it\u2019s this $1 billion of cash flows that I just mentioned, we had about 1.5 billion of outstanding forward equity contracts. And then obviously, our CIT [ph] related to just the $645 million of incremental NOI is all that stuff\u2019s broad equity type capital. Some of it\u2019s incurred, some of it\u2019s future cash flows. But if you look at that, some number approaching almost $7 billion that are typical leverage profile, assuming a five one year end target for net debt to adjusted EBITDA. This pipeline will generate probably 3.3 billion or something in that range of debt funding. That\u2019s roughly one third debt, two-thirds equity on a leverage neutral basis. So as the EBITDA starts to come online, you can fund quite a bit from a debt perspective as well. And so those are the numbers I would keep in mind broadly. We obviously continue to focus on real estate dispositions, given the strength of the private market values and the scarcity of our assets as Peter has been highlighting for a number of quarters. Obviously, over the next three years, each of the years or every year is very different. And therefore, the funding needs for each year will vary. Basically, there\u2019s different timing from commencement of NOI and construction spend in each of the years, but it\u2019s really important to point out that there is a path forward if we had to navigate a period without access to the capital markets. So call it, if the capital markets were shut for three years. And I think from a risk management perspective or team analyzes this every quarter. And we do find comfort in the results, obviously, this is clearly not an operating scenario we would expect for three years. And I call it, one bookend scenario that you must evaluate from a risk management perspective. So I don\u2019t want to get into specifics for 2023, but hopefully those broad strokes help you understand that. We\u2019re reasonably well positioned in a \u2013 to address a, what could become even more challenging environment. We look forward to presenting the details of our outlook for 2023 at our Investor Day in late November. Dave Rogers : We really appreciate that, Dean, that was helpful. And just one follow up from me, maybe to Joel or to Peter. Clearly, you\u2019re getting the rent that you need on the development. So that\u2019s continuing to grow and keep pace remotely with it sounds like inflation. What are you seeing on just market rent growth? You gave the mark-to-market earlier, but and obviously your spreads continue to kind of grab those \u2013 that mark-to-market. But I\u2019m curious on what you\u2019re seeing in market rents, maybe even a band. You don\u2019t have to go market-by-market, but what you\u2019re seeing kind of across the country? Joel Marcus : Yes, so Peter, I don\u2019t know if you want to comment. I think, we\u2019re still seeing rent growth in almost not necessarily all of our markets, but in almost all of our markets. It certainly won\u2019t keep pace with the hockey puck growth that you\u2019ve seen over the last year or two, the kind of COVID years. But I think it remains, I mean, just look at the numbers we posted this quarter and last quarter was an indication of kind of where things are and how they look like they\u2019re kind of settling out on a normal run rate. But Peter, I don\u2019t know if you want to comment macro. Peter Moglia : Yes, I mean, supply continues to be tight. So as new opportunities come about we are \u2013 we have continued to increase rents. We\u2019ve \u2013 and what we typically, even in our new developments as we lease them up, that they do tick up a percent or two over time. So I guess macro wise, without trying to predict what the actual percentages are, they are still increasing at this point in time and we don\u2019t see any evidence that that\u2019s going to slow down. Joel Marcus : Yes, and I think, again, you have to look at that question really almost has to be asked submarket-by-submarket, not market-by-market, Dave. Dave Rogers : Well, I appreciate the color. Joel Marcus : What goes on in Cambridge is going to be far different than what goes on in Somerville, for example. Dave Rogers : No, that makes sense. We\u2019ll look forward to getting into more details probably at the Investor Day. So Joel and Peter, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Tom Catherwood from BTIG. Please go ahead. Tom Catherwood : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Peter, hey, looping back on the supply question. During prior quarters, you\u2019ve mentioned that obviously you track all the planned or proposed development that\u2019s out there in your markets and redevelopments obviously. But you\u2019ve also commented that you didn\u2019t think all of those were going to make it to market or get started. Given, the recent movement and rates and kind of lack of capital availability, have you seen any pull back in those starts? Or do you feel even more convinced that you\u2019re not going to see all those come to market in the near to medium term? Peter Moglia : Yes, and we have been receiving some anecdotes of projects that were on the radar that are not going to happen. Even a couple that started construction that paused, I mean, I talked about cost escalations in my prepared remarks, and they continue to wreak havoc and go into a lot of percentages because I didn\u2019t want to talk for 20 minutes. But just year-over-year from Q2 2021, I\u2019m sorry, Q3 2021 to Q3 2022, they were about 13.5%. So it has just become very expensive and I think that\u2019s giving a lot of sobering up a lot of people that were ready to jump in and try to get involved. So we don\u2019t expect there to be a huge supply problem in any of our markets. From what we see under construction it looks to be a fairly normal rate in a normal environment at this point. And as long as that continues everyone\u2019s being rational. We should continue to see good rent growth, not 2021 rent growth, but not the hockey stick that we experienced that Joel referenced. But good, and usually over time, we\u2019ve exceeded inflation. And I\u2019m not saying we\u2019re going to do that now with the inflation numbers, but as soon as inflation normalizes, I would imagine that we would continue to exceed it. Joel Marcus : Yes. But again, you have to take that supply issue submarket-by-submarket again, what supply might be in Cambridge versus what it might be in Somerville. It\u2019s talking about like night and day out a handful of years. So you have to think about, you can\u2019t generalize even do a market about supply, but it\u2019s pretty clear in addition to I think the important points Peter raised about either capital pausing or operators pausing. I think it\u2019s pretty clear cities are having and other jurisdictions, it\u2019s just tougher to get things approved, they\u2019re requiring more concessions. Residential is becoming a big \u2013 a big issue. We know in some jurisdictions if you don\u2019t have a resi as part of your project you\u2019re in a long line. If you have it, you may go to the head of the line. So a lot of dynamics now on a national basis that are I think changing and that will be a good check on supply. Tom Catherwood : Got it. Thanks Joel. Thanks Peter. Joel Marcus : Yes. Tom Catherwood : And then last one, appreciate the detail and the stuff this quarter on 325 Binney, obviously a lot of color in there. Have there been any changes recently with tenants increasing their sustainability requirements for their facilities and it kind of, what is the cost differential of going LEED Platinum and LEED Zero Energy like 325 Binney versus a more traditional lab design? Dean Shigenaga : It\u2019s Dean here. Joel Marcus : Yes. Go ahead. Dean Shigenaga : Yes, maybe 325 is a good example and I think the, the way to think about this is you do have some advantages when you do sustainability initiatives from the start. It\u2019s a lot more efficient. You can, I think that project incurred something around that 6% to 7% range of cost to really end up being able to describe it as becoming the most sustainable lab building in Cambridge. As you guys know, it\u2019s probably the most important and unique feature is taking advantage of geothermal energy for heating and cooling of the building, which along with other attributes of the design, allows us to eliminate almost all the fossil fuel consumption for the building. It\u2019s an important attribute for Moderna, the CEO emailed their team as soon as the lease was signed, literally as soon it was assigned and said, let\u2019s get moving and make this one of the coolest, most sustainable green buildings in Cambridge and so they were passionate about it. Most of our large pharma and big bio tenants have already publicly announced sustainability initiatives. So they do find it important. Like LEED was in the early days. LEED had a cost element to it that we all had to get our head around, and we did early on. We had the first core and shell LEED Certified Building and so we were a pioneer there and continuing to be a leader in sustainability here in lab buildings. Peter Moglia : Yes. I also think you have to pay attention to the time we\u2019re in. So I think tenants are given today\u2019s inflationary spiral and kind of what\u2019s going on broadly. I think tenants are maybe somewhat, it depends on the size, the nature and so forth. Bigger tenants are more attuned to this, but I think a little less attuned to sustainability today and more focused on the recruitment, retention and return of their workforce. And then also recognizing that if you just read any number of articles on China\u2019s major ramp up of coal-fired plants and coal use and certainly in India too, it\u2019s pretty clear by scientists almost no matter what we do here in the United States, until that part of the equation is solved for the Planet Earth these, these measures aren\u2019t going to make a difference in global warming. Tom Catherwood : Got it. Thanks everyone. Peter Moglia : Yes. Leap on that. Dean Shigenaga : Thanks Tom. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Michael Carroll : Yes, thanks. Joel, can you provide an update on the New York cluster? I know there\u2019s a proposed 1.6 billion life science hub that could be built over the next decade. I mean, it sounds like there\u2019s a lot of buildings to build out the science infrastructure here? And should we think about these investments as a way to further build out this cluster and kind of the important step to make this more of a mature cluster over the next decade or so? Joel Marcus : Yes. Well, I would refer you to and a good question to our September 12th press release where we talked about a range of issues in New York. New York is a very complicated market. It still remains a small company market. I\u2019ll come back to that initiative in a moment. Probably 250,000 square foot of lease \u2013 actual leasing last year. So that\u2019s a very small market. We started that market. There were literally only two commercial companies in New York doing research when we started, today the number approaches 75, 80 or more, but it\u2019s a slow growth. It\u2019s gestation period is 25 years or more. We\u2019re 12 years into it. So the market is not going to be grown by any supply. It\u2019s going to be grown by capital helping create companies. That\u2019s the only way that market is going to grow. You\u2019re not going to have big farmers like they\u2019re doing, like we signed these two leases a quarter or two ago with Lilly in Boston and BMS, Bristol Myers and San Diego. You\u2019ll never see that in New York because of the just the nature of the topography and geography there. You\u2019ve got very high tax burden and you\u2019ve got some safety issues going on now that hopefully maybe the Governor and others will wake up to. But it\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s the kind of market it is. It\u2019s a small company market, it\u2019s a great place, but it\u2019s different than every other market. It\u2019s unique compared to all the other clusters. With respect to the State and City effort in Kips Bay there, it\u2019s a pretty broad and deep effort. Much of it is institutional and governmentally driven. There is a, a thought of building or a plan to build a tower in that area, but probably to get, go through the land use approvals will take two plus years and then go through an RFP process and then the development process it\u2019s maybe a decade away. But I think what\u2019s really needed is company creation there to really continue to foster the demand. And that\u2019s kind of, I mean, we know that market because we literally help create that market so that that\u2019s the state of play there. Michael Carroll : Nice. And does that investment, I guess improves the longer term outlook for that cluster and maybe increase the likelihood of you doing Phase 3? I mean, I don\u2019t know the timeline\u2019s probably too early to say, but does that make you more encouraged that things are coming around there? Joel Marcus : Well, those are I mean, I think it\u2019s good anytime you can continue to build infrastructure for institutions and governmental bodies that are doing research or developing. Part of that is health care delivery services which we\u2019re not involved with. So those are all good things. That\u2019s the East Side Medical Corridor really at its best. We\u2019re anchored between Bellevue and NYU and that\u2019s why we chose that site when we responded to the RFP by Mayor Bloomberg. But I think it\u2019s fair to say what really is needed is capital and company formation because that will be the lifeblood that will really grow that market over time. And what we\u2019ve helped grow it over the last 12 years. That\u2019s what it\u2019s been. Michael Carroll : Okay. Great. Thanks for that. And then just last one for me. With regards to your investment book, I know the capital markets are a little bit dislocated right now. Is ARE finding better opportunities to deploy capital in that investment book? And when you typically look at new investments, are they more strategic? Or are you taking more opportunistic views just given where maybe some opportunities may lie \u2013 give and it might be difficult for some of those companies to attract the capital right now? Joel Marcus : Well, I think as Hallie said, there\u2019s been an all-time high venture fund capital raise this year, and that is kind of invested sprinkled out over a three, four, five maybe even longer time period. And I think it\u2019s fair to say that great companies with great technology, high unmet medical needs, protected IP, good IP, just really smart people at the scientific helm and the business helm will generally always attract capital. I mean, we invested in Alnylam back in 2003 when it was a startup company because we felt that RNAi had great promise, but it took 15 to 20 years to prove, but it was a great investment. That company has gone on to do great things and has a huge footprint in Cambridge. And then in 2013, which again was before the bull market started to happen, we took an early investment in Moderna and everybody knows the story there. So sometimes down markets as things are, valuations are better, and they give you interesting opportunities that really are focused on totally, I would say, groundbreaking technologies that may create tremendous opportunities for shots on goal on so many of the diseases that we\u2019re all suffering from. So \u2013 that\u2019s how we look at it. So yes, good time to invest. Michael Carroll : Okay, great. Thank you. Joel Marcus : Yep, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Joshua Dennerlein : Hey guys. I appreciate all the color today. I just had a question on the guidance. What gets you to the high and low end of same-store cash guidance? And then also same for the capitalized interest guide. Joel Marcus : Yes. So Dean? Dean Shigenaga : So if you look at our guidance today, same property, call it the midpoint is 7% GAAP, 7.8% cash. And I think my commentary earlier highlighted we\u2019re at 7% for nine months on GAAP. So we\u2019re right on the midpoint today. And then we\u2019re at 8.9%, we\u2019re on the upper end on a cash basis. So we\u2019re at a good perspective for nine months. And I kind of highlighted the outlier drivers occupancy growth driving a 2x benefit to NOI. So we had 100 year-to-date for nine months, 110 basis point occupancy growth with a double impact, at least to NOI and then early lease renewals early, early in 2022, which was also driving the strength. So that\u2019s the backdrop. We\u2019ve got a good run rate for the nine months, which will carry us into a comfortable spot with our outlook for the full year. Joshua Dennerlein : Thanks Dean, what about the capitalized interest, the upper and lower ranges? Dean Shigenaga : Look, I think the way to think about cap interest and interest expense; we don\u2019t change those numbers very often. The run rate that you\u2019ve seen for capped interest this year is probably reflective of the volume of construction activities in our business, which continue an upward trend at the moment, meaning capped interest probably on a quarterly basis, doesn\u2019t peak out until probably Q1 of 2023. So you\u2019re still on an upward trajectory as our \u2013 and that\u2019s just a pure function of what you would call construction in progress or the basis that\u2019s under construction, which drives the amount of capped interest. The interest rate drives it a little bit, but so much of our costs are fixed. There\u2019s very little variable cost for interest expense. So it\u2019s really just a function of spend quarter-to-quarter adding to CIP at a pace that\u2019s outpacing the deliveries which, as I mentioned earlier, will start to peak out here in the next quarter or two. Joshua Dennerlein : Thanks. Operator : And for our last question, we have a follow-up from Michael Griffin from Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Griffin : Hey, thanks for stay on. I\u2019m just curious obviously; we saw the news about GE moving out 5 Necco, what are the prospects potentially to backfill this space? And would you attempt to sublease it could it be a potential conversion opportunity? And are there worries that there might be more of this coming down the pipe for your traditional office users, I think it\u2019s about 8% of the portfolio, but any commentary there would be great. Joel Marcus : Yes. So maybe I\u2019ll ask Dean to comment, but one thing to keep in mind, there\u2019s an existing lease with a credit tenant but Dean? Dean Shigenaga : Yes. I think that\u2019s the key concept. And I guess the other thing to keep in mind, Michael, there\u2019s always \u2013 it\u2019s interesting in the articles that you on any company. And most companies will choose not to comment specifically about articles in the press. As Joel mentioned, we do have a lease with a credit behind it. It\u2019s somewhere around 80,000 square feet in the Seaport market. But beyond that, we don\u2019t really have much to comment on. Michael Griffin : Okay, thanks. Operator : And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks. Joel Marcus : Well, we\u2019ll make it quick. Thank you and stay safe everybody. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz with Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Paula Schwartz : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company\u2019s actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company\u2019s periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel. Joel Marcus : Thank you, Paula, and welcome everybody. With me today, are Hallie Kuhn, Peter Moglia and Dean Shigenaga. Want to thank you for joining Alexandria's fourth quarter and yearend 2022 earnings call and wishing you a safe and healthy new year. And thank you to our Alexandria family team members for their continued operational excellence across all facets of our unique business platform. A truly mission-driven, one-of-a-kind company. We have truly exceptional fourth quarter and 2022 yearend results and by any and all metrics, we're very proud, thankful, and humbled, while many public recording companies ever really struggled mightily during this past year. I'd like to take a moment to tick off what I consider to be some of the most notable news for Alexandria. Truly amazing that Alexandria has delivered approximately 8.5% FFO per share earnings growth while continuing to strengthen our fortress balance sheet, the strongest in our history and Dean will give you more details on that. Against the backdrop of a very deleterious macro-market in this 2022 year and really again, nothing short of operational excellence to the team. With our highly leased development pipeline and continued strong leasing and Peter will comment on that, Alexandria is well positioned to deliver strong earnings growth again in 2023. We have continued to create long-term shareholder value with a total shareholder return from IPO through the end of this -- end of the year, December 31, 2022 of 1673% compared to the MSCI read index of 684%, S&P 500 of 628% and NASDAQ 838%. So a wide margin upbeat. Alexandria continues to produce stable, increasing, long duration cash flows and an increasing dividend. We're very proud of our approximately 1,000 client tenant base, a one of a kind treasurer that continues to generate remarkable demand for our Alexandria lab space and Peter and Dean will highlight more on this, but again, two million square feet leased in fourth quarter, over eight million for the year and almost 18 million for the last two years with rental rate increases last year of about 22% on a cash basis. Pretty amazing stats and we're very proud of our own tenant base, which is generated by far and away the majority of that lease space. 4Q '22 and yearend 2022 was another strong quarter by all fundamental financial metrics and a few others and Dean will highlight some of this, almost 100% -- almost a 100% on collections from a very strong and durable tenant base and very proud of almost 95% occupancy and we put in I think very strong same-store performance both for the quarter and the year.  Innovation in medicine is but must continue to be a national imperative. One in four of us will develop a neurodegenerative disease. Nearly 40% of adult men and women will be diagnosed with cancer during their lifetimes. One in five in the nation's population suffers from mental illness and we're continuing to see over a 100,000 deaths due to overdose last year, despite all of the efforts that certainly this company has made with our Dayton project, but just a literally a war out there, which does not seem to be in check and governments at the federal, state and local level need to double down with the vast amount of resources that have been appropriated over the last few years and really focus on this mental health issue. A comment about our successful and continuing value harvesting and recycling of our precious capital, Peter will detail that, but amazingly stellar 2022 with $2.2 billion successfully harvested and then reinvested in a highly disciplined, disciplined manner and Peter and Dean will also comment on the excellent and steady progress we've made year to date, just one month in to our 2023 business plan for value harvesting and capital recycling and we're very optimistic about that. And then before I pass it over to Hallie, want to particularly call out and thank our particularly call out and thank our finance team and all those who had a hand in the impressive balance sheet accomplishment set forth on Page XB of our supplement. I am very proud that we once again have the strongest balance sheet in the company's history. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Hallie for further comments. Hallie Kuhn : Thank you, Joel and good afternoon, everyone. This is Hallie Kuhn, SVP of science and technology and capital markets. Today, I'm going to provide a recap of the life science industry coming out of 2022 and now into 2023 and how our highly unique approximately a 1,000 tenants remain resilient through the volatility of the current macroeconomic environment. As Joel mentioned, and as we often talk about, the 90% of 10,000 diseases remains an incredible opportunity and unmet need. And the fact is, many of these that do have treatments are far from solved. Take type 1 diabetes. While it was a death sentence before the discovery of insulin over 100 years ago, it still carries an immense burden. A person with type 1 diabetes makes on average 180 health-related decisions a day, some of which have life or death consequences.  Now looking back at 2022, the stats truly speak for themselves regarding the enduring strength of the life science industry, of which I'll highlight 3. First, despite widespread commentary that VC funding hit the pause button in 2022, life science venture deals totaled nearly $58 billion. Other than 2021's record year, it was the second highest amount of capital ever deployed. Of note, over 70% of VC dollars deployed went into an Alexandria cluster, and with VC funds across tech and life science raising nearly $160 billion in 2022, a record eclipsing 2021 is $150 billion, significant dry powder is on hand to deploy over a multiyear time horizon. Second, large pharma continues to be 1 of the best performing sectors in the market. In a year where total returns for market indices such as the NASDAQ and Dow ended the year down 10%, the top 20 biopharma ended the year up an average 12%, with 8 of the top 20 pharma ending the year with total returns over 20%. With historic levels of cash on hand, over $300 billion to deploy into R&D and M&A, biopharma has the firepower to continue to innovate and grow.  And last, the pipeline of early innovation to commercialization continues to deliver to patients, with 37 novel FDA small molecule and biologic approvals, three gene therapy approvals and a novel cell therapy approval, of which nearly half were developed by Alexandria tenants.  Moving to Alexandria's unrivaled life science tenant roster; we wanted to provide additional color on our business segments and some examples of Alexandria's tenants at the forefront of life science innovation. Starting with large pharma, $260 billion was reinvested into R&D in 2021, and analysts estimate that, including leverage, pharma has over $600 billion to deploy into M&A and partnerships. The next several years, indeed decade are going to be framed by large pharma's continued pursuit of innovation as product patents expire and new types of medicines such as mRNA and cell therapies transition from large preclinical and clinical pipelines to commercial stage. Alexandria tenant Pfizer is a great example, with preclinical and clinical -- sorry, with over 110 programs spanning early to late clinical developments, and an estimated 19 products launching in the next 18 months. The company also noted in their 4Q earnings this morning, they are targeting an additional $25 billion in revenue to come from M&A activity by 2030. Transitioning to public biotech, our tenant base includes the majority commercial stage companies, which brought in nearly $150 billion in revenue in 2021. Tenants such as Amgen and Vertex have large diversified pipelines, driving long-term growth. As a note, Vertex is also leading the next generation of type 1 diabetes treatment with a novel clinical stage cell therapy that addresses the root cause of diabetes. For clinical-stage biotechnology companies, data is king. And those that have met and will meet clinical milestones in 2023, continue to see stock recovery and ability to access capital through follow-on financings. While the public markets are still recovering, life science follow-on financings reached nearly $17 billion in 2022, which is right on par with the average life science follow-on financings over the past decade. With respect to life science products, service and devices, this segment largely consists of commercial stage tenants. While not immune to higher interest rates and supply chain challenges, this is a big business segment that both drives and responds to the needs of researchers across academia, biotech and large pharma, which continue to grow and innovate. A notable development in the space is the rapid drop in the price of genome sequencing, driven by a healthy increase in competition. Costing $100 million to sequence a genome in 2001 and diving to $1,000 per genome in 2020, we are now looking at the $200 genome, enabling access to critical sequencing data that saves lives.  So where are we headed in 2023? In the face of persistent economic headwinds, all industries are forced to double down on the areas of greatest value. As part of the reset, there are companies that won't make it, and we'd argue that this, in the long run, is healthy as capital is deployed more efficiently. There will continue to be further separation of haves and have nots, but companies like those on Alexandria's tenant roster with differentiated technologies, a clear road map to key inflection points such as generating clinical data and tenured management teams will continue to raise capital. As history has shown time and time again, some of the most successful companies are those created in the depths of a financial downturn. Ultimately, the life science industry is not built on technologies looking for a problem, but instead thousands among thousands of devastating problems, i.e. diseases that this incredibly innovative industry is poised to address over decades to come. To end on a note of hope from former FDA Commissioner, Scott Gotland. Our ingenuity drives our hopeful innovation, but it's our compassion for each other that inspires us to apply these advances to the purpose of reducing human suffering. With that, I'll pass it off to Peter. Peter Moglia : Thank you, Hallie. 2022 was quite a volatile year in the macro markets, a reminder that all businesses are subject to cycles, some more than others. The pruning we see in the tech industry today is not a surprise to anyone who's been around since the turn of the century. However, much like a broken bone, it will come back stronger after it heals. Unlike tech, developing products and services to address disease is hard and takes a lot of time, much harder and more time consuming than creating the next app to book a reservation or share recipes. Because of that, there is more discipline in life science investment, a discipline Alexandria has mirrored in our real estate strategy, which is why through the dot-com bust to the financial crisis, to whatever you want to label today's conditions, our business remains sound, as you can see in our results this quarter and during those historic down cycles.  Despite the macro headlines, we remain optimistic and excited for our business as we are in the early innings of the Golden Age of Biology. We have only had the blueprint of the human genome for 20 years. And in that time, we've developed more new modalities to attack disease than in the previous 100. It's going to be hard, and it's going to take time, but the industry is going to have options for people with Alzheimer's. It's going to perfect technology to detect pancreatic cancer in time to save lives and much, much more. So let's all remember, it's hard, it takes time and patience, and then you will understand why life science research and development continues through the proverbial thick and thin of economic cycles, making our business resilient and essential.  With that said, I'll briefly touch on our development pipeline progress, update you on construction trends, discuss our leasing and update you on investor demand for life science real estate.  In 2022, our best-in-class development teams continue to deliver high-quality, purpose-built laboratory space to our tenants on time and on budget in a very challenging construction environment, which I'll touch on in a moment. During the fourth quarter, we delivered just shy of 500,000 square feet, with $28 million in annual NOI commencing during the quarter. For the year, we delivered 1.77 million square feet spread over 15 development and redevelopment projects, with annual NOI of $119.2 million commencing during the year. Initial stabilized yields for recent deliveries averaged 6.8% and 6.3% on a cash basis, reflecting the healthy contractual annual increases embedded into our leases.  As of year-end, projects under construction and near-term projects expected to commence construction over the next four quarters totaled 7.6 million square feet and are 72% leased. Approximately 77% of that leasing has come from our approximately 1,000 existing tenant relationships. New projects added this quarter include 1450 Owens, which is approximately 213,000 square feet and will be 100% funded by our joint venture partner; and 10075 Barnes Canyon Road in Sorrento Mesa, which will be 50% funded by our joint venture partner. Both projects are under active leasing negotiations.  Deliveries primarily commencing from the first quarter of '23 through the fourth quarter are expected to add $655 million in annual incremental NOI, reflecting a strong pipeline driven by consistent demand even in this volatile time.  Transitioning to leasing, the fourth quarter results continue to demonstrate the strength of our unique one-of-a-kind company, with leasing volume of 2,322 square feet leased in the quarter, the fourth highest total in company history. The 8,405,587 square feet leased for the year is the second highest annual total in company history. And as you can see in the supplemental, the -- our guidance for strong mark-to-market growth remains unchanged from Investor Day with a range of 27% to 32% on a GAAP basis and 11% to 16% on cash. These results are certainly reflective of Hallie's commentary on the strength of VC funding and the stellar 2022 performance of large pharma. With $300 billion in cash on hand, we anticipate further investment in growth from this high-credit tenant sector in 2023. And the successful conversion of early innovation to commercialization reflected in the 37 FDA approvals in 2022 will incentivize continued investment in new and existing companies that have sound business models and underlying science, a cohort of companies Alexandria has a unique ability to identify.  The highest quality life science tenants always consider occupancy in the best assets as an imperative. Their facility and campus are not only used for research and development, but is a critical tool for them to recruit and retain the best scientific and management talent in the world, which is by far their greatest asset. Therefore, demand for Alexandria facilities and our unrivaled mega campuses remains healthy as the facilities are A+, and our operational excellence is highly sought after.  Moving to construction cost trends. At a high level, it appears the construction industry is on the cusp of slowing down. One of the leading economic indicators of the industry is the AIA Architectural Billings Index that leads nonresidential construction activity by nine to 12 months. Design work is at the front end of projects, so architects are the first consultants to slow down. Recent numbers show the 3% moving average heading towards no growth in billings, and commentary from the AIA was that fewer clients are expressing interest in starting new projects. For the first time since the postpandemic restart of construction projects, which was the genesis of significant cost inflation and supply chain problems, we're starting to see some signs of materials pricing flattening out and general contractors and subcontractors looking for work.  That said, there are still items such as aluminum, rebar, copper and glass of 16% to 21% over this time last year, and it's still very difficult to obtain electrical switchgear, emergency generators, building controls and smart air handling units because despite an improvement in availability of chips, there are more products using chips than ever before so demand for them is still ahead of supply. Laboratory buildings are heavy consumers of these hard-to-get items so to keep a laboratory construction project on time and on budget is a difficult task. Alexandria has the Intel and experience needed to make quick decisions and relationships with critical vendors to ensure we have access to the materials and labor needed to meet our schedule and budgets.  Despite the continued construction market pressures, as mentioned, we do believe the industry is on the cusp of slowing down, and we do expect cost escalations to reflect that in 2023, reducing from 9% to 10% -- from the range of 9% to 10% experienced in 2022 to 4% to 6% in 2023. However, the $2.3 trillion infrastructure spend over the next eight years will continue to put pressure on costs and labor so we will continue to conservatively underwrite and manage our value creation projects. As of the end of the year, 81% of our active development and redevelopment projects, aggregating 5.6 million square feet, are under GMP or other fixed contracts, which is consistent with the run rate we have maintained during these volatile times.  Anticipating year-end volatility in the real estate investment markets, we completed our 2022 value harvesting and asset recycling efforts in the third quarter with impeccable execution as we laid out at Investor Day. Overall, we completed $2.2 billion of value harvesting, with the improved properties achieving a weighted average cap rate of 4.4%, realizing a total gain of $1.2 billion and a value creation margin of 107%. This is a tremendous achievement considering the volatile interest rate environment in 2022 with many real estate investors on the sidelines. It speaks to the desirability of our assets, which are in the best markets with high-quality tenants and managed with operational excellence.  High-quality life science assets are scarce, and that is reflected in the pricing. We have started working on, and are making good progress on 2023 value harvesting and asset recycling, and we'll update you on that next quarter. But in the meantime, we'd like to report on three notable non-Alexandria sales that illustrate that there is still strong demand for life science real estate product. The first is the sale of 1828 El Camino Real and [indiscernible] in the Bay Area. Anchored by three non-credit life science tenants, the property is 98% leased, but is extremely low quality, with limited window line, no shipping and receiving, no backup power and venting through the windows to get adequate HVAC. Despite this, an investor paid $902 per square foot for this asset at a cap rate of 5.8%. The second trade was in the Route 128 submarket of Lexington, where a single non-credit tenant occupied 101,310 square foot manufacturing building at 20 McGuire Road sold in October for $878 per square foot and a 6.2% cap rate. The third comp, which closed last week, is an R&D campus known as the Gauge and Center Point in the Route 128 submarket of Waltham. It traded for $983 per square foot and a 5% cap rate. It was reported that some of that -- some vacancy existed at that property and that the stabilized return is likely to be in the high 5s.  As the Fed continues to pull levers to battle inflation, we expect we will see cap rates move up, but much less on a relative basis to other product types, and thus we remain well positioned to fund our value creation pipeline efficiently and at a relatively attractive pricing by harvesting our value creation among other sources.  With that, I'll pass it over to Dean. Dean Shigenaga : Thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. We'll jump right in here. Our team is very pleased to have the strongest balance sheet in the company's history as of December 31. And this really is a result of disciplined execution of liability management year-to-year over the past decade. Our key highlights include, we really have earned our corporate credit ratings that rank in the top 10% of the REIT industry today. We ended the year with tremendous liquidity of $5.3 billion that provides us important flexibility in this macro environment. No debt maturities until 2025, a statement only a small handful of REITs can make today, and a weighted average remaining term of debt at 13.2 years. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 5.1 times on a quarter annualized basis, 5.2x on a trailing 12-month basis. The fixed charge coverage ratio was very strong at 5.0x, and 99.4% of outstanding debt is subject to fixed interest rates.  Our team had outstanding execution in 2022 on our strategic capital plan. Key highlights include $1.8 billion of 12-year and 30-year bonds, with a weighted average rate of 3.28%, the term of 22 years completed in February of 2022. Outstanding execution by our team, as Peter had highlighted, on outright dispositions, partial interest sales, aggregating $2.2 billion, with an amazing $1.2 billion in gains or consideration in excess of booked value, a 4.4% cap rate on cash NOI, all exceptional statistics and significant value creation tap for reinvestment.  We had disciplined issuance of common equity with proceeds aggregating $2.5 billion at an average price of $189 per share, including 105 million sold under forward equity sales agreements in December of 2022. On a blended basis for the year, we felt comfortable executing on the modest $105 million under the equity under forward equity sales agreements in December at roughly $150 per share.  Now briefly on the bond market, the beginning of 2023 has been positive for high-quality issuers like Alexandria. Overall pricing for 10-year bonds for Alexandria has significantly improved, and as of yesterday, was in the upper 4% range or just below 5%. For 2023, we will continue to focus on execution of real estate dispositions and partial interest sales or joint ventures for a significant component of our 2023 capital plan. Two transactions are under executed LOI to bring in a partner on a portion of each asset. These transactions will provide approximately $370 million of equity-type capital in 2023, and there are other transactions that we expect to complete this year.  Turning to operating and financial results, really, congratulations to our entire team for outstanding execution this year or in 2022 during a very challenging macro environment. We reported total revenues of $2.6 billion, up 22.5% over 2021, with FFO per share as adjusted of $8.42, up 8.5% over 2021, and outperforming our initial outlook for 2022 of $8.36 by $0.06, and ahead of consensus, both for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2022.  Now diving into key highlights from our truly amazing operating and financial results for 2022. Strong rental rate growth, leasing volume and occupancy growth drove record same-property NOI growth in 2022 of 6.6% and 9.6% on a cash basis, exceeding our 10-year average same-property NOI growth prior to 2022 of 6% and 2.9% on a cash basis. The last four years of rental rate growth on lease renewals and releasing the space have been the highest in the company's history, including rental rate growth of 31% in 2022. Over the last two years, cash rental rate growth has been the highest in the company's history, including 22.1% for the full year of 2022. Leasing volume in the fourth quarter was robust relative to the quarterly average volume in recent years in the range of 1.1 to 1.3 rentable square feet per quarter, highlighting the continued demand from our client tenants. Now the last two years have generated the two highest annual periods of rentable square feet leased, including 8.4 million rentable square feet in 2022. three out of the last four quarters represented the highest quarterly periods of rentable square feet leased, including two million square feet in the fourth quarter. Now turning to occupancy, occupancy was up 80 basis points since the beginning of 2021 to 94.8% as of December 31. Now looking forward into 2023, we expect a slight decline in occupancy in the first half of the year, with recovery expected in the second half of the year. We had a similar dip in occupancy in 2022, specifically overall strong occupancy in the year, but we did have a 40-basis-point decline from the first quarter of '22 to the third quarter of '22. For 2023, we expect temporary vacancy beginning in the first quarter related to spaces that, on average, are expected to generate significant rental rate growth, greater than 60% on a cash basis. Now these spaces are forecasted for occupancy over the next five quarters. This includes a mix of small redevelopment space, i.e., the first time conversion to lab space, normal lease expirations and a few early tenant departures.  Importantly, consistent with our general quarter-to-quarter growth in FFO per share for many years, we expect quarter-to-quarter growth in FFO per share in 2023.  Now a few other key highlights. 90% of our annual rental revenue is from investment-grade or large-cap publicly traded companies within our top 20 tenants, highlighting the high-quality list of client tenants that our team has curated over the years. 99.4% of collections of January rent through January 27, just highlighting the continued strength of rent collections. And we had a very strong adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%, highlighting execution of operational excellence by our team.  Cash flows from operating activities after dividends for 2023 is expected to be very strong at $375 million at the midpoint of our guidance, and will continue to support growth in our annual common stock dividends per share. Our FFO payout ratio was very solid at 58% for the fourth quarter. And at this pace, cash flows from operating activities after dividends, over the next three years, should generate over $1 billion and that's an amazing statistic and very efficient capital for reinvestment.  Now turning to a couple of important real estate highlights. Construction in progress, otherwise known as CIP is forecasted to peak in the first quarter, then declined slightly through 2023 as the dollar amount of deliveries are expected to exceed additions to CIP quarter-to-quarter, highlighting the significant volume of deliveries over the next couple of years. As Peter had highlighted, we have 7.6 million rentable square feet of projects that are 72% leased and projected to generate $655 million of incremental net operating income over the next three years. In the fourth quarter, we recognized impairments aggregating $26.2 million on real estate, primarily related to a few assets we plan to sell in 2023. Each asset is small and represents noncore assets no longer strategic for Alexandria to own. And to put this into perspective, the book value of assets held for sale was approximately $120 million as of December 31. The key takeaway is that from time to time, we review our asset base and proceed with selective sales that continue to enhance the quality of the remaining asset base.  Briefly on venture investments. FFO per share as adjusted over the last 2 years has included an average of $103 million of realized gains each year from venture investments, or approximately $26 million per quarter. Now quarterly gains from venture investments in 2023 are expected to be up slightly in comparison to this recent quarterly run rate. As of December 31, 2022, we had gross unrealized gains of $506 million on a cost basis of $1.15 billion, highlighting significant value in our venture investment portfolio. Now investments in our venture portfolio have been very modest, at less than $70 million in aggregate over the last five years, including $20.5 million that we recognized in the fourth quarter.  Turning to guidance. We reaffirm guidance for 2023 that was initially provided in connection with our Annual Investor Day on November 30 with 1 minor update. We updated excess cash held from bond proceeds to $300 million, representing a $50 million increase from the midpoint of our prior guidance. Our 2023 guidance for EPS diluted is a range from $3.41 to $3.61, and FFO per share as adjusted diluted is a range from $8.86 to $9.06 with no change in the midpoint of $8.96. Now under the current common stock distribution agreement we have in place, otherwise known as our ATM program, we have approximately 142 remaining available. We expect to file a new program in the first quarter of '23. Please refer to Page 6 of our supplemental package for detailed underlying assumptions included in our strong outlook for the full year of 2023.  With that, let me turn it back to Joel. Joel Marcus : Thank you. Operator, you can open it up for questions, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Steve Sakwa : I guess I wanted to just circle back to some comments, Dean, you made about some of the pending sales and joint venture interest. I'm just wondering if either you or Peter could provide a little bit more color on what the institutional market is sort of looking for? Maybe how pricing has changed over the past six months? And can you give us any sort of flavor on the timing of when some of these transactions make it over the finish line? Joel Marcus : Yes. This is Joel. I think we'll try to be general in that given that we have -- we're at the letter of intent stage on a number of transactions. But maybe, Peter, you could give kind of a topside view. PeterMoglia: Sure. Obviously, there's only a few product types out there that people are comfortable in investing in right now. And obviously, life science real estate is 1 of them. So we are -- I mean, been receiving calls on a fairly regular basis from some existing partners that are excited to see what we have going this year. As I mentioned during my comments, cap rates are expected to rise from the peak. But as I've also said in the past, we don't anticipate, on a relative basis, to be very high. And I'm not going to speculate right now on where they'll be. We'll start reporting once we have more data, but they will be sticky given the scarcity of opportunities for life science real estate. Steve Sakwa : Okay. And then just a second question, Joel. I know acquisitions are not a huge part of the plan right now, it's mostly development. But maybe could you just comment on the 2 deals that you did announce in the quarter and kind of the strategic rationale for both of those projects, and how you think about pricing on those versus your development opportunities? Joel Marcus : Yes. So each one of those was unique in and of itself. I don't want to get too granular, but I think the one in the Route 128 corridor really enables us to piece together three different projects into a more than 1-million-square-foot mega campus, and we have some great activity from our 1,000 tenants to help fill that. So we're very optimistic on that and feel like that was very strategic. It's also under lease back for a number of years, so it will be continuing to cash flow.  The other acquisition was a unique acquisition in downtown Austin. We felt that it was a superb location. It's also under a lease back for a period of time. So we'll continue to generate good revenue, and I won't comment on what our future business plan is for that, but we think there's a really great opportunity to do something unique in that spot, if that's helpful. Operator : The next question comes from Georgi Dinkov of Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Georgi Dinkov : So I was wondering what are your thoughts on the sublet market in the sector? And have you seen an uptick with more companies subleasing space across the board and specifically in your markets? And could you please remind us what percentage, if any, of your portfolio is currently subleased? Joel Marcus : So, Peter, do you want to maybe comment generally on that? PeterMoglia: Yes. I've got some sublease statistics so I will -- for our larger markets. I will say that the amount of sublease space overall has come down in the -- over the last couple of quarters. One of the reasons for that is built out lab space is very attractive, especially for companies today that want to try to limit their out-of-pocket investment in the space. So Boston is at about 4.7% right now sublease. And again, anything of quality and that's built out is moving fairly quickly. San Francisco has been reduced to 2.3% and San Diego only has 2.1%. So these are all very normalized numbers for any cycle. Georgi Dinkov : Great. And could you comment on your specific portfolio? Peter Moglia : It's less than that. Georgi Dinkov : Okay. And just my second question on Sanofi. We noticed that the square footage day rent dropped by about 30,000 square feet quarter-over-quarter. I was wondering if you could provide some more color on that. Joel Marcus : SP1 I don't know, Dean, if you know that, what asset that was or you want to... Dean Shigenaga : No, it's such a small number. I'm sorry, guys. We don't -- I don't have that at my fingertips. Joel Marcus : I don't either. Joel Marcus : It's 30,000 square feet on our 40 million square foot portfolio is artwork. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Griffin of Citigroup Global Markets. Please go ahead. Michael Griffin : Maybe going back to the Route 128 acquisition. Peter, you touched on some pretty favorable pricing it seemed like with transaction comps. I feel like that's probably 1 submarket that maybe there's been more worries around supply with. So maybe you can expand on sort of what you're seeing out there, has sentiment changed for that suburban market? I mean, obviously, when we think Boston, we think Cambridge being the highest quality market there, but maybe has a sentiment shifted in more of those suburban product? Joel Marcus : Yes, this is Joel. Let me make a topside comment, and then I'll turn it over to Peter. I think you have to -- if you're asking about general sentiment, Peter will comment if you're asking about our sentiment it's different because we generally have a certain targeted demand from our existing client base, and therefore, by making, say, the acquisition we did or doing things that we do to create an environment where companies want to go, it really is focused on our kind of game plan.  But if you're looking at a topside view, I don't know, Peter, you could share topside view on Waltham generally. Peter Moglia : Well, Waltham, the other surrounding areas, I think the sentiment is still positive. The group, that last comp, I talked about the campus that sold for a five cap, it was reported -- I think it was [indiscernible] that had the article that the group that sold it made $200 million on it. They only owned it for two years. So pretty good outcome. And obviously, if somebody is paying $200 million more than somewhat bought it for two years ago, maybe it was three years ago now, that -- they're a believer in the rent growth in the market. So the other reason that the comps are weighted towards the suburbs is very likely because there's just not a lot of available product to buy in Cambridge or the Seaport or Watertown. So the opportunities were just there. And I don't know if it says anything about the sentiment and probably just more about the availability. Joel Marcus : And keep in mind, there will always be demand among more R&D-light companies for Route 128 in Waltham than in the heart of Cambridge. That's just how it's been for decades now. Michael Griffin : Great. That's helpful. And then on the $1.4 billion of commitment costs from joint venture partners, I'm curious, are there any kind of restrictions around how that can be drawn down, how much these partners can fund? I think you've got some portion of that in your capital plan for this year. But anything you can expand on that would be helpful as well. Joel Marcus : Yes. I'll ask Dean to do that, but obviously, each and every situation is different, but Dean, upside view? Dean Shigenaga : Yes. I think the high-level concept on the $1.4 billion of commitments for funding from our JV partners, generally speaking, these are funding requirements related to our value creation pipeline, so construction funding commitments. And these commitments do extend out over multiple years out, two to three years depending on the joint venture. But given the recent increase in projects with joint ventures over the last, call it, four to six quarters, we just wanted to be sure that the investment community understood the significance of the commitments coming from our partners on just a handful of construction projects. So we'll continue that disclosure going forward. Operator : Next question comes from Josh Dennerlein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Josh Dennerlein : I saw in your top 20 tenants page in the sub. It looks like there's a footnote on 270 Bio saying the in-place cash rents are 20% to 25% below current market. Looks like that last quarter was 5 just 10% below current market. Just curious on what's driving that update? Joel Marcus : Dean, do you have any information on that? Dean Shigenaga : Yes. So it's Dean here, guys. So what we did was we looked more carefully at the actual space. I believe the prior quarter was slightly lower or showing a modest mark-to-market opportunity and it was reflective of looking at that specific property overall, but we realized we had to dive into the details a little bit further because it didn't make sense as we were looking at it for the current quarter. And as we looked at the space specifically, so a portion of the building and the specific space that they're occupying, there's a bigger mark-to-market opportunity. So we wanted to be sure we updated that number in the current quarter. So nothing changed from a real mark-to-market, but previously, it was the overall building. And today, it's just specifically, or this quarter it's specific to that space that they occupy. Josh Dennerlein : Okay. And then just -- since I'm newer to the story, just kind of curious why the disclosure on that type company. It looks like it has a small market cap. Dean Shigenaga : It's really due to that. Some -- occasionally, there's a tenant in the top 20 list of tenants that we did not curate ourselves or has a modest market cap, and we just want to provide some incremental color to some investors who don't need to research the details on their own. Operator : The next question comes from Richard Anderson of SMBC Nikko Securities. Please go ahead. Joel Marcus : You may be on mute, Rich. Richard Anderson : I totally was, sorry about, Joel. So Peter, you talked about cap rates in your opening comments, and I think, Dean, you mentioned some partial interests that are far along and may be announced shortly. How would you characterize the quality spectrum of what you're looking at for partial interest? Are we talking very high-quality assets like the Binney Street transaction a while back or more middle of the road is a mechanism to minimize the cap rate, but also keep hold of your best assets and not relinquish too much of that opportunity going forward? PeterMoglia: I'll start, Rich. The profile of what going on is good quality. We don't have much of anything outside, I think, of high quality. I mean, certainly some workhorse assets that we still hold, we've sold a lot of those. So the partial interest sales just because of the profile of our portfolio are typically going to be higher quality assets, and that's what we're working on now. Richard Anderson : Are we sub-five, you're not talking about pricing just yet? Or can you give any... Peter Moglia : I mean I don't think it does any good really to talk about pricing because we're still negotiating with people. And so better strategy to keep that to ourselves at this point. Richard Anderson : Fair enough. And then second question for me is for Dean. You have an average debt exploration, I think, of 13 years, you said, I think your average lease term expires in 7 or 8 years. I'm wondering if that provides you any opportunity in the future in the interest of matching liabilities with assets, your way conservative in that comparison as it stands today. Do you ever see that, that gap shrinking whereas maybe the opportunity to raise shorter-term debt or lengthen lease term would make sense for the company? I'm just curious if that spread that you have in place now is something that could wiggle around a little bit in the future? Dean Shigenaga : Rich, I guess the way to answer the question is I think we find significant value in the longer maturity profile given the size of our company and -- we have a meaningful maturity profile for a big company, right, or that matches a big company is maybe a better way of describing it. So the longer average debt term gives us a lot more flexibility to manage the overall maturity profile, right? Because if that was more like five years, with that much debt outstanding, it will be a lot to manage year-to-year on top of any growth capital. So I think strategically, the longer term of remaining maturity is a real positive for us. Operator : Our next question comes from Tom Catherwood of BTIG. Please go ahead. Tom Catherwood : Appreciated Hallie's comments at the outset about tenant health and funding and commentary around Pfizer M&A really jumped out. Maybe, Peter or Joel, during prior M&A cycles in the biopharma industry, what was the read-through for real estate usage? Did acquirers tend to consolidate the footprint of their portfolio companies or were there further expansions? Joel Marcus : Yes. I can give you my thoughts, and Peter can share his. I think it's hard to compare past cycles because the level of technological development in biotech was so different. Today, it's much more sophisticated new modalities. So when you have M&A today, it used to be oftentimes you're buying a company for maybe a pipeline and you like to hold on to the people, but maybe space is less valuable going back maybe a decade or two. Today, that space is pretty critical, especially if it's located in a top-tier cluster market like Cambridge. Not only do you want the people for recruitment, retention and just working on the projects, but you've also got probably built into the space some pretty sophisticated new modality technologies, both at the lab side and in the R&D manufacturing, which is kind of integrated so closely. So I think it's harder to tell. I think, again, there's going to be a whole series of different types of uses of capital.  A lot of it will be partnering, which has historically been probably the favorite approach of pharma. There will be some acquisitions. You've got a Federal Trade Commission that's pretty hostile to any acquisition in any industry these days. So you'll probably see bolt-on acquisitions where people will want to keep that group and that technology in tow. But I don't think it's is easy to look at, say, big mega mergers in the past and think that, that has any relevance to today. And I think the key buy line for life science in 2023, in addition to what Hallie kind of framed out is what will be the velocity, the depth and the focus of this large cash hoard $300 billion. And if you leverage it, you could be as much as $500 billion to $600 billion. But Peter, you could comment just historically and what you've seen. Peter Moglia : It used to be if you were like a one-trick pony, it was an acquisition and then you shut it down. I mean, a good example is company called ICOS in the Seattle area was bought by -- they developed Cialis, they were bought by Lilly, and they completely shut down. But with the rise of platform technologies, a lot of the M&A, were super beneficial to the growth of our clusters. Companies realized that these teams that they were buying -- or these companies were much more valuable than just the pipeline, but the teams were extremely important. So there were a number of companies. I mean I remember when I was in Seattle, a company got bought by Gilead It was a -- it was called Corus Pharma. They were a 5000-square-foot tenant. And right after that, the Gilead approached us, and we ended up doing a huge over 100000-square-foot deal with them so that they could expand the capabilities of the team. So as Joel said, it ebbs and flows.  But I think if you look at the fact that, I think about 75 -- or in certain years, about 75% of products that have hit the market have started from external innovation that end up on -- in pharma's hands, it's pretty telling that, that is a long-lasting strategy to cone the biotech world, to buy the companies and to keep the teams in place because they generally have platforms and other products behind their initial ones. So I think the general trend in recent years has been to keep them in place and to expand. That would be my... Joel Marcus : Yes. Hallie, any final comments on that question? Hallie Kuhn : Just to say that every acquisition is going to be very unique in terms of the types of products being acquired, the talent base that comes along with it, the market that it's in. And so we very much are acutely aware of kind of the one-off nature of every acquisition. And ultimately, for acquisitions where they may tuck it into the company, we see a net positive in the ecosystem. If it's a small company that does get folded in, those executives go on to create 1 more or multiple companies after that. So we've had some great examples in the past of a company gets acquired and then that CEO goes on to build a bigger and even larger company. So altogether, it's a net positive for the ecosystem, I would say no matter what the outcome is. And a great example in Seattle, as Peter mentioned, another great 1 is Celgene's acquisition of Juno and then the acquisition by Bristol-Myers, that's really one of their most critical advanced cell therapy outpost. So again, it's almost case by case, Rich. Tom Catherwood : Great. I really appreciate the thoughts there. Maybe sticking with Pfizer, we did notice that in New York, 219 East 42nd Street moved from future developments to intermediate developments. If memory serves me, I think there was a 6-year sale leaseback on that asset. What are your current plans, if any, on that building in a potential project? Joel Marcus : Yes. So that building, which we acquired had a leaseback to Pfizer. Remember, it's an office building for Pfizer, but it unique in New York, very few buildings have the bones to be converted to lab. They are moving to Hudson Yards, as you know, and their lease is up, I think, out about 2 years or so. But we do have some internally generated demand for that from our current client base, and so we're moving that along. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Carroll of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Michael Carroll : I know demand for fully built-out lab product is pretty high. But have you noticed any difference in the level of demand you're tracking in your development pipeline where tenants do need to invest a significant amount of cash outlays to build out that space? I mean has that dropped off noticeably over the past 6 to 12 months given the disruption in the capital markets? Joel Marcus : Yes. Peter, you could comment generally to upside. Peter Moglia : Yes. one of the reasons the sublease market has stayed in check even when there's been some disruptions to companies is the fact that -- and as we've talked about for now almost 2 years, the high cost of construction has just created a much more expensive proposition when you have to build out lab space. The news, though, is that there's just not a lot of sublease space to satisfy all the demand. So deals where the tenants have to invest space, such as our development and redevelopment deals do continue to go. But I mean, there -- if you're a Board and your company wants to expand and they can go into 25,000 to 35,000 square feet of existing space, even though it might be in a different building and even the different neighborhood, they're going to consider that today just given the costs. We're still doing fine in our leasing of our development and redevelopment portfolio. But there is a sentiment that if there's an existing available space just try to grab it. Michael Carroll : Okay. Dean, do you know if you're like competitors on the development pipeline? I mean, is that where the drop-off in demand is coming from is that first-generation type space? Dean Shigenaga : Well, I think that the reason that others aren't as successful just because they don't have our brand. I mean it's -- we've talked about it for years and years. And there's a lot to be said about the operational excellence we bring, the management of the facilities to the design of the facilities. I think -- to the extent that there's projects out there that are pausing even after they've gone vertical or remain vacant, it's a number of things. One is that the location isn't comparable to ours; two, they've underwritten very high rents because they need to, their basis isn't very good; and three, they don't have a reputation to manage these critical infrastructure building. So I would say that, that's really the reason behind a lot of the competitive buildings not... Joel Marcus : And major overruns on budgets, I can think of 1 project in Boston where a client went there because we didn't have exactly the space that they needed, and then they came back to us when the developer had a huge overrun on costs. So that goes on all the time. Michael Carroll : Okay. And then just last 1 for me. I was looking at your current tenant roster versus the prior quarter, and it looks like Maxar Technologies dropped off the list. I mean is that a fair read? Am I looking at that correctly? And can you give us a sense of what happens there? Joel Marcus : Yes. That is a project that we own where they're rotating out of that, and that will be a future development project -- redevelopment and development. Operator : Yes. Our next question comes from David Rogers of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Dave Rogers : Maybe this is for Dean. But I wanted to talk about the leasing spread. When you excluded the 2 leases in the quarter, obviously, very strong performance for the company overall. Curious about the guide for this year, which you gave in December, reaffirmed last night. But at the 11% to 16%, I think you had said that there was some incremental component of that that was non-life science maybe. But can you give us a sense of kind of that 11% to 16%. Is that more a function of kind of market rents may be slowing down? Or is that just a function of kind of more different leases that have been added to that pool? Dean Shigenaga : Dave, its Dean here. Lab rents remain healthy as you can tell from leasing statistics in the fourth quarter. Hard to really look out well as you go out into the future, and lab rents are trending well, as we noted from our results. There is a slight mix at play in '23 with certain expirations coming up and certain leasing activity we expect to accomplish, call it, non-lab product. But that product is a small percentage of the portfolio. Rental rates overall, even when you blend it all together, will remain very strong. Dave Rogers : That's fair. And then maybe to follow up, Peter, in your last question in terms of kind of market rent growth, it sounds like it's bifurcating even further, probably between kind of the higher-quality and lower-quality assets. What does that spread look like today maybe across the portfolio or maybe pick the top three clusters in terms of kind of where replacement rents might be going versus where maybe a more traditional kind of A- asset might be performing today at a market rent level? Peter Moglia : I can really only speak to our rents. I just don't have a lot of visibility to outside of the asking rents that we are hearing from competitive buildings. Our newer product and our -- in our older product, there's not much of a spread between it. Typically, you might see even a 10% to 15% premium for new buildings over older buildings. I think probably the availability of existing space makes the existing space more valuable today. But it also, I think, speaks to just the quality of our overall portfolio. We don't have a lot of B assets that you would -- that you could say that out in the suburbs, the single-story stuff that's not amenitized. Still, the rents, I can -- in the greater Boston, I mean, the rents out there for that type of product or are in the $60 to $70 range. Compare that to the $100 to $120 in Cambridge and maybe the $85 to $100 in Seaport. It's still fairly close, but you do the math and that will give you the premium.  I think overall, though, I would say that rents for lab space have not regressed at all and are still fairly strong, and the has not been a big movement in concessions like you might be seeing in the office market. I know I read a lot about the office market, and I know that rents for high-quality buildings have held there, but concessions have gotten really, really high. And that's not the case with us. Our rents have held well and concessions have remained constant. Operator : The next question comes from Dylan Burzinski at Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. Dylan Burzinski : And I appreciate the color on some of the transactions that have happened lately. But just curious, when we look at cap rates for purpose-built lab product versus converted product, have you guys seen any cap rate differential between the 2? Peter Moglia : I don't have any specific examples other than maybe what I just talked about and the comp in is a really just terrible conversion. Burlingame is on the Peninsula. It is very close to South San Francisco. So to get a fully leased comp at an almost 6% cap rate, I think, probably illustrates that conversions aren't that appealing. I would expect good quality, purpose-built lab in Berlingame to be at least 100 to 150 basis points lower than that. Joel Marcus : And most conversions, not all, but almost all don't work. Dylan Burzinski : Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess, just looking at the supply picture, are there certain markets or submarkets where you're starting to see supply pick up and maybe become more of a risk here? Peter Moglia : From a supply standpoint? Dylan Burzinski : Yes. Peter Moglia : The numbers are -- the numbers for availability are still kind of where they've been over the last few quarters. I mean, the biggest supply overhang in any of our markets is in South San Francisco, and it remains that way. That is -- that has not really changed. We -- there's a lot of talk about supply in Greater Boston. Majority of what's talked about hasn't broken ground, some assets have. A lot of them are in the Summerville area, which is not competitive to where our product is. So we're not too concerned about it. But yes, I think that the supply story is always 1 that we have to talk about. People are trying to get involved in the business. But the best locations are very difficult to get. And some people have tried to fan out in other areas such as Summerville with limited to no success, I think, at this point. Dylan Burzinski : Okay. Thanks. That's it for me. Operator : The next question comes from Jamie Feldman of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Jamie Feldman : Thanks for taking my question. So I know you spoke a lot about how differentiated AllexInterest portfolio is and leasing demand is. But if you look at the market that it does kind of show in some of these markets, you're seeing flattish rents and concessions rising and net effective rents been declining month-over-month or maybe quarter-over-quarter. Are you seeing that at all in your portfolio? I mean, are you still pushing rents? And I know you said the concessions haven't grown a lot, but can you just provide some more color on how that really looks for your business versus maybe what we're seeing overall in the market? Dean Shigenaga : Jamie, it's Dean here. Net effective rents have been positive over time for our business. So it's not declining, it's increasing. Jamie Feldman : Can you say maybe by how much like quarter-over-quarter? Do that like a same-store basis, how much you're pushing net effective rents? Dean Shigenaga : I don't have it right in front of me, Jamie, but I don't have the exact statistic, but we recall reviewing it over the last month and it was a very solid positive trend. I mean it's -- look, our rents, cash and GAAP rents are up. Those are significant increases period-over-period. Net effective is just trailing out a little bit, but still directionally very substantial, right? Because their base net effective is based off your GAAP rents, right? Very strong. Peter Moglia : Yes. I wouldn't doubt, Jamie, that other developers are offering concessions to try to bridge the gap between the quality and reputation that we have and what they offer. Our numbers are still stable at this point. Jamie Feldman : Okay. That's great news. And then I saw -- I noticed you did the $105 million forward equity agreement in the fourth quarter. Typically, this time of the year, sometimes you'll do a much larger one. Can you just decide -- can you just discuss the decision to do equity at all this quarter? And just how you think about why you didn't do something bigger? Dean Shigenaga : Jamie, it's Dean. As we looked at our wrapping up the year, there was an opportunity to raise a very modest amount, as you've mentioned, $105 million. And as we looked at our overall capital that we raised during the year, which I commented on, it blended in very attractively. While, it was done at $150, I think the overall blended common equity proceeds were about $189 per share. So just keeping things in perspective, there's a modest amount that we raised. And Jamie, going back to your other question, I just needed a second to pull it, but 1 second, I just lost the page.  But on rental rate growth, we were at -- so 31% GAAP, '22 cash for the year. Net effective for the year was something around 37%. Jamie Feldman : I guess I was thinking more in terms of just in the market today. I mean, you have a nice baked-in mark-to-market that's going to show up in leasing spreads. But are you able to still, versus last month, keep pushing rents? It sounds like you think you are on a net effective basis, but I was just hoping to get color on that. Dean Shigenaga : It sounds like you're asking what the first quarter is going to look like. Look, Jamie, in the fourth quarter and the year for 2022, we are very strong. So I don't have an outlook going into the first quarter for net effective, but again, 2022 is up 37% on a net effective basis. Joel Marcus : And directionally, just look at our guidance for GAAP and cash, too so... Jamie Feldman : Okay. That's great. And I guess just going back to the equity raise. So it sounds like you kind of think about it on a 12-month view, like that kind of cleaned things up for '22 and then '23 kind of is a fresh start in your -- how you would raise equity? Peter Moglia : Well, maybe I think probably what's more important, Jamie, on the broad bucket of solving for equity-type capital, as I mentioned, we remain focused on dispositions and partial inter sales JV capital for a significant component of our capital plan for 2023. And we've got a couple of transactions that are fairly advanced right now executed LOI and moving through. So it's only January 31, and we feel like we're in a good spot moving on our capital plan there. And so we got to keep in mind that, that's an important component as well, Jamie, as it has been for many years now. Operator : The next question comes from Omotayo Okusanya of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Omotayo Okusanya : Just a quick question on capitalized interest. I think there was a comment made earlier on that CIP would peak in first quarter and then slowly start to decline as you have deliveries. But I believe the CIP guidance is meaningfully above last year. Can you just help us kind of reconcile the difference? Just higher cost of capital being used to capitalize the CIP? Or how do we think about that? Peter Moglia : Is your question just the growth year-over-year? Omotayo Okusanya : Yes. Peter Moglia : The year-over-year growth is more just a function of the size of activities undergoing construction today. As you know from our disclosures we have 7.6 million either under construction or near-term starts on average, 72% leased. If you look at the fourth quarter capped interest, which is reflective of the average basis under construction, it was $79.5 million of cap interest for the quarter. it was $73 million in the third quarter, so I'll call it up about $6 million. It was $68 million in the prior quarter, so up about $5 million quarter-over-quarter. If you were just to continue to project out that $4 million or $5 million increase quarter-to-quarter, you can kind of project out what half of the year would look like. And just double that from that point forward, you're now at the bottom end of the range of our guidance. So directionally, it should make sense if you look at it from a run rate perspective.  Again, year-over-year, it's up significantly because the amount of construction activities were actually up year-over-year. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks. Joel Marcus : Thank you, everybody, and we look forward to talking to you on the first quarter call. Be safe, feel well. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Swartz with Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Paula Schwartz : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The Company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the Company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel. Joel Marcus : Thank you, Paula, and welcome, everybody, to Alexandria's first quarter '23 Earnings Call. With me today are Peter, Dean, Hallie and Dan. And first of all, I want to send a big thank you to our entire, ARE family team for an operationally and financially strong first quarter in a tough -- continuing tough macro environment. As you know, Alexandria is truly a one-of-a-kind S&P 500 company. And we're very pleased that we just received new -- one of Newsweek's most trusted company awards. We have no peers. We're kind of a pure play. In our field, we first identified and pioneered the lab space niche back in 1994 and then through our disciplined execution of our original vision using the strategic architecture of our cluster model, which we customize to the life science industry. We have brought the mission-critical real estate infrastructure of the life science industry and integrated it with an unparalleled and world-class 24/7 operational excellence service component aimed to protect the hundreds of billions of dollars of leading-edge science, which is conducted 24/7 within our asset base. And we have brought this to a highly respected and recognized real estate product type today. Alexandria is definitely not a health care service facilities company nor a generic office company. Our disciplined core focus is our patented and trademark lab space. It's a premium priced, non-commodity product generally characterized by high barrier to entry markets, where we have a dominant franchise and where we exercise pricing power, especially in our highly sought after Alexandria-branded mega campuses, and those markets exhibit deep science base, deep life science talent base, a rich abundance of risk capital and also are ones that are generally safe and have excellent transportation access. And what we saw in 1994 in the embryonic days of the life science industry is multiplied geometrically today, 30 years later, as Steve Jobs said, the 21st century will be the century of the intersection of biology and technology innovation. We have 10,000 known diseases wreaking havoc on human beings each and every day and the personal and economic cost of sickness, illness and today, the mental health crisis is continuing to skyrocket. Continued innovation in medicine is an absolute national priority and the transformative work of our tenants in the industry is critical to addressing the massive unmet medical need. Literally every day, we hear of great progress. And today, for example, one of our Greater Boston tenants, Morphic Therapeutic which has an oral drug addressing moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. And if you've ever had it, it is a tough condition, a major GI indication announced that it hit its Phase 2a clinical trial endpoint and their stock has been up 75% this year. The 10 most prevalent diseases in the U.S., heart disease, cancer, chronic respiratory disease, obesity, Alzheimer's, diabetes, substance abuse, infectious disease, chronic kidney disease and mental illness are not being solved to-date. We have a large mountain decline, and the industry is really in its formative days. Weathering a tough macro environment, ARE posted a very solid first quarter. Our funds FFO per share is up 7%, as you see in revenues, top line revenue is up almost 14%. And Dean will go into the metrics, but almost 100% collections, which is -- bodes well for our continued strength and stability of the Company. We've maintained strong while lowering uses and sources of capital. We've had very solid leasing with the highest-ever rental rate increase, and we've had continuing strong operating and EBITDA margins. All stakeholders should recognize and appreciate this management team took a highly disciplined approach over a multiyear period to create a fortress balance sheet to successfully weather what now is the current self-inflected economic storm by the various policies that we implemented over the last many years. We have taken judicious measure to cut our CapEx, while at the same time, making strong progress on our funding plan for 2023, and you'll hear more about that from Peter. So without any further hesitation, let me turn it over to Hallie, who's going to give you some bird's-eye view of our view on the life science industry. So, Hallie? Hallie Kuhn : Thank you, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Hallie Kuhn, Senior Vice President of Science and Technology and Capital Markets. Today, I'm going to comment on the life science industry following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. The health of ARE's best-in-class life science tenant base and innovation is a long-term driver of life science industry growth. Beginning with SVB, there remains some misperceptions on the long-term impact of its collapse on the life science industry. SVB certainly was a go-to provider for banking needs of many venture-backed companies, particularly in the tech industry. And while SVB has created a niche serving the segment, it was also cultural. Early-stage start-ups work within a very tightened community and many used SVB because that's what everyone else used, not necessarily because there were no other options. And many banks, including G-SIBs have been working for years to carve out their own share of this market. For our own private biotech tenants in the days following the collapse, we had conversations with over 100 companies. Some of which use SVB, but many of which did not or had multiple banking relationships. Importantly, within approximately 72 hours from the start of the bank run, companies had access to all deposits and the near-term risks such as making payroll were mitigated. As for long-term risk driven by instability of regional banks, unlike some tech companies that maintain significant cash and deposit accounts, our tenants largely rely on safer third-party custodial and sweep accounts to minimize cash deposits. Biotech is also not reliant on venture debt to the same extent as the tech industry. And for those that do seek venture debt, SVB is by no means the only option. We expect that the life science sector will be minimally affected going forward as evidenced by venture financing rounds that closed in March is expected and continue to do so in April, which I'll touch on in more detail shortly. Before transitioning to the health of our tenant base, one quick reminder on the differentiation of our life science real estate product from traditional office, importantly, the office component of our life science buildings directly supports researchers in the lab. A scientist does not spend all day at the bench, but spends time moving back and forth between lab and adjacent office in order to, for example, analyze data, plan the next set of experiments and meet with colleagues. Thus, the office component cannot be broken out or compared to traditional office, but is an adjacent, highly integrated and critical component of laboratory design and workflows. Of course, this is also not work that can be done from home. Now transitioning to the health of our world-class diverse life science tenant base, perhaps the best way to frame the current environment is the old adage in God we trust all else spring data. Starting with pharma, which makes up 18% of our ARR, this segment continues to operate from a position of strength with strong balance sheet and significant free cash flows, pharma is less sensitive to rising rates. In 2022, biopharma deployed an estimated $267 billion into R&D. The result is tenants like Eli Lilly that continue to translate this R&D into transformative medicines. Mounjaro, which aims to treat obesity in type 2 diabetes, is predicted to eclipse $50 billion per year globally in revenue. And to put this in perspective, nearly one out of every $4 of U.S. health care spend is deployed to care for people with diabetes. And obesity is estimated to account for over $480 billion in direct health care costs in the U.S. with an additional $1.2 trillion in indirect costs due to lost economic productivity. To that end, therapies such as Mounjaro, save and extend lives and have the potential to significantly drive down the cost of health care more broadly. Transitioning to private venture-backed biotech which makes up 8% of our total ARR, we continue to see a reset of venture deployment to pre-2020, 2021 levels, which while down from peak remains strong by historic standards. Venture capitalists are more discriminate, disciplined and demanding of current and future investments. And the companies with tenured management teams and strong differentiated technologies and near-term value inflection milestones are the ones that rise above the fray. We continue to underwrite and monitor all tenants closely, and our private biotech tenants remain compared to the broader market. In fact, across this tenant base, they have raised over $1.9 billion from BC and pharma partnerships since the beginning of the year, of which $800 million has closed following the collapse of SVB. As a testament to this point, with the week remaining in April, private biotech tenant rent collection is at 99.7%. Next to public biotech, our tenants with marketed products make up 14% of our ARR generated $150 billion in revenue in 2022 and include names such as Amgen, Gilead, Vertex and Moderna. Moderna continues to highlight the potential of novel platforms to deliver innovative new medicines to patients. This month, the Company's personalized mRNA cancer vaccine in combination with an immunotherapy drug from tenant Merck, demonstrated promising clinical trial results in aggressive forms of skin cancer. Companies also continue to set high bars for continued innovation and product launches. For example, Alexandria tenant Gilead has laid out an ambitious plan to achieve 20 new drug approvals by 2030, which will entail advancement of their current pipeline, particularly in oncology, supplemented by additional M&A. For our preclinical and clinical stage public biotechs comprising 10% of our ARR, compelling clinical data remains king. Tenants such as [indiscernible] and Biomea Fusion, for example, have recently raised additional capital of promising clinical data. Prometheus Biosciences, while not a tenant exemplify how data drives the lifeblood of the industry. The Company announced stellar data in December, driving their stock up over 600% in the past 12 months and culminating in a $10.8 billion acquisition by Merck. To be clear, in the process of developing novel medicines, there will always be some that fail no matter what the market conditions. But this is baked into our mall. With the deep tenant base, relationships across every facet of the industry, and the highest quality space in operations, we can get ahead of potential tenant challenges to backfill and further optimize our tenant base. Reflecting this, in April, we've collected 100% rent from our preclinical and clinical stage public biotech tenants. Next, transitioning to academic and institutional tenants, which constitute 12% of our ARR, it's an opportunity to remember that the life science industry's cornerstone is innovation, which is not slowing. Bipartisan support for life science research remains strong. At $47.5 billion, the NIH's 2023 budget is a 21% increase over 2019. The Academic and medical institutions continue to be highly productive, a key metric being the pace of new intellectual property. In 2021, U.S. academic institutions accounted for 20,000 invention disclosures and nearly 1,000 new startups. And this activity in return is an important long-term funding mechanism for these institutions. For example, for Prometheus Bio was originally spun out of Cedars-Sinai, which is set to receive nearly $800 million from the recently announced M&A. In sum, with the majority of our academic and institutional ARR from investment-grade tenants and funding cycles that are based on multiyear grant funding time lines, this segment continues to be sheltered from larger macroeconomic conditions. Staying on the topic of innovation, a few final data points to orient the growth of the life science industry beyond the next few quarters but to the decades to come. According to the American Society of Cell and Gene Therapy, there are over 3,700 gene cell and RNA therapies in preclinical and clinical development. For chronic diseases, which drives the bulk of health care spend in the United States, there are over 800 medicines in clinical development. The culmination is continued FDA approvals and 2023 has started at a fast clip. Year-to-date, 14 novel therapies have been approved including a novel therapy for ALS developed by Tenant Biogen just announced this morning. And altogether for the year, nearly 60 novel medicines have been scheduled for FDA approval review which mirrors 2018's record year of 59 novel FDA approvals. To end, I want to reiterate that we are acutely aware of the years of abundance and easy capital that have passed and that the separation of haves and have-nots will continue to widen as the industry drills down on the technologies and medicines that bring the most value to patients and investors. But as Winston Churchill once said, \"Never let a good crisis go to waste.\" While this market is and will continue to warrant extreme prudence, it is an opportunity for the best companies to hone in on their long-term fundamentals and thrive. And that's what our tenants and Alexandria exemplify. With that, I'll pass it off to Peter. Peter Moglia : Thanks, Hallie. I just had my 25th anniversary with the Company, In addition to that milestone reminding me of how fast time moves by brought about a nostalgic look back at my time at Alexandria. I recall my interview with Joel, where I learned about this novel idea of forming a real estate company to serve the life science industry, which made me both nervous as nobody had ever done it before and equally inspired to help enable an industry that was hell bent on changing the world. After serious contemplation, I decided that if I was going to make it different in the world, this was a heck of an opportunity to do it. Plus after having been in real estate for about eight years at that point, I could see a tremendous value in offering mission-critical facilities over commodity product. I could not have made a better decision as it all proved out. Alexandria has played a critical role in the evolution of the life science industry over the last three decades by creating and growing the ecosystems and clusters that ignite and accelerate the world's leading innovators in their pursuit to advanced human health, which is our solid mission. In addition, we've built an irreplaceable world-class asset base of robust and highly differentiated properties and campuses that attract a diversified best-in-class tenant base who values our expertise and operational excellence by providing 75% to 85% of our leasing quarter-to-quarter. The result of all this is we have built a brand without here that puts us in a position where we don't rely on third parties to bring us tenants. They come to us directly as we are a trusted partner with a long successful track record of developing and operating mission-critical facilities. This is an important distinction in any part of the cycle, but perhaps even more when things have slowed down. Our results prove it out. Thank you for indulging me on that retrospective. I'm going to go and briefly touch on our development pipeline, construction costs, leasing and asset sales and then hand it over to Dean. In the first quarter, we delivered 453,511 square feet in five projects into our high barrier to entry submarkets. Annual NOI for these deliveries totals $23 million, and the initial stabilized yield is strong at 7.3%. At quarter end, projects under construction and near-term projects expected to commence construction over the next four quarters totaled 7.6 million square feet and are 74% leased or under negotiation. This is very similar to last quarter, but in response to the uncertainty and volatility in the markets, we have made a strategic decision to reduce 2023 construction spend by $250 million by pausing or delaying projects that had been classified as under construction, so we can focus our capital on the most strategic projects that have the most attractive terms, enabling our highly bedded and vast tenant base. The reduction in spend results in NOI from deliveries primarily commencing from the second quarter of '23 through the first quarter of '26 to be approximately $610 million. After commenting on construction costs for the past two years, I can still say they remain volatile but are on their way to stabilizing. The availability and price of commodities such as steel, copper, aluminum and concrete, continue to fluctuate due to shortages of raw materials, low yields for mines, high demand from electrification or low capability utilization rates in the mills and fabrication shops due to labor shortages. Cost of materials and supply chain volatility were the initial drivers of construction inflation, but now the primary driver is labor with a triple whammy of wage increases, shortage of workers and the inefficiency of the remaining labor force due to the retirement of older, more skilled labor. There are 330,000 open construction jobs today and the time it takes to train the new entrants to be highly skilled as measured in years. So these inefficiencies will be with us for a while. Specific to life science buildings, the availability of switchgear and equipment such as HVAC units and generators are -- has slightly improved but their lead times are still extraordinarily long with custom air handlers taking 27 weeks longer to get than before COVID and switch gear and generators and astounding 64 weeks longer. Even worse is the availability of large transformers provided by the utility companies, which can take as long as three years now to get. What's driving these delays are chip shortages and demand from electrification projects happening all over the world as investors, governments and end users demand improvement in carbon emissions. As you can imagine, the cost of this equipment is reflective of these shortages and paired with high labor cost is making new laboratory office projects more expensive to build than ever before. The upside for us is that 84% of our costs for our active development and redevelopment projects are under GMP or other fixed contracts with contingencies behind that. So, we are largely locked in. Anyone contemplating a speculative development these days will have to contend with these delays and associated high costs, which will put the feasibility of building and financing the project at considerable risk. One reason, we will likely not see the supply many are expecting beyond what is under construction today. Transitioning to leasing, our strong brand loyalty, mega campus offerings and operational excellence continue to drive strong leasing numbers in a challenging market. The 1.2 million square feet leased in the first quarter is above our five-year pre-2021 average and is the 12th consecutive quarter with leasing volume above 1 million square feet. We achieved attractive economics primarily from our vast tenant base, accounting for 85% of the leasing this quarter, resulting in a rental rate increase of 48.3%, which was the highest in company history and a strong cash rate of 24.2%. As we have noted previously, demand has normalized from the record year of 2021. Depending on who you ask, demand is at slightly below or slightly above pre-COVID levels. There are less tenants actively seeking space in the market today, which we believe is being significantly driven by uncertainty in the economy. As Hallie put it, this market is and will continue to warrant extreme prudence. However, we're not dependent at all on broker deal flow. There are pending opportunities from our tenant base that the broader market likely does not see due to our direct relationships with company management teams. Such relationships are a huge differentiator for us and will continue to drive solid leasing even in tough environments. Some private and preclinical clinical stage companies are making do with the space they have today until they can better understand their ability to raise capital on its cost. Capital is available. But as Hallie mentioned, BCs are more discriminate disciplined in demanding of future investments and companies with tenured management teams, strong differentiated technologies and near-term value inflection milestones are the ones that will rise above the fray. Those are the halves who by and large are Alexandria's tenants, which we have underwritten and placed into our world-class asset base, differentiated from the have nots tenant base of others who take on any tenant that can fill space with hope as their underwriting strategy. On the supply side, we track high-quality projects, we believe, are competitive to ours in the high barrier-to-entry submarkets. Accordingly, we're tracking direct vacancy in Greater Boston to be 2.8%. On lease sublease space is at 3.9% and unleased directly competitive with our AAA locations and building quality to be 1.5% to be delivered in 2023 and 5.1% to be delivered in 2024, a 1.3% total increase in availability from last quarter. In San Francisco, direct vacancy is 3.5% and sublease space is at 5.8% and unleased supply directly competitive with our assets continues to be the highest in all of our markets at 6.6% and 8.9% to be delivered in '23 and '24, respectively. This is an increase of 3.4% in total availability over last quarter, largely driven by spec building in South San Francisco. In San Diego, direct vacancy is at 4.1%, sublease space is at 2.3% and unleased competitive supply is 3.2% in 2023 and 5.4% in 2024, a slight increase of 0.2% over last quarter. Supply in all submarkets is very likely to be muted beyond what is under construction today due to high construction costs that I referenced, higher cost of capital and the lessening of generic tenant demand. We focus primarily on high barrier-to-entry markets where supply is inherently limited. We focus primarily on high barrier to entry markets and brand mega-campus offerings in those AAA high barrier to entry market locations and operational excellence enables us to continually mine our vast and deep tenant base to drive our leasing activity, which will likely lessen the impact of generic supply. I'll end with some commentary on our value harvesting and recycling progress. As we all know, the rapid rise in interest rates have not only increased investors' cost of capital but created a lot of uncertainty causing a number of investors to remain on the sidelines. Adding to the difficulty to execute in this environment is the increasing desperation of a number of office building owners trying to raise cash to stay afloat by offering quality long-term leased assets with credit tenants at 6.5% to 7.5% cap rates. Despite these challenges, the demand for high-quality life science assets which is vastly different from office assets continued in the quarter. As noted in our press release, we were pleased to transfer an 18% interest in our current JV at 15 Necco which we control and owned 90% prior to the sale. The asset is under construction and will not be delivered until the end of this year with cash flow commencing in mid-2024. The buyer will fund the remaining construction costs to deliver the property to our tenant until they reach a 37% ownership, which is expected to be the remainder of the cost to deliver the project. Given that the receipt of cash flow is over a year away, it's difficult to translate the valuation to an operating cap rate. But to give you some color, the parties agreed to evaluation at closing to be $576 million or $1,665 per square foot, which is an initial yield of 5.25% on their investment based on in-place NOI at closing. But we also agreed to credit our partner $5.5 million in fees payable. Because we sold 33% of the total 37% our partner purchased those fees equate to approximately $15 million in value. Stripping that $15 million from the purchase price gets you to a total valuation of $561 million increasing the cap rate to 5.4%. If you want to tie that to the supplemental, the $66 million price for the 18%. And the other -- if you add the other $119 million to be funded to completion and divide it by the 33% we sold, you get $561 million. This was a great outcome for Alexandria as we were able to partner with a world-class investor to monetize the value creation and secure the capital for the remaining spend in an accretive manner while retaining control of the asset and all management fees. We have not yet closed on the other transaction we signed an LOI on in the fourth quarter, but we expect to do so in the second quarter. In addition to this transaction, we have signed letters of intent or purchase and sale agreements for a number of assets, including the office campus referenced in the press release, aggregating to a total sales price of $799.3 million. These future transactions and 15 Necco account for approximately 57% of the progress needed to meet the midpoint of our disposition guidance. With that, I'm going to hand it over to Dean. Dean Shigenaga : Thanks Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. We reported excellent operating and financial results that exceeded consensus with strong core results, and our team is off to a strong start towards a solid growth for 2023. Our client tenants continued very timely payment of rent year-to-date through April. We have a very strong balance sheet. We have meaningfully reduced uses of capital for 2023, made excellent progress on dispositions and sales of partial interest, have a conservative FFO payout ratio and a growing dividend and are the go-to brand for life science real estate. We have a very strong balance sheet with $5.3 billion in liquidity, no debt maturities until 2025. Our team made excellent progress on our dispositions and sales of partial interest only four months into 2023. As Peter highlighted, we've advanced transactions aggregating $865 million. They're either completed or subject to executed LOIs or purchase and sales agreements, including the new JV partner for our build-to-suit project for UI Lilly. Many of the in-process transactions are targeted to close on or about June 30. Now we have also identified other dispositions and sales of partial interest to bring our total for the year to $1.5 billion. While the macro environment remains challenging, we are reasonably optimistic that we can execute on our disposition plan in 2023 at attractive values and cap rates. We will provide values and cap rates quarter-to-quarter as we close transactions since we're unable to do so sooner while transactions are in process. In addition to the $1.5 billion in dispositions and sales of partial interest, New JV capital forecasted for the full year of 2023 will contribute over $300 million towards construction spend this year, including most of the $119 million of contributions from the new partner we just added to our build-to-suit project for Eli Lilly. Now JV contributions to construction spend, including forecasted joint ventures were added to our detailed disclosures on Page 48 of our supplemental package. Now turning to outstanding financial and operating results, we had really strong growth of $342.9 million or up 13.9% in total revenues for the first quarter annualized in comparison to the first quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA on a trailing 12-month basis was up $246.2 million or 15.4% really strong growth of 6.8% in FFO per share for the quarter in comparison to the first quarter of 2022, again, off to a very strong start and on track for 6.4% growth in FFO per share for 2023. Now key highlights of our continued strong operating and financial performance Strong growth in revenues, adjusted EBITDA and FFO per share was driven by the continued strength across key areas of our unique and differentiated business. We had continued strength and timely payment of rent from our client tenants, 99.9% and for the first quarter and 99.7% for April that was through April 21, only three weeks into this month, pretty amazing. Continued strength in same-property NOI growth of 3.7%, 9% on a cash basis and really reflects the benefit of strong rental rate growth on leasing in recent quarters, contractual annual escalations in rent and the burn-off of some free rent. Our outlook -- our strong outlook for 2023 same-property NOI growth is 3% on a GAAP basis, 5% on a cash basis and generally consistent with our strong 10-year average for same property growth. Now turning to record rental rate growth and strong leasing volume, strong rental rate growth continued into 2023 at 48.3% on a GAAP basis, 24.2% on a cash basis from lease renewals and re-leasing the space in the first quarter. Now this was an exceptional rental rate growth, GAAP at the highest in the Company's history, both GAAP and cash rental rate growth higher than the strong rental rate growth for the full year of 2022 and 2021. Now leasing volume for the first quarter was strong at 1.2 million rentable square feet, slightly ahead of the strong quarterly average of leasing volume prior to the exceptional record-level leasing volume in both 2021 and 2022. Now the key takeaway is that the scale of our high-quality tenant roster combined with operational excellence from our team, puts us in an excellent position to benefit from the unique pool of demand from our client tenants even in this unusual macro environment. Now our strong occupancy was in line with our expectations. Occupancy was 96 -- 93.6% as of March 31 and really in line with expectations and the comments I provided on our year-end earnings call. There are three key takeaways here. First, occupancy is expected to improve in the back half of the year. Second, 371,000 rentable square feet of the recent vacancy has significant rental rate growth of 110% on a GAAP basis and 115% on a cash basis; and third, 29% of this 371,000 rentable square feet has already been leased with occupancy of some of the space beginning in the third quarter of '23. Please refer to Footnote 1 on Page 26 of our supplemental package for more information. We also absorbed $71,000 of vacancy from a building located in Texas. This is one of two buildings that were undergoing redevelopment last quarter, one building, aggregating 131,000 rentable square feet is currently 36% pre-leased and undergoing redevelopment. We decided to hold on further redevelopment of the second building, aggregating 71,000 rentable square feet until we lease up the remainder of the 131,000 rentable square foot building. The 71,000 rentable square foot building is vacant and is classified in operating properties. We continued with very strong adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. Briefly on a high-quality tenant roster, Alexander really is the brand for life science real estate, has built long-term trusted relationships and is a true partner to the life science industry. 90% of our top 20 tenants are investment-grade rated or large-cap publicly traded companies. And we highlighted continued strength of timely payments of rent from client tenants at 99.9% of rent that was due in the first quarter really reflects the strength of our high-quality client tenants, important tenant relationships and the high-quality underwriting from our research team. Briefly on venture investments, realized gains from the venture investments included in FFO averaged about $25.8 million per quarter for the last eight quarters through the end of 2022 in comparison to $20.7 million for the first quarter of 2023. Now we do expect realized gains each quarter from our venture investments for the remainder of '23 to be more consistent to slightly up from the historical quarterly average of $25.8 million that I just highlighted. Gross unrealized gains in our venture investments as of March 31 were $459 million on a cost basis of $1.2 billion. Now we've got continued consistency and growth in dividends from really high-quality cash flows we generate in our business. We've got a very low and conservative FFO payout ratio, 55% for the first quarter annualized with 5.3% increases in common stock dividends over the last 12 months. We're projecting $375 million in net cash flows from operating activities after dividends for reinvestment. At this rate, this represents over $1.1 billion of capital for reinvestment over the next three years. Briefly on external growth, we have $610 million of incremental net operating income from our pipeline of 6.7 million square feet that is 74% leased. Approximately 30% of this NOI will commence in the remaining three quarters of 2023, about 40% will commence in 2024, about 26% in 2025 and the remaining 4% thereafter. Now turning to guidance. We updated our underlying guidance assumptions for 2023. These assumptions are disclosed on Page 4 of our supplemental package. Our per share outlook for 2023 was updated to plus or minus $0.05 of a range from the midpoint of guidance, down from the plus or minus $0.10 range last quarter. Our range of guidance for EPS is $2.21 and to $2.31 and a range for FFO per share diluted as adjusted is $8.91 to $9.01 with no change at the midpoint of $8.96. Now this represents a strong 6.4% growth in FFO per share for 2023 following excellent growth last year of 8.5%. Now key updates on the underlying detailed assumptions included the following : a significant reduction of $325 million in both sources and uses of capital, including a $75 million reduction in the midpoint of acquisitions to $225 million and a $250 million reduction in construction spend at $2.725 billion. We also gave updates on significant dispositions and partial interest sales aggregating $865 million including significant transactions that are under executed LOIs and purchase and sale agreements. Now rental rate growth on lease renewals, re-lease in this space was increased 1% for both GAAP and cash to a range of 28% to 33% for GAAP and 12% to 17% on cash and occupancy was adjusted 20 basis points to reflect vacancy from 170,000 rentable square foot building located in Texas that is on hold while we lease up the adjacent building under redevelopment that is currently 36% leased. Importantly, occupancy is expected to recover in the second half of 2023. With that, let me turn it back to Joel Marcus. Thank you. Joel Marcus : So operator, can we go to questions, please? Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Please go ahead. Steve Sakwa : Joe, look, I can appreciate that you still haven't closed a lot of these deals, but I think the market would certainly appreciate just any range of commentary you could provide on sort of how to think about cap rates? I realize not singling out individual deals, but is there a way to sort of bracket them or bucket them kind of against maybe where your implied cap rate is today or maybe against the deal that Peter discussed? Joel Marcus : Well, I think the way -- and I'll have Peter certainly and Dan may want to comment as well. I think it's fair to think about we were posting low 4% cap rates, again, on Class A facilities over the last couple of years, and Peter just went through, I thought, a pretty clear explanation of the transaction in Greater Boston, which is essentially a 5.4%. So you might think about an adjustment of cap rates maybe over this transition transitioning economic time of maybe 100 basis points. So that's maybe a way to frame it, but I think you'll be pretty impressed. And I think people would be impressed when we do our second quarter call. But Peter, any comments? Peter Moglia : Yes, I agree with that assessment. I would say that we will see things that are still lower than 5% potentially when there's a good mark-to-market opportunity that can be monetized. But if it's stable, high-quality assets going to have a five handle on it just like this one did. Joel Marcus : Dan, any other comment you would throw out? Dan Ryan : Yes. No, I think not Peter did perfectly. Joel Marcus : Okay. Steve, hopefully, that's helpful. Steve Sakwa : Yes. No, that's great. And then, Joel, and maybe you and Hallie could just comment. I saw that I guess in the last supplemental, you talked about sort of dealing with 1,000 tenants. This time, you've kind of mentioned $850. My sense is half of that is retail tenants that maybe are leaving for an asset. But I suspect that maybe some of them are not retail. And I guess that really just speaks to how are you changing maybe your underwriting in the tenants that you're sort of willing to do business with today versus maybe tenants who were willing to do business with either post SVB or a couple of years ago? Joel Marcus : Yes. We didn't have 150 failures. But Dean, do you want to highlight that for a moment? Dean Shigenaga : Yes. So Steve, -- so the huge majority of the change was really due to a simple future mega campus development project that we acquired. It's a retail project known as the shops at 10 Fran. That was almost all of the change in the tenancy from roughly 1,000 to 850. You're right. Beyond that, like we highlighted, not just during this call, but over the last couple of quarters, we've had, as you would always expect some normal lease expirations that occur at the end where the tenant doesn't choose to extend. And that's fairly normal activity. And then we've also had a few tenants that have come back, as you guys are well aware and have come back to and their lease a little bit early. But that was really a handful of leases over the last couple of quarters. I think the big takeaway though is, look, you know that we do a really good job at selecting really high-quality locations in the core of the life science cluster markets. So, great locations, great facilities, and I think our operational excellence and our brand puts us in a great position to capture mark-to-market on most of these spaces that have come back. I mean the comments I provided on the vacancies that came up just in the first quarter alone with mark-to-market, both GAAP and cash north of 100%. And 29% of that space has already been leased. If you go back to my comments in the fourth quarter, I believe I gave similar comments of pre-leasing on space that had just rolled as well. So, we've got good activity. And again, going back to the crux of your question, Steve, almost all that change in the tenancy was retail related at that shopping mall. Joel Marcus : Yes. And let me maybe put a footnote on that, Steve. You asked about the nature of underwriting. I think kind of Hallie said it all that when we look at private companies or we look at preclinical public companies or even companies in the clinic that are public. So that group of tenants, you're always looking now even much more so for much nearer-term value inflection milestones and really good data and importantly, large unmet medical needs. I mean we've always done that, but I think now it just goes to show that they're going to be the haves and the others that have not. So that's really, I think, where the mindset is. Steve Sakwa : Great. And just one last question, Dean, do you have like an overall mark-to-market on kind of what you think the portfolio kind of lost the leases on the overall assets today? Dean Shigenaga : Meaning if we were to mark-to-market the rental rate, Steve, on the whole portfolio? Steve Sakwa : Yes. Dean Shigenaga : Yes, it's somewhere around -- I think last quarter, it was somewhere around 27%. This quarter, it's closer to 22% overall in the whole portfolio. Operator : The next question comes from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Anthony Paolone : You guys talked about driving a lot of your leasing from just internal relationships in your existing tenant base. And so I was wondering -- if I don't know if there's an Alexandria dashboard, so to speak, or what, but can you maybe give us a sense as to what either like leasing traffic, rate or just the aggregate amount of demand that's coming out of your portfolio today looks like versus, say, now two, three, four quarters ago? Joel Marcus : Yes. That is almost -- that's hard to do generally, and it's so submarket and building specific, Tony. Clearly, demand is overall down from the peak of '20 and '21. You see that just everywhere and you certainly see it on more of a normalization of our historical leasing, which has bounced around over the last either five-year benchmark or 10-year. But maybe the thing to say is companies that are active are pharma, and I think Peter alluded to this, bigger biotech product and service companies that aren't so much focused on the manufacturing side or the supply side. And then clearly, biotechs that whether they be public or private that have got good data coming. I think that's where you see it, but I'm not sure we could give you a numerical characterization of that. Anthony Paolone : I guess maybe a different way to ask it is if you think about the next couple of years, you see where the growth is within your portfolio, and you also know space that's coming due in your development pipeline, do you see enough demand today to absorb the space that's coming online in the next couple of years? Or do you think we should expect some moderation in occupancy levels as the demand is lower. Joel Marcus : Well, yes, I'll let maybe Peter comment on that as well. But I think it's fair to say if you look at our pipeline, which is pretty highly leased, I think we have a reasonably high level of confidence that we can fully lease those projects. And there are demand that doesn't even show up today on projects that may be on the future drawing board that we're also comfortable with. I don't think we see demand dropping off a cliff here at all. But Peter, you want to comment and Dan, you could comment as well. Peter Moglia : Yes. There's been a slowdown in activity due to the fact that boards and companies are really just trying to figure out where the economy is heading. There's definitely expansion needs. They're just not going forward with some of them, which is contributing to the reduction in demand. So, I would say that there's a nice amount of pent-up demand building. And I would say a couple of years from now that, that's definitely going to be in the market if not sooner. Anthony Paolone : Okay. And then just one -- second question, maybe a bit of detail. In the supplemental package on Page 34, you break out the portfolio between the operating assets and the various buckets of future opportunities. I guess what I'm trying to just make sure if I'm putting a cap rate on ARE's NOI and getting a value what from that slide do I need to add to that to kind of capture the totality? So I'm just trying to understand if in some of these future opportunities buckets, if there's some operating assets in those? Or I'm just trying to piece that all together, so either we're capturing everything or not double-counting something? Dean Shigenaga : Tony, it's Dean here. So you're referring to the Page 34 for others on the call, which is in the bottom right-hand corner. This page highlights square footage of our operating, but most importantly, the different categories of our pipeline, everything from construction to the future. There's no significant cash flows from assets that are sitting in the pipeline. I just want to make clear that there's a line item that adjusts the future pipeline for square footage that's sitting in operations, but those cash flows are in the operating portfolio of, Tony, as you pick up that NOI to value the Company. We just don't want you to double count the square footage as you go towards the future pipeline. But from an NOI perspective, if that's your fundamental question, the future pipeline doesn't have any significant NOI being generated at the moment. Anthony Paolone : So like that 4.2 million square feet, there's not an appreciable amount of NOI from that that we would be picking up. Dean Shigenaga : We'll wait a second, the $4.2 million is in rental properties today. It's in operations, Tony. I thought you were asking about the $38 million right above it. $37.889 million Anthony Paolone : Right. So, the $4.2 million does have some meaningful NOI associated with it. That's that we'd be out... Dean Shigenaga : Correct. So you don't want to double count the square footage there. That's why we net down the square footage in that disclosure to 30 -- roughly $34 million. Peter Moglia : Right, right. But the book value has that $4.2 million in there. Dean Shigenaga : The book value would only have it to the extent it's not related to the operating component, Tony? It's in operations, the book value would be sitting in the operating component if a larger campus had two operating buildings and a pad to support two buildings, the pad to support the future buildings would be in the future pipeline, the book basis, but the cost base is related to the operating buildings would be in operations, not in the pipeline. Operator : The next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead. Nick Joseph : Maybe just on the sourcing uses. Obviously, there's dispositions and partial interest sales that are continuing to come at different points in the cycle right now. But as you think about the ability to flex that going forward, if the transaction market stalls even more, how are you thinking about the flexibility on your end? And where could equity play into that? Joel Marcus : Yes. So Dean? Dean Shigenaga : Well, I don't know that -- I mean, it's interesting the way you posed the question. Maybe I'll start from the back end of your question. Flexing capital plan and turning to equity as a solution is not really something we are contemplating. I think the way to look at our capital point is what we are doing internally, like we did in the current quarter for earnings as well as over the last several quarters and prep for initial guidance for Investor Day this year was to really challenge the uses of capital. I think one thing to keep in mind is that -- our pipeline is $610 million of incremental net operating income from projects that are highly leased today. There's so much equity type capital that's invested in CIP today, there's very little incremental equity needed to fund that pipeline. And so, we're looking at spend across other projects as we look forward over into '24 and beyond to be sure we're prioritizing things that we should be investing into and maybe holding on things that we shouldn't be just given the macro environment. So, hopefully, that gives you just some color on how we're thinking more broadly about it. I think, as I mentioned on the call earlier, we're mindful of the macro environment. We're also in a position where we know where we are here at the end of April with a lot of good activity on the pipeline. And so, we're reasonably comfortable with our outlook into 2023 and we'll obviously provide an update as we go quarter-to-quarter, but a bulk of what we have under executed LOI or PSA agreements today is sliding to close here fairly soon, plus or minus mid-year. So we feel good about it, and we'll keep an eye on things as we go through the next two quarters. Nick Joseph : Absolutely, that's helpful. And then maybe just on that kind of reduction in development spend. How does that play into capitalized interest and interest expense in 2023? Dean Shigenaga : Yes. Well, it's all reflected in our guidance. We just gave -- so you saw there was no changes in capped interest down in the details, obviously, if you -- we did on a number of projects review strategically what we wanted to do and a number of them were put on temporary hold. If you want to look at it from that perspective, redevelopments were placed into operations as vacant assets, development projects for the future for -- they have been paused on a few circumstances, which basically were left in the future development pipeline. From a capitalization perspective, that operating building that went in -- I'm sorry, the redevelopment building that's vacant that went into operations capitalization ceased immediately. The other projects have activities that are winding down as we speak, meaning capitalization will cease over the next month to a number of months going forward. But they're all basically shutting down in the near term in the scheme of things, they're relatively small. So, we've been able to absorb that. It sits within our range of guidance. It sits within our range of FFO with other assumptions offsetting those changes. So, we are able to pick up some improvement to offset those. So hopefully, that gives you a sense. I mean we look at qualifying activities carefully across all of our projects that are undergoing construction activities and capped interest and shut them down accordingly. So you will see some of that, but they're fairly small in the scheme of this. Nick Joseph : That's helpful. And then just on the transaction market, I know you touched on cap rates, maybe up about 100 basis points in each asset, very different, though. Is there anything you're seeing from a buyer or kind of bidder pool buyer pools kind of change relative to what you've seen really over the last 12 months, just given kind of where financing costs have moved different institutions either fallen out? Or have you seen kind of any institutional interest that you hadn't seen before? Peter Moglia : Yes. It's Peter. I'll take that. We actually have a number of choices still in the market. But there are definitely some folks that are on the sidelines that are facing redemptions. And so, they're interested in accumulating more life science product, but they can't necessarily play right now. But that's been filled in by some other new folks coming in that want exposure that are also high-quality institutional investors. And yes, we have liquidity, and I'm not too concerned about that at this point. I think it will get better once there's more certainty in where the terminal rate is going to land and where cost of capital is so people get comfortable in spending their allocations for '23. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Michael Carroll : Peter, can you talk a little bit about the supply comments that you're making in your remarks. I mean are you seeing developers being more cautious pursuing new projects? I know there's a few data sources out there saying that developers are still pursuing life science projects specifically in Boston, I mean, would you agree with that statement? Peter Moglia : Yes. Certainly, there are -- there have been -- there has been spec building, especially in Boston. What we are seeing is in areas outside of our core submarkets where we don't own product, there are vacant buildings sitting there. And it's -- we're hearing that there's no tours, there's no activity. So, we don't necessarily think that those buildings are competitive to ours. There are a few projects, obviously, that we do believe, and that's where those percentages are coming in. So obviously, '23, a lot of stuff has already been delivered. There's some more coming in '24, there's more coming. We are seeing very little that is starting new today. I think there was one project in South San Francisco that has started recently, which is just beyond comprehension. But outside of that, we believe that anything that would compete in -- of our quality is in our numbers and that we don't think many, if any, people will start new projects from here on out, at least not in a material manner, but who knows? Michael Carroll : Okay. Great. And then just last, on 15 Necco, what's the reason for selling that specific, I guess, development stake? Is there any something about that building that didn't like or that was more particularly attractive to certain investors, I guess, why that property? Peter Moglia : Well, it was a fairly low yield. So we're giving away not too much upside by selling part of it, right? And are the investors that we attracted really like the building, and it was an opportunity to fund something that was near-term dollars. So it made a lot of sense. Joel Marcus : Yes. And I mean it's a world-class building with a world-class tenant. So it certainly is one of those opportunities that would attract a variety of capital sources. And we continue to be the dominant owner as well. So it kind of meets all the requirements that we have for monetization. Operator : The next question comes from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Please go ahead. Rich Anderson : So, on the $7.6 million square foot pipeline, how much -- what does that imply in terms of development spend in 2024? And how much of that is potentially some place where you can sort of tap the brakes like you kind of did this quarter in deference to the current capital raising market, please? Dean Shigenaga : Rich, it's Dean Shigenaga here. So you said $7.6 million... Rich Anderson : You use any pipeline place you want. I'm curious as to what you've committed to in terms of development spending. Dean Shigenaga : I see what number you're referring to. So you were referring to the pipeline that's under construction, 5.5 million square feet, plus another $1.2 million near term. Those are all 100% pre-leased projects. So that ties to the $610 million for others of incremental net operating income. We haven't broken out that number for '24 to spend just related to that, but that's not -- within that bucket now we've slimmed down the focus of what is continuing to generate the $610 million of NOI. And for the most part, Rich, for the most part, those are either 100% leased projects or multi-tenant projects, most of which have some level of pre-leasing. Some that don't have pre-leasing today are multi-tenant projects anywhere from a building to multiple buildings. So rightsized for delivery to requirements in the market, they're not lumpy, large build-to-suit opportunities that could be more specific to larger requirements. So I guess, a long way of saying, Rich, I think we feel comfortable with what we've rightsized for the pipeline of activity. The construction spend, plus or minus will play out like a normal curve for spend over that pipeline, roughly two years from the start of new projects, the active pipelines part way through that already. So -- what you're really focused on, though, in your question is a spend outside of that, which goes to quite a bit of activity, site work, advancing site work as well as entitlements. Entitlements are important. They add a lot of value. Site work shrinks the time to deliver buildings to a tenant, which if you looked at us two years ago, we said, let's move that along. If you look at us today, we'd say, well, let's think carefully about site work given cost of capital considerations with the macro environment today, and let's just hold on that until the right time. And so, I think we're going to look hard, as I mentioned earlier, over the next couple of quarters. We continue to refine our plan for 2024 because as I mentioned earlier, the $610 million of pipe, that pipeline does not require much more equity capital at stabilization because we have so much already in CIP which the incremental EBITDA will allow us to debt fund leverage neutral, the wide majority of the incremental capital for that pipeline such more general TIs kind of renovation costs that aren't part of development and redevelopment that we need to scrutinize in our business. Joel Marcus : Yes. And that's kind of the critical message. Rich Anderson : Yes, got it. And then the second question for me is on the success that you're having from asset sales and partial interest. It's obviously the best way to one of the best ways to raise equity capital right now for you guys today. But at what point does it become too much? Where you're parting ways with your preeminent assets, you only want to do that to a certain degree before you're giving away stuff you'd rather own 100%. So is there a sort of a number you can point to that this is how much we can raise from a disposition standpoint, still be in a range where we're comfortable with our ownership position in these fantastic assets longer term. Dean Shigenaga : Rich, it's here. I think the way to think about at a high level is that we just close the conversation about the pipeline 6.7 million square feet under construction or including 1.2 million to start in the near term here. That's a lot of product. And we just completed a lot of product over the last two or three years. So, we have added a lot of high-quality assets to our portfolio in recent years as well as coming online here over the next two to three years. So put off a piece of the portfolio makes sense. And we're mindful of your question, but we have so much coming online and that we have completed in recent years. I think we feel we're in pretty good shape. Operator : The next question comes from Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Please go ahead. Tom Catherwood : Just following up on Michael's previous question about Boston. Can you provide some more insight on the decision not to redevelop 275 Grove Street? And is there any read-through to other recent acquisitions, Greater Boston like Gatehouse Drive or presidential way? Joel Marcus : Yes. I think Peter can comment as well. I think the way we're trying to think about it is to -- I mean, we have a very significant position in the Greater Boston market, 14 million, 15 million square feet. And I think in a tougher macro environment, it's kind of thought to prune and rightsize you see what we've done last year would be a good example of -- we sold a set of really good high-quality workhorse assets, but we felt in locations that were not necessarily high barrier to entry markets, but good economics for buyers as well and good economics for us. And I think as we think about different assets, we're trying to make sure that we're more focused on the highest barrier to entry markets rather than less. And I think that's probably the best example I could maybe share Peter, but you could give you color. Peter Moglia : Yes. I mean there was one nuance to kind of focus us on 275 Grove, which was when we acquired that, there was a thought an opportunity to expand our holdings in that neighborhood and in fact, adjacent to it. So we in addition to high-barrier to enter, we also really are focused on aggregating into mega emphasis and the opportunity to do that wasn't attractive enough for us to move forward. And so we ended up with this kind of stand-alone asset, which is a really good office asset. But you have to start prioritizing and that one just kind of lost some of it shine when the opportunity to expand kind of went away. Tom Catherwood : Got it. And then Peter, sticking with you, appreciated your comments on availability rates when including 2023 and '24 deliveries. When it comes to upcoming lease expirations, you're typically in conversations with tenants a year or multiple years in advance. Are you getting any sense that tenants are engaging less on their '24 expirations or space needs given the large amount of expected deliveries between now and the end? Peter Moglia : That's a hard question to answer because it's pretty -- would be pretty granular for me to understand when I'm looking at leasing reports remembering what is expiring today versus in the future. But I believe our early renewal statistics have been fairly strong recently. So, I guess the short answer is, I don't -- I haven't noticed anything. We are constantly in communication with the regions about their upcoming renewals in a year to two years, even three years ahead at times, our -- what's the status of the Company and are they expanding? And do we want in the portfolio or not. And so, we're pretty aware. And if I think -- if there was some weakness there, I think I would have probably noticed it by now. Operator : The next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Joshua Dennerlein : I just wanted to follow up on some of those supply comments, particularly the San Francisco supply. It sounds like that's where the biggest incremental change was when you're looking at 2023 and '24 on lease unleased new supply. What in particular kind of changed on that front, new supply coming online? Or was it projects that were previously signed and then kind of the lease went away? Peter Moglia : Just some new recent starts and one, large one in particular in South San Francisco, you made up most of that change. It is just uncanny that people are still trying to put new products into the queue in a market that has a lot of vacancy. We're fortunate we have one project moving that is kind of a good niche for earlier-stage companies, mid-stage companies, so we don't have to go on an elephant hunt to lease some really large project, but there's a lot of folks out there that are going to be in a lot of trouble because of what I would think is fairly reckless investing. Joel Marcus : Well, and also, historically, if you go back to my comments, I said we have tried to shape the Company and allocate our capital as much as possible the high barrier to entry markets and mega campuses. South San Francisco, we've never had a dominant position. We chose not to win the Britannia assets came for sale quite a number of years ago and in those days, HCP bought that, I think, almost $3 billion, we valued at about $1.7 billion. So we decided to pass on that. But what's changed in South San Francisco is transportation is now a bit of an issue. Genentech transitioned to Roche, which is a great company, a world-class company, but they're not company creating in that market like Genentech was like a factory for spin-outs much like MIT is. And some of those aspects of what would otherwise be a high barrier to entry market don't exist there. So you saw some of the moves we made last year in South San Francisco, exiting a number of assets, passing on -- we passed on an option we had to do a development. And so we're being pretty darn cautious there, and you'll see that continue. Joshua Dennerlein : And then one other question. I saw you revised upward the leasing spread guidance. What was that a function of just market rent growth or just leases you actually signed in 1Q? Dean Shigenaga : It's reflective of where we usually start at the beginning of the year. If you look back over time, I think we've enjoyed the opportunity to move rental rate growth and same-property performance northward as we make our way through the year. And so, a combination of settling in on activity this quarter, as well as our continued outlook for the remainder of the year, so slight improvement overall. Operator : Next question comes from Dylan Burzinski with Green Street. Please go ahead. Dylan Burzinski : And I appreciate the color that you guys have provided thus far on sort of demand and the normalization on that front. But just curious, from a geographic perspective, are there certain markets or submarkets where the normalization is a little bit more onerous? Joel Marcus : Well, I think maybe South San Francisco might be not so much for us but maybe others. Yes, that's a good example. And we've tried to minimize limit our exposure there and transaction that we build to suit was really a bit -- it's in the South San Francisco submarket, but it's a little bit out of there. But directly on transportation, we felt was a huge competitive advantage in landed a world-class tenant to 100% occupy that development. So, I think that's one example, yes. Dylan Burzinski : And I guess just on that line of thought, like our markets like in the non-cluster markets, like RTP, suburban Maryland, are those sort of seeing similar kind of normalization demand trends as San Francisco versus maybe like your core mark submarkets like Cambridge, BTC, Torrey Pines in San Diego Joel Marcus : Yes. I think we're still seeing decent activity maybe RTP or RT, I should say, has slowed maybe a bit more than we would have guessed, but part of that's due to my guess is the mix of tenants down there in the -- not so much our tenants per se, but the mix of life science, the components of life science tenants in that market. And I think we see in Maryland, it's still pretty good. It's slower than it has been because obviously, '20 and '21 were peak times and obviously COVID dollars we're heavily focused on that market, but we're still seeing pretty decent activity that I would say, matches our historical numbers. So that's just two examples. Operator : The next question comes from Georgi Dinkov with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Georgi Dinkov : Could you please provide more color on the internal leasing pipeline that comes from your existing tenants? And how that demand compares to the broader industry? Joel Marcus : I don't think you can compare that because no one has the scale and depth of the tenant base that we do, and we know pretty instantaneously about the needs of those tenants versus if you're just in the market using brokers and you're kind of hearing here, say, your secondhand. So, the two are pretty fundamentally different. Georgi Dinkov : Understood. And apologies if I missed it, but do you have any lease termination since this quarter? And if so, how much? Joel Marcus : Dean? Dean Shigenaga : Yes, nothing significant in the quarter. Operator : Great. Appreciate it. Joel Marcus : Next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Jamie Feldman : Can you talk about the credit watch list today and just what that looks like as a percentage of your revenue versus, say, six months ago, how that number has changed? Joel Marcus : Yes. I don't know that -- I mean, we don't call it a credit watch list. I think Hallie indicated, we have a pretty methodical deep and judicious approach that has always been there. And I mean, if you looked at, say, the Rubius situation, we would say that if there's a management change that then you look at -- or you put that scrutiny at a higher level when it happens. And then as technology developments or take hold that you are informed about. And rumor sometimes when you're dealing with public companies, you have to -- sometimes we have confidentiality agreements, sometimes we don't. So information comes in different ways in different fashions. We just have a more -- much more hands-on work approach with clients. But I think the bottom line is the simple bottom line. If you look at Hallie indicated, if you look at the tenant collections by segment, they're 99% to 100%. So we've, I think, done an extraordinary job of managing rent collections and monitoring all of our tenants in a way that I don't think anyone else could even imagine. So I don't know if that's a helpful way to characterize it, Jamie. Jamie Feldman : No, that is helpful. I mean, I guess the big picture is like everyone kind of sees the headlines on what's going on in life science. Clearly, you are flying above the clouds or just have a better portfolio, a better tenant base, but it's so hard to handicap just how bad this cycle could get for you I think if you look. Joel Marcus : Yes, I mean if you look at the tenant base and where we, again, how they went through each of the segment or a number of the segments, and I think you could always say to me, the privates are in pretty good shape because they're not exposed to the public markets, and they generally assuming we've underwritten them well, and we have. They generally have good and deep backers, whether it's venture or institutional. And then you look at public, which are preclinical or in the clinic, but don't have near-term milestones. I think that's the area that everybody is really focused on, and we have very limited exposure there. I mean, for example, we turned down a lease with Sorrento Therapeutics down in San Diego some years ago because we -- it was kind of like Elizabeth well, Theranos, forget her last name, but Elizabeth Holmes. I know people who did diligence and they said they could never look at the Edison machine. Well, if you can't look at the Edison how it works and so forth, you can't underwrite the tenant. Well, that's kind of how we looked at Sorrento. We couldn't understand the science, not that we had some ability to say, hey, this is going to fail or not fail, but we simply could not understand the science that we passed on the tenancy. And that's just how we do things. Jamie Feldman : Okay. No, that's helpful. And then I guess, Dean, just back to your comment on the $25.8 million of gains you might show. I mean what's the maximum you think you could do on that number on that line item? Dean Shigenaga : Well, I mean, a couple of years back now, I think it was two years ago, Jamie, we took -- the market was able to deliver on some unique liquidity events within the portfolio, and we had something just north of $200 million in realized gains. Now, our policy has been these large significant unusual items. They're one-off. There aren't events that we control. And those, as you go back about $100 million of that was excluded from FFO per share. These were individually very significant gains. But that's just one example as a historical data point, Jamie, is -- but if you look back for now, I think this would be the third year that we're into this run rate right at about $100 million, $105 million on average, I think, for the last couple of years. And that's kind of the general outlook other than having a slightly lower number for the first quarter. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks. Joel Marcus : Just simply thank you very much, and we look forward to talking to you on second quarter call. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz with Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Paula Schwartz : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The Company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the Company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel. Joel Marcus : Thank you, Paula, and welcome, everybody, to our second quarter earnings call. Our one-of-a-kind company, which pioneered the lab space niche, continues to perform well in both good times and tough times, demonstrating the resiliency of our unique business model in our now post-pandemic world. In fact, COVID-19 really reaffirmed the sustained strength of our life science industry fundamentals and the need for our essential lab space infrastructure. This favorable backdrop for this nation's -- one of the nation's most mission-critical industries, which we serve, continues to underpin our business, driving demand for our world-class brand and highly differentiated assets and operations. I want to thank each and every member of the Alexandria family team for an operationally and financially excellent second quarter. A big shout out to the finance and accounting team for winning the 2023 NAREIT Gold Award awarded by NAREIT in June for the best REIT reporting and transparency, and amazingly, an unprecedented eighth award and most ever by any REIT. Alexandria is truly a best-in-class REIT, which pioneered the lab space niche and which I believe has made a metamorphic and innovative and transformational impact on our life science industry for the last 29 years. We're very proud of the stellar balance sheet we built since the days of the great financial crisis when we were a small and unrated REIT. Upon the closing of our $1 billion line of credit accordion add-on, one of the banks said of Alexandria \"Congratulations on the successful expansion of your credit facility to $5 billion.\" This is a significant accomplishment in any environment where many real estate owners are struggling to source debt capital. It is a testament to the strength, quality and endurance of the Alexandria platform. So let me turn to some highlights of the quarter. Dean will cover in detail, but I want to just give a little bit of perspective. The second quarter was a very strong reporting quarter, generally in line with our 5- and 10-year historical run rates, REIT financial metrics and certainly outside of the rocket ship performance during COVID. We had strong FFO per share growth in both the second quarter and the first half approximating 7%, especially in a continuing challenging macro and nicely beating consensus. Strong leasing quarter at 1.3 million rentable square feet ahead of the historical run rate of about 1.1 million square feet and NOI was up nicely, almost $200 million for the quarter. Positive rental growth, stable occupancy and solid same-store NOI increases also hosted. The continuing strength and I think overall solidity of our fortress balance sheet continues. Our ability to reiterate and maintain strong guidance, way, all the metrics should demonstrate our continuing confidence and our tenants demand for essential lab space, coupled with our ability to operate successfully in a moderately elevated supply dynamic environment. And then let me make a couple of comments on the life science industry, which Jenna will detail in just a moment, a couple of high-level observations. M&A, a critical part of the capital recycling, continues to increase mostly with bolt-on product deals, which is a good and positive sign. Series A rounds in 2023 so far have averaged about $60 million, an all-time high, and biologics, not surprisingly, have attracted the majority of early-stage investments. And with that kind of brief intro, let me turn it over to Jenna Foger. Jenna Foger : Thank you so much, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Jenna Foger, Senior Vice President and Co-Lead of our Science and Technology team here at Alexandria. Today, I'm going to comment on the solid fundamentals of the secularly growing life science industry, how these fundamentals contribute to the continued vitality and health of Alexandria's best-in-class life science tenant base and innovation as a long-term driver of life science industry growth. The secularly growing life science industry, which has an estimated market value of over $5 trillion and approximately $450 billion in estimated 2023 R&D funding, fuel is continuing demand for Alexandria's essential 24/7 lab space infrastructure across our cluster markets. This industry is driven by the achievement of scientific, clinical and commercial milestones and is not significantly impacted by market cyclicality nor by some of the macro trends impacting commodity REITs today. With over 10,000 diseases known to humankind and less than 10% addressable with current therapies, the incredible innovation taking place within our lab-based facilities is and will remain a national imperative. Taking a closer look at the health of our tenant base, beginning with multinational pharma, which makes up 17% of our ARR, this segment continues to operate from a position of strength. In 2022, biopharma deployed an estimated $267 billion into R&D, representing a 57% increase in biopharma R&D spend over the past 10 years, which is expected to continue to increase. Given the immense capital firepower on the balance sheets of large-cap pharma in excess of $300 billion and the healthy pressure on pharma to continue to pad its late-stage pipelines with sources of new revenue, there's been a significant uptick in M&A, as Joel mentioned. The first half of 2023 M&A deal value has already totaled $97 billion, surpassing total M&A transaction values for full years '21 and '22, pumping additional liquidity into the sector. We also see increased pharma partnering activity across our regional ecosystems as well. Transitioning to private venture-backed biotech, which makes up 10% of our total ARR, we continue to see healthy life science center activity with a significant $17.7 billion invested in the first half of 2023, which while down from the record pandemic period peak, life science venture activity remains quite strong by historic standards and in line with 2018 and 2019 levels. Given the record high years of venture fundraising by life science venture funds in '21 and '22, there is still plenty of dry powder to deploy of course, given the broader capital market context and a very narrow IPO window, venture capitalists are more discriminate, disciplined and demanding of new and future investments with the expectation that companies may need to stay private for longer. Private biotechs with tenured management teams, strong differentiated technologies and clear line of sight to value inflection milestones consistent with our own tenant underwriting selection criteria are the ones that continue to rise above the fray. As for public biotech, our public biotech tenants with marketed products make up 14% of our ARR and include companies such as Amgen, Gilead, Vertex and Moderna. This is also a very healthy segment of our tenant base with substantial revenues and continues to be a critical contributor to innovation and partnerships across our ecosystem. For our preclinical and clinical stage public biotech comprising 10% of our ARR, compelling clinical data remains king, and this segment of our tenant base continues to perform. Tenants such as Black Diamond, Medicine and Biomass Fusion to name a few have recently raised substantial follow-on public equity financing on the heels of promising clinical data. As we always have, our science and technology team continues to meticulously underwrite and monitor all of our tenants very closely. Notwithstanding in the process of developing novel medicines, there will always be some that fail in every type of macro market environment. And this is, of course, baked into our model. With a deep tenant base relationships across every facet of the industry and in each of our regional ecosystems and of course, the highest quality infrastructure and operations, we get ahead of potential tenant challenges to backfill and further enhance our tenant roster. Reflecting the health of our current tenant base in 2Q '23, tenant rent collections were at 99.9%, and we've already collected over 99.7% of July rent. Now a word on innovation, catalyzed by groundbreaking technologies, new modalities, massive unmet medical need and strong fundamentals, the life science industry remains uniquely positioned to tackle and solve our most persistent and major health care challenges. The emergence of a new golden age of biology only bolsters the strength and growth potential of this vital industry. In this new historic age, the FDA has approved over 450 new drugs over the past decade, and 2023 is on track to be a near all-time record high year of new drug approvals, starting the year off with over 60 PDUFA dates set on the FDA calendar to review new drug applications. Collectively reflecting the productivity and impact of the life science industry to bringing new medicines to patients, many of our tenants are at the forefront of this innovation. To name a few, Pfizer and GSK, each received new approvals this year for their respective RSV vaccines, an incredible feat given a long history of failed vaccine development in RSV. And Biogen's tofersen also received a Vanguard approval for ALS, a debilitating neurodegenerative treatment lacking current -- debilitating neurodegenerative disorder lacking current treatments. These trends reaffirm the fundamental truth Alexandria recognized nearly three decades ago. Our fully integrated mission-critical lab space infrastructure centered in core hubs of innovation is essential for our tenants to advance scientific discoveries and improve human health. Through every market cycle, Alexandria's tenants rely on a central lab-based infrastructure for the intended purpose to provide 24/7 compliant fully integrated and workflow optimized facilities to house, operate, advance and help safeguard in aggregate billions of dollars of scientific research, specialized equipment, pipeline programs and commercial assets. It is the advancement of this science and related intellectual property in Alexandria's lab space building that drives the utilization of and demand for space. Much like a data center that is constantly and consistently capturing and storing data throughput, the volume, velocity and value of the scientific throughput occurring in our spaces at any point in time is not correlated with the volume of people flowing in and out of our buildings and campuses. As such, a more relevant metric for measuring the utilization of Alexandria's lab space assets by our tenants is energy consumption. And we have seen consistent same-store electricity energy consumption -- same-store electricity consumption across Alexandria's lab space asset base today as we did in pre-pandemic years. Equally as important to note, within Alexandria's lab space assets, the laboratories and adjacent non-technical space cannot be decoupled. Each tenant base floor and building plan is fully integrated and intentionally designed to enable seamless workflows between laboratory and nontechnical spaces within the leased premises. Remember, the majority of tenant employees in our lab space assets interact with the science in the lab in some ways, including to conduct experiments, analyze and interpret data, plan new experiments, make business decisions about the data or engage in other related activities. This is the nature of life science companies research workflows, critical aspects of which clearly cannot be performed from home. And lastly, collaboration, collaboration is also fundamental to innovation and overall life science industry productivity and really critical for translating discoveries from academia into treatments, diagnostics and cures by biotech and pharma companies. It is also a key reason why 17 of the top 20 multinational biopharma's lease space from Alexandria across our regional markets to access this early innovation. And I point to the recent example from Verve and Lilly collaboration in Greater Boston, Pipeline Therapeutics and J&J collaboration in San Diego as two recent examples of collaboration across our campuses. Now given the proprietary and regulatory considerations, these collaborations are, of course, intentionally and tightly managed by executive teams and employees from one company are not wandering back and forth between discrete tenant spaces to collaborate ad hoc. Clearly, more or less people in a building or on a campus is really not correlated with more or less collaboration. So to wrap my comments, while today's broader macro environment will continue to warrant extreme prudence, it is an opportunity for the best life science companies reflected across Alexandria tenant base to benefit from the secularly growing life science industry solid fundamentals and to continue to advance the technologies and medicines that will bring the most value to patients. And with that, I pass it off to Peter. Peter Moglia : Thanks, Jenna. A few days ago, when reading a capital markets report, I came upon the line, uncertainty is arguably the harshest enemy of investing. It was a very concise way of describing what we have all been seeing in the broad economy over the past couple of years. It has even hit the somewhat insulated life science industry over the past few quarters, manifested by slower decision-making and the tightening of budgets by executive teams and boards. Nonetheless, progress continues in the labs, milestones are being achieved and success is being rewarded. The golden age of biology will not be stopped. The flywheel is starting to turn again, and we're excited to see the like changing innovations that inertia will bring, and Alexandria is perfectly positioned to capitalize on it. I'm going to briefly touch on our development pipeline, leasing, supply, and asset sales and then hand it over to Dean. In the first quarter, we delivered 387,076 square feet in four projects into our high barrier to entry submarkets, bringing total deliveries year-to-date to 840,587 square feet covering seven projects. Annual NOI for this quarter's deliveries totaled $58 million, bringing the year-to-date total incremental additions to NOI to $81 million. The initial weighted average stabilized yield is 6.4%, influenced by a build-to-core project in East Cambridge housing the next generation of companies from the investors who brought the world Moderna. Development and redevelopment projects saw an uptick in activity for the quarter with approximately 142,000 square feet of leases signed, covering six multi-tenant projects. As of quarter end, we have another 42,000 square feet under negotiation. During the quarter, we placed a lab conversion opportunity at 401 Park Drive and the ground-up development of neighboring 421 Park Drive, both located in the Greater Boston submarket of the Fenway into near-term projects expected to commence construction in the next three quarters, stabilizing in 2025 and beyond. A portion of the 421 Park Drive project is in process of being presold to a research institute, which will be a highly complementary to the development of the mega campus and the proceeds will help fund the remaining 392,000 square feet of the development. This transaction, along with a joint venture that will fund the remainder of 15 Necco, which closed in April, are great examples of the optionality Alexandria has to fund its value creation pipeline. At quarter end, our pipeline of current and near-term projects is 70% leased and is expected to generate greater than $605 million of annual incremental NOI, primarily through the second quarter of 2026. The decline from 72% leased last quarter was due to the addition of the new Fenway projects. Excluding those additions, the pipeline would have been 74% leased. Transitioning to leasing and supply. Once again, our strong brand loyalty, mega campus offerings and operational excellence continue to drive strong leasing numbers in a challenging market. We are pleased to report leasing volume of 1.3 million square feet achieved in the second quarter, which again exceeded our five-year pre-2021 average and is the 13th consecutive quarter where we have achieved a leasing volume above 1 million square feet. Rental rate increases were 16.6% and 8.3% on a cash basis reflective of leasing volume heavily weighted towards Seattle, Research Triangle and Maryland. Despite spreads coming down from the COVID rocket ship numbers, net effective rents remained strong in our operating assets due to their generic build-out, which enables renewals in the re-leasing of vacant space with minimum CapEx. Another positive realized this quarter was a notable increase in demand, ranging from 15% to 20% in our top three markets, a sign that perhaps investors are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel when it comes to economic uncertainty, but also likely driven by significant dry powder they need to put to work. There have also been an increase in 100,000 square foot plus requirements in a few regions driven by large pharma and biotech anticipated venture creation investments. Alexandria is well positioned to capture this demand because many of these opportunities are coming from existing relationships, which typically account for a significant amount of our leasing. In the first half of the year, we have leased 2.55 million square feet, of which 82% was generated from existing tenants. In addition, our mega campus offerings providing the ability to scale in a wide variety of amenities are the clear choice of high-quality companies. We spent considerable time during our G&A REIT meetings discussing supply and recently covered it in our white paper. The data presented in those meetings and the white paper was from the first quarter of '23, and we'll update it for you here. As a reminder, we perform robust on the ground, building-by-building analysis to identify and track new supply from high-quality projects we believe are competitive to ours in our high barrier to entry submarkets. We focus primarily on high barrier to entry markets and our brand mega campus offerings in AAA locations and operational excellence enables us to continually mine our vast, deep and loyal tenant base to drive our leasing activity, which will likely lessen the impact of generic supply. In Greater Boston, unleased competitive supply remaining to be delivered in 2023 is estimated to be 1.6% of market inventory, a slight increase of 0.01% over last quarter. In 2024, the unleased competitive supply will increase market inventory by 5%, a 0.3% reduction due to the lease-up of that inventory during the quarter. In San Francisco, unleased competitive supply remaining to be delivered in 2023 is estimated to be 6.6% of market inventory, which is unchanged. In 2024, the unleased competitive supply will increase market inventory by 8.8%, a 0.3% reduction due to a downward revision of estimated square footage to be delivered during the year. In San Diego, unleased competitive supply remaining to be delivered in 2023 is estimated to be 3.5% of market inventory, which is a decrease of 0.8%, due mainly to projects being delivered with unleased space now reflected in direct vacancy. In 2024, the unleased competitive supply will increase market inventory by 4.9%, a 0.4% reduction due in part to a pause conversion project and a decrease in scope of another one. Direct and sublease market vacancy for our core submarkets is updated as follows. Greater Boston direct vacancy stayed stable at 2.8%, but sublease vacancy increased by 1.5% to 5.4% for a net increase in available space and operation of 1.5%. San Francisco direct vacancy stayed stable at 2.3%, but sublease vacancy increased by 2.7% to a total of 6.2% for a net increase in available space and operation of 2.7%. San Diego direct vacancy increased from 4.1% to 4.8%, largely due to delivered unleased new supply, and sublease vacancy increased by 1.8% for a net increase in available space in operation of 2.5%. We are tracking new supply to be delivered in 2025, and we'll update you on those statistics next quarter. For our current read is that volume will be below 2024 deliveries, likely due to high construction costs, higher cost of capital, a lack of available debt financing and adequate supply currently under construction. I'll conclude with an update on our value harvesting asset recycling program. We are quite proud and fortunate to own assets in a scarce asset class. As you all know, the past few months have had little transactional activity in the broad markets. But because of the attractiveness of our product type, Alexandria has been able to make great progress towards reaching our value harvesting goals. At quarter end, we had closed $701 million of sales, including the 15 Necco sale announced last quarter and have another $175 million pending for a total of $876 million, which is a little over halfway to our midpoint guidance. We have a number of other efforts in progress or soon to be launched that would exceed our guidance if we choose to execute on all of the opportunities. The vast majority of those identified assets are noncore non-campus assets we plan to fully dispose of and reinvest the proceeds into our value-add pipeline. Notable sales closed in the first quarter include the sale of 100% interest in 11119 North Torrey Pines Road for $86 million or $1,186 per square foot at a strong 4.6% cap rate. There is a significant mark-to-market on the asset when the lease expires in approximately 4.5 years, but a fair amount of capital will be needed to execute on that opportunity. This asset was a one-off for us, and there was no opportunity for us to aggregate a campus around it. We sold 20.1% of our joint venture interest in 9625 Towne Centre Drive, an asset jointly owned with an institutional partner who wanted to exit their position and initiated the sales process for their interest only. Given the strong demand for this University Towne Centre asset, we decided to participate in the sale, which captured $32 million in proceeds at a strong 4.5% cap rate, reflective of the high-quality building, tenant credit and the future mark-to-market opportunity we will participate in with our continued ownership. A portfolio of non-core assets inclusive of our Second Avenue assets in Waltham and our legacy non-mega campus affiliated 780 & 790 Memorial Drive asset located in Mid-Cambridge sold for $365.2 million or $852 per square foot at a combined cash cap rate of 5.2%, reflective of a mix of credit quality, some vacancy and term. We also completed the sale of pure office asset 275 Grocery in Newton, Massachusetts. Originally planned for conversion to lab as part of an assemblage of adjacent assets into a mega campus with green line access, the opportunity did not come to fruition. So, we made the prudent decision to sell this noncore office asset. The $214 per square foot price reflects its 70% occupancy. The negative sentiment of office buildings outside of cluster locations and a significant amount of capital needed to reposition the asset. Overall, we are very pleased with the results achieved thus far in our value harvesting asset recycling program. As mentioned, we have identified more than enough noncore opportunities to achieve our goals to fund our 2023 growth, primarily through dispositions. With that, I'll pass it over to Dean. Dean Shigenaga : All right. Thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. We reported very solid operating and financial results for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2023. Total revenues for the second quarter were $713.9 million, up 10.9% over the second quarter of 2022. NOI was up 12.2% over the second quarter of 2022, driven primarily by the commencement of $58 million of annual net operating income related to the 387,000 rentable square feet of development and redevelopment projects that were placed in service in the second quarter. The significant NOI growth from completion of pipeline projects was the key driver of our outperformance this quarter in comparison to consensus. Additionally, we slightly beat other key line items relative to consensus. FFO per share diluted as adjusted was $2.24, up 6.7% over the second quarter of 2022, and we're on track to generate another solid year of growth in FFO per share growth of 6.4% at the midpoint of our guidance for the year. Now high-quality life science entities continue to appreciate our brand mega-campus strategy and operational excellence by our team. 49% of our annual rental revenue is generated from investment-grade or large-cap publicly traded tenants, and this statistic represents one of the highest quality client rosters in the REIT industry today. Our collections remain very high at 99.9%. Our adjusted EBITDA margin remains very strong at 70%. Same-property NOI growth was very solid and in line with guidance for the full year. Same property results for the second quarter were 3%, up 3% and up 4.9% on a cash basis, and for the first half of the year, up 3.4% and up 6.5% on a cash basis. As a reminder, our outlook for 2023 same-property NOI growth remains very solid at a midpoint of 3% and 5% on a cash basis. Now turning to leasing. Quarterly leasing results are driven by a relatively small volume of and mix of transactions that drive the overall rental rate growth related to lease renewals and re-leasing the space. Now for the second quarter, leasing volume was 1.3 million rentable square feet, and rental rate growth on lease renewals and re-lease in the space was up 16.6% and 8.3% on a cash basis. Now rental rate growth for the second quarter was driven by transactions based out of the Seattle region, Maryland and Research Triangle in comparison to record rental rate growth in the first quarter of 48.3% and 24.2% on a cash basis, which was driven by transactions out of Greater Boston, San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle. Our outlook for rental rate growth on lease renewals and re-leasing space remained solid at the midpoint of 30.5% and 14.5% on a cash basis. The overall mark-to-market for cash rental rates related to in-place leases for the entire asset base remains very strong at 19%. Now capital expenditures generally fall into two key categories. The first category is focused on development and redevelopment. And redevelopment specifically is the first time conversion of non-lab space to lab space through redevelopment. Now the second category is nonrevenue-enhancing capital expenditures. And our nonrevenue-enhancing capital expenditures over the last five years have averaged 15% of net operating income and has been trending lower for 2022 at 13%. For 2023, this is closer to 10% based upon the second quarter '23 net operating income on an annualized basis. Tenant improvement allowances related to lease renewals and re-leasing the space have been very modest at about $16 per square foot for the first half of the year, and these costs are included in the nonrevenue-enhancing capital expenditures that I mentioned earlier. Second quarter occupancy was in line with expectations at 93.6%, consistent with first quarter occupancy. Our outlook for 2023 reflects flat occupancy from the second quarter to the third quarter and occupancy growth in the fourth quarter. The midpoint of occupancy guidance is 95.1%, and occupancy as of June 30 of 93.6% included vacancy of 2.2% or approximately 900,000 rentable square feet from properties that were recently acquired in 2021 and 2022. Now 23% of the recently acquired vacancy is already -- has already been leased and will be ready for occupancy over the next number of quarters and an additional 14% is under negotiation. Now a huge thank you to Marc Binda and his entire team and our important relationship lenders under our $5 billion line of credit. During the quarter, we increased aggregate commitments available under our line of credit to $5 billion, up from $4 billion. Now this has allowed us to increase liquidity on our balance sheet to over $6.3 billion as of June 30. Now during the first half of '23, we had remained very flexible with our strategy and pivoted toward outright dispositions versus sales of partial interest. Our team has made excellent progress on dispositions and sales of partial interest for the first half of the year and are working on a number of transactions for the second half focused primarily on outright dispositions. There are more details on Page 7 of our supplemental package for your reference. Now turning to consistent growth in dividends from our high-quality cash flows. We have a low and conservative FFO payout ratio of 55% for the second quarter annualized with 5.2% increase in common stock dividends over the last 12 months. We're projecting $375 million, representing a three-year run rate of over $1.1 billion in net cash flows from operating activities after dividends for reinvestment. Turning to venture investments. Realized gains from our venture investments included in FFO for the second quarter was $22.5 million and has averaged about $25 million per quarter for the last eight quarters. Gross unrealized gains on our venture investments as of June 30 were $373 million on a cost basis of just under $1.2 billion. Now on external growth, we have $605 million of incremental net operating income from our pipeline of 6.7 million rentable square feet. Now projects aggregating 3.7 million rentable square feet is expected to reach stabilization in 2020 -- in the remainder of 2023 and 2024. And these projects are 94% leased and will generate $277 million of incremental net operating income. Additionally, we have another 3.7 million rentable square feet that is expected to reach stabilization after 2024 and will generate another $328 million of incremental net operating income. Turning to guidance, our detailed updated underlying guidance assumptions are disclosed beginning on Page 4 of our supplemental package. Our per share outlook for 2023 was updated to a range plus or minus $0.03 from the midpoint of guidance down from a range plus or minus $0.05 last quarter. Now our range of guidance for EPS is from $2.72 to $2.78 and our range for FFO per share diluted as adjusted is $8.93 to $8.99 with no change in the midpoint of $8.96. Now this represents a strong 6.4% growth in FFO per share following excellent growth last year of 8.5%. Our strategy for dispositions and sales of partial interest for 2023 reflects our focus on enhancement of our overall asset base through outright disposition of properties no longer integral to our mega-campus strategy with fewer sales of partial interest. Now this is reflected in the transactions we have completed to date in 2023 and our target transactions for the second half of the year. This strategy did result in an update to sources and uses of capital due to the replacement of a potential sale of a partial interest with an outright sale of properties. Now while this change did not result in a change in gross construction spend, it did reduce funding for construction spend by a potential JV partner that was replaced with funding from an additional $225 million in dispositions of real estate. Let me stop there and turn it back over to Joel to open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Please go ahead. Steve Sakwa : Dean, I was wondering if you could just provide a little bit more color on that occupancy build that you talked about. It sounds like things are flat Q2 to Q3. But to get to the midpoint, there's a pretty big uplift, I guess, from 93.6% to 95.1%. So are there a bunch of signed leases that are just not commenced yet? Or is that based on kind of incremental leasing you think you're going to do? Just kind of help us walk through that bridge, please. Dean Shigenaga : Sure, Steve. So the growth in occupancy anticipated in the fourth quarter, some of it is from signed leases. We have about 400,000 square feet of executed leases that will commence in time for the occupancy growth by the end of the year. That includes some of the spaces that I mentioned in the recently acquired vacancy. We also anticipate some leasing activity that we need to complete in order to drive that occupancy growth. And then we also have some key spaces being delivered out of our development pipeline, which by the time they're delivered should be pretty much close to 100% leased. And that doesn't have quite the same impact of delivering space to tenants out of the operating portfolio, but there is a slight benefit from that as well. Steve Sakwa : So just as a quick follow-up, could you just help frame maybe the spec leasing that you think you need to get done maybe as a range that the team needs to complete over the next five months to hit that target? Dean Shigenaga : I don't have that figure right at my fingertips, Steve. But look, if you look at our volume of leasing activity that we've averaged pre -- the record period of leasing in '21 and 2022, we're back to that run rate of leasing activity on a quarterly basis, which is 1.2 million, 1.3 million rentable square feet. A portion of that, as you know, comes out of the value creation pipeline development and redevelopment and previously vacant stuff. So, our run rate on renewals and re-leasing the space is probably, on average, about 1 million square feet per quarter; and only a portion of that is stuff that we need to complete related to fourth quarter deliveries. As you can imagine, most space, probably for any real estate company, sometimes it's ready for delivery immediately, but only a portion of that -- of that 1 million square feet can actually be delivered that quickly. So, it's not a big number, Steve. But to be fair, we do have to get some leasing done. And so we've got to work through that opportunity. Steve Sakwa : Okay. And just a second question. I know that you had talked about the Toast termination. But I think there's just maybe some confusion or uncertainty over kind of the dollar amount. Maybe when it hits, how it might have been in guidance or not in guidance. So could you just maybe walk through the space take back, maybe some offsets to the termination fee and maybe what flowed through in Q2 and what we should expect in Q3 from that transaction? Dean Shigenaga : Sure, Steve. So this is a pretty good example of space that we opportunistically took back in the second quarter. The background for this tenant, there was an in-place lease related to an acquisition that we completed in January of 2021. Toast was at 401 Park in the Fenway submarket for reference. And during our due diligence for the acquisition, our team had identified multiple floors of this office building that will be suited for conversion to lab space through redevelopment. These floors were targeted for redevelopment. Obviously, after our successful lease-up of 201 Brookline, now if you remember, 201 Brookline that was a development site at the Fenway campus that the seller had commenced construction on, and it was only 20% pre-leased at the time we acquired it. Our team quickly leased the remainder of that project -- the construction development project at rental rates that were well exceeded our initial underwriting. And so when we had the opportunity to take back space from Toast, I think it was about 133,000 rentable square feet in total. We're going to get about 111,000 rental square feet back in 3Q here to commence our redevelopment. And the remaining 22,000 rentable square feet we get back at the end of 2024. The bottom line, the way to think about this arrangement we entered into with Toast is that net of the write-off of deferred rent, we'll earn the remaining of the revenue from Toast overtime. And this really covers the quarterly rent that was due to rent Toast about 1.59 a quarter. And so, this arrangement allows us to earn our revenue through the end of 2024. And the way to think about this is the net benefit we're going to earn is a slight pickup relative to the prior run rate rent. So for 2023, we might pick up about $2 million in FFO. And then in 2024, there's a similar expected benefit of a couple of million bucks or so. The key takeaway is that we were able to move up the timing of new lab space at 401 Park after our successful lease up of 201 Brookline. And so, we were excited to be able to get access to that earlier to start the redevelopment sooner than later. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Joshua Dennerlein with BOA. Please go ahead. Joshua Dennerlein : I appreciate all the color. Maybe a follow-on based on the occupancy earlier, but focused on the lease rate growth. It looks like your guidance is still assuming an acceleration in the second half of the year off of 2Q growth rates. What gives you the confidence that you'll see that reacceleration? Dean Shigenaga : Can you clarify, were you asking about occupancy or rental rate growth? Joshua Dennerlein : Rental rate growth. Dean Shigenaga : So, our outlook -- just to remind everybody, our outlook for rental rate growth for 2023 is a range of 28% to 30%, call it, a midpoint of 28.5%, 12% to 17% with a midpoint of 14.5% on a cash basis. Our rental rate growth for the first quarter, just to remind everybody, was pretty record at 48% and 24% on a cash basis. And most of that was driven by Greater Boston, San Francisco, Bay Area and Seattle. It's important to recognize that the second quarter was a very different subset geographically, which consisted primarily of Seattle, Maryland and Research Triangle. When you think about rental rate growth of 16% -- 16.6% on a GAAP basis, 8.3% on a cash basis, that's pretty outstanding in this type of market and when you think across the REIT sector today. So we're very pleased with the rental rate growth that we actually delivered on the quarter and feel comfortable as we look out that we're on track to hit the range of guidance that we gave. What gives us that comfort? I think you've heard us talk about we have a unique brand our mega-campus strategy and our operational excellence, I think, puts us at an advantage to capture opportunities in the marketplace. Joshua Dennerlein : Okay. It's not based on stuff that's already signed. It's kind of just what you're seeing in the pipeline are signed? Just kind of... Dean Shigenaga : Well, we're only 3 weeks or 3.5 weeks after quarter end. So, there's very little activity relative to what we're going to sign for the full six months as we look forward. So you'll have to stay tuned. Joshua Dennerlein : Okay. Okay. And then Peter, I heard you mentioned potential sales above your disposition guidance range. Just what would give you the go ahead to make those additional sales? Peter Moglia : We're going to market in a very targeted way so that we don't overdo it, if we don't need to. But if we end up with values that are highly attractive, we'll definitely consider selling that amount over what we need and apply that towards next year's program. Joel Marcus : Any other question there? Joshua Dennerlein : I'm good. Operator : Our next question today comes from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Anthony Paolone : First question, I think -- Dean, I think you mentioned 19% mark-to-market across the portfolio. And I think that number was about 27% coming into the year. So just wondering, can you talk to how much of that's just from moving rents higher and the bumps closing some of that gap versus maybe what's happened in the market thus far? Dean Shigenaga : Tony, it's Dean here. Yes, so 19% is our current outlook for where we are today on the mark-to-market. Last quarter, you're correct, it was 22%. The quarter before that was 24% and the quarter before that was 27%. So, we have made our way through some of the mark-to-market with leases that we've executed over the last number of quarters. So, it's primarily driven by that, maybe a slight adjustment here and there on our outlook on specific spaces. But most of the move is related to actual leases we've executed. Anthony Paolone : Okay. And then, I guess, you talked a bit about 401 and 421 Park Drive and the reason for kind of moving forward with that. But just in general, just think about incremental development and redevelopment, so for instance, in 2024, it looks like you got another 1.5 million or so teed up coming out of expirations for that. But just what's the hurdle to start new projects, whether it's pre-leasing, returns? Just how should we think about just what's coming out in the next 12, 18 months, whether it's the stuff expiring that will go into redevelopment or just new ground up? Dean Shigenaga : So Tony, let me start with your first part of your question on the exploration front. What we're really looking at is if you look at 2024 as an example, we do have a number of spaces that are coming up for contractual exploration. And keep in mind, these are all related for the most part to recently acquired opportunities where we saw. In this case, these projects have in-place leases and from acquisition that are burning off here. Only a portion of that overall number is something that we expect to actually tackle in the near term. It's roughly -- it's about 684,000 square feet of that is actually development opportunities for the future. So 1.1 -- 1.2 million is expiring in '24 that's been targeted for future development and redevelopment, but 684,000 of that is future development. And that's not going to start immediately on vertical construction because it needs to go through entitlements, design, possibly some site work, and these are really associated with mega campus opportunities. The remainder of that, so roughly 400,000 square feet or so, 400,000 to 500,000 square feet is redevelopment opportunities. Those are more near-term speed to market, less time to build out the projects, and we'll look at those. But our current view as we sit here today would be there's potential to start those because of opportunities we can tackle. So, the number is much smaller. As far as your other question, Tony, how do we look at it? I think you're going to find that we need to remain very disciplined with our approach to new redevelopment and development projects given the macro environment. We're going to focus primarily on projects that are concentrated in our mega campuses, and we really have well-located land for future development. It's important to keep in mind we have the flexibility and not the requirement to address these expansions -- expansion needs from our clients. And maybe as you think about development opportunities on our future pipeline, it's important to recognize that we are going to continue to advance preconstruction activities on the future pipeline projects. Entitlements for large campuses -- mega campuses, it require years to fully entitled. They require design. And oftentimes, the sites are so large, they do require infrastructure before we can actually commence vertical construction. And these preconstruction activities add value to the sites ultimately reduce the time from commencement of vertical construction to delivery a Class A space to our clients. So again, just getting back to where we started with your question, Tony, we'll have to remain very disciplined in our approach, given the macro environment. Joel Marcus : Yes. Maybe just a little more color, Tony. We have one new mega campus that we're entitling on the West Coast and one on the East Coast. And in both cases, we have, in one case, a current tenant, in the other case, a former tenant, have approached us to take a significant portion of those campuses. So, we're actively pushing entitlements and thinking about site design and all those things. But before we would kick something off, as Dean said, and as Peter said many times, we want to make sure that our spread to our cost of capital is sufficient and long-term IRRs to be certainly positive. Anthony Paolone : Okay. And if I could just ask one last one. Just can you remind us just in the discussion around perhaps scientists working from home as well, just what's the split between lab and I guess, like workstation, office type space in your buildings today? And do you think that changes over time? Jenna Foger : Tony, it's Jenna Foger over here. So, I guess a comment on that. So again, as I mentioned in my earlier comments, in our lab space assets, of course, the lab training on technical space cannot be decoupled. It -- historically, we've seen about a 50-50 split between the lab and the nontechnical space. In some cases, we're seeing it kind of go up a bit to 55% or 60% lab that's mostly attributable to platform companies kind of prosecuting multiple platforms and pipeline programs at once. But yes, I guess that's probably a high level thing. Joel Marcus : Yes. And remember, Tony, too, and as we've pointed out before, COVID certainly enabled and caused a lot of companies to repatriate certain overseas processes back into the kind of the home lab and also with the much more sophisticated new modalities, cell therapy, gene therapy, et cetera. The enhancements and the complication of work environments have been expanded as well. So those are two kind of big macro forces that have made a big difference, say, over the last three to five years. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Michael Griffin with Citi. Please go ahead. Nick Joseph : It's Nick Joseph here with Griff. Maybe just starting up a follow-up, I guess, on the lease termination with Toast. Just want to clarify, was the $16 million in guidance initially or is that new and incremental? Dean Shigenaga : So Nick, the way to think about the arrangement with Toast is that what was -- the total consideration was something in that $15 million range. The deferred rent number was written down to take that down. I don't have it right in front of me, but $5 million to $6 million or something in that range. The net number is earned out over time effectively replaces rent or cash flows that were in place prior to that arrangement with Toast. And so net-net, at least through 2024, there's very little upside. Like I mentioned, it's a couple million bucks in each year. So, it's not really changing net FFO in any big way. So, in response to your specific question, was the revenue that we're going to generate from the lease with Toast in guidance? It was because it was already a lease in our business. Remember this building was acquired with the lease in place back in 2021. What did change for 2023, a couple of million dollar pickup to FFO. Nick Joseph : Got it. And then just on the capital plan. Obviously, the pivot, I guess, from selling more JVs to wholly-owned asset sales, can you just expand on that? Is that more of a pricing decision? Was it more strategic in terms of improving the portfolio by maybe selling some that's noncore? But how do you think about that broadly? Joel Marcus : Yes. I'm going to have -- this is Joel. I'll have Peter kind of respond to that. But I think about -- the Company has -- was a garage startup back in '94. So over many years as it kind of grew, grew its regions, we've had a variety of assets. We did not start a mega-campus strategy. We didn't start even a campus strategy. We couldn't even afford to go into Cambridge in those days. So the nature of a set of our assets really very, very solid workhorse assets in solid locations with solid tenants and with solid cash flows. Now as we move to this or as we've been moving over the last couple of years to this mega-campus strategy in core really high barrier to entry markets has enabled us to let go of those noncore assets. So that's kind of the fundamental frame. But Peter? Peter Moglia : Yes. Nick, it was very tempting to bring somebody in to complete the funding of that JV development just like we did at Necco. But at the end of the day, it is part of a mega campus. It is one of the best assets in likely in the world as far as long duration of value. And then reexamining our portfolio and seeing that we still had a number of assets that we could substitute and do just as well as far as getting the proceeds needed to fund our pipeline and just made it, much better story for us to keep 100% of that other development asset, sell the non-cores and really continue to improve our overall asset base towards concentrating it into mega campuses and lessening the one-off assets. Michael Griffin : This is Michael Griffin on here with Nick. Just one question around VC funding, I saw there was a report recently that showed some incremental positivity in VC funding in Boston. Is Joel's expectation for this to translate to your other markets? And kind of where do you need to see VC capital pick up in order to see incremental demand? Joel Marcus : Well, I think I'll have Jenna kind of give you her take on venture capital. But remember, we've returned to kind of the high run rates pre-COVID. So it still is healthy. What you've seen is a slower allocation and greater reserves just given the macro market. But Jenna, maybe some numbers. Jenna Foger : Yes, that's absolutely true. So as I mentioned in my comments, we've seen in 1H '23 so far about $17.7 billion. So this is right on -- in line, if not slightly above 2018, 2019 levels, and this is really across our market, obviously, with Greater Boston being kind of the center of life science activity. So kind of leading the chart, but we are kind of seeing this across our ecosystem. And again, as Joel mentioned, I mean, there's been a disciplined allocation of capital as we see a potential opening maybe a little bit towards the end of the year but into next year in the IPO window and then kind of a rationalization of follow-on financings on the public side. We're seeing also that kind of trickle down to a venture in terms of the pace increasing, but certainly no dearth of investment opportunities to be had. And like I mentioned in my comments, with '21, '22 and even kind of early '23 life science center fundraising, really being at all-time highs, there continues to be dry powder to deploy. Joel Marcus : Yes. And remember the comment that I made, Series A, $60 million this year, all-time high, that's pretty astounding when you think about it. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Michael Carroll of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Michael Carroll : I wanted to jump on, I guess, Peter, in your prepared remarks, you did mention that the biotech flywheel is starting to turn again. Can you provide some additional color on that? Did the flywheel slow down in the past year or so and now it's improving? Or were you mentioning that like tenants were just delaying decisions and now are just being more active? I mean, what -- can you provide some color around that comment? Joel Marcus : Yes. So Mike, I'll ask Peter to answer that in fact. But just keep in mind, the central thesis is the industry has been on a bull market tariff since maybe 2013, 2014 through early 2021. It was the longest biotech bull market that I've seen in -- since the days of Amgen and Genentech and Biogen when they were started late '70s, early '80s. So that says something. And then remember, the rocket ship years with the huge amount of funding and just activity of '21 and -- 2021 and into '22, and remember kind of the first quarter of '21, you saw the biotech index start to move. Now remember, biotech is a sub-segment of all of the life science, but it started to move as a leading indicator of the macro. But Peter? Peter Moglia : Yes. So Michael, last quarter, in my prepared remarks, I had mentioned that we had seen a weakening in demand. And one of the positives that I pointed out in this quarter's comments is that we actually have had, I would call, a significant uptick, 15% to 20% in demand in our top three markets. That, coupled with some knowing financings that are happening, as companies have been getting good news, to me, it just feels like the wheel starting to turn again momentum is building, and I'm confident it's going to continue. Joel Marcus : Yes. And I would say as a footnote, I know personally that there are a number of companies preparing for an IPO in 2024 and that just has not been possible over the last, say, except for extraordinarily rare exceptions on the public markets for the sector. That's a really good sign. I think people are looking at the Fed action maybe today or tomorrow. I forgot what day that is where they think it's kind of going to peak and obviously, the strength of activity, M&A and partnering has all had significant upticks. So that means pretty darn good activity. And I think Peter said or Jenna said, there's always clinical failures in all -- across all modalities and therapeutic classifications. But there's been some awfully good news these days in the diabetes and obesity area and the neurodegenerative area, ALS, which is one of our former directors had a young daughter who died of that disease. We're seeing some remarkable advancements here. Michael Carroll : Okay. Great. And then like what is driving, I guess, that uptick in tenant activity, I guess, today? Is it just people are more comfortable with the overall market and are willing to make decisions? Are they more comfortable and are actually trying to execute and get financing, allowing them to kind of expand their research process? I guess what is driving that right now? And do you think that will cause incremental demand growth over the next few quarters? I mean can we read that into your comments? Peter Moglia : Yes. I mean what's happening is -- and I touched on the theme of my comments, I think that uncertainty has really held back the entire economy. It has held back the life science industry, and that uncertainty is starting to go away and people are starting to realize that there's a lot of dry powder they need to put to work. So that -- we think that the investing of things that were not investing before, new company formation is going to occur, the science continues to move forward. When clinical milestones are met, we're seeing companies be able to raise a lot of money. And on top of that, we're seeing big pharma and biotech position themselves in our markets to grow. So that is what is giving us the positive outlook. Michael Carroll : Okay. Great. And then last question for me. On the supply front, have you seen a slowdown of some of those non-dedicated life science developers stop-breaking around the new projects? Has that occurred over the past quarter or so? Peter Moglia : With a couple of exceptions that are inexplicable, yes. We're not seeing much of anything new breaking ground, but there are some folks that have decided to move forward, which will be in the numbers for next quarter's update on '25. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Vikram Malhotra : I just want to go back and get some more color. You talked about the 15% to 20% increase in the top markets. But in your comments, you also mentioned specifically 100,000 square foot deals, I guess, are back in the market and smaller ones picking up. Can you just give us more color? Are these new requirements for expansion in those top three markets? And then if you look into the second half as we think about the sustainability of the 1.3 million leasing, can you just give us color on the pipeline in terms of maybe qualitative and quantitative comments around kind of how the pipeline of deals are developing in the second half?? Joel Marcus : Well, yes, this is Joel. Vikram, let me say maybe this regarding your first question. I think we probably don't want to say given just the proprietary nature of what we do and how we do it, talk too much about requirements. Some are sole-sourced RFPs. Some are broader RFPs. Some are existing tenants that come from our own tenant base that aren't in the markets. I don't think we want to make any comments, particularly about that. I think when it comes to leasing, we can only give you the best judgment we have based on Dean's affirmation of guidance both on -- when it comes to the issue of rental rates, occupancy, et cetera. We haven't given our view of 2024 yet. We will do that toward year-end. But I think it's fair to say that, remember, we've got a long history, and Peter cited some of the numbers of quarterly leasing. The vast majority of that comes from our own tenants. And so we have -- I think we have our finger on the pulse and ear to the ground in a way that very few people or groups could have. And I think that gives us the confidence that we can achieve our business plan for this year that by the way we articulated last November, and we'll do the same. I think beyond that, I'm not sure we can or want to give any further color. Vikram Malhotra : Okay. I was just talking about like the second half of '23 in terms of the pipeline to hit the second half run rate of 1 million or whatever, 1.2 million feet in leasing. But I'm happy to clarify that off-line. I guess just, Dean, on the quarter, you mentioned there was a very modest pickup from Toast, but you did beat Street estimates. And I'm wondering if you can just clarify, a, from your vantage point, the source of that beat and then why that beat did not translate into an uptick in the guide? Is there something offsetting in the second half that kind of reduces the magnitude of the beat in 2Q? Dean Shigenaga : Not as it relates to NOI, Vikram. I think that was just a timing difference. I can't speak to the various sell-side models on what drove the timing differences. But from our view of the world, our deliveries were, by and large, on track with our expectations. So that doesn't translate to upside there. And there were -- that wasn't the only line item that there was a variance on. If you look across consensus, there were some other line items. I think the G&A is an example. We are lower on G&A than consensus across coverage. But the key driver was that the NOI line item. Vikram Malhotra : Okay. That's helpful. And then just last one. Specifically, I think one of your top tenants, maybe I'm pronouncing them wrong, Illumina, they called out reduction of real estate as a part of their cost reduction plan overall into the next year or so, call out, one or two specific projects on their call. And I'm wondering you have any update in terms of your exposure with them? Joel Marcus : Yes. So I'll make a comment. Remember, Illumina still is a pioneer and a leader in their category. They did have an activist attack from icon regarding some management strategies kind of weirdly enough a lot to do about GRAIL, the EU and the FTC took issue with or Illumina acquiring GRAIL. Well, the weird thing is GRAIL was started and spun out of Illumina, and it made no sense, but yet here's an ideological kind of a thing going on. Illumina is as strong as ever. They have a -- they've got a lot of their market that they can still left to penetrate, but I'll ask Dan Ryan, who run San Diego and who's been very involved in Illumina that maybe give you a kind of a broad view of what's going on in their campus. Dan Ryan : Yes. So the -- what you saw in the headlines is they are currently subleasing. They leased about 300,000 square feet in -- not on our campus, but in the UTC area for pure office space. They have put that on the sublease market. They continue to advance with us discussions about adding a building or two to the campus, which would be more of their laboratory life science and manufacturing space, they look that they're kind of in desperate need to continue to innovate. So that's really what we're seeing from them. And then they -- I think they've had bits and pieces of real estate up in the Bay Area that they no longer deem as critical. So, we expect a pullback to San Diego, and I do expect to engage with them later in the year on additional laboratory office space on campus. Joel Marcus : Yes. The two sites that they announced, they were retrenching from were not owned by and operated by us. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Please go ahead. Tom Catherwood : Just one for me. Peter, I appreciate all your commentary about continuing to focus on mega campuses and allocate capital there. In the past, you've talked about how these campuses garner rental rate premiums. Do you have a sense of kind of the level of premium you're getting compared to market? And then maybe a little bit more broadly, do you have a sense of how your 19% mark-to-market is split between your mega campuses and the noncore assets that you're bringing to market? Peter Moglia : Yes. As far as the premium goes, Tom, our study indicates that it's about 20% more in net effective rent that you're going to get versus a one-off project. Companies are going to pay for the amenities and pay for the scalability and the desirability of the asset. What else did I not cover on your question there? Tom Catherwood : Just trying to see if you have a breakdown with what you're selling as you're looking at that 19% mark-to-market that Dean had referenced is what you're selling 5%, 0% and what you're holding in the mega campuses is, is that 25%, 30% when it comes to mark-to-market? Or is it more consistent kind of across your portfolio? Peter Moglia : Yes, I don't have the breakdown of each and every asset we're selling and what the mark-to-market is. But by and large, the best mark-to-market opportunities are in the mega campuses, and we are holding onto those assets. So what we are selling would be the one-offs that would not garner those types of premiums. Joel Marcus : Yes. And I think we've historically said on a number of the asset sales we've had to date, a typical mark-to-market has been 15% to high 20%, somewhere in that range, which is pretty good. Operator : And our next question today comes from Dylan Burzinski with Green Street. Please go ahead. Dylan Burzinski : And appreciate the comments on sort of net effective rent for the operating portfolio. But just curious, we're hearing that concessions are higher today for new leases, particularly on the development side. So you guys expect that you might start to feel pressure in terms of net effective rents impacting development yields moving forward? Peter Moglia : Yes, you are correct. On the development side, new leases, tenants are conserving cash. They are looking to the landlord to provide more tenant improvement. So that is creeping into the ether there. We will be, in some instances, able to push the rents to make up for that -- some of that or all of that. The good news is on the operating side because the spaces are built out because they're built out generically. We have very few concessions and TIs. We need to put out in order to lease or renew that space. Joel Marcus : Yes. I would also say if you look at the bigger the credit and the bigger the Company, the landlord contribution to build out is not as essential. And in fact, the -- one of the big pharma buildouts that we're working on in one of the top markets, the contribution by the pharma is about $750 a foot. So, oftentimes, the configuration or triangulation or architecture of a deal oftentimes is based, to some extent, on credit and need to put in unusual situations, unusual features that only that tenant would want and that's -- that would be on the tenant's bill not something we would do. So that's something else you have to keep in mind. Dylan Burzinski : That's helpful. And I just one more, going back to sort of occupancy and realizing that you guys are still targeting, call it, low 95% in terms of occupancy at year-end. Just as we think about the trajectory over the intermediate term, I mean, do you guys think that you can continue to grow on this front? Or should we sort of view this as you guys approaching structural vacancy? Joel Marcus : No, I don't think so. I think look historically at how we've grown, I'll ask Dean to comment, but then also think about over time, we have an asset base where we can almost double the size of the Company. So, I don't think we've reached any plateau in any way, shape or form. Dean Shigenaga : Yes, it's Dean here, Dylan. I agree. You've seen occupancy in our asset base the way we manage our business have really strong relationships with our tenants and really deliver a level of excellence in operating our buildings. Our occupancy can grow to 300 basis points from or more than that above our bogey -- 200 or 300 above our midpoint bogey for the end of '23. So at 95.1% is the midpoint you referenced. I mean we've been in the 98% occupancy range. So there's plenty of room to grow there. And as Joel had also mentioned and as you guys are well aware, our pipeline is set to bring on a tremendous amount of NOI and that gives you visibility all the way into '25 and a little bit going up to '26 now. Joel Marcus : Yes, remember, a number of our acquisitions that happened over the last couple of years in Greater Boston involved and one was mentioned the whole Fenway area, existing vacancy that as part of, say, a conversion to first-time lab space and those give, I think, great opportunities for occupancy gains. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks. Joel Marcus : Just want to say thank you, everybody, wishing you a great summer and look forward to our third quarter call. Operator : Thank you, sir. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz with Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Paula Schwartz : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The Company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the Company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel. Joel Marcus : Thank you, Paula, and welcome, everybody, to our third quarter conference call and the order of speaking today will be, I\u2019ll kick off, Hallie will follow, Peter will follow Hallie and then Marc will do clean up as most of you know, Dean Shigenaga stepped down as Chief Financial Officer on September 15th. He'll remain full-time employee and will be on our Q&A call. But Marc is going to, and Dean is mostly responsible for the quarter. But Marc will handle today's call on the presentation.  I want to start off with two quotes. First by one of the most legendary, by two legendary investors. First one is Warren Buffett who has said and many know, this quote, be fearful when others are greedy and opportunistic when others are fearful and so we are. And a quote from one of the most legendary institutional investors on Alexandria. Alexandria is a life science industry leader solely publicly traded pure-play REIT at its current discounted valuation we believe concerns about competitive supply and distress for some of the company\u2019s life science tenants were overblown and sufficiently discounted in the company\u2019s valuation. We believe the management team has assembled a desirable real estate portfolio, enjoys a leading market share position in its geographic markets and has solid expectations for long-term demand-driven growth.  So I want to thank each and every member of the Alexandria family team for a strong and operationally outstanding third quarter for this one of a kind read, especially in a very challenging, and continuing disruptive macro environment. Our size, scale and the dominance we've chosen to undertake in our key submarkets coupled with our irreplaceable brand of importance to our over 1800 tenants represents a distinctive impact few other REITs will ever enjoy.  We continue to dominate those of our key submarkets where we have created a leading position and continue to maintain pricing power for a highly desirable mega campuses which enable life science entities to meet their mission-critical needs and also a path for future growth. Couple of thoughts on the third quarter. We continue to maintain a fortress balance sheet, one of the best in the entire REIT industry. We continue our consistent strong and increasing dividend with a focus on retaining significant cash flows after dividend payment for reinvestment. We're well on track for a 7% FFO per share growth for 2023, fueled by our onboarding of substantial net operating income, the first half approximately $81 million, the third quarter approximately $39 million and the fourth quarter, approximately $114 million.  A few comments on FDA drug approvals, which is the holy grail of the life science industry and Hallie will have more to say. During the period, which was the bull biotech market 2015 to 2021, almost three quarters of approvals were biotech and 25% were pharma. So biotech continues to be the mainstay of innovation.  This year as Hallie will detail, 45 approvals to-date and it could surpass the all-time high of 59 in 2018. Hallie will address the health of the life science industry and the demand generators. But third quarter leasing of approximately 870,000 rentable square feet was very solid and especially with a weighted average lease term of an amazing 13 years and very strong, leasing spreads, almost 20% on the cash basis and almost 29% on a GAAP basis while leasing costs were decreasing. Life science tenant health is one of the most frequently asked questions and again Hallie will address that in depth. We are in a de facto recession and in the self-inflicted inflationary and high interest rate environment. So that is driving caution, but the life science industry is unequivocally healthy thriving, and the key to improved healthcare outcomes which are desperately needed for all of us.  Internal growth remains steady and solid with same-store cash NOI growth for the year at a strong 5.6%, occupancy on course for about 95% plus as of yearend and Mark will have much more to say on internal growth. Peter will detail external growth and our strong efforts of onboarding the substantial net operating income as I just referred to, and he will also update as he does each quarter supply dynamics. Peter will also give a brief update on the status of our self-funding for the balance of 2023 and the year as a whole.  Let me say in summary, we know this is a tough show me market filled with many skeptics. Many of those skeptics doubting the health of life science industry despite clear facts to the contrary over blowing the impact of the elevated levels of new construction, no matter the quality location and/or sponsor or operations and we know of numerous operating debacles causing substantial damage to tenants by so-called other operators to their science doubting the ability of Alexandria, the self-funded business, despite clear facts to the contrary.  Each and every reporting quarter, we intend to continue our world-class operational excellence with exceptionalism in all we do and we intend to capture virtually all of the future demand of our over 800 tenants and virtually all of the future demand of non-tenants who meet our underwriting requirements. And we intend to execute a perfect thread the needle self-funding plan for the remainder of 2023, as well, as 2024 as our assets continue to remain scarce and still in demand. And then finally, before I turn it over to Hallie, I would say remembering that CREDO of the Navy Navy SEALs, the only easy day is yesterday. So Hallie take it away. Hallie Kuhn : Thank you, Joel and good afternoon, everyone. This is Hallie Kuhn, SVP of Science and Technology and Capital Markets. Alexandria is at the Vanguard and Heart of the $5 trillion secularly growing life science industry, which translates into numerous demand drivers for Alexandria's mission-critical lab space and we are the go-to partner for the life science industry. Today I am going to review these demand drivers and exciting new areas of life science, research and development all of which translates into a healthy and expanding tenant base and increasing long-term revenue.  So first, what do we mean when we say the life science industry is secularly growing? First, massive unmet medical need with over 90% of known diseases having no available treatments drives the life science industry providing a tremendous opportunity for innovation, new company formation and life science industry growth. This opportunity set does not change at the whims of the market. It is non-cyclical and non-discretionary.  Second, tenant growth and demand are event and milestone-driven. Important milestones include new biological discoveries, successful advancement of experimental therapies into the clinic and ultimately the demonstration of safety and efficacy of new medicines. Expansion of new therapeutic modalities such as cell, gene and RNA medicines; better diagnostic tools to accurately identify and diagnose patients, and increasingly efficient and predictive clinical trial designs have the potential to increase the number of new medicines over the coming years.  Third, multifaceted and differentiated funding sources ensure that life science companies founded on impactful and differentiated technologies with experienced management teams continue to thrive Altogether, we estimate over $400 billion will be deployed to support life science companies in 2023 across venture funding, biopharma R&D, philanthropy, government, grants and public equity financings.  Notably, 2023 has already exceeded the previous 10 year average of $360 billion and the total market capitalization of public life science companies currently exceeds five trillion. Together, the massive unmet medical need, event-driven growth, and robust and diverse funding sources result in secular growth of the life science industry that drive additional demand for Alexandria lab space, even amid an economic downturn. The output of this significant investment is longer, healthier lives. As Joel commented, 43 new therapies have been approved this year by the FDA, and six novel gene, cell and RNA-based therapies have been approved. These numbers are on track to meet or exceed the all-time high for annual FDA approvals. That was in 2018 when 59 novel therapies were approved by the FDA.  This is extremely positive above all for the patients that need these medicines. An example of important new therapies on track for approval include the class of GLP1 medicines for obesity, a disease, which accounts for direct costs of over a $170 billion in healthcare spending in the US per year and afflicts, one, and three children and one in five adults.  A decade ago, obesity was considered a minefield for drug development and the industry sentiment was that medicine could not address such a complex disease. Fast forward, and pharma has unlocked an entirely new class of anti-obesity medicines and analyst estimate upwards of 10% of the US population will have been treated with a GLP1 by 2030 with an estimated market size of $40 billion to $50 billion.  Another exciting area is artificial intelligence and machine learning tools. As highlighted in our recent press release, AI is not new to the life science industry. In 2021, there were over a hundred drug and biologic submissions to the FDA developed using AI components. Nor do AI tools negate the need for lab space. In many cases, AI focused life science companies require significant lab footprints to generate the immense biological and chemical datasets needed to effectively train AI ML models.  To this end, the acceleration of AI may in fact, increase the need for laboratory footprints. And we already see this manifesting as an exciting emerging segment of demand. Now, moving to the health of our diverse life science tenant base. While some analysts and investors have a misconception that small and mid-cap biotech are a proxy for the entire life science industry, and its growth, the reality is broader, and far more complex. Starting with multinational pharma, which account for 18% of our ARR, companies are leveraging healthy balance sheets to double down on R&D and in licensing, acquire innovative products. Biopharma alone invested $278 billion in R&D in 2022, representing a 66% increase, compared to 10 years prior.  Biopharma also has an estimated $500 million in M&A firepower to continue to bring external innovation into their portfolios. To that end, M&A has regained momentum with $112 billion in acquisitions in 2023 exceeding the 2021 and 2022 levels. Large pharma continues to heavily rely on innovation from smaller biotechs to backfill their pipelines.  For example, BMS\u2019 top five products in. 2022 were all derived from acquisitions. For J&J, Merck and Pfizer, four out of five of the company's top selling therapies were from licensing or M&A deals. So how does M&A impacts net absorption within our clusters? The specific impact of M&A events needs to be looked at on a case-by-case basis, but it\u2019s broadly positive.  Platform companies acquired not just for their clinical assets, but for their R&D platform and scientific talent, lend tend to land and expand so to speak. A great example is in San Diego where the significant presence of large pharma tenants including BMS, Eli Lily, Takeda, and Vertex were all driven by acquisitions of smaller biotech companies.  We are also in the process of supporting the significant expansion of a pharma acquired company in Greater Boston more to come on this at Investor Day. Companies acquired for specific assets may not lead to additional expansion, but we do benefit from an upgrading credit in all cases as the acquirer will be responsible for each in place lease. M&A also leads to capital being returned to investors and can drive formation of new companies within our ecosystems as experienced scientists and entrepreneurs start their next new endeavors, which also creates additional demand for Alexandria lab space. Critically, for pharma to remain competitive and ensure a steady stream of successful, innovative medicines over the next decade, they need to attract the best talent and have the infrastructure and operational supports to accelerate and safeguard their mission-critical science.  This need is driving several significant requirements in key R&D clusters and Alexandria is the go-to brand.  Transitioning to public biotechnology companies, 14% ARR is represented by companies with marketed products and 10% ARR by preclinical and clinical companies. For our commercial stage biotech tenants, they notched a $108 billion in revenue through the third quarter of 2023, including the likes of Gilead, Vertex and Amgen. For our pre-commercial companies, the public market for small and mid cap biotechs certainly remains challenging. However, companies that meet expected milestones have executed significant follow-on financings and stock prices have responded positively. Through 3Q $14 billion has been raised in follow on offerings, which is on track to beat total 2022 follow-ons of $14.5 billion.  This includes tenant vaccite which earlier this year netted $545 million in total proceeds to fund their potentially best-in-class, pneumonia vaccine and others including Editas and Etera. There are also some green shoots in the IPO market for companies with the right pedigree, namely deep clinical pipelines with line of sight to important inflection points. In September, San Diego tenant RayzeBio raised an oversubscribed $358 million IPO driven by near-term clinical trial data readouts, testing their first-in-class radio pharmaceutical therapies for rare forms of cancer. On to private biotech which makes up 9% ARR, while life science funding has largely reverted to pre-pandemic levels, it remains robust.  Annualized projections of life science venture funding for 2023 are trending towards an estimated $27 billion which exceeds 2019 levels of nearly $24 billion. Further while a frequent assumption is that many financings are being propped up by current insiders, the data highlights that this is just not true. In a detailed analysis by Oppenheimer of Series A and B financings year-to-date, nearly 80% of all financings were led or co-led by outside investors speaking to a healthy appetite from investors to fund new deals. Our new lease with Altos Labs on our One Alexandria Square Mega Campus in San Diego is one example of a stellar private company, having raised a historic $3 billion to deploy towards self reprogramming to treat diseases associated with aging.  Last, life science products, service and devices which represent 22% of our ARR continue to be the workhorse of the industry, providing the hardware and software so to speak that fueled experiments in the lab. There are challenges that exist post-COVID as some companies ramped up products and services, either directly or indirectly driven by COVID-19 and are now resetting strategic priorities.  But novel areas of science and successful products are emerging and generating new forms of demand such as the new obesity drugs, which will require significant CDMO capacity to manufacture and new forms of drug discovery such as proteonics highlighted by the recent acquisition of Olink for a $3.1 billion by Thermo Fisher.  Altogether, the results of the current market conditions is that companies are highly conscious of every dollar spent. They do not have the luxury of risking their science and unreliable lab space or in locations where they can't recruit the right talent.  We continue to see increasing demand for companies looking - by companies for looking for just in time availability of high quality lab space in amenitized campuses in the best locations with the infrastructure and operations that ensure their mission-critical work is supported 24/7 and that there is a path for future growth needs. And this is what Alexandria's one of a kind lab space within our world-class mega campuses is uniquely positioned to deliver.  To end, I want to share some insight from Dr. Robert Langer, an MIT professor Moderna co-founder and luminary in the field of drug development. When recently asked what scientific innovations, he is most excited about his answer was simple, but profound. The science and medicines that have not yet been discovered.  So, as we traverse challenging times, remember that the resilience of this industry is rooted in a truly vast opportunity for new discoveries that will improve the lives of everyone on this call today. The most impactful of which is yet to come.  With that, I will pass it to Peter. Peter Moglia : Thanks, Hallie. Before I launch into my commentary, I\u2019d like to acknowledge the great contributions we've received from Dean Shigenaga, Dean is one of the smartest and hardest working people I've come across in my 33 year career. He's played a huge part in the building of Alexandria and to what it is today, and wanting to thank him very much for everything he's done for this company. Thanks Dean.  On our fourth quarter 2022 call, I spoke about our optimism for the future of the life science industry referencing that we are in the early innings of the golden age of biology. And I pointed out that we've only had the blueprint of the human genome for 20 years. And in that time, we've developed more new modalities to attack disease than in the previous 100.  On Friday, October 13th, buried on the third page of Section A in the Wall Street Journal, another scientific revelation was reported. One that scientists liked into the human genome project and that could yield similar results in neuroscience. And the international team of scientists unveiled the most comprehensive map of the human brain ever completed. A map that the article stated will set a critical foundation for the understanding and eventually treating brain-related diseases, such as Alzheimer's, epilepsy, schizophrenia, autism and depression. As I watched my own mother declined daily due to Alzheimer's and experienced the enormous emotional, monetary and time burden and inflicts on our family, I have a full appreciation of what this map being do for mankind.  It's yet another example of how important the life science industry is to improving our lives and how it's only going to grow and influence. And that ladies and gentlemen, is why this $5 trillion secular growth industry is poised to drive our business for decades to come.  I'm going to discuss our development pipeline, leasing supply and asset sales, and then hand it over to our very capable new CFO, Marc Binda. In the third quarter, we delivered 450,134 square feet and seven projects into our high barrier to entry submarkets, bringing total deliveries year-to-date to one million, two hundred ninety thousand seven hundred and twenty one square feet covering 10 projects.  Annual NOI for this quarter\u2019s deliveries totals $39 million bringing the year-to-date total incremental additions to NOI to $120 million. The initial weighted average stabilized yield is 6.5%. Six of the 10 projects delivering spaces here have initial stabilized yields ranging from 7% to 9.5%. Two are at 6.3% and two are in the mid fives. One of those developments in the mid fives is located in Cambridge and is 99% leased and the other is in our Shady Grove mega campus and successfully leased 23% of its space in the third quarter.  The Cambridge asset is in a prime location and its yield reflects the cost to acquire it, which was justified, because we had commitments to fill 100% of it before closing making it a build-to-suit core investment that expanded our ACKS mega campus. The Maryland asset\u2019s yield has been driven down by complex site conditions, but it has been very well received by the market and we are bullish on its long-term performance as part of our Shady Grove mega campus.  Development and redevelopment, leasing activity at approximately 205,000 square feet was higher quarter-over-quarter for the second quarter in a row, which we are pleased to see in an environment where tight financing markets have focused tenant demand on turnkey space.  In addition to the increase in development, redevelopment, leasing during the quarter, we signed LOI's covering nearly 230,000 square feet of space in our pipeline, including one for 185,000 square feet, with a high quality tenant - high quality credit tenant that may materially expand into the mega campus as they refine their programming indicating a continuation of positive momentum. During the quarter, we executed a lease termination with a tenant at our 10935 and 10945 Alexandria Way mega campus development in Torrey Pines, and leased approximately 89% of the space to a stronger credit tenant. This is a win for Alexandria as we were able to substitute a higher credit tenant into the new development, increase the term for that space by three years and receive higher rents.  We did increased the TI allowance for the new tenant, but the incremental rent we are receiving yields at 14% return over that incremental TI allowance, all in all a great outcome. At quarter end, our pipeline of current and near-term projects is 63% leased and 66% leased in negotiating which includes executed LOIs and is expected to generate $580 million of annual incremental NOI through the end or through the third quarter of 2026.  The decline from 70% lease last quarter despite leasing approximately 205,000 square feet was mainly due to the, to the delivery of fully leased projects at 141st Street and 751 Gateway and the addition of 10075 Barnes Canyon Road in Sorrento Mesa, which has 17% of its future space underwhelm LOI and significant additional activity underway. Transitioning to leasing and supply, Alexandria's pioneering establishment of highly curated mega campuses featuring Class A, A plus facilities at main and main and the world's most desirable high buried entry life science clusters provides an enduring foundation for our existing asset base to perform in even the most challenging times.  We are executing and winning nearly every high quality leasing opportunity when we have available product, a testament to the daily operational excellence demanded and required by our mission-critical tenants. We leased 867,582 square feet and the third quarter of \u201823 with Maryland significantly supporting the leasing activity led by San Diego and Greater Boston.  Leasing activity has come from a broad base of our regions, both this quarter and year-to-date in which we have leased a total of 3.41 million square feet with Seattle San Francisco, San Diego, Greater Boston, and Maryland all materially contributing to our overall leasing activity. These quarterly and year-to-date leasing volumes are consistent with our pre-COVID levels. As you can see in the company highlights section of the Q3 supplemental on pages little Roman numeral, 19 and 20. Although below our historic average of a million square feet, this leasing volume is strong considering the amount of expiring leases available for lease for the rest of the year is relatively low at approximately 623,000 square feet.  Very strong cash rent increases of 19.7% and GAAP rent increases of 28.8% during the third quarter, provide clear evidence of the long-term enduring value of Alexandria\u2019s brand and platform and are consistent with our year-to-date stats of 18.1% and 33.9% for cash and GAAP increases respectively.  We'd like to call your attention to the year-to-date weighted average lease term of 11 years, which you can find on page little Roman numeral 22 of the supplemental that significantly exceeds our weighted average lease earned since 2014 of 8.7 years. In our first quarter earnings call, we noted that demand has slowed from the rocket shift COVID period of 2020 and 2021. And last quarter, we reported that we were seeing demand increase especially in our Greater Boston, San Francisco and San Diego markets. We see demand holding steady today and believe it will trend upward, but are fully aware that the volatile geopolitical environment we are in can create the uncertainty that sometimes slows decision making.  As we've discussed in a number of investor meetings since our last earnings call, the demand profile is best described as a barbell. We're seeing most of the requirements in the 5,000 to 30,000 square foot range coming from either emerging stage companies that have achieved milestones and need growth space or large requirements of a hundred thousand square feet or more from large pharma and biotech looking to grow or establish a footprint in our clusters, driven by specific new modalities prevalent in those clusters coupled with the talent available on those locations.  Alexandria is well positioned to capture this demand because many of these opportunities are coming from existing relationships, which typically account for a significant amount of our leasing. Over the past year 80% of our leasing has been generated from existing tenants. In addition, our mega campus offerings provide the ability to scale in a wide variety of amenities making them the clear choice for high quality companies. I am sure you are all interested to hear analysis of supply, so I\u2019ll conclude this section with an update on these statistics, which will include our projected competitive supply additions delivering in 2025.  As a reminder, we perform a robust building-by-building analysis to identify and track new supply from high quality projects we believe are competitive to ours in our high barrier to entry submarkets. We focus primarily on high barrier to entry markets and our brand mega campus offerings in triple A locations and operational excellence enables us to continually mine our vast deep and loyal tenant base to drive our leasing activity, which will likely lessen the impacts of generic supply. The slides we provided on pages Roman numeral 8 through Roman numeral 13 of the supplemental illustrate this and are hopefully helpful.  In Greater Boston, unleased competitive supply remaining to be delivered in 2023 is estimated to be 1.1% of market inventory, a 0.5%, decrease over last quarter. In 2024, the unleased competitive supply will increase market inventory by 6.1%, a 1.1% increase driven by the addition of a new competitive project. In 2025, the unleased competitive supply will increase market inventory by 3.7% an expected slowdown from 2024 levels.  In San Francisco Bay, unleased competitive supply remaining to be delivered in the second quarter of \u201823 is estimated to be 5% of market inventory, which is a reduction of 1.6% over last quarter due mainly from deliveries. In 2024, the unleased competitive supply will increase market inventory by 8%, a 0.8% reduction unfortunately not driven by leasing, but due to a downward revision of estimated square footage to be delivered during the year.  In 2025, the unleased competitive supply will increase market inventory by only 1.2%, which is a good indication that developers in this market are beginning to act rationally. In San Diego, unleased competitive supply remaining to be delivered in the third quarter of \u201823 is estimated to be 1.9% of market inventory, which is a decrease of 1.6% due mainly to projects being delayed into 2024 or delivered with unleased space now reflected in direct vacancy and one project developer deciding not to pursue a laboratory use.  In 2024, the unleased competitive supply will increase market inventory by 6.9%, a 1.9% increase driven primarily by the aforementioned projects delivering in 2024 instead of 2023. In 2025, the unleased competitive supply will increase market inventory by 3.3%, driven primarily by our 75% pre-leased 10935, 10945 and 10955, Alexandria Way project. Direct and sublease market vacancy for our core submarkets is updated as follows : Greater Boston, direct vacancy increased 1.7% to 4.5% and subleased vacancy increased slightly to 5.6% for a net increase in available space in operation quarter-over-quarter of 1.9%.  San Francisco, direct vacancy increased by 7.4% to 9.7% driven mainly by the inclusion of the Mission Rock projects into laboratory inventory when it was previously thought to be leasing as an office project. Move outs and delivery of new inventory are also drivers. Sub lease vacancy remains stable at 6.2% for a net increase in available space in operation of 7.4%.  San Diego direct vacancy increased from 4.8% to 6.8%, largely due to delivered unleased new supply and move outs. And sublease vacancy remains stable at 4.1% for a net increase in available space in operation of 2% quarter-over-quarter.  I'll conclude with an update on our value harvesting asset recycling program. We continue to be fortunate that there is a considerable demand for Alexandria's assets and life science assets broadly. As you can see on page 7 of the supplemental, we are approximately 95% through completing dispositions needed to hit the midpoint of our guidance, when totaling completed sales and those under LOI or executed purchased and sale agreements not yet closed.  Our overall strategy for the full year of 2023 has been to execute on a combination of partial interest sales and sales in whole of non-core workhorse assets. These sales will provide the capital needed to recycle our high quality development redevelopment mega campus pipeline which will widen our moat by expanding our highly differentiated mega campuses offering unmatched scale and amenities highly sought after by the full spectrum of tenants we serve. And the identified supply I just mentioned can't compete with.  We only closed on one asset this quarter we can report on, but to give some color on dispositions that are pending, they are all non-core, solid workhorse assets. Obviously, it's a challenging interest rate environment and economic volatility has reduced overall transactional activity, but demand for our assets has remains resilient. As mentioned, we are on track to meet our goals. In September, we closed on the previously announced sale of a vertical ownership unit comprising approximately 268,000 rental square feet or approximately 44% of Alexandria's 660,000, 34 square foot 421, part drive purpose built ground ups life science development in the Fenway submarket of Greater Boston to Boston Children's Hospital.  The units sold will house Boston, Children's Hospital future medical research facilities. The sale serves the dual purpose of providing substantial funding for the significant development project and brings in a key bedrock anchor to the project and our Fenway campus in whole. Austin Children's is a long-term strategic partner of Alexandria who invests heavily in basic clinical and translational research to accelerate the discovery of new treatments for devastating diseases to improve the health of both children and adults.  They ranked number one in NIH funding among all US children's hospitals in fiscal year 2023. Their presence will help attract tenant companies looking to collaborate with world-class research institutions much like our campuses in Cambridge benefit from those looking to collaborate with MIT. Alexandria will receive development fees as well as the significant capital to the fund the project.  With that long update, I'm going to go ahead and pass it over to Marc. Marc Binda : Thank you, Peter. Hello and good afternoon. This is Marc Binda, CFO and I'm going to cover some of the key financial metrics for the quarter. We reported very solid operating and financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended 3Q \u201923, which was driven by strong core results and reflects the strength of our brand, scale, high quality and well-located campuses and operational excellence.  Total revenues for 3Q were up 8.2% over the prior year. NOI was also up 8.2% over the prior quarter and the prior year driven primarily by the commencement of a $120 million of annual NOI related to 1.3 million rentable square feet of development, redevelopment projects, placed into service year-to-date through 3Q \u201823 coupled with strong same-property performance.  FFO per shared diluted as adjusted was $2.26, up 6.1% over 3Q \u201822 and we are on track to generate another solid year of growth in FFO per share of 6.7% at the midpoint of our guidance for 2023. Our tenants continue to appreciate our brand, the mega a campus strategy and operational excellence by our team. 49% of our ARR is from investment-grade and publicly traded large cap tenants and we have one of the highest quality client rosters in the REIT industry.  Collections remain very high at 99.9%, adjusted EBITDA margins remain very strong at 69%. The weighted average lease terms for leases completed in 2023 has far outpaced our historical averages at 11 years on average. And 96% of our leases contain annual rent escalations approximating 3%. Same-property NOI growth was solid and in line with guidance for 2023. 3Q \u201823 was up 3.1% and 4.6% on a cash basis and for the year-to-date period up 3.7% and 5.6% on a cash basis.  Our outlook for 2023 same-property NOI growth remained solid at a midpoint of 3% and 5% on a cash basis. We do expect our fourth quarter same-property results to be somewhat impacted by the timing of free rents and some temporary vacancy, including a hundred thousand square foot lease termination in the fourth quarter, by our tenant Atreka at our, San Carlos mega campus.  Important to note that we don't expect any income to be recognized on this space for same-property purposes in the fourth quarter, since termination fees are excluded from our same-property results. The good news is that we have a signed LOI with a new tenant to potentially take that space as early as December.  Turning to leasing, quarterly leasing volume was 867,000 square feet for the quarter and $3.4 million for the first nine months, which on an annualized basis is in line with our historical annual average from 2013 to 2020. Also after stripping out spaces already leased and projects going into redevelopment, the 2023 expirations at the beginning of the quarter were relatively low at only 623,000 square feet. 3Q \u201823 rental rate growth for lease renewals and re-leasing of space was very strong at 28.8% and 19.7% on a cash basis.  Rental rate growth in 3Q was driven by transactions in Seattle Maryland and Greater Boston, and these results were driven by a mix of transactions in markets which can vary from quarter to quarter. Our outlook for rental rate growth on leased renewals and re-leasing space remains solid at a midpoint of 30.5% and 14.5% on a cash basis.  The overall mark-to-market for cash run rates related to in place leases for the entire asset base remains very strong at up 18%.  Turning next to capital expenditures, they generally fall into two buckets. The first category being focused on development and redevelopment, which includes the first time conversion of non-lab space to lab space through redevelopment. The second category is non-revenue enhancing capital expenditures. Our non-revenue enhancing capital expenditures over the last 5 years have averaged 15% of NOI and that rate has been trending lower with 13% last year, and 12% for 2023.  Tenant improvement allowances and leasing commissions related to lease renewals and releasing of space, which is included in non-revenue enhancing expenditures were very low for the quarter at $19 per square foot.  Turning to occupancy, 3Q occupancy was in line with our expectation at 93.7%, up 10 basis points from the prior quarter. This included vacancy of 2.1% or approximately 870,000 square feet from properties acquired in 2021 and \u201822. 30% of that recently acquired vacancy is leased and will be ready for occupancy in the next number of quarters. Our outlook for 2023 reflects occupancy growth by the end of 4Q \u201923. The midpoint of our occupancy guidance is 95.1%, which implies 140, basis point increase by the end of the year. The bridge to our range for yearend occupancy breaks down as follows : About 50% is related to spaces already leased and expected to deliver by year end.  Another 20% relates to assets that were designated as held for sale in October that contains some vacancy. This leaves about 30% left to resolve, which includes the 100,000 square feet space at our San Carlos mega campus which I mentioned earlier, which is under negotiation. I'd also like to highlight that it's often difficult to reconcile leasing activity to changes in occupancy, given that leasing activity doesn't always result in immediate occupancy. The main driver of the expected ramp up in occupancy related to previously leased space delivering in 4Q 2023 I just mentioned is a perfect example.  Turning to the balance sheet, we have a very strong balance sheet with $5.9 billion of liquidity, no debt maturities until 2025, 99% of our debt is subject to fixed interest rates and we remain on track to achieve our net debt to adjusted EBITDA goal of 5.1 times on a quarterly annualized basis by 4Q \u201923. We continue to focus on our self-funding strategy through the execution dispositions and partial interest sales with no common equity expected for 2023 other than the $100 million of forward equity sales agreements from 2022, which are still outstanding. Our strategy for dispositions and sales of partial interest for 2023 reflects our focus on the enhancement of the overall asset base through it outright disposition to properties no longer integral to our mega campus strategy with fewer sales of partial interests. For the year, we expect about 90% of the proceeds from our program to be focused on outright dispositions. Our team has made excellent progress with $875 million completed and another $699 million under LOI or purchase and sale contract, which are expected to be closed in the fourth quarter, which is primarily comprised of outright dispositions.  Our targeted fourth quarter dispositions include land, non-core assets and some properties which require significant capital to lease and are expected to have a higher FFO cap rate, compared to the transactions we closed in the first half of the year. We have a low and conservative FFO payout ratio of 55% for 3Q \u201823 annualized with a 5.2% increase in common stock dividends over the last 12 months.  We're projecting $375 million in net cash flows from operating activities after dividends for reinvestment, for this year, which represents a three-year run rate of over $1.1 billion. Turning to venture gains, realized gains from venture investments included in FFO for 3Q \u201823 was $25 million, which is the same as our eight prior quarter average. Gross unrealized gains in our venture investments as of 3Q \u201823 were $311 million on a cost basis of just under $1.2 billion. On external growth, we have $580 million of the incremental annual NOI coming online from our pipeline of $6.4 million square feet.  In the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver two key projects at 325 Binney and 15 Necco, which will generate a whopping $114 million of incremental annual NOI. We expect to place these projects into service in mid to late November on average, which will drive significant NOI growth in the fourth quarter, as well as the first quarter of 2024. For 2024, we expect another $1.8 million square feet, which is 94% leased to stabilize around mid to late summer on average and generate another $127 million of incremental annual NOI. Additionally, we have another 3.8 million square feet that's expected to reach stabilization after 2024 and will generate another $339 million of incremental annual NOI.  With the expected significant deliveries at 325 Binney and 15 Necco in 4Q \u201823, we expect a slight decline in capitalized interest in 4Q 2023. Capitalized interest for 3Q, was up about $4 million over the prior quarter, which resulted from some shifts in timing on the delivery of our 140 First Street redevelopment project and the sale of a portion of our 421 Park project.  It's important to note that these changes were slightly dilutive to FFO per share results for the quarter, but were offset by strong core operations during the quarter. Turning to guidance, our detailed updated underlying guidance assumptions are disclosed beginning on Page 4 of our supplemental package. Our per share outlook for 2023 was updated to a range of plus or minus $0.01 from the midpoint of guidance. Our range of guidance for EPS is a $1.36 to $1.38 and our range for FFO per shared diluted as adjusted is 897 to 899 which represents a $0.02 increase in the midpoint of 898. This represents a very strong 6.7% growth in FFO per share following excellent growth last year of 8.5%. As a reminder, we're about a month away from the issuance of our detailed guidance for 2024 and therefore, we're unable to comment on details for \u201824. Lastly, just want to extend this special thank you to Dean Shigenaga for all his years of leadership and service to the company, as well as his tremendous mentorship.  Next I\u2019ll turn it over to Joel to open it up for questions. Joel Marcus : Yeah, let's go to Q&A. And sorry for the long presentation but important to get all the facts out there. Operator : All right. Thank you. [Operator Instructions]  Our first question today will come from Joshua Dennerlein of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Joshua Dennerlein : Hey guys, I appreciate all the color in the new slides on the supply dynamic across your submarkets. Just kind of curious how we should think about that supply that's coming online and the vacancy you mentioned and just how that will impact market rents and GI's across maybe as in particular, Cambridge in South San Francisco? Joel Marcus : Yeah. So, Peter thoughts comments? Peter Moglia : Yeah, certainly, it's going to be part of the negotiation with tenants. What we believe is that our mega campus platform and our reliability and brand will - gives confidence to tenants that they're going to be well taken care of. And so there is a premium to that that will help us overcome the competitive supply dynamic when it comes to that. Joel Marcus : Yeah, I would say also important to distinguish, we think in Cambridge the impact would be far less than South San Francisco. South San Francisco as you can see from the slide just adds too much stupid supply. The good news is a lot of that supply is in an area that people don't want to be in. Joshua Dennerlein : Then one more question from me on the occupancy front going from your 3Q 93.7 to just the occupancy guide range of I think 94.6 to 95.6 just, what are the kind of moving pieces in there? Is there anything you still have to accomplish? Or is that kind of all baked in at this point? Joel Marcus : Okay. I think Marc, just answered that question. But Marc, do you want to repeat that? Marc Binda : Yes, sure. Hi, it's Marc. Yeah, so about - going from that 140 basis point increase, about half of it was from leases that we leased either in the current quarter or prior quarters that\u2019s delivering next quarter. So a big chunk of it's in the bag. And then about another 20% was for some assets that were designated as held for sale after the end of the quarter, in October that we expect to sell.  And then that that leaves about 30% and then of that, a big chunk of it relates to that space in San Carlos. It was the former - space which we do have a signed LOI there and hope to execute on. Joshua Dennerlein : Okay. Thanks, sorry for missing that. Appreciate that. Joel Marcus : Yeah, no problem. Our pleasure. Operator : Our next question, we'll come from Georgi Dinkov of Mizuho. Please go ahead. Georgi Dinkov : Hi, this is Georgi on for Vikram. Can you square your views on not losing more occupancy than the GFC given you have seen several tenant pay issues and lease terminations in the past two quarters. And even though you have limited expirations, good credit issues, depressed occupancy? Joel Marcus : Well, I think number one, Marc just went through the details of occupancy and guidance in giving and he just answered the question from the analyst on what we're thinking about occupancy. And we said, for example, on a - we have a signed LOI and negotiating a lease for all that space. I'm not sure what else you referring to. Georgi Dinkov : Okay. And can you just give, I guess more color on 270 Bio? I believe they're backed by Bluebird, but how would it would work if their cash position deteriorates going forward? Joel Marcus : Well, at the moment they have over $300 million in cash. It gives them a runway out through 2026 as I recall. You have to remember both 270 Bio and Bluebird or both joint and severely liable on the lease. We expect that's a great location. It'll be subleased. And we don't see any challenge to yards successful collection or rent over the coming few years. Georgi Dinkov : Right. Thank you. Joel Marcus : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Griffin of Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Griffin : Great. Thanks. Maybe just a question on development starts. Kind of how you're thinking about that over the next couple years the funding needs for potential impact on capitalized interest will be helpful. Joel Marcus : Yeah, so I think as Marc said, let's wait for Investor Day to do that. Michael Griffin : All right. And then just on the pending asset sales I know Marc kind of talked about in a higher cap rates than expected. I was wondering if there's any numbers if you could maybe associate with that? And any color you can give around the buyer pool, their interest there would be helpful. Joel Marcus : Yeah we're under confidentiality. So we can't. So stay tuned for Investor Day or year-round and we will give you know as much detail as we're able to. Michael Griffin : All right. Operator : Our next question will come from Rich Anderson of Wedbush. Please go ahead. Rich Anderson : Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. So I was kind of doing some back reading and I looked at the second quarter of 2022 where it was the comment was beyond 2024 and beyond, we don't see large disruptive projects well underway in our core markets that are preparing to go vertical. Does that comment, I mean, I guess the question is, what change between that comment little bit more than a year ago and today because the market for developing only has gotten worse with that macro environment and all that? Or do you still - would you still agree that this is not disruptive relative to that comment that was made about a year and change ago? Joel Marcus : Yep. Peter do you want to maybe address that? Peter Moglia : Yeah. Rich, I mean, the comment, the intent of the comment was to express that 2024 was going to be a peak of supply deliveries and that the numbers that I just went through I think illustrated that. There will be some, some things that we thought would deliver in \u201824 that might get pushed into \u201825. But we're not seeing more than less and probably in total in all of our markets like a handful of things that have started in recent times meaning like the last few months.  It does appear and the numbers themselves in San Francisco I think were really telling it does appear that developers are finally understanding that the market has plenty of supply underway. And not - there's not more needed on a speculative basis. And so that's good news for the coming years. Rich Anderson : Okay. Fair enough. And then, real quick second question and then we're running along here. Joel, you said the word self-funding for this year and for 2024 and anticipating your response wait till Investor Day, but let me just ask anyway, is the disposition program kind of not infinite, but I mean, if you're always selling assets and funding something that's probably a better and newer asset to your development pipeline, is that something that can go on in perpetuity or is there a ceiling to which you have to sort of cut off the disposition program and reassess? Joel Marcus : Yeah. I think that's a really good question and that'll be a cornerstone of the Investor Day presentation. But I think it's fair to say Rich that the way to think about it is we continue to have, the company owns and operates 40 million square feet and has the capability to double our size and what we own beyond that. So there's a pretty deep pool for partial interest and sales of outright non-core assets, but we do have an approach to self-funding for next year in addition to that, which I think will be pretty, pretty exciting. So let us wait to announce that that at Investor Day. Rich Anderson : You got it. Thanks very much, everyone. Joel Marcus : Yep. Thank you guys. Operator : And our next question today will come from Tom Catherwood of BTIG. Please go ahead. Tom Catherwood : Thanks and good afternoon, everyone. Maybe Joel or Peter, we always think of your team doing such a great job partnering with tenants understanding their business, helping them solve real estate problems, Peter I think the examples you talked about in San Diego with the developments really speak to that this quarter.  When we think of that partnership, how have you seen the needs and maybe the pain points of your tenants changed over the past six to 12 months? Joel Marcus : Well, I think that the obvious one is one that a number of people mentioned throughout the commentary. And that is certainly in the small and medium size companies that are emerging that are dependent upon whether it be private financing or public market financing or cash on hand. The fact that we're in this de facto recession, inflation and high interest rate environment just makes the management of cash, the management of burn, the management of decisions, just more methodical.  And yeah, maybe just more methodical. So our job is to understand those needs and work intimately with the clients to make sure that we're doing the best job that we can to meet their needs. And I think we've done a great job of that. And we have very, very close relationships. These are not ones they sign a lease and that's it. These are ongoing very deep relationships. So we're generally pretty intimately involved in a lot of the decision making. Peter Moglia : And, remember, I mean, this isn't the first time we've hit hard times as a company. We've been around for, close to 30 years. And we've worked with our tenant base during all of these times. And the goodwill that accumulates and how we're able to help them is why 80% of our leasing comes from these existing tenants. I mean, we have the ability - we have the size, the ability to work with folks that need assistance and it provides great goodwill for future endeavors for those of the - those management teams that are in the buildings that we're helping them out with. Tom Catherwood : Got it. Thank you. Thank you for those answers. And then, kind of following up on that, maybe if I switchover to Hallie, Hallie I appreciate - Hallie I apologize. Appreciate the detailed market update. I was kind of really interested in the comment you made around AI adoption potentially leading to the need for incremental lab space. And that you were potentially seeing the early signs of that. Can you provide more kind of color on that comment? And maybe what you're seeing in the market in that regard? Hallie Kuhn : Sure. Happy to. A great example and we had a quote from the CEO, Roger Perlmutter the former CSO of Merck in our press release is icons, which we have a signed lease with a property under development in San Francisco. With AI you have to have data to train the models. And so, when folks kind of \u2013 there has been commentary thrown out that oh! AI is going to and, make it so that you don't have to run experiments as extensively in labs.  What we see is actually the opposite, because you need such vast datasets to train the AI ML models in order to optimize and drive towards results that we see really large footprints whether it's robotic, high throughput, both chemical, and biological data these companies are generating in order to be able to actually apply AI and ML.  It would be like applying generative AI to the internet in 1995, right? You have to have a really vast starting dataset in order to get something that's meaningful on the back end. So we're continuing to see that evolve I think across all of our clusters. There's some really interesting ways that companies are integrating this tool into their toolkit for developing new medicines and that the end results 10, 20 years from now it's hopefully a lot more medicines for patients and additional lab space demand. Tom Catherwood : Appreciate the color. Thanks everyone. Joel Marcus : Yep. Thanks, Tom. Operator : Our next question will come from Connor Siversky of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Connor Siversky : Good afternoon. Thanks for having me on the call. I got a question on 2025 deliveries. So correct me if I'm wrong here, but the pre-leasing rate of the 2025 delivery should have a significant impact on how we're looking at capitalized interests in this context. So, assuming the pre-lease rate remains stable as it was reported in the supplemental release last night, can you give us an idea of how this would impact the interest expense on the P&L? Joel Marcus : So Marc you might want to comment on that, but that's kind of used in isolation because that's just one piece of the business. But Marc, go ahead and comment. Marc Binda : Yeah. Hi Connor. So, yeah, so capitalized interest is really determined based upon the size and magnitude of the assets under construction activities or under broadly all types of activities to get that asset ready for its intended use. So, to the extent that deliveries outpace construction spending and assets that are going through, either redevelopment or development, then capitalized interest would go down and the opposite is true if construction costs exceed the pace of deliveries.  What I'd say on 2025, if you're looking at the leasing percentages is, we've got some time on some of those and we've seen that that pre-leasing percentage pick up. Definitely, if those assets, we get to \u201825 and those assets seize activities and yeah, then capitalized interest would turn off. But we're, we got a long headway there. We got a long time and we've done - we've definitely done studies to look at the timing of pre-leasing and we're not quite in that sweet spot for some of these assets that are out in \u201825 and beyond in terms of when tenants are ready to make decisions. So, I guess, stay tuned. Connor Siversky : I appreciate the color. Is there any way, I mean, let's just say we took the most simplistic form of the deliveries in that context, what a kind of breakeven pre-leased rate would look like as those projects come online? Marc Binda : I'm not sure I understand your question, Connor. Connor Siversky : Well, I mean, we can we can take it offline. What I mean to say is if we if we use the schedule of deliveries and when those projects are supposed to roll online is what would be the breakeven rate between say the NOI contribution and the interest expense, that would be absorbed on the P&L as those projects roll online and they are moved from capitalized to the P&L on the interest expense? Marc Binda : Yeah. I guess the way to look at that, Connor is this, if you're looking at projects that has say just to make the math easy 7% yield and capitalization is in the high 3% range that that would, that would kind of tell you that, if half the building turned got delivered and half the building got turned off, you'd be neutral, but that's really, it's really not typically the case.  I mean, that the pre-leasing on all the, all the assets that we have for \u201823 and \u201824 is extremely high. So, we'll have to wait and see, but like I said before, we've seen the pre-leasing on \u201825 pickup as we get closer and closer to delivery, which is, which is pretty typical for tenants that of smaller size that make decisions much closer to the point at which they can see the building coming out of the ground and can visualize it. Connor Siversky : Got it. Understood. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Lot my questions have been asked. But I guess Joel, I'm just curious given the challenging funding market for maybe many of your private competitors. I'm just wondering to what extent are you gaining any kind of market share to the extent that you can do fit outs and build outs of smaller lab space and to what extent have your peers maybe not been able to do that? And is that maybe delaying some of the new supply coming to market? Joel Marcus : Well. Yeah, hey Steve. So I think the way to think about that is other landlords who may have laboratory assets. If they're in - if you're in Cambridge or you're in other key markets that are directly competitive of ours, it always depends on their financial capability and also the needs of the tenant. I mean, it's really hard to say.  I think at the moment we feel very good about our positioning because if you're a tenant and you need especially now just in time space and you need a path for future growth, you hit a valuation milestone, value inflection milestone, which is very typical today. A one-off building, no matter whether it's fitted out or not fitted out, doesn't really offer you that opportunity. You need a campus. You need a campus and generally you want one run by Alexandria because you want the best operator because a one-off building may get you some space, but oftentimes there's no path to future growth or expansion. And so that that's how we kind of see things. So we think we have an enormous competitive advantage and moat against one-off buildings by whether they be landlords who know what they're doing or landlords, who have no idea of what they're doing. Peter Moglia : Hey, to dive a little - this is Peter. To dive a little bit deeper into that. You'll notice the big increase in vacancy in San Francisco of buildings essentially that delivered and they delivered in shell condition. I took a deep dive with the team as like guys, what does this product look like? And a lot of it is just our buildings that are basically waiting to see whether they should be office or lab.  They were built with an ability to be lab and so we're counting them in our supply numbers, but they could very well go office because nobody is super committed. But you're also right in that those developers are not able to go ahead and just build out TI's because their financing isn't there for that. But I wanted to bring attention to that because you reminded me of it, you're seeing vacancy numbers, you're seeing supply numbers.  A lot of these projects are agnostic about whether or not they're going to be office or lab especially in the larger markets. But we are counting on them on our competitive supply because they could be. But they may very well not be and they very well may fail if they don't have financing to provide TI's. Steve Sakwa : Great. Thanks, guys. That's it for me. Joel Marcus : Okay. Thanks, Peter. Operator : The next question will come from Dylan Burzinski of Green Street. Please go ahead. Dylan Burzinski : Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question this afternoon. Just curious, I know you guys touched a little bit on the development pipeline, but just wondering if there's any sort of interesting opportunities that are you guys are witnessing or seeing on the acquisitions front? And if not today, do you expect to sort of see any interesting opportunities come refreshing over the next, call it 12 to 18 months? Joel Marcus : Yeah. So, first of all I think you noted we had a slow quarter. I don't think any quarter is slow. So you might rethink about that commentary. Second, yes, just remember the quote that I gave regarding Warren Buffett. So we think there may be some opportunities, but we certainly won't comment on them. Dylan Burzinski : Thanks. That's all I had. Operator : And our final questions today will come from Aditi Balachandran of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Aditi Balachandran : Hi all. Just a quick one for me. I know how you mentioned that M&A is an overall positive. So do you have an idea of how much incremental demand it could possibly drive? And I guess, how much of that would be for pure lab space versus the product or drug manufacturing space? Joel Marcus : Well, most of it. Hallie can comment. We see as a big, big opportunity as, if you look at these schedules of drugs coming off patent for the balance of the decade, it\u2019s pretty large and virtually the only way to fill pipeline in that shorter time is to acquire technologies and pipelines that are available. And so we see it as a big opportunity, number one. And by and large most of that is R&D related. We're not so focused.  Sometimes you have the new modalities that are you've got intimate manufacturing with the new modalities as part of the R&D Center, but kind of classic manufacturing. We don't really deal with that. And we don't see that as an opportunity for us. But Hallie, I don't know if you have any other comments. Hallie Kuhn : Yeah, with M&A as I mentioned, you really have to look at it as a on a case-by-case basis for specific M&A, I think that the better way to look at it is holistically and as Joel mentioned, M&A and licensing is a huge component of large pharma strategy for the next decade and that will likely continue beyond that. They're looking to recoup something on the order of over $130 billion in revenue, that'll be lost due to patent expirations.  And so when you look at that acquisition activity on a whole, the net positive is certainly going to lead to additional R&D needs and is also a benefit from the perspective of upgrades and credits. Given that when an acquirer comes in and buys a smaller company, we get the upgrade on the credit from the in place lease. Aditi Balachandran : Great. That\u2019s really Helpful. Thank you. Joel Marcus : Yeah. Thank you. Operator : And we did have an additional question coming from Wes Golladay of Baird. Please go ahead. Wes Golladay : Hey everyone. Thanks for sticking around for the final question. I just had a quick question on the development pipeline, just like the \u201823 and the \u201824 pipeline that\u2019s well leased. Do you have any, I guess plans to change any more of those tenants out like you did this quarter? Or is it pretty much locked in at this point? Joel Marcus : Yeah, that's a kind of an unusual circumstance where we felt we had a robust client that needed space even a little more quickly than we anticipated. We had another client. We saw that maybe had taken on too much space. So it was actually an ideal mix and marriage of putting the two together. They come up from time to time. I'm not sure I'd read anything into that, but that's kind of normal, but that's how it happened. Wes Golladay : Fantastic. And a quick follow-up. Are you seeing any - I guess pent-up demand to get into some of these mega campuses where they've been fully occupied for years and do you have a little bit of tenant churn? And do you have any situations where multiple tenants are going to the space? Joel Marcus : The answer to that is yes. And but that tends to be more like Cambridge-centric. Maybe our San Carlos campus, not quite a mega campus yet. It's about 600,000 feet, but to grow much larger. So, Alexandria Center for Life Science in York City is another example. So, yes, some places we see that there are multiple tenants we're having to kind of juggle. Wes Golladay : Thanks for paying attention to. Joel Marcus : Yeah. Operator : This will conclude our question and answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Marcus for any closing remarks. Joel Marcus : Okay, thank you very much for taking time to listen. And god bless everybody. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Paula Schwartz : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now I would like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel. Joel Marcus : Thanks, Paul, and welcome, everybody. Consistent with Alexandria is building the future of life-changing innovation in medicine and at the Vanguard and the heart of the $5 trillion secularly growing industry, I want to wish everyone a safe and healthy 2024. On the cover of our press release and supplemental package, we've included the great Jim Collins quote about Alexandria, Alexandria has achieved the three outputs that define a great company : superior results, distinctive impact and lasting endurance. On superior results, we're very proud to say that we've had a very strong total shareholder return since IPO of over 1,500%, beating all of the benchmark REIT indices and also every -- almost every other health care REIT. On distinctive impact, Alexandria's tenants whom we have supported are responsible for an astounding 50% of the novel FDA approved therapies over the last decade, truly amazing. And our unique one of a kind full continuum of care 115 project in Dayton, Ohio has treated more than 7,000 patients afflicted by opioid addiction and other substance abuses and has made a dramatic positive impact on the lives of thousands of people, and we're very proud of that accomplishment. And then moving to lasting endurance want to congratulate the Alexandria family team on this significant 30-year anniversary milestone of our founding on January 5, 1994 and who would or could have imagined in 1994 that this fledgling garage startup would have created an entirely new class of real estate at the Vanguard and the heart of the life science industry, combating many of the illnesses, which afflict our family and friends. So moving on to my take on fourth quarter and year-end 2023, I'd say we have witnessed the unprecedented eight-year bull run of the life science capital markets 2014 through 2021, the longest on record, coupled with the rocket ship funding during COVID. And the market in 2023 has clearly reflected the rationalization of the past decade. With respect to Alexandria in 2023, I would say, I would characterize our 2023 overall operating and financial performance as highly resilient. Notable achievements include 11% plus NOI growth year-over-year, 2023 to 2022 in very, very strong. We delivered a record $265 million of incremental NOI in 2023 with our development capabilities moving that to fruition, which are first-in-class. We've continued very solid leasing in 2023 with over 4 million plus rentable square feet leased with very respectable GAAP and cash numbers. Two key leases in fourth quarter, which are noted in the supplement, the lease to Novo Nordisk and the lease to Cargo Therapeutics. 2023, we had a remarkable 76% of leasing with existing tenants, and we look forward to a strong 2024 leasing effort and expect a handful of significant leases to mature soon. We expect to make significant progress on our lease expirations and filling vacant space, while achieving positive rent growth. 2023 we did a highly confident job of self-funding our growth and will continue to do so in 2024. Our balance sheet and liquidity are in the best shape in the company's history, and we're very proud of that accomplishment. We have given and reconfirmed very solid detailed guidance for 2024, and we believe that the life science industry will continue to benefit most importantly, from some key macro tailwinds in 2024, including positive M&A activity, declining interest rates, increased innovation and some great key data readouts. And finally, before I turn it over to Peter to comment on a range of critical issues. I want to comment on the sale of our 42nd Street asset in New York City, leased to Pfizer through midyear 2024. They previously vacated and moved their headquarters to another site in New York City. We made a strategic decision not to go forward with the contemplated redevelopment of that building to in part to state and local to challenging state and local governmental policies. We also had a somewhat similar, but not on the scale reaction back a number of years ago and our successful reduction in our footprint in the city of San Francisco. We have created and grown the commercial life science lab space market in New York City. When we delivered our East Tower and our ACLS mega campus back in 2010, there were only essentially two companies of any significance that we're doing commercial life science research in New York City, many academics, but no -- virtually no commercial. Today, there are over 100 but New York City, the life science market there remains here 14 years later, still a small start-up market. And we believe that by focusing on our ACLS New York City mega campus. That's the best way for us to continue to be successful. And we have taken this disciplined action out of an abundance of prudence. And with that, let me turn the commentary over to Peter. Peter Moglia : Thanks, Joel. In Flagship Pioneerings 2024 Annual Letter, Founder and CEO, Noubar Afeyan, described 2023 as a polycrisis, encompassing the confluence of economic turbulence, climate change, deeply fractured politics, two global wars, threats to democracy, loss of trust in institutions, and continuing dislocations triggered by the COVID epidemic. Alexandria's solid 2023 performance within such a dismal backdrop is nothing less than extraordinary. I don't want to steal too much of Mark's thunder, but leasing close to our average volume since 2018 ex the rocket ship years and maintaining strong earnings growth, while navigating through this poly crisis is a testament to Alexandria's competitive advantage and the power of our brand that Joel and Dan eloquently articulated at Investor Day. Heading into 2024, the poly crisis remains, but so does our resiliency. Our balance sheet is as strong as ever. And in 2023, we proved that we can self-fund our investments and still maintain our lowest leverage level in history. Thus, with our unique business model, highly skilled and experienced talent impeccable execution and a healthy underlying industry poised to advance human and planetary health. We've created the fertile industrial ecosystem, Mr. Afan [ph] postulated can generate value while defending against any coming vulnerabilities, we aim to prove that thesis right. I'm going to discuss our development pipeline, leasing, supply and asset sales and hand it over to Hallie. In the Fourth Quarter, we delivered 1,228,604 square feet into our high barrier to entry submarkets bringing total deliveries for the year to 3,271,170 square feet covering 15 projects. The annual incremental NOI delivered during the year of approximately $265 million and the incremental NOI delivered during the quarter of $145 million are both the highest total in company history. The initial weighted average stabilized deal for 2023 deliveries was 7%, supported by a strong stabilized yield on cost of 7.7% from our fourth quarter deliveries. Development and redevelopment leasing activity of approximately 234,000 square feet was higher quarter-over-quarter for the third reporting period in a row, and the positive momentum is expected to continue as we signed 270,000 square feet of LOIs during the quarter. At quarter end, our pipeline of current and near-term projects are 60% leased or under negotiations, which include executed LOIs. From the first quarter of 2024 through the end of 2027, we expect to deliver approximately 90% of the $495 million of stabilized NOI the current pipeline is expected to generate. Demand from our highly innovative credit tenant base, looking to leverage the place-making and scale of our mega campus model is expected to drive future opportunities, such as the Novo Nordisk lease executed during the quarter for 165,000 square feet at the Alexandria Center for Life Science Waltham, Mega Campus in Greater Boston. Transitioning to leasing and supply. We leased 4,306,072 square feet during the year and 889,737 square feet during the quarter. To put some context to that, it's roughly half of the average of the rocket ship years of 2021 and 2022, but very close to the average volume we leased in the three years prior from 2018 through 2020. We've returned to the fundamentals which were trending positively before 2021 and 2022. So we feel really good about the near- and long-term prospects for our business. We spoke a lot about the competitive advantages that our Mega Campus model affords us during Investor Day. 63% of the total leasing we did during the year was completed in our highly curated Class A mega campuses, located in high barrier to entry life science clusters. And they are the key reason we continue to post strong cash and GAAP rent increases, which came in at 15.8% and 29.4%, respectively, for the year. We believe the beginning of 2023 was the low point for demand and are pleased to see that demand for Greater Boston, San Francisco Bay and San Diego are all up year-over-year. A good sign since this does not include a number of projects that are on hold as management teams and Boards remain cautious. However, that should change soon. As you will hear from Hallie, the trajectory of the industry has turned positive. In the meantime, we continue to win the majority of the current high-quality demand due to tenants prioritizing location, place-making experience, ability to scale, proven operational excellence, reliability and trustworthiness. Our teams continue to closely track supply building-by-building in our proprietary databases. As we turn the page on 2023, we expect 2024 to be the peak year for new deliveries then begin to dissipate in 2025. In Greater Boston, unleased competitive supply estimated to be delivered in 2024 is 7% of market inventory, a 0.9% increase over last quarter, not due to new projects, but because of project deliveries being pushed from 2023 to 2024. In 2025, the unleased competitive supply will increase market inventory by another 2.5%, an expected slowdown from 2024 levels. In San Francisco Bay, unleased competitive supply estimated to be delivered in 2024 is 10.7% of market inventory, which is a 2.7% increase. Like Greater Boston, this increase is driven by projects that were expected to deliver in 2023, but are taking longer than expected. In 2025, the unleased competitive supply will increase market inventory by much less at 2.2%, a good sign, but still a 1% increase over last quarter due to a new project breaking ground in Menlo Park. In San Diego, unleased competitive supply estimated to be delivered in 2024 is 6.8% of market inventory, a slight decrease from last quarter due to an increase in supply from projects being pushed from 2023 to 2024, offset by leasing in those projects. In 2025, the unleased competitive supply will decelerate to 2.7% of market inventory. A quick update on direct and sublease vacancy. Direct vacancy in Greater Boston is up 258 basis points to 7.05%, still mid-single-digits despite a number of deliveries in late 2023. It has climbed 270 basis points to 12.36% in our San Francisco Bay markets due to unleased new deliveries. And in San Diego, the increase has been more modest, rising 121 basis points to 7.97% driven primarily by Serina Therapeutics vacating all of their leases in the region. They are not an Alexandria tenant. Subleased vacancy has remained stable, ranging from 5.4% in San Diego to 5.9% in Boston. I'll conclude with an update on our value harvesting asset recycling program. Continued demand for our assets enabled us to self-fund our investments as we presented at Investor Day. Page 6 of the supplemental summarizes the material transaction closed during the year. What can be taken away from the partial interest sales at 15 Necco and 9625 Town Center Drive and the sale of 11119 North Torrey Pines Road is that well-located and stabilized assets located in Alexandria's primary submarkets continue to command a premium valuation. Others in solid locations, but in need of material CapEx for repositioning such as the Second Avenue and Memorial portfolio in Greater Boston completed in the Second Quarter and the Memorial Drive Beaver Street and Roselle Street portfolio completed in the fourth quarter, delivered solid per square foot valuations due to their solid historical performance. Due to the unstabilized nature of these portfolio sales, the cap rates will not provide any meaningful insights to return expectations on stabilized properties. However, I can point you to Healthpeak's 65% sale of 3020 and 3030 Callan Ridge Road in Torrey Pines as a directional comp. The building is fully leased long-term to a credit tenant but is not expected to be occupied by said tenant. The purchase price yielded a 5.3% cap rate despite that change or despite that challenge. As we presented at Investor Day, our strategies that continue to widen the moat with competitive advantages our mega campus model provides by recycling our non-campus assets into our current and future mega campuses. With that, I'll pass the call over to Hallie. Hallie Kuhn : Thank you, Peter, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Hallie Kuhn, SVP of Science and Technology and Capital Markets. Today, I will provide a recap of the life science industry in 2023 and an overview of the health and demand drivers of each of our life science tenant segments as we kick off 2024. John Templeton wisely wrote that bull markets are born on pessimism, grow on skepticism, mature on optimism and die of euphoria. While the reset of the life science industry from euphoric 2021 highs has been rocky, healthy pessimism is seeding renewed momentum, underscored by rational valuations and capital flowing to the strongest technologies and experienced management teams. Fundamentally, the staggering unmet medical need that drives the $5 trillion secularly growing life science industry has not debated, and the opportunity for companies and investors in the life science sector to positively impact human health and disease is massive. Through the ups and downs, the trajectory of the industry is positive, translating long-term, into a healthy and expanding tenant base. This sentiment is reflected in the numbers. The XBI, a weighted index of small and mid-cap biotech ended 2023, up 8%. Large biopharma performance, which had an exceptional 2022, while the rest of the market generally languished, ended flat. Two notable exceptions were Alexandria tenants, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk both of which ended the year up over 50% as the market for their novel diabetes and obesity medicines accelerated. And as Peter mentioned, in December, we announced a significant lease with Novo Nordisk for their new US R&D headquarters on our Waltham Mega campus in Greater Boston. Another 2023 biopharma trend was M&A. Excluding mega mergers over $50 billion, 2023 set a new high watermark with $159 billion in acquisitions. These were largely sub-$10 billion deals driven by pharma's need to bolster pipelines as they face steep revenue loss due to patent expirations. As M&A dollars are recycled back into the industry, it creates a positive cycle of innovation as scientists and entrepreneurs start their next new venture. Altogether, the M&A life cycle is an important driver of demand across our regions. With respect to the FDA, 55 novel medicines were approved in 2023, the second highest year on record and double the average number of annual approvals 20 years ago. There were also eight advanced cell and gene therapies approved. Tenant Vertex received FDA approval of CASGEVY this December, a potentially curative therapy for severe sickle cell disease and the first approved treatment utilizing a novel genome editing technology known as CRISPR. The takeaway is that the industry's model is working, novel scientific discoveries, such as CRISPR, which was elucidated just over a decade ago are translating into impactful medicines for patients.  Now let's take a closer look at the health and demand across each of our life science tenant segments. First, large pharma, which makes up 19% of our ARR continues to deploy substantial capital towards internal and external R&D, equating to over $270 billion in R&D spend.  Commitment to R&D is an imperative for pharma. Over the next decade, the top 20 pharma are staring down approximately $200 billion of lost revenue as patents expire, new competitors enter the market and a subset of medicines become subject to potential price setting by Medicare through the recently enacted IRA legislation. And where does pharma look to offset gap in revenue to smaller and nimbler biotechs. Currently, $3 out of every $5 of top 20 pharma revenue stemmed from medicines acquired through M&A and partnerships. Fortunately, this segment is well positioned with strong balance sheets and an estimated $1 trillion in available firepower to leverage. All told, we expect healthy levels of internal research and M&A to continue through 2024 and beyond. Importantly, innovation requires people and a critical component of the pharma equation is stellar talent. Recruiting and retaining scientists is more important than ever. Cancer can't be cured from the couch and expectations of a scientific workforce where working from home is not an option or high, requiring amenities and community that the scale of Alexandria's mega campuses are uniquely positioned to provide. This need is driving several large pharma requirements across our clusters. Transitioning to public biotechnology. Our ARR from biotechs with marketed products increased to 17% compared to 14% in 3Q. This increase is due to the delivery of Moderna's new headquarters at 325 Binney Street on our One Kendall Square mega campus, as well as several clinical stage companies transitioning to commercial stage after receiving marketing approval for new therapies. This segment continues to mature, with tenants such as Vertex eclipsing a market cap of $100 billion in 2023. Next step are our pre-commercial public biotech companies, which represent 8% of our ARR. For this segment, data trumps all. Companies that meet expected milestones have executed significant follow-on financings and stock prices have responded positively. In total, nearly $20 billion in follow-on financing was raised on U.S. stock exchanges in 2023, a quarter of which was raised by Alexandria tenants. Companies have also tapped alternative financing structures such as pipes and royalty deals providing additional access to liquidity. Our San Francisco-based tenant BridgeBio has raised over $900 million in the past 12 months from a combination of these sources, driven by clinical data for a novel medicine treating transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy, a potential fatal disease of the heart muscle. As the IPO market cracks open in 2024, companies with the right clinical pedigree will be able to access additional liquidity. Last week, the first IPO of the year by asset-based CG Oncology priced above their target range and raised $380 million. On to private biotechnology, which encompasses 10% of our ARR, while life science venture investments slowed in 2023 relative to the highs of 2021 and 2022, it still exceeds pre-COVID levels and came in at approximately $40 billion. Series A, B and C rounds are predominantly being led by outside investors. Speaking to healthy levels of new investments, with the caveat that valuations have come down and deals often take longer to close. Funds have been conservative deploying the capital raised in the past several years and have ample dry powder. As the market's warm, we expect venture activity to remain strong through 2024. One counterbalance is that we may see less later-stage financings as a subset of companies go public instead of raising another round of private capital. Next, our life science product, service and device tenants, which represent 21% of our ARR. This segment includes contract manufacturers, diagnostic firms and research tool companies, all of which are critical and complementary to companies developing new medicines. For example, research tool companies are creating the next generation of advanced life science technologies such as super-resolution microscopes and DNA sequencers that can process an entire genome in half a day. These technologies often require large specialized footprints, complex infrastructure and highly trained scientific talent. As the trusted brand for life science real estate, our tenants look to Alexandria to safeguard the billions of dollars of equipment, intellectual property and assets housed within their labs. Last, our institutional tenants totaling 11% ARR as well-funded often credit tenants, institutions continue to be an engine of innovation within our ecosystems. One pioneering institutional tenant that came out of stealth this month is Cambridge-based Arena BioWorks. With $500 million in funding, Arena hired scientific luminaries from around the country, with the goal to combine and accelerate academic research and venture-backed drug development under one roof. Returning to where we started, the life science industry is squarely in the realm of healthy skepticism, exceeding the very early innings of the next bull run. We are not completely out of the woods yet with question marks around interest rates and 2024 election looming. However, accelerating pace of scientific innovation, access to significant capital from multiple sources and enormous unmet need for life-saving therapies will propel the industry forward and translate into healthy demand and increasing long-term revenue. With that, I will pass it over to Marc. Marc Binda : Thank you, Hallie. This is Marc Binda here. Hello, and good afternoon, everyone. Congratulations to our entire team for outstanding execution this past year in a very challenging macroeconomic environment. I'll start with our solid financial results. Total revenues and NOI for 2023 were up 11.5% and 12.2%, respectively, over 22%, primarily driven by solid same-property performance and record high development and redevelopment projects placed into service in 2023 with an incremental annual NOI of $265 million. FFO per share diluted as adjusted was $897, up a solid 6.5% over 2022. We're very proud to report solid operating results for the year, driven by disciplined execution of our mega campus strategy. Our tenants continue to appreciate our brand collaborative mega campuses and our operational excellence by our team. We have high-quality cash flows with 52% of our annual rental revenue as of 4Q 2023 from investment-grade and publicly traded large-cap tenants, up 3% from the prior quarter. And we have one of the highest quality client rosters in the REIT industry. 75% of our annual rental revenue comes from our collaborative mega campuses, collections remained very high at 99.9%, adjusted EBITDA margins remained strong at 69% and 96% of our leases contain annual rent escalations approximating 3%. Now, solid rental rate growth and leasing volume drove same-property NOI growth in 2023, up 3.4% and 4.6% on a cash basis. These results were in line with our previous guidance and very solid results, especially considering the macro environment. As expected, our Fourth Quarter same-property results took some pressure due to some temporary vacancy and four properties spread across Boston, San Francisco and San Diego, comprising about 330,000 square feet that is 64% leased or negotiating. We expect same property results to accelerate in the second half of 2024, driven by anticipated solid rental rate growth, occupancy growth in the second half of the year, coupled with the four properties I just mentioned, as well as contractual rent increases and the burn-off of contractual free rent from executed leases. We expect solid same property growth for 2024 consistent with what we provided at our Investor Day in December, up 1.5% and 4% on a cash basis at the mid point of our guidance range. Leasing volume in the fourth quarter was solid at 890,000 square feet for the quarter and 4.3 million for the year, which is in line with our general historical average from 2013 to 2020. We continue to benefit from our long-standing tenant relationships and brand loyalty with 76% of our leasing completed in 2023 coming from existing tenant relationships. Rental rate growth for lease renewals and releasing space in 2023 was very strong at 29.4% and 15.8% on a cash basis. These are very solid results and are the third highest annual amounts, compared to the 10 years preceding the rocket ship years of 2021 and 2022. 4Q 2023 rental rate growth for lease renewals and releasing of space was 9.2% and 5.5% on a cash basis. Due to the incredible execution by our team, we were able to backfill the roughly 100,000 square foot former Atreca space in San Carlos with a very exciting clinical-stage biotech company called Cargo Therapeutics during the quarter at solid economics, including no TIs and limited downtime. The starting cash rent on that deal was slightly negative at about negative 4% compared to the most recent in-place rents from [indiscernible] that was three years into a 10-year lease. Given the quarterly results are driven by a relatively small amount of square feet, the relatively flat results from this transaction had a meaningful impact on the quarterly rental rate increases. Excluding this transaction, rental rate increases for the quarter would have been 21.4% and 9.7% on a cash basis. We expect solid rental rate growth on lease renewals and releasing of space for 2024 at a midpoint of 15% and 9% on a cash basis with some variation from quarter-to-quarter. The overall mark-to-market for cash rental rates related to our in-place leases for the entire asset base remains solid at 14%. Our non-revenue-enhancing expenditures, including TIs and leasing commissions on second generation space have averaged 15% of NOI over the last five years and remained low during 2023 and in the 12% to 13% range. Year-end occupancy was solid at 94.6%, up 90 basis points from the prior quarter and the primary driver of the increase from the third quarter was space that was delivered in San Diego. The midpoint of our guidance range for occupancy for year-end 2024 is 95.1%, so we do expect some modest growth in occupancy through the year as well as growth in same-property occupancy in the second half of the year. Transitioning to the balance sheet. We have one of the strongest balance sheets in the company's history as of 4Q 2023. Our corporate credit rankings link in the top 10% of all publicly traded US public REITs. We met our goal for year-end leverage of 5.1 times for net debt to adjusted EBITDA on a quarterly annualized basis. And we ended the year with tremendous liquidity of $5.8 billion fixed rate debt comprising 98.1% of our total debt, a weighted average remaining term of debt of 12.8 years and no debt maturities until 2025. Only 20% of our debt matures in the next five years and 29% of our debt matures in 2049 and beyond with an attractive rate of 3.91%. We continue to focus on the enhancement of our overall asset base and the recycling of capital through outright dispositions of assets that are not integral to our mega campus strategy. We recognize that these types of assets will likely have a higher cost of capital than our core assets located in our mega campuses, but this will allow us to recycle these proceeds into our highly leased development and redevelopment pipeline and to continue to enhance our mega campus strategy. For 2023, we completed dispositions and partial interest sales of $1.3 billion, including $439 million of dispositions completed in the fourth quarter. Importantly, during 2023, we did not issue any new common equity other than the settlement of our outstanding forward equity contracts from 2022, which raised $104 million and we're very proud of our strong execution capability. The team is laser focused on the execution of our capital plan headed into 2024, and we have pending dispositions subject to letters of intent or sales agreements for another $142 million that we expect to close in 2024. Based upon our current outlook, we expect our asset recycling program to be more heavily weighted towards outright dispositions of non-core assets rather than partial interest sales in 2024. In the fourth quarter, we recognized impairments aggregating $271.9 million, which included two significant items. First was the $94.8 million charge related to the sale of 380 and 420 East Street located in the Seaport, which had been announced last quarter and subsequently closed during the fourth quarter. And then second, as Joel mentioned, $93.5 million of a charge related to an office property located in Manhattan, which was classified as held for sale this quarter. The New York project Joel mentioned was acquired in 2018 as a covered land project with a leaseback and in-place cash flows. But in the fourth quarter, we elected not to proceed with the conversion project and this is now under contract and expected to be sold next year. Cash flows from operating activities after dividends for 2024 is expected to be very strong at $450 million at the midpoint of our guidance, and we'll continue to support growth in our annual common stock dividends per share. We had a low conservative FFO payout ratio of 56% for the quarter with a 6% average per share dividend increase over the last five years and at this pace of retained cash flows over the next three years, Cash flows from operating activities after dividends should generate close to $1.4 billion of efficient capital for reinvestment. Now I'll turn to a couple of important highlights on the external growth side. 2023 and 4Q 2023 were both record years in terms of the amount of incremental annual NOI onboarded with $265 million and $145 million, respectively. Importantly, about 80% of the annual rental revenue delivered in the fourth quarter was the investment-grade or publicly traded large cap tenants, including Moderna and Eli Lilly. With a very large amount of deliveries around mid-quarter on average in the fourth quarter, we expect a significant earnings benefit headed into 1Q 2024. We expect tremendous growth in incremental annual net operating income on a cash basis of $114 million upon the burn-off of initial free rent related to recently delivered projects with a weighted average burn-off period of about 10 months. And as Peter highlighted, we have 5.7 million rentable square feet of projects that are 60% leased or negotiating and projects that will generate $495 million of incremental annual net operating income over the next four years. A key item to highlight here is that we had strong leasing activity in the pipeline with over 500,000 square feet either leased or added to the negotiating bucket through signed LOIs during the quarter, which was the most we've had since 2Q 2022. Next, on capitalized interest, our outlook for capitalized interest for 2024 is consistent with our previous guidance. And as a reminder, we expect capitalized interest for 2024 to be impacted by the following : First, and overall decline in average real estate basis subject to capitalization compared to 2023, which was driven in part by the large basis placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2023, and second, we expect an offsetting increase caused by an uptick in our weighted average interest rate on borrowings used in the calculation of capitalization of interest in 2024 compared to 2023. I'll turn next to venture investments. Realized gains from venture investments included in FFO per share as adjusted for the quarter was $12.3 million, which was below our recent run rate, in part due to a large realized loss on one of our investments that occurred late in the quarter. FFO per share as adjusted over the last three years has included on average, $96 million of realized gains in each year from venture investments or approximately $24 million per quarter. Our outlook for quarterly realized gains from venture investments in 2024 and is $95 million to $125 million, which is modestly above our three-year annual average of $96 million. Gross unrealized gains in our venture investments as of the end of the quarter were $320 million on a cost basis of just under $1.2 billion. Turning to guidance. We have reaffirmed our solid guidance for 2024 that was initially provided in connection with our Annual Investor Day on November 29th, with a few minor changes as outlined in our supplemental package on Page 4. Our range for guidance for EPS is $3.49 to $3.69 and our range for FFO per share diluted as adjusted is $9.37 to $9.57, with no change in the midpoint of $9.47, which represents a solid 5.6% growth in FFO per share, following excellent growth last year of 6.5%. Lastly, our ATM program expired in early January of this year upon the expiration of our shelf registration, so we do expect to file a new program here in the near future. With that, let me turn it over to Joel. Joel Marcus : So, please open it up for questions, operator. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Josh Dennerlein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Josh Dennerlein : Hey guys. Thanks for time. I just wanted to explore the occupancy uplift that you're assuming in guide. Just how much of that occupancy uplift is just driven by leases you've already signed versus leasing that you're assuming that still has to get done? Joel Marcus : Yes. So, Marc comment? Marc Binda : Yes, sure. Hi Josh. So, we do have about 300,000 square feet of leases that we've already signed that have not commenced that will commence next year. So we have a good head start headed into 2024. I think to put things into perspective, we've got about $3.4 million of lease rules next year. But after you back out the space that we've anticipated, we'll go dark into redevelopment or development that only leaves you with about 1 1.8 million square feet that's not resolved. So, I think that number feels pretty manageable relative to our historical run rate on leasing. Joel Marcus : Yes. So, when Marc says next year, we're in 2024, but the next year from 2023, which we're reporting, just so we're clear. Josh Dennerlein : Appreciate that. And then it looks like supply is going to peak this year. Just kind of what's your latest thoughts on timing for net effective rents bottoming, any kind of variation across your three core markets? Joel Marcus : Yes. So Marc, Peter, you guys want to comment? Peter Moglia : Yes, I'll take it, Josh. Hard to predict. But certainly, the effects of 2023 supply has been seen net effective rents. We've seen TIs increase remarkably, we've talked about that before. TIs aren't going to go any further up, because they're already pretty high. I'd say, there's some pricing power to the tenant if they've got a very large requirement. But outside of that, I think things have been holding relatively well. Josh Dennerlein : Okay. Appreciate that. Thank you. Peter Moglia : Yes, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Anthony Paolone of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Anthony Paolone : Yes, thanks. First question is, it's early in the year, and it seems like you're approaching the midpoint of your acquisition guide. So just curious, if these were transactions that were in process when you're setting up the guidance or if you just are seeing a lot of stuff that's attractive or you feel like it's a time to play more offense. Joel Marcus : Yes, the former, Tony. Anthony Paolone : Okay. So there's no like anticipation that you want to pick up the [indiscernible]. And then just on the disposition side, you talked about some of the noncore stuff like having New York under contract. But like when you look at the rest of the dispositions that you're thinking about for the rest of this year, do you think you'll have better execution on noncore sales? Or do you think selling stakes in more core higher-quality stuff is where you might get either more capital or better execution at this point? Joel Marcus : Yes. I think we're -- I think as Marc and Peter have indicated, we're focused on really noncore, noncampus assets. So we feel pretty good about that. Anthony Paolone : Okay. All right. Thanks. Joel Marcus : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Vikram Malhotra of Mizuho. Please go ahead. Vikram Malhotra : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to get some maybe more color on the pipeline that you're kind of looking at today to deal with sort of expirations over the next 12 to 18 months, but also the developments, particularly what's delivering in sort of '25, '26, where maybe more lease-up is expected. So I don't know if you could give us some sort of wide range of like what is the pipeline square footage-wise of tenants you are at some stage of discussion with? Or if not that, at least give us a sense of the composition of these large, small by market? And any color there would be helpful, just to sort of bridge the lease-up that you have to do in terms of expirations and developments? Joel Marcus : Yes. So I don't think we would want to talk about pipeline that I think is pretty confidential stuff, Vikram. But I think you can assume every lease is somewhat different, and every market is somewhat different. I mean, if you go back and look at the cargo therapeutic, that was a very unique lease in a very unique set of circumstances. So it isn't like -- this is not a commodity product. This is a generally a premium priced, noncommodity product. So, it's not like you have the same bunch of folks waiting for the same amount of space in the same, kind of, market type place. It's just not that kind of a business. Vikram Malhotra : Okay. And then just maybe one other topic, Biogen announced sort of rationalization of its office space. And I'm wondering if in your conversations with tenants across the portfolio, can you give us a sense of the latest thoughts on how they're thinking about office versus lab or office needs whether it's remote work or just they took on too much space. Just how are the tenants thinking about office space they may have in their last portfolios? Joel Marcus : That's always asked. Hallie, do you want to kind of comment on that? Hallie Kuhn : Sure. And hi Vikram, this is Hallie. I think we need to separate out the component of non-technical space adjacent to the labs. These are desks largely for the researchers that are moving in and out of the labs through the day. And just there's no rationalization of that space. That space is needed, it's part of the workflow that scientists day in and day out are utilizing. Surely, there are larger office requirements that as companies grow, that they will lease up if it's for their clinical or sales and marketing. That's a different set of questions. That is not who we are catering by and large. So when it comes to the lab based infrastructure that space is not going to go away. And we even have examples right now where that lab to non-technical space ratio is shifting. We need more desk king, right? Like we have more scientists going in and out, people don't like to share the same space. They like their own desks. So just to make that clear, you really have to distinguish the two. Peter Moglia : This is Peter. Just to be clear, Biogen is rationalizing their pure office space, nothing to do with their lab space. Joel Marcus : Yeah. And remember, they're a big cap company. So like big pharma, they have, kind of, dedicated legions of people doing things in traditional office, if you will, so it's not a typical case. Vikram Malhotra : That\u2019s it. Thank you. Peter Moglia : Yeah. Next question, operator. Operator : The next question comes from Rich Anderson of Wedbush. Please go ahead. Rich Anderson : Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. I just wanted to ask about the impairment and specifically, it's behind you now, but as a function of taking on what may be called a creative approach to development in a different macro environment. And I'm curious if you can -- we can expect to see more in the way of an impairment type of model in 2024 as you part ways with non-core assets? Is this something that we might see repeat itself as the year progresses? Joel Marcus : Yes. Marc, do you want to comment on that? Marc Binda : Yeah. Sure. Hi, Rich. Yeah, so under the accounting rules, these -- you can -- the common way where you could have an impairment is at the point where you designate an asset as held for sale. So as we get closer to potentially committing to certain sales, it's definitely possible that we could have additional impairments. But it's really hard to say at this point as we're still refining our approach and which assets to sell. So hard to say at this point. Rich Anderson : Okay. And then second question, on the $114 million of free rent burn that's good in the sense that you've got new cash flow coming in, but it's also free rent and it is what it is. It's not necessarily a good thing. Where does that compare if you can quantify it to the past and how much of it is a reflection of the current difficult headwinds that are facing you? And how do you expect that free rent sort of exposure to trend on a go-forward basis? Joel Marcus : Marc? Marc Binda : Yes. Hi, Rich. So we did -- yes, we had $114 million of free rent that will be burning off. I guess just to put that into perspective, we delivered $265 million of NOI this year, that's annual NOI. And a lot of those leases are very long-term in nature. So it's not a direct correlation one for one, but if you just do the simple math there, it's less than less than half a year on what is generally on average, those types of leases are 10 years and longer. So I don't think it's something that we're super concerned with. But to be fair, free rent has trickled up a little bit as we've seen. Rich Anderson : But \u2013 just not glaringly higher or anything like that. over the past few years. Is that correct? Marc Binda : I mean we published our free rent statistics, Rich. And I think it was about months 3 \u2013 0.3 months per year of rent at the end of last year. And I think we're at 0.6, so it's ticked up a little bit this year, but still relatively modest compared to the length of leases. Rich Anderson : Fair enough. Thank you. Peter Moglia : Yes. Hi, Rich. It's Peter. The great financial crisis, it was more like one. So we're -- it's still pretty healthy considering the market dynamics. Rich Anderson : Great. Thanks, Peter. Thanks, everyone. Peter Moglia : Thank you, Rich. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Griffin of Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Griffin : Great. Thanks. I want to go back to the Cargo Therapeutics lease at 835 Industrial. Joel, I know you mentioned that it was something specific driving that, but was wondering if you can give any more color on what drove the decline in rents? Was it a function of cargo willing to take occupancy pretty quickly? Or are there more worries about supply and where rental rates are going? Joel Marcus : Well, I think the key is -- and it's a good question, it's one of those situations where you're trying to find the right key to fit the right lock. You know, an exact amount of space that comes vacant that one would not have wanted to be vacant due to Atreca and finding the exact user of that space with literally very little downtime. And as I think Marc said, we had no TIs. So you don't want to just let that kind of a tenant go into the market and choose from some assorted number of spaces that might be available now or in the future. And so you try to make the deal because it's the perfect lock fitting -- the perfect key fitting the right lock. And so that's kind of the story. Michael Griffin : Got you. That's helpful. And then I was wondering if you could provide any additional color on the recent asset sales, the ones in Greater Boston and San Diego. It seems like they're aggregated in the supplemental and given there -- it seems like they're kind of lowly occupied. I'd be curious if you can kind of give us pricing, particularly on the asset in Cambridge, maybe what a yield would be on a stabilized basis? Joel Marcus : Yes. So Peter, do you want to give some commentary? Peter Moglia : Yes. I mean that speculating on what the Cambridge asset would be on a stabilized basis, I'd just kind of point to where we've seen stabilized things in Boston trade ourselves in the low to mid-5s. With the Necco transaction we had a couple of quarters ago, Boston Properties last quarter did something in the high 5s, but it's about two or three years from cash flowing. So I pointed to, in my commentary, a 5.3% cap rate in Torrey Pines for a building that's fully leased long-term to a credit tenant but that tenant has decided not to move in. So I've said it before, we speculate that good, well-located assets with good credit and good lease term are going to be in the low 5s, the sub-5 cap rates are no longer with us due to rates. Hopefully, that's helpful. Michael Griffin : Yes. That's it for me. I appreciate the time. Joel Marcus : Yes. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Jim Kammert of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Jim Kammert : Thank you. Good afternoon. Thematically, in Alexandria's experience, Hallie mentioned a lot of this positive M&A activity. Has that historically in your experience translated to a net incremental space demand across your portfolio? Meaning or is it more of a credit upgrade. I'm just trying to understand if the acquirers really tend to over time expand their lab footprint or they already have kind of underutilized space. Joel Marcus : Yes. Hey, Jim, the way to think about that is every case is different. If it's a smaller company with a specific product, it's sometimes just bolted on and the space isn't necessarily utilized and maybe subleased or terminated. But oftentimes, you find a strategic acquisition, and they could be on the larger medium or even smaller side, where companies, I can think of the Bristol-Myers, Juno in Seattle back a number of years ago, where BMS wanted really to get into the cell therapy issue and that led not only to the acquisition but a fairly big expansion. So if they're buying, if it's a strategic technology platform with multiple product shots on goal, usually, those end up with very, very good expansion results. If it's a smaller bolt-on, sometimes those don't. But everyone is honestly different. Jim Kammert : All right. Fair enough. And then a technical question, I'm sorry. You note that the fourth quarter sort of same-store progression in the first half of this year will be a little depressed by the vacancy associated with four properties what would have to happen at those properties from a leasing perspective from where they are today to get to 3% same-store NOI guide at the bottom end of your range. I mean, does anything have to happen? Or I'm just trying to understand the order of magnitude might in terms of incremental leasing for that portfolio to bench in your range? Joel Marcus : Yes. So Marc? Marc Binda : Yes. So we gave the leased/negotiating stats. I think it was about half of that 64% was leased and the other half was negotiation. And that stuff is expected to benefit the last half of the year. We do need to continue to make progress on that. But then we do have a significant amount of free rent that's contractual that has already been leased. It will also contribute to the numbers in the back half of the year. Jim Kammert : Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Tom Catherwood of BTIG. Please go ahead. Tom Catherwood : Thanks and good afternoon, everyone. Peter, you commented in past quarters on tenant space planning trending towards more just-in-time leasing. Is that still a fair characterization across your portfolio? Or are you seeing some markets where tenants are getting ahead of their expirations to lock in space? Peter Moglia : Yes. Decision-making has been slow. And I mean, I guess what I've talked about is that and tenants not wanting to invest in space. So the preference has been to go into available build space, things that are vacant or rolling or subleased rather than plan ahead and move in 12 months later into a development project. A lot of that has to do with a lot of the requirements over the past year and a half have been small, versus a larger requirement that you might not be easy to find and you need to put into a newer building. But that I don't think anybody is waiting to the last minute. It's really a function of the size of the company. If you're under 15,000 square feet or even under 20,000 square feet, you probably have options. If you're above that, you definitely need to plan ahead, because there's a lot less inventory in those sizes. Joel Marcus : Yes. I think the other way to think about that is the just-in-time inventory issue is really focused on, primarily biotech companies clinical stage that hit a milestone, and they need to move pretty rapidly the scale because of that milestone, which also yields funding, and that's where you get probably the most kick on the just-in-time space. Tom Catherwood : Appreciate that. And that actually kind of leads into the second question, which is, Peter, you had mentioned elevated concessions, and we hear about that kind of across the market, yet if we look at your second-generation leasing costs in 2023, they were a good bit lower than in 2022, especially if we do it on a kind of per year average basis. So can you speak maybe about how concessions are trending for new and renewal leases at existing properties as compared to leases at new developments and maybe where the economics are different on that side? Peter Moglia : Yes. I mean, the increase in the large increase in tenant improvement concessions has really been almost exclusively in new development space where you would traditionally give somebody $200 a foot plus or minus, depending on the market. With their rental rate and then expect them to invest into the rest of the space that, as we've talked about, has gone to $300 a square foot. If you look at the operating portfolio, and you pointed out that the numbers prove this, that concession isn't needed, because that is already built out. And one of the beautiful things about our business is how the tenants or how the TIs are recyclable. So we build something out first generation. It's very rare that we have to put a material amount of money into it the next time around. And given that it's probably got a large investment from a tenant, the first-generation tenant. We don't have to bump the rents much to make up for that additional investment, right, because we didn't make it. So it becomes a very valuable thing to a tenant to be able to move into something that's already built out. And so they aren't seeking the type of concessions that they are for new space. Now, it ties to what I said before, if you're in the -- a smaller set of space needs 25,000 square feet or less, you might have some options to find. But once you get above that, it becomes tougher to find existing space. So you might end up going more towards new development where you would see the concessions of higher TIs, but you're also paying higher rents. Tom Catherwood : Appreciate the color. Thanks everyone. Peter Moglia : Yeah. Thank you, Tom. Operator : The next question comes from Jamie Feldman of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Jamie Feldman : Great. Thanks for taking my question. So, if you look at your 2024 exploration schedule, the amount of expirations moving into redevelopment declined 13% in the supplemental from 41% when you initially gave guidance? Do you think that's a number that's going to continue to trend lower as the year moves on? Or is that more driven by dispositions? Maybe just talk about what changed and what may change going forward? Joel Marcus : Yeah. Marc, do you want to comment on that? Marc Binda : Yeah, sure. I think last quarter we -- or at least as of Investor Day, we did have the 219 East 42nd Street asset in there as something that we thought that we would redevelop or develop turned out that we've decided to sell that asset. Aside from that, it's been pretty consistent from the last quarter. I think a lot of those redevelopment assets are in great locations in places that we'd like to be. But certainly, as we go through our process to look at non-core assets. It's always possible that we find things in there that could potentially be sold. Jamie Feldman : Okay. Thanks for that. And then the $95 million to $125 million of investment gains that you plan to include in earnings, you said you took an impairment recently. I mean, what gives you conviction that you can hit those numbers? And do you think you'll see more impairments netting that out? Marc Binda : Yeah. We did have some impairments during the quarter here, Jamie. But I think when we look back over three years, we've averaged like $96 million over the last three years per year. And so over a longer period, when we look back, the impairments have been pretty modest relative to the size of those gains. So I think we're thinking about the things that Hallie mentioned upfront, just with some renewed excitement around M&A that we feel pretty comfortable with that number headed into next year. Jamie Feldman : So do you mean that you think you'll see some increase in values and take gains on that? Or based on where values are today, you still can deliver that $95 million to $125 million? Marc Binda : Yes. Hard to say where values go. Yes. No, I think we're talking about the values today. I think if you look on balance sheet, we've got something like north of $300 million of unrealized gains that we could tap. And part of it too, to be fair, a lot of it is outside of our control, whether it's an M&A event or an acquisition by big pharma or so forth. So some of it, it's hard to predict because these things kind of happen when they happen. Joel Marcus : But the fact that we've reiterated guidance here, I think Jamie should give you comfort that we think we can hit those numbers pretty comfortably. Otherwise, we wouldn't stick with it. Jamie Feldman : Okay. That make sense. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Carroll of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Michael Carroll : Yes, thanks. I believe you touched on this earlier, but I wanted to see if I can ask it a different way just regarding overall leasing activity. I know that some tenants have been delaying decisions just given the uncertain environment. I mean are there any examples of this starting to loosen up just given the prospect of interest rates that could continue to drop? I mean, is that activity or urgency for attendance? Is that starting to pick up here? Joel Marcus : Well, I think, again, if you go back to Hallie's comments and think about the different sectors, each sector is kind of driven by different issues when it comes to, say, big pharma or big cap bio, those are dependent upon their needs and not on the vicissitudes of the capital markets today or whatever. But then you contrast those to clinical stage biotech who are waiting to hit a clinical milestone or not, than those -- that's where -- and Peter has reemphasized this a number of times, boards want to be really careful not to get ahead of their skis. So it really depends on the sector that you're looking at. It's not a one-size shoe fits all, if you will. Michael Carroll : Okay. And then on the five projects that are scheduled to be stabilized in 2025, I mean, how are the leasing prospects on those specific buildings? And I know that we're still a year out from the expected stabilization. But when should we start to see leases getting signed those projects that are going to be done here in the next few quarters? Is that a good way to think about it? Joel Marcus : Yes. So maybe let's do this since we're doing fourth quarter and year-end 2023, let us and Peter Macken [ph] noted this, will specifically address that on our first quarter call, if you don't mind. Michael Carroll : Okay, great. Thanks, Joel. Joel Marcus : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our last question comes from Dylan Burzinski of Green Street. Please go ahead. Dylan Burzinski : Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. Peter, I just wanted to go back to one of the comments you made regarding one of the questions asked a little bit earlier on $200 a square foot for new development leases for TIs being the norm last year versus $300 a square foot today. Do you -- would you attribute that to solely the imbalance between supply and demand today? Or do you expect that to sort of be the new normal moving forward? Peter Moglia : I think it's the new normal going forward? I mean it's driven certainly by more competition in the market, but it's also driven by the higher cost to build out space that's been a considerable increase in construction costs as you guys all know, and I used to comment on. So that alone, I mean, the availability numbers will eventually resolve themselves, but the costs are what they are and the tenants are willing to invest in the space, but only to a certain degree. So, I think that, that that number is here to stay? Joel Marcus : Yes. And again, I think you have to distinguish different sectors have different tolerances for investing in space and they can be pretty dramatically different. And as Peter said, the structural inflation that we have brought on ourselves over the last number of years as a country and really as a world is pretty much here to stay. So -- and that's true across all real estate classes. Dylan Burzinski : Okay. I appreciate the details on that. And then one more on sort of the dispositions. You mentioned focusing on noncore noncampus like assets. Can you just talk about sort of typical buyer profile on who's in bidding tense when you go to market with those types of assets? Joel Marcus : Yes. I think we'd rather not get into that issue and just let it be at this moment. I don't think we want to discuss that on an earnings call. Sorry. Dylan Burzinski : Okay. That\u2019s all I had. Thanks, guys. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks. Joel Marcus : Thank you, everybody, and I look forward to our call for first quarter and again, safe and healthy new year. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Alexandria Real Estate Equities First Quarter 2024 Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Paula Schwartz with Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. Paula Schwartz : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now I would like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel. Joel Marcus : Thanks, Paul, and welcome, everybody to Alexandria's first quarter '24. With me today are Hallie, Peter and Marc. First of all, a thank you and congratulations to our ARE's family team for a very solid first quarter against a continuing tough macro with stubbornly high interest rates and continuing non-transitory inflation instigated by the federal governments really uncontrolled spending. In fact, our annual debt service now is greater than our defense budget crazy. Also huge congratulations to the entire team as Alexander has once again been named one of the most trustworthy companies in America by Newsweek, and nominated as such by our 3 constituencies, our customers, our investors and our employees. Guided by Alexandria's core values of integrity, mutual respect, egoless leadership, humility, transparency, teamwork and trust, we have established ourselves at the Vanguard in the heart of the $5 trillion secularly growing life science industry. We're very honored that Newsweek has again recognized us with this important award, which is a testament to company's values and to the trust that our tenants, investors and employees have in our one of a kind brand. And as we said before, as Jim Collins has said, Alexandria has achieved the 3 outputs that define a great company, superior results, distinctive impact and lasting endurance. We remain unwavering in our efforts to build upon these outputs and to continue to maintain our stellar reputation and the most trusted brand for life science real estate providing essential infrastructure enabling the development of new safe and effective medicines. Remember over 90% of diseases have yet to have addressable therapies or cures. Remember 2, the top causes of death in the United States remain cancer, heart disease and the third fentanyl and methamphetamine and that is a profoundly sad statement of fact. So my quick take on the first quarter, Alexandria is a one of a kind company with a great brand as I said, scale, dominance and our unique cluster strategy together with the fortress balance sheet. We've posted 7.6% year-over-year NOI growth which is I think very solid in this environment, 7.3% year-over-year FFO growth, 5% dividend growth and our collections 99.9%. We had a strong leasing quarter with solid leasing spreads and we continue strong occupancy despite recently acquired vacancy. We also posted very solid same store growth and also very solid guidance. We are particularly laser focused on leasing for the 2025 pipeline as well as redevelopment space to be delivered in 2025 and of course the leasing of vacant space in 2025, which is the fastest space to deliver to our growing tenants. And much like we did during the great financial crisis, we're pushing forward our pipeline because of the need for Alexandria's Labspace coupled with solid indicators of positive rebound for life sciences in 2024 which Hallie will address. Lease expirations for 2024 and 2025 on a combined basis are down as well as unresolved expirations for both 2024 and 2025 on a combined basis being down as well. Peter will talk about capital recycling, but for the quarter so far, we've had approximately $275 million of noncore assets sold or pending and we're about so that means we're about 20% through our targeted $1.4 billion of recycling of capital for our business for 2024, and we feel very comfortable where we are today. And then finally before I turn it over to Hallie, I mentioned in our last earnings call our decision to sell 219 East 42nd Street, New York City, the former Pfizer headquarters building ultimately for residential use. A very good decision reinforced by the continuing. My own view and competence of the State of New York and the City of New York in continuing to incentivize and foster empty one-off buildings for so called life science use while turning their backs on fundraising of startup companies, which is the heart and soul of the New York City life science ecosystem and which is so badly needed. There has been of all the regions no lab leasing in New York City in the first quarter whatsoever and yet the state and the city are proposing fostering more and encouraging more people to deliver space. We sit in a very good position with our campus, but nonetheless when you have local and state governments who are not mindful of using funding better spent on funding startups and also the health, welfare and safety of the citizens, that's very disconcerting. So with that I'm going to turn it over to Hallie for a number of important comments. Hallie? Hallie Kuhn : Thank you, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Hallie Kuhn, SVP of Life Science and Capital Markets. Today, I'm going to review the fundamentals of the $5 trillion secularly growing life science industry, what these fundamentals mean for the health of our diverse life science base, and how our tenant science dictates the need for Alexandria's Labspace infrastructure. In 2008, on the heels of the great financial crisis, the size of the public biopharma industry was around $2.5 trillion and approximately $11 billion in venture capital was invested in private life science companies. There was no cure for hepatitis C, obesity was considered too complex to ever treat with an effective therapy and gene and cell therapies were a hope not a reality. Today, the industry is valued at over $5 trillion venture capital is on pace to reach 4x the levels deployed in 2008. 600 additional novel therapies have been approved by the FDA and countless lives have been improved, extended and saved. Coming out of this bear cycle, albeit with stops and starts along the way, the life science industry is in a profoundly different place compared to previous cycles with a fundamentally strong framework to accelerate long-term growth of the industry and demand for Alexandria Labspace. With the long-term perspective as a backdrop, let's step through first quarter trends in the life science industry. First, with respect to life science venture investment, nearly $11 billion of deployed capital was announced in the first quarter and $100 million plus mega rounds accounted for 34 deals, the highest number in the last 8 quarters and any quarter prior to 2021. These trends bode well for demand from new and existing private biotechnology tenants, which account for 10% of our ARR. Moving on to our pre-commercial and commercial public biotech tenants, which represent 9% and 16% of our ARR respectively. Follow-on and PIPE financings achieved one of the highest quarters on record, totaling $15.5 billion of which one in every $4 was raised by an Alexandria tenant. This past week, long time Alexandria Tenant Intracellular Therapies announced clinical data for their first-in-class therapy lumateperone, for treatment of depression and went on to raise $500 million. The story here is that demand is milestone based and for companies that achieve their target milestones, typically clinical data, they have access to meaningful capital to accelerate their science and expand. Third, are our multinational our multinational pharmaceutical companies, which represent 20% ARR. M&A is a key headline for this segment. 2023 was a record for acquisitions and first quarter continued at a strong pace, eclipsing $40 billion in announced deals. This activity reflects large pharma strong balance sheets and pressure to expand their pipelines with innovative therapies to counter the over $200 billion in revenue at risk from patent expirations through 2030. M&A is a robust sign of the health of the industry and as capital is recycled back to investors and entrepreneurs, it will be redeployed into the next generation of life science companies. Last our life science products, service and device tenants, which represent 21% ARR. A trend we are watching closely is pressure from Congress to limit utilization of Chinese CDMOs under the proposed BIOSECURE Act. Whether or not the legislation passes, this is positive for our U.S. based CDMO tenants, which analysts expect to see a substantial increase in demand and will help ensure we maintain our national competitive edge in such a critical industry. Switching gears, let's put on our lab coats and examine how our tenants research dictates their lab requirements. Illustrating with a real world example, consider a private biotech Company developing precision oncology medicines that is expanding into 20,000 square feet. Working directly with Alexandria's in-house lab operations team, they placed 328 pieces of equipment in the lab ranging from bench top centrifuges to freezers, cryo tanks, DNA sequencers and advanced microscopes. 10 pieces of equipment, including negative 80 degree freezers, require emergency power as it is critical this equipment operates 24x7 to ensure hundreds of thousands of dollars of experimental samples are safeguarded. Now where this equipment is placed is not based simply on the square footage required, but the process flow of their experiments. A single cell biologist utilizes equipment spanning multiple benches, chemical fume hoods, tissue culture suites and microscopy rooms. Beyond that, she moves back and forth through the lab and adjacent non-technical space, conference rooms and communal kitchen throughout the day. Labspace cannot be equated to traditional office steps dictated solely by the number of workers, but is more tend to a data center where the space needs are driven by the physical equipment. While highly trained scientific talent is required to oversee the science, it's the scientific workflow and instrumentation used that dictates the lab footprint. On a related topic, given the immense volume and complexity a data require to inform AI algorithm. Many AI centric tenants have heavy equipment needs that require significant laboratory footprint. A great example is South San Francisco based tenant, insitro with whom we announced a significant early extension this quarter. AI is an amazing tool, but the laboratory is still the workbench. So circling back to where we began, in the past 15 years the Life Science industry has doubled in size, along the way improving countless lives. Projecting 15 years into the future, the growth trajectory of this industry is massive as companies work to cure diseases such as Alzheimer's, autoimmune disease, and the nearly 7,000 rare diseases that affect 1 in 10 Americans. As a trusted partner to the world's leading life science companies, our job is to safeguard our tenants' mission critical research and support and catalyze discoveries that will shape the future of medicine. With that, I will pass it to Peter. Peter Moglia : Thanks, Hallie. I know myself, family and friends benefited from innovation that has occurred since 2008. So appreciate the context you just gave us. I'm going to go ahead and discuss our development pipeline leasing supply and asset sales, and then I'll hand it over to Marc. In the first quarter, we delivered 343,445 square feet into our high barrier to entry submarkets covering 5 projects. The annual incremental NOI delivered during the quarter aggregated to $26 million. Development and redevelopment leasing during the quarter was approximately 100,000 square feet. In addition to the executed leases, we signed 162,000 square feet of LOIs during the quarter which will see future development and redevelopment pipeline leasing. Base leased or under negotiation in our current and near-term projects under construction increased by 3% over last quarter to 63% and projects delivering in 2024 and 2025 are 80% leased. From the second quarter of 2024 through the end of 2027, we expect to deliver approximately $480 million of stabilized NOI from the current pipeline. Transitioning to leasing and supply, as we noted last quarter, the bottom of demand was reached during the first half of 2023 and it continues to incrementally recover in our core markets. We expect that the lack of funding activity in early 2023 will continue to be an overhang to full recovery for a quarter or two, but we have strong conviction that a recovery will be achieved in the near-term given the key fundamentals Hallie outlined. Alexandria is well-positioned to weather these storms given the moat enduring competitive advantages we continue to widen and build. We leased 1,142,857 square feet during the first quarter, consistent with our pre-pandemic velocity. GAAP and cash rental rate increases were extraordinarily strong at 33% and 19% respectively and the related tenant improvements and leasing commissions trended down 16% compared to our 2023 leasing costs. Our teams continue to closely track competitive supply building by building in our proprietary databases. As noted in last quarter's call, we expect 2024 to be the peak year for new deliveries and then begin to dissipate in 2025. In Greater Boston, unleased competitive supply estimated to be delivered in 2024 decreased significantly from 7% of market inventory in the fourth quarter to 1.6% due to 3.3 million square feet of competitive projects delivering in the first quarter. Approximately 1.17 million square feet of those projects were moved from an estimated 2023 delivery to a 2024 delivery last quarter. The unreleased delivered space is reflected in the direct vacancy numbers I'm going to present. In 2025, the unleased competitive supply in Greater Boston will increase market inventory by another 2% which is an expected slowdown from the 2024 levels. In San Francisco Bay, unleased competitive supply estimated to be delivered in 2024 is 9.6% of market inventory which is a 1.1% decrease driven mostly by reclassifying a 0.5 million square foot project from a 2024 to 2025 delivery due to a temporary delay in construction. In 2025, the unleased competitive supply in San Francisco will increase market inventory by 3.7%, a 1.5% increase over last quarter due to that reclassification. In San Diego, unleased competitive supply estimated to be delivered in 2024 is 5.1% of market inventory, a 1.6% decrease from last quarter due to moving 2 projects from an estimated 24 delivery to 2025. In 2025, the unleased competitive supply will increase market inventory by another 3.8%, a 1.1% increase due to that reclassification, but offset somewhat due to first quarter leasing at those projects. To update you on direct and sublease vacancy, direct vacancy in Greater Boston is up 593 basis points to 12.98% due to the previously mentioned 1Q '24 deliveries. It has climbed more moderately in San Francisco up 175 basis points to 14.11% propelled by 147,000 square foot spec delivery in San Carlos. In San Diego, direct vacancy increased by 244 basis points to 10.41% driven primarily by the inclusion of space not vacant today, but now known will be vacant soon. Sublease vacancy decreased in Greater Boston by about 3 quarters of a percent to 5.17% increased in San Francisco Bay by 0.5% to 6.28% and increased by a third of a percent in San Diego to 5.7%. Again, 2024 is the peak year of disruption from supply. Alexandria is studying 94.6% occupancy is another data point supporting the effectiveness of our wide moat and enduring competitive advantages. I'll conclude with an update on our value harvesting asset recycling program. After a busy quarter four 2023 schedule where we closed on $439 million in asset sales marketed and negotiated throughout the year, we spent the first quarter priming our disposition and partial interest sales pipeline for what will likely be a closing schedule heavily weighted towards the third and four quarters. Early progress is reflected in pending transactions subject to letters of intent or purchase and sale agreement negotiations of $258.1 million and there are a number of other ongoing active sales efforts. Buyers of noncore assets are generally private equity, family office, local operators and institutionally backed real estate partnerships looking to diversify their asset mix with life science real estate. During the quarter, we closed on assets totaling $17.2 million inclusive of 99 A Street in the Seaport, which executive management deemed to no longer be strategic due to its one off profile and our pivot to 285, 299, 307, 347 Dorchester Avenue acquired during the quarter, which is nearby with similar red line access, but has the scale to be a future mega campus. We remain committed to our self-funding strategy and our offerings remain attractive to investors looking for exposure to life science real estate given the promising outlook for the industry how we presented despite near-term supply challenges. With that, I'll pass it over to Marc. Marc Binda : Thank you, Peter. This is Marc Binda, CFO. Hello, and good afternoon, everyone. We reported very strong operating and financial results for the first quarter and our team is off to a great start to 2024. Total revenues and NOI for 1Q 2024 was up 9.7% and 11.5% respectively over 1Q '23, primarily driven by solid same property performance and continued execution of our development and redevelopment strategy. FFO per share diluted as adjusted for the quarter was $2.35 up 7.3% over 1Q '23 and was ahead of consensus. We also reiterated the midpoint of our full year 2024 guidance for FFO per share diluted as adjusted of $9.47 which is up 5.6% over 2023. Our solid operating results for the quarter were driven by our disciplined execution of our mega campus strategy, tremendous scale and our differentiated business. Our tenants continue to appreciate our brand, collaborative mega campuses and operational excellence by our team. 74% of our annual rental revenue comes from our collaborative mega campuses. We have high quality cash flows from 52% of our annual rental revenue from investment grade or publicly traded large cap tenants. Collections remain very high at 99.9% and adjusted EBITDA margins were very strong at 72%. Leasing volume in the first quarter was strong at 1.1 million square feet for the quarter, which is up 30% over the average of the last two quarters and consistent with our historical quarterly average period from 2013 to 2020. We continue to benefit from our tremendous scale, high quality tenant roster and brand loyalty with 77% of our leasing activity over the last 12 months coming from existing deep tenant relationships. Rental rate growth for lease renewals and releasing space in 1Q '24 was strong at 33% and 19% on a cash basis. Our outlook for rental rate growth for the full year 2024 remains solid at 11% to 19% and 5% to 13% on a cash basis. And reflects our view that given the relatively small amount included the renewals of releasing from any particular quarter compared to the full year and the mix of lease expirations in any particular quarter, we do expect some variation in rental rate growth from quarter to quarter. The overall mark-to-market for cash rental rates for our entire portfolio remains very solid at 14%, which is unchanged from the prior quarter, which is impressive given the strong realized rental rate growth experienced in the first quarter. Our nonrevenue enhancing expenditures, including TIs on second generation space, have averaged 15% of net operating income over the last 5 years and are expected to be below that in the 12% to 13% range in 2024, which really highlights the durable nature of our laboratory infrastructure. Same property NOI growth for 1Q 2024 was solid at 1% and 4.2% on a cash basis, driven by strong rental rate growth and leasing volume. Our outlook for full year same property growth was unchanged since our last update at 1.5% and 4% on a cash basis at the midpoint. Occupancy for the quarter was solid at 94.6%, which is consistent with the prior quarter. And during the quarter, we continued to execute on our development and redevelopment strategy by delivering 343,445 square feet from the pipeline, which will generate $26 million of incremental annual net operating income. We also expect to see significant future growth in incremental annual net operating income on a cash basis of $101 million from executed leases as the initial free rent from recent deliveries burns off over the next 7 months on a weighted average basis. As a reminder, this contractual increase in cash flows will have a significant positive impact on NAV as these projects were previously delivered and no longer sit in CIP at the end of 1Q '24. As Peter highlighted, we have $5.5 million rentable square feet of development and redevelopment projects that are projected to generate $480 million of incremental annual net operating income over the next 4 years, including 2.1 million square feet delivering through 2025 that are 81% leased negotiating and are expected to generate $229 million of additional net operating income. With projects committed and/or under construction and expected to generate significant NOI over the next few years, coupled with our future pipeline projects in preconstruction, we have the ability to grow our already large operating base of 42 million square feet by 78% over time. With significant construction activities as well as important pre construction activities adding value and focused on reducing the time from lease execution to delivery, we're required to capitalize a significant portion of our gross interest cost. Last year, we saw a peak in capitalized interest in the quarter preceding our record deliveries in the fourth quarter of 2023, which generated $265 million of incremental annual net operating income. These record deliveries have driven a decline in the average real estate basis subject to capitalization of $1.3 billion or 14% from all of 2023 on average to 1Q '24. Capitalized interest as a percentage of gross interest has similarly declined from 83% for the entire year of 2023 to 67% for 1Q '24. In addition, capitalized interest has had an overall decline for 2 consecutive quarters coming off the peak of 3Q '22. Our outlook for capitalized interest for 2024 is consistent with our previous guidance and continues to assume a double-digit decline in average basis subject to capitalization for the full year ended 2024 compared to 2023. Transitioning to the balance sheet, we continue to have one of the strongest balance sheets amongst all publicly traded U.S. REITs. Our corporate credit ratings rank in the top 10% of all publicly traded U.S. REITs. Our leverage continues to remain low at 5.2 times for net debt to adjusted EBITDA on a quarterly annualized basis. We have tremendous liquidity of $6 billion fixed rate debt comprising 98.9% of our total debt and a weighted average remaining debt term of 13.4 years. In addition, nearly a third of our total debt has at least 25 years remaining to maturity with a very advantageous blended rate of 3.86%. We remain disciplined with our strategy for long-term funding of our business with a focus on maximizing bottom-line growth, maintaining our fortress balance sheet and recycling capital from dispositions and partial interest sales to minimize the issuance of common stock. We're very pleased with the execution of our bond deal, which we completed during the quarter aggregating $1 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 5.48% and a weighted average maturity of 23.1 years. Similar to the self-funding strategy that we executed in 2023, we expect to recycle capital into our highly leased development and redevelopment pipeline through outright dispositions and partial interest sales primarily focused on assets not integral to our mega campus strategy allowing us to enhance the quality of our asset base. As Peter mentioned, we completed $17 million dispositions during the quarter. We have $258 million of pending transactions at various levels of negotiation and we have a significant amount of additional target dispositions and partial interest sales that we're working on beyond that. Based on our current outlook, we expect our asset recycling program to be more heavily weighted towards outright dispositions of noncore assets rather than partial interest sales. I'll turn to the dividends. We also expect to continue to fund a meaningful amount of our equity needs with retained cash flows from operating activities after dividends of $450 million at the midpoint for 2024 or an estimated $2.1 billion for the 5-year period through 2024. And our high quality cash flows continue to support the growth in our annual common stock dividends with an average annual increase in dividends per share of 5% since 2020 and we continue to have a very conservative FFO payout ratio of 54% in the first quarter. Realized gains from the venture investments included in FFO per share as adjusted for the quarter were $28.8 million relatively consistent with our historical average of $24 million per quarter going back to 2021. Gross unrealized gains in our venture investment portfolio as of 1Q '24 were $320 million on a cost basis of just under $1.2 billion. We have updated our guidance as I mentioned for '24 for EPS of $3.60 to $3.72 and we tightened the range for FFO per share diluted as adjusted to $9.41 to $9.53 with no change to the midpoint of $9.47 which represents a solid 5.6% growth in FFO per share for 2024. With that, let me turn it back to Joel. Joel Marcus : So operator, let's go to Q&A kindly. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Josh Dennerlein : Peter, just wanted to follow-up on your question or your comments on asset recycling. Could you just kind of provide more color on it sounds like you're pausing or relooking at what you're selling, so maybe there's a little bit slowing activity near-term? I guess just what's driving that and how is the potential pool changing? Peter Moglia : Yes, I think you misinterpreted my comments. There's no pause. I was just trying to point out that, we tend to close a lot of our sales in the latter half of the year like we did last year. And because we spend a lot of time in the first quarter teeing up things after a busy fourth quarter. So, yes, no pause, activity remains brisk. Josh Dennerlein : Okay. Because I think if I'm not mistaken it looks like what you had pending versus 4Q or under like letter of intent versus like today, it looks like it fell a bit. Is that just is there anything fallout? Peter Moglia : It's about 20% of our goal which again given how we're heavily weighted towards 3Q and 4Q I think is on target. Josh Dennerlein : Then Marc just wanted to follow-up on your comment on leasing spreads in 1Q and just it sounds like there's a slowing for the rest of the year on rental rate increases. Just kind of curious how we should think about the cadence through the rest of the year? Marc Binda : Yes. I mean, it really depends market by market, lease by lease that we renew in each particular quarter. So there can definitely be some variation to quarter-to-quarter. Q1 was very strong. We're really pleased with that. And I think the year is strong. We still feel good about the guidance we gave for both GAAP and cash rental rate increases for the year. Operator : The next question will come from Michael Griffin with Citi. Michael Griffin : Peter, I want to go back to your comments just around the competitive supply set. You've noted that a number of properties I think have been pushed out a couple of years in the development pipeline. I guess what gives you confidence that we're nearing the peak of this supply picture and we're not sitting here a year from now and seeing a lot of those projects get the can kicked down the road and spy picture is still pretty challenged? Joel Marcus : Yes, so this is Joel. I'll let Peter answer that. But I think the words you used are pretty inaccurate. One project in San Diego was moved to the following year, not kicked down several years of the can because there is a very substantial credit tenant lease they're working on that makes it more complex to deliver the space as we originally intended. So I think your thinking is not like the federal government not getting a budget and just kicking it down that's not what's going on here. Peter? Peter Moglia : Yes. I think Michael was also referring just to the general market data that I was talking about. There were probably I think 3 to 4 projects within the 3 markets that I comment on that got moved and that is something fairly normal because of course, what Joel mentioned was one of our own projects that got moved, but we're tracking all projects that we believe is are competitive. And as the data comes in from the brokerage community and from our own observations at times something that was supposed to or we thought would deliver in 1 year gets kicked quarter or 2 and puts it into the next year. So that's just the nature of data. But yes, we do, we are fairly confident that we're not going to see too much more after 2025 frankly because we're not seeing anything else start right now or limited I think maybe one project started in San Diego in the third quarter of 2023, but nothing of material that's material that we've noticed has started since then. So that would put us in a pretty good position after '25 to get to a very normalized delivery run. Michael Griffin : That makes sense and appreciate the clarification there, Joel. And then just on the leasing environment, specifically as it pertains to the development pipeline. Would you have to give up more in concessions in order for tenants to sign leases or would you rather leave some vacancy in those developments with a go at or after stabilization in order to potentially get better rents if the environment improves? Joel Marcus : Yes, it doesn't quite work that way. That's kind of how it works in the rest of real estate. But as Hallie said, demand in this sector as you can see over many years is event driven. So it's not so much a rental rate or a concession per se. It's the key location for recruitment of talent, the ability to grow or need space immediately based on a major clinical milestone that's either made financing possible or just scale up possible. So those are the things that tend to be the most important, which is space for delivery. And the market will be the market, but that's not the concessions or things like that are not driving people's decisions. It doesn't work that way. Operator : The next question will come from Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Vikram Malhotra : I guess just you sort of painted a picture where things are on track, spreads better etcetera. So I guess, Marc, I'm just wondering why adjust the guide, the FFO guide early on especially the top end of the guide given what you just outlined as likely a good start? Marc Binda : Yes, I mean, I think we're on track. It's not unusual for us as we get out as we kind of get through the year to shrink the range as we get more and more comfortable. So we shrunk the top end and the bottom end with no change to the midpoint of our guidance. So I think we still feel good about very solid growth this year of 5.6% over 2023. Joel Marcus : Yes. And that's been pretty consistent as Vikram, how we've done it year-by-year, year-over-year. Vikram Malhotra : Okay, fair enough. Joel Marcus : And remember, this is one of those years where you've got macro at home, you've got geopolitical issues and then you've got an election. So we wanted to be conservative about what we're doing here. Vikram Malhotra : Makes sense. I think there were a bunch of shorter term renewals or I guess extensions into '25, because we did see the '25 overall move up. And I'm just wondering like what sort of what was the nature of those discussions? Is it kind of tenants are uncertain about space needs or what drove those relatively higher volume of short-term renewals? Joel Marcus : Well, short-term renewals often happen. Remember what I just said to Michael, in this industry people are waiting for data that Hallie said and if you've got a clinical trial data or some important catalyst that's going to drive the business hopefully positively, but could be negatively. And that's coming up. You want to ensure that you're kind of preserving your strategic optionality as much as possible and that's why people want to kind of keep where they are until they know what do we need and where are we going. So that's very typical of this industry over many years. Vikram Malhotra : And just one more I can just slip in. I think there was a comment about '24 being sort of the bottom or at least your trajectory seems to be in recovery from here on into '25. I'm wondering if you can just elaborate on that. Is it demand? Is it what parameters or factors are you seeing that give you confidence in this demand recovery into 2025? Joel Marcus : Yes. So, Hallie, do you want to maybe just comment again? Hallie Kuhn : As I walked through in the data across our different segments, just remember that we have a very diverse set of different tenant demands ranging from small private biotechs, public biotechs, large pharma institutions, life science tools product devices. So each of those you have to look at differently. But across each one of those, we are seeing strength. And again, we are coming down off 2021, but still quite strong compared to any year previously. So, venture capital continues to be at a very robust pace. Mega rounds, which are a great indicator of what will be near-term demand drivers, oftentimes just in time space, have really picked up with 34, just this quarter. On the public biotech side, follow on financing, very strong historic quarter, but also IPOs, the window is opening slightly. We'll see how that trend continues over the rest of the year. And then pharma demand, we continue to see a number of very large requirements across our regions, very much driven by the need to be able to recruit the best talent and ensure that they can innovate for years to come. So I think across each of our segments, we're seeing continued strength in the backdrop of, of course some challenging macro markets. Operator : Your next question will come from Rich Anderson with Wedbush. Rich Anderson : Peter, what's the tail of supply? And by that I mean, okay, let's say we peak in deliveries this year, but there's that doesn't just shut off the light switch and you're off to the races or shut up turn on the light switch. There's a period of time where there's free rent to burn from your competition and that impacts your ability to operate nearby facilities perhaps. I'm wondering is it a year lag where you could really start to see cash flow rolling again for Alexandria or is it shorter or is it longer? I'm just curious, yes, maybe we're getting to a point where we're peaking on deliveries, but then when do we start peaking or get back up and running on a cash flow basis for the company? Peter Moglia : Yes, I mean, it's a great question, Rich. It's a crystal ball question, but I mean the way I think about it. Rich Anderson : You got a crystal ball. Peter Moglia : The way I think about it is, I look at what Hallie is talking about with demand and to kind of add on to what her last comments were, we saw a decrease relative decrease in funding during 2023 and there's a lag effect for that to take place and that's one of the reasons why we think 2024 is going to be the kind of the bottom to use the crystal ball and it's going to accelerate from here because of all the investment that Hallie pointed out that's going on today is going to create demand. So the tail of the supply is going to be a direct correlation to how much demand there is to take it up and we think that that demand is going to be strong therefore the tail won't be that long. But we'll see, as I said, we're going to see some significant additions to the market in 2024 and then roughly half of what we're seeing in 2024 and 2025 and then virtually hopefully 0 to very little in 2026 probably just things that get delayed in 2025 bleed into '26. But we'll be, that'll be coming into a market that is strengthening as more demand appears because of the funding. Rich Anderson : Yes, fair enough. And then as it relates to you guys using that those observations that you just made, would we expect you to continue on your kind of existing pace of development starts funded primarily through dispositions? Or do you feel the need to maybe slow it down a little bit on the view that disposition funding is not a forever strategy? Assuming the stock stays where it is, hopefully not, but let's say everything I'll hold everything else constant or starts down next year up to meet the demand. What do you think from Alexandria's lens? Joel Marcus : Yes. So maybe, Rich, let me just say this. I think you've seen us kind of like we did in the great financial crisis once the rocket ship of COVID started to come back to earth rather rapidly, February of '21 is when it started. Certainly over the last couple of years and certainly into this year, we've been I think profoundly disciplined in thinking about, we've certainly stopped a number of projects. We've restarted 1 or 2 here or there based on leasing volume, but we've been very, very disciplined about what we would start. So there is not a volume throughput or some kind of a need to do that. We have right now, as you know, a pretty decent pipeline that's relatively well leased and our goal is to meet the needs of growing tenants and that's what really dictates our decision to start projects or convert space or try to move people into vacant space that's available and quickly operational. So those are the things that we're really focused on and it's really judged by demand and then against the backdrop of cost of capital and yield and things like that which Peter has given pretty over many quarters pretty great detail on. Operator : The next question will come from Wes Golladay with Baird. Wes Golladay : Hey everyone. Looks like the first quarter is off to a good start with same store NOI growth. I believe the expectation was for the growth to be back half weighted. Is that still the case? Marc Binda : Yes. Hi, Wes. This is Marc. Yes, I think last quarter, we did believe that the second half of the year would have some acceleration. I think our view is that the second half will be strong to in line with guidance right now. And I think to be fair, I think the first quarter came in pretty strong. So I think second half, we expect to be strong. Wes Golladay : Okay. And then you mentioned potential demand drivers, CDMO, AI, is this going to move the needle this year, is it more of a \u201825, \u201826, \u201827 type driver? Joel Marcus : Yes. So Hallie, you could kind of comment on that. I think that's ongoing frankly, but. Hallie Kuhn : Sure. Yes. I think these are really popular topics, right? We don't go more than half an hour without getting a question on AI and the BIOSECURE Act and certainly on the regulatory front has been front and center. Yes, I think these are pieces of a kind of large pool of different types of demand that we see across our spectrum of tenants. But certainly, we have a number of tenants insitro we mentioned, and a number of others in our portfolio that do have significant lab requirements given the large data generation. And then for CDMOs and how that relates to demand going forward, these things happen in the order of years, not months. But certainly, I think it's a positive trend for the industry overall with respect to ensuring that this industry remains certainly what we would consider a national, really important for our national security for development of drugs. So two things that we're watching closely, but I wouldn't say are going to be the things that are pushing the industry overall, just two pieces of it. Operator : Your next question will come from Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Tom Catherwood : Peter, maybe moving over to leasing activity this quarter, costs were down pretty materially, yet obviously the unleased new supply continues to deliver as you detailed. How is this new supply competing with the expiring leases in your operating portfolio? Peter Moglia : I don't think it's competing very well at all. And that's illustrated by our occupancy and the cash and GAAP rent spreads that we reported today. I mean, we've been saying for a long time that our brand and platform of mega campuses means a lot to our tenants and I think it's just proving out. Remember a lot of the supply is one off in tertiary markets and it's the type of profile that things get super tight in areas like Cambridge or Torrey Pines or South Lake Union, in Seattle, they might catch a bid just like tertiary markets and office would when there'd be spikes in office demand. But for now nothing is really moving outside handful of leases here and there outside of what we're doing. Because as we say all the time, if Alexandria has space available that fits what the tenants need are 90%+ of time, they're going to come to us because we know what we're doing. We can scale them. We have operational excellence, and I say this all the time, no one's going to get fired, for picking an Alexandria building. You might get fired for picking a building from someone who has no idea what they're doing. Tom Catherwood : Actually that kind of feeds into the next question which is and this is probably another crystal ball question here, but if we take a step back and think more broadly on the unleased competitive supply and your comments on secondary markets and secondary operators. How do you think distress could play out in the life science real estate market, if at all and does that present a potential opportunity for Alexandria? Peter Moglia : Yes, it's a great question. We get asked, my first reaction is always well, gosh, if we weren't there by now, it wasn't a priority. I believe they'll probably be some opportunities that we will look at in the future. If we put our brand on the building and people know we're operating it even if it's in a newer market, it can be successful. A great illustration of that is what we did in the Fenway. We came in there, it was an unproven market. The 201 Brookline asset that we bought was about 17% leased. We come in, put our brand on it, put our knowhow into it and within I think 3 quarters it was fully stabilized. That said that was a submarket that we knew was going to be had a lot of the fundamentals that make a good submarkets. Some of these areas that the supply is in today, I don't see the same profile. So probably a tougher decision down the road. But what happens to those buildings, I think a lot of them will become office buildings. Frankly, offices certainly not dead, probably office that was built in the \u201860s and \u201870s and even the \u201880s might have to go away because it's functional obsolete. But if you built a new lab building and you couldn't lease it as lab, it's probably going to be a pretty good office building. But again crystal ball, that's just my opinion. Operator : The next question will come from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan. Anthony Paolone : I guess first question is your development yields seem to have been around 7% for a number of years at this point. And Joel, you mentioned interest rates being stubbornly high. But if this is the rate environment on a go forward basis. Is that 7% is that an appropriate level for you all to continue with the program or and maybe you've just been over earning on spread in prior years or does that number have to go up? Like how do you think about that? Joel Marcus : Yes. So, Peter, thoughts? Peter Moglia : Yes. Look, Tony, I think you really have to look Joel laid out what creates opportunities that we may capitalize on, but we are going to be looking obviously at cost of capital. We can't make decisions though on what we think or what the cost of capital is today. We absolutely take a longer look. So as an analyst, you would look at the internal rate of return that you will get on a development because you know that if you believe that fundamentals are going to improve over time, you could do something with a 6 yield today, a 7 yield today. But as cap rates adjust, as rental growth adjust, you look out 10 years and you get an IRR that's above your weighted average cost of capital today. And then you have confidence to go forward. So I know it's real easy to just look at initial yield and we publish that because it's an interesting topic to everybody and rightly so. But in challenging times like this, you really have to take a longer view because you don't want to miss on opportunity that would be very strategic and excellent for your shareholders over the long run. And that's what we're trying to do. Anthony Paolone : Okay. And then just on the funding side of that then, you talked about just the preference for dispositions versus stake sales. But just what about your comment at this point? I mean is that completely off the table or similar type discussion where it could make sense depending on what's teed up. Joel Marcus : Yes. So Tony, as we've said, our guidance assumes no equity, same was true in 2023 to remind everybody. And our focus is on as sources of capital to fund our business on the noncore assets outside of the mega campus. But obviously you reevaluate that on an ongoing basis just like we have in past practice. Anthony Paolone : And then if I could just sneak one more in for Peter since you got your crystal ball out. If you kind of look forward to, I guess, maybe next year when you're past this whole wave of supply that you outlined. What do you think happens to market rents between now and then, and not just base, but just totality of lease economics? Peter Moglia : Yes. Like we're anticipating a very flat environment. Opportunities that Alexandria can provide in a mega campus are likely going to perform much better, materially better than some of the supply that's going to be delivered. But certainly supply is going to weigh on rents and, but we don't necessarily see a retrenchment outside of certainly levels that were hit in 2021 and 2022 are going to be back we're going to back off from that. But the area the rental areas of '17, '18, '19 that our submarkets were in, I'm certain will be the bottom and it'll grow from there. Operator : Your next question will come from Jim Kammert with Evercore. Jim Kammert : Joel, certainly appreciate your comments that demand can be more event driven for the lab business, which is understandable. But is it possible for the team to provide just a little bit more context or quantification regarding your tenant interest in your development and redevelopment pipeline today, say, versus 90 to 180 days ago? And when I say context, I'm thinking the number of tenants you're holding discussions with, the range of space requirements they might be seeking and maybe the timetables for making decisions, just trying to get some more comfort into the visibility of the lease up? Joel Marcus : I don't think we would want to be that transparent given the competitive nature of what we're doing these days. I'm not sure that would serve our interest or even our tenants interest. In fact, they may not want us to be talking about something like that in advance. So I'd be pretty wary of that kind of thing. I think that what is happening is and Peter I think has talked about this, we kind of hit a low in '23 certainly after the Silicon Valley Bank episode and some of the market shutters and so forth. But I think as Hallie has presented, the market since October is really solidified and more money was flowing or is flowing into the sector. And I think that's really a better benchmark and certainly as companies hit milestones as Hallie mentioned intracellular hitting a critical, critical very high quality milestone and was able to do. I think their last financing and then they turned profitable. So that's kind of how we look at it. I think anything more of a NORAD early warning system probably wouldn't be in our best interest. I apologize for that. Operator : The next question will come from Dylan Burzinski with Green Street. Dylan Burzinski : Hi, guys. Just going back to sort of the development yields coming down versus historical levels, I guess just given as you guys think about things from a holistic capital allocation approach, how do you weigh sort of starting in development at a low 6% cap rate versus sort of going out and buying in the open market or buying assets, I guess, I should say. Is it simply maybe you guys are willing to sort of accept that lower yield today because a lot of these developments are sort of an extension of the Mega Canvas strategy or is there something else? Joel Marcus : Yes. No, I think that's a really I'll ask Peter to comment, but I think that the last point you raised is really the point. The mega campuses provide, I mean we were first mover, we have by and large in almost every market, I can't think of any market where we don't have really best locations. And if somebody wants to grow and grow on your campus that's going to be a lot better for the long-term growth and health of the campus and the company as opposed to somebody who wants to go into a one off building somewhere. That's just even if the yield is potentially higher, I don't think so. And remember too with 3% plus bumps each year, the ending rental value on certainly development 10, 15, 20 year leases is pretty substantial. But Peter? Peter Moglia : Yes. Hey, John. I just I'm not just me, but the team is not necessarily seeing anything we'd want to buy. Again, as I make the commentary about supply, most of what probably will be available to buy is not in the areas that we're interested in today. I'm not saying we're not never say never that an area might not become interesting in the future. And as I said, we could put our brand on it and make it work. But the opportunities that we will be talking about in the future and I'd say the near future are going to be on our mega campuses because of all the things that we talk about with the scale and the vibrancy our tenants and tenants that are not ours but want to be ours notice and understand the value. And so it's going to make the, it's just going to make more sense long-term for us to put them on these campuses rather than buy a one off building and put someone in there and end up wondering in the future why we did that because it doesn't really match our model. Operator : The next question will come from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll : I wanted to circle back on overall leasing activity. It sounds like trends are improving over the past few quarters. But does the recent push out in interest rate cuts, does that impact, I guess, tenants' ability to raise capital at all or does that delay their decisions or ability to make these types of decisions? Joel Marcus : No. And you can just look at what's happened as Hallie outlined in the first quarter, Michael, again event driven, it's not a direct correlation to economic environment or interest rates that just how this sector in industry kind of walks the walk. And it's not totally shielded by that, because if there was to be some, I mean imagine if China decided to invade Taiwan, the market seized and rates spiked in some crazy fashion or something obviously that would have an immediate impact on everybody. But I think no not the deferral isn't going to change if somebody hits a great milestone they're going to be able to finance. Now maybe there might be a higher concession on the underwriting or the overnight or whatever method they choose. But that's a rather infinitesimal cost to capital issue for companies. Michael Carroll : Okay. I mean do tenants make decisions on expanding into 2 new areas of research based off of their ability to raise capital so like they\u2019re and I think correct me if I am wrong\u2026 Joel Marcus : Of course. And most of that is done at the venture level. And so when somebody is pioneering a new area venture and not so much the publicly traded markets. But once you get into the clinic then if you are fortunate enough to get public then the public markets kind of take hold of that. Hallie Kuhn : Yes. And just to this is Hallie, just one addition. Recall that with venture firms, they're sitting on a lot of dry powder, that is already committed capital that they can call on and there's a number of larger funds that we're talking to that are raising, closing multibillion dollar funds. So they are sitting on capital that's ready to deploy. They are not dependent in the same way that a public company is on the interest rate. Michael Carroll : And then just last one for me. I know there has been discussions where, the Board as some of these tenants have been making like veto decisions if companies can lease space or not. I mean is that are the boards loosening up? Are they willing to make these decisions now? Joel Marcus : Well, I think historically, boards have had very careful oversight. I think unfortunately, when the markets become very frothy, boards get a little bit lazy and not as astute or disciplined in what they do. But I think you can be certain today, boards are very disciplined and it's been that way now for a handful of years. So I don't think anything's changing in that regard. I mean the answer is, if somebody needs space to scale and grow because they hit a key milestone or they've turned profitable or whatever it happens to be, those are high quality decisions, because the cost of space for most of these companies is a fairly nominal amount of their overall cost of doing business. Operator : Next question will come from Omotayo Okusanya with Deutsche Bank. Omotayo Okusanya : I appreciate all the comments around supply and also development. If you could go back to this crystal ball type scenario, curious if you'd be willing to offer up when you think you might be able to start a new development? And then what potential market could that be given the demand supply dynamics you see in each of your key major markets and on your mega campuses? Joel Marcus : Yes. I don't think we would announce such a thing on an earnings call willy-nilly. It's based on tenant demand, of course. Omotayo Okusanya : But are markets getting better? Are you seeing like more demand suggests that could happen sooner rather than later? Joel Marcus : Well, I think based on the questions that have been raised on the call right now and Hallie's commentary, I think we've said since October, the market certainly have gotten better, yes. Operator : This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Joel Marcus for any closing remarks. Please go ahead. Joel Marcus : Yes. Thank you, everybody. Just remember May is Mental Health Month and we'll be very focused on that with our efforts on a number of corporate social fronts. So be safe. Take care. God bless. Thank you. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today\u2019s event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz. Please go ahead. Paula Schwartz : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company\u2019s actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company\u2019s periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel. Joel S. Marcus: Thank you, Paula, and welcome, everybody. With me today are Hallie, Peter and Marc, and we welcome you to our second quarter earnings call. And, thank you and congratulations to the Alexandria family team for another very solid second quarter operating and financial performance given the continuing uncertainty of the backdrop as soaring U.S. debt and government spending problems continue pretty much unabated. And, in thinking about our daily efforts, we all think about the Navy SEAL credo, The Only Easy Day Was Yesterday. Also, huge congrats to our team on the June 2024 release of our corporate responsibility report, which reinforces our longstanding operational excellence across our one of a kind Labspace platform and to the team for securing 100% of the electricity needs with renewable energy for 100% of our Alexandria paid accounts in our Greater Boston cluster market, a phenomenal achievement. Thank you, team. And, thinking about long-term strategic thinking since the bull market of the life science industry turned in February of 2021, I would say the market moved from a historical long bull run to a bear market in, as I said, February of 2021 and we\u2019ve worked every single day to re-engineer and fine tune our long-term competitive advantages of this one of a kind leading Labspace platform. Our goal is much like it was, but very different given the facts of course, after the 2008, 2009 great financial crisis and the bear market aftermath to position ourselves to come out of this sector bear market with the acumen and business strategy really to enable our life science industry and tenant growth much as we led the long historical bull market 2014 to 2021 with record breaking earnings growth for our sector. So, in thinking about our competitive advantages, and what we choose to really emphasize. I think most importantly, our first mover advantage in the top life science clusters, we continue to refine and refocus our footprint, and you see that by our actions quarterly. Our high quality assets aggregated in desirable and well-amenitized mega campuses, we continue this monumental effort really driven to and by our re-development and development efforts in each of our massive mega campuses and our attempt to reduce and hopefully successful strategy our non-mega campus pipeline, future pipeline and obviously the sale of most of our non-core assets over time. That\u2019s going to be critical to our go-forward business plan. High quality cash flows and substantial embedded future net operating income will be even more secure, given that platform focus. Our longstanding tenant relationships that demonstrate stellar brand loyalty continue. Lilly is a great example with multiple strategic relationships there. We continue to be backed by our fortress balance sheet with significant liquidity, unique and deep life science expertise which is a hallmark of this company from day one, and we\u2019re very proud of our long tenured and highly experienced management team. And, as I move from kind of our strategic thinking about what we need to do to be at the vanguard of the next bull market for life science, the life science industry, I want to take a reflection on my take of the second quarter and our future planning. It goes without saying that we had a very solid FFO per share growth in this quarter, this past quarter, second quarter of course of 5.3% and 6.3% for the six months this year and especially I think positive given the backdrop. An astounding 74% of our ARR comes from the mega campuses and we hope to push that over 90% in a short handful of years as our major moat, as the major moat of our business. 53% of our ARR is from investment grade or big cap companies, the strong quality of cash flows and the 96% of our leases having contractual rental rate increases gives us great future protection. We\u2019ve maintained stable occupancy with a very solid leasing quarter with solid economics and we continue to have very solid cash same store NOI growth. Our EBITDA margins are best-in-class and we\u2019re also working hard to reduce our go-forward CapEx and G&A. We are anchored by our fortress balance sheet, as I\u2019ve said, with strong liquidity and almost one-third of our debt expires after 2049 with an average term of 13 years. Over the next few months, we are laser focused on leasing the remaining 1 million approximately square foot rolling this year and getting a strong jump on the significant 2025 rollovers. Also over the next few months, we are laser focused on our \u201824 and \u201825 deliveries and continue to increase our leasing on those well beyond the current 87% to drive NOI growth. We\u2019re making significant progress on our recycling of capital for 2024 and beyond. And finally, the life science industry, which Hallie will comment on in-depth here, is the crown jewel and the cherished industry of our country and truly the world\u2019s leader in innovation in the discovery of new medicines. It is virtually the only industry which fundamentally enables better health, well-being and longer and happier lives. We have built this one of a kind company to be at the vanguard of this cherished life science industry as it recovers from the aftermath of the COVID rocket ship. And, without further ado, let me turn it over to Hallie. Hallie Kuhn : Thank you, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Hallie Kuhn, SVP of Life Science and Capital Markets. Today, I\u2019m going to review 2Q24 life science industry performance, demand across our strong and diverse tenant base and the incredible innovation that is propelling the growth of the life science sector. As I walk through the details, there are two main points I want to underscore. First, the $5 trillion secularly growing life science industry continues to command robust levels of capital from diverse funding sources. And second, the life science that life science innovation is advancing at a historic pace yielding new medicines that extend and save lives. Starting at the beginning of the lifecycle of innovation, biomedical and government institutions which account for 10% of our ARR catalyzed discoveries that fuel deeper understanding of disease biology and early development of new medicines. In addition to the NIH budget of $49 billion in 2024, $57 billion was contributed to biomedical research last year through non-profit organization While institutions maybe the engine for early innovation, private biotech companies which represent another 10% of our ARR are the fuel advancing research discoveries into potential new medicines. Private life science venture funding was robust this quarter exceeding $12 billion. While down from the peak in 2022, this year is on-track to be the third highest year in life science venture dollars ever deployed. Next are pre-commercial public biotech companies representing 9% ARR. Remarkably, follow-on financings and private placements are at historic highs eclipsing $10 billion in the second quarter with 2024 financings already exceeding full-year 2023 levels. This activity is juxtaposed against limited IPO volume and the XBI, which is up moderately for the year, but lags the broader markets. We caution that the XBI is an imperfect barometer for public biotech. The reality is a picture of have and have nots. Biotechs that meet clinical milestones have ample access to liquidity and see positive stock performance, while those that lack meaningful inflection points are faced with a challenging market reality. Next, our commercial stage biopharma and large multinational pharmaceutical companies representing 17% and 20% of ARR respectively. Biopharma continues to commit historic levels of capital to internal R&D and external innovation. 2023 R&D spend neared $300 billion and the industry set records for M&A driven by an estimated $200 billion to $300 billion dollars of revenue at risk in the next five years due to patent expirations. In 2022, this pace has continued with over $60 billion in M&A announced. On the ground, leasing from this cohort is driven by the need to recruit and retain scientific talent critical to developing new medicines essential to meeting near and long term growth targets. This is illustrated by the 127,000 square foot lease we announced this quarter with a large multinational pharmaceutical company on our SD Tech by Alexandria mega campus in San Diego. Spanning the entire lifecycle of innovation is the life science product, service and device tenant segment, which represents 21% ARR. Relevant to this segment is the BioSecure Act, which if passed will limit utilization of select Chinese contract manufacturing and research organizations. We view this legislation as largely positive. It includes grandfathering provisions to minimize near-term impact to biotech companies, while creating an incentive for U.S. based contract manufacturing and research organizations to onshore capabilities. The output of the entire innovation cycle are novel medicines that make it into the hands of patients. Through June, the FDA approved 21 novel small molecule and biologic therapies and separately approved 5 novel gene and cell therapies. Of approximately 500 novel FDA therapies approved since 2013, 50% were developed by Alexandria tenant. Highlighting one recent approval, this month the FDA approved Alexandria Tenant Eli Lilly\u2019s novel antibody for treatment of early Alzheimer\u2019s disease. As many listening today have experienced firsthand, Alzheimer\u2019s is devastating affecting one out of every nine individuals over 65 in the U.S. While recently approved Alzheimer\u2019s medicines can slow disease, they are still not a cure and there remains much work to be done. In the same way that 10 years ago obesity was considered too complex to treat with medicines and now has been transformed by GLP-1 therapies developed by Alexandria tenant, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, 10 years in the future we may have medicines that completely alter the paradigm of diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s, rendering them treatable or even preventable conditions. Coming full circle, the life science industry continues to demonstrate sustained strength, energized by this incredible pace of innovation and reinforced by diverse sources of funding. As the trusted partner to the world\u2019s leading life science companies that expand the entire lifecycle of innovation, our mission remains steadfast to create and grow life science ecosystems and clusters that ignite and accelerate the world\u2019s leading innovators in their noble pursuit to advance human health and cure disease. With that, I will pass it over to, Peter. Peter M. Moglia: Thank you, Hallie. A respected economist recently made the case that pent-up demand from the pandemic has continued to be a key source of inflation which is one of the reasons the raising of short-term rates has been ineffective and that sectors of the economy with pent-up demand will continue powering the economy going forward in 2024 regardless of rates or who wins the election. Healthcare was one of the sectors mentioned. Patients returning to doctors\u2019 offices and hospitals are releasing pent-up demand for therapies and medicines, which should send a strong signal to the industry to grow. We look forward to enabling that growth. I\u2019m going to discuss our development pipeline, leasing, supply and asset sales and then hand it over to Marc. In the second quarter, we delivered 284,982 square feet, 100% leased with 92% of the space contained in mega campuses located in our high barrier to entry submarkets. The annual incremental NOI delivered during the quarter equaled $16 million bringing the year-to date total to $42 million. Development and re-development leasing of approximately 341,000 square feet was more than three times the volume of last quarter led by strong credit tenant leasing. The ability to execute on our development and re-development pipeline when others are clearly struggling is mainly attributed to our strong brand built on operational excellence and the attractiveness of our mega campus platform which houses 69% of our current pipeline. Projects to be delivered in 2024 and 2025 are 87% leased and projects expected to stabilize in 2026 and beyond are 40% leased or under negotiation because of our continuing strong execution during the quarter. Our development and re-development pipeline is expected to deliver very significant incremental NOI of approximately $480 million in the near-to-medium term. $187 million of this NOI is expected to be delivered through the fourth quarter of 2025 and the remaining $293 million will be delivered from the first quarter of \u201826 through the Q1 of \u201828. To execute on this, we will only need to average approximately 61% of the leasing per quarter through the first quarter of \u201828 and we executed this quarter. Transitioning to leasing and supply, the leasing market is in a flight to quality. Failed projects are often in tertiary markets and operated by inexperienced entities with little to no know how or capital to fund tenant improvements. The majority of fully vacant buildings in our markets are recently delivered buildings from these entities who majorly underestimated the skill sets needed to be successful in life science real estate and pick sites as if they were investing in office. High-quality locations in the core areas of innovation and high-quality sponsorship matters. Many of these new entrants are learning that the hard way. Alexandria sets the standard for sponsorship in life science real estate and our consistent occupancy, tenant retentions and strong tenant relationships which accounted for 83% of our leasing during the quarter. Our reflections are reflections of that moat we have created with our high-quality mega campus model residing in AAA locations, our operational excellence and our fortress balance sheet. Although the search rings of the tenant bases have expanded with the delivery of new supply, the strike rings have tightened as quality tenants leery of inexperienced and undercapitalized developers choose the trusted brand. We leased 1,114,001 square feet during the second quarter highlighted by the strong leasing in a development and re-development pipeline, I noted earlier. GAAP and cash rental rate increases were 7.4% and 3.7% respectively. Over 90% of our renewals were either neutral or had a positive mark-to-market. On competitive supply, 2024 is going to be the peak year for new deliveries and then it will begin to dissipate in 2025 to about half of what we will deliver in 2024. We are likely to see little-to-no new deliveries from pretenders after 2025 unless projects currently under construction are delayed. I\u2019ll conclude with an update on our value harvesting asset recycling program. As mentioned on the last call, our value harvesting transactions will be heavily weighted towards the third and fourth quarters but significant progress continues to be made. During the quarter, we closed on the $60 million non-income producing asset in New York and increased our pending transactions subject to letters of intent or purchase and sale agreement negotiations by approximately $549 million to a total of $806.7 million. This combined with our $77.2 million in closed sales and $27 million of forward equity sales agreements expected to be settled in 2024 brings our pending and closed transactions to $884 million approximately 59% of the midpoint of guidance for dispositions, partial interest sales and equity. Interest in our non-core asset sales remains consistent and we believe the anticipated rate cuts and thawing of the financial markets will bring more buyers and have a positive effect on values. The lack of financing available to investors has been the driver of the widely reported lack of capital markets activity in the broad market. Capital flows have a major impact on valuations and commercial real estate debt has trended downward as a percentage of GDP for the last two years prior to the first quarter of \u201824. However, this appears to be reversing as new CMBS issuance for the first half of 2024 is up nearly threefold from the same period last year, which should provide positive momentum for our current and future efforts. With that, I will pass it over to Marc. Marc E. Binda: Thank you, Peter. This is Marc Binda, CFO. Hello and good afternoon everyone. We reported solid operating and financial results for the second quarter. Total revenues and NOI for 2Q \u201824 were up 7.4% and 9.4% respectively over 2Q 2023, primarily driven by solid same property performance and continued execution of our development and re-development strategy. FFO per share diluted as adjusted for the quarter was $2.36 up 5.4% over 2Q 2023 and was ahead of consensus. We reiterated the midpoint of our full-year 2024 guidance for FFO per share diluted as adjusted of $9.47 which is up 5.6% over the prior year. The key assumptions to FFO as adjusted generally remain within our prior guidance ranges and so they remain unchanged with the one exception being the change to our sources and uses to the Tech Square ground lease amendment, which I\u2019ll get to later. I\u2019ll start with internal growth. Our solid operating results for the quarter were driven by our disciplined execution of our mega campus strategy, tremendous scale, longstanding tenant relationships and operational excellence by our team. 74% of our annual rental revenue comes from our collaborative mega campuses. We have high-quality cash flows with 53% of our annual rental revenue from investment grade and publicly traded large cap tenants. Collections remain very high at 99.9% and adjusted EBITDA margins continue to be strong at 72% for the quarter. Turning to leasing, leasing volume was strong for the quarter in the first half of 2024 at 1.1 million and 2.3 million square feet respectively. The second quarter is up 27% over the average of the back half of 2023 and is consistent with our historical quarterly average for the period from 2013 to 2020. We continue to benefit from our tremendous scale, high-quality tenant roster and brand loyalty with 79% of our leasing activity over the last 12 months coming from our existing deep well of approximately 800 tenant relationships, including the 127,000 square foot development lease that was executed this quarter with a multinational pharma company at our mega campus development in Sorrento Mesa. The rental rate increases for the first half of \u201824 were strong at 26.2% and 15% on a cash basis and our outlook for rental rate growth for the full year \u201824 remains solid at 11% to 19% and 5% to 13% on a cash basis. Rental rate growth for lease renewals and releasing of space for the quarter was 7.4% and 3.7% on a cash basis. As we\u2019ve noted in the past, the rental rate increases can vary from quarter-to-quarter based upon a particular mix of lease expirations. Lease terms on new leases completed in the first half of 2024 were 7.7 years, which is consistent with five out of the last 10 years, which had lease terms in the seven to eight year range. The overall mark-to-market for cash rental rates related to in place leases for our entire asset base remains solid at 12%. TIs on renewals and releasing of space for the quarter of $31.83 were consistent with our historical per square foot average since 2020 of $31.07 and the year-to-date amount is significantly below our historical average at $25.32. Our total non-revenue enhancing expenditures including TIs on renewals and leasing of space are expected to be in the 12% to 13% range as a percentage of net operating income in 2024, which is below our five year average of about 15% and highlights the durable nature of our laboratory infrastructure. Same property NOI growth for 2Q24 was solid at 1.5% and 3.9% on a cash basis, driven by solid rental rate growth and leasing volume. Our outlook for full year same property growth consistent with our last update at 1.5% and 4% on a cash basis at the midpoints. Our capacity for the quarter was solid at 94.6% which is consistent with the prior two quarters. Turning to lease expirations, our team has done a great job of addressing 2024 leasing expirations. Unresolved lease expirations remaining for the balance of 2024 are pretty modest up 637,192 square feet to resolve excluding the 350,000 square foot lease expiration related to the New York asset we disposed of in July. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2025, we highlighted a few key lease expirations aggregating 600,000 square feet with $37 million of annual rental revenue that are expected to have 12 months to 24 months of downtime on a weighted average basis with more than half of that coming from a lease expiration with Moderna at Tech Square, which as a reminder recently expanded into 462,000 square feet at the recently completed 325 Binney project. These spaces may require some time to release and or reposition the assets and are likely to remain as operating assets. Please refer to footnote number 5 in Page 23 of our supplemental package for additional details there. Turning next to external growth. During the quarter, we continued to execute on our development and redevelopment strategy by delivering 284,982 square feet from the pipeline, which will generate $16 million of incremental annual net operating income. We also expect to see significant future growth in incremental annual net operating income on a cash basis of $80 million from executed leases as the initial free rent from recent deliveries burns off over the next seven months on a weighted average basis. As a reminder, this $80 million is for previously delivered projects and is not part of the projected go forward $480 million net operating income associated with current projects. We have $5.4 million of rentable square feet of development and redevelopment projects that are 61% leased or negotiating and those projects are expected to generate $480 million of incremental annual net operating income over the next four years, including $187 million over the next six quarters. In July, we completed an extension of our ground lease at Alexandria Technology Square. This will require a prepayment of rent of $2,135 million amounts in 4Q \u201824 and 1Q \u201825 and will be amortized into non recoverable ground rent expense starting in 3Q \u201824 through 2088 on a straight line basis. We increased our guidance range for disposition sales partial interest and common equity to reflect the funding for the first ground lease payment due in 4Q \u201824. A few key items to note. First, we view this asset, Tech Square as a generational asset located adjacent to MIT in Cambridge at the centre of Maine and Maine with several important relationships located on the campus. Second, since we acquired this mega campus in 2006, NOI has nearly quadrupled over our ownership period. And third, even with the expected prepayment of rent, we believe this adjusts to a very attractive annual ground rent cost relative to market over the next 65 years. And ultimately, we believe that this extension enhances the long-term value of the campus. For all these reasons, we are very pleased with the outcome. I\u2019ll turn next to cap interest. We continue to focus on the completion of committed and or under construction projects which are expected to generate $480 million of incremental NOI through 1Q \u201928 as well as important pre construction activities adding value and focused on reducing the time from lease execution to delivery. Capitalized interest has declined three quarters in a row primarily due to the delivery of projects from the pipeline, which generated $187 million of incremental annual net operating income over that time and a decline in average real estate base is subject to capitalization of $1.9 billion from a peak in 3Q \u201823 to 2Q \u201824. Our outlook for capitalized interest for \u201824 is consistent with our previous guidance and continues to assume around a 10% decline in average basis subject to capitalization for the full year \u201824 compared to \u201823. Transitioning next to the balance sheet, we continue to have one of the strongest balance sheets amongst all publicly traded U.S. REITs and we look for opportunities to continue enhancing our fortress balance sheet. Our corporate credit ratings are in the top 10% of all publicly traded U.S. REITs. Our leverage continues to remain low at 5.4 times for net debt to adjusted EBITDA on a quarterly annualized basis. We have an attractive debt profile with fixed rate debt comprising 97.3% of our total debt and a weighted average remaining term of debt of 13 years. We also have tremendous liquidity of $5.6 billion supported by our $5 billion revolving credit facility. We\u2019re very pleased with the recent agreement to extend our credit facility through January 2030 and we thank our banking relationships for the tremendous support to help us continue our mission. We remain disciplined with our strategy for long-term funding of our business and recycling capital from dispositions and partial interest sales to minimize the issuance of common stock. Our disposition strategy is heavily weighted towards outright dispositions of assets not integral to our mega campus strategy allowing us to enhance the quality of our asset base. We may also consider reducing the size of our future pipeline through asset recycling in the current pipeline and into our mega campuses. July \u201824 we completed the sale of our vacant non-laboratory building located in Manhattan for $60 million. This building was designated as held for sale in 4Q \u201823 and was sold following the lease expiration for the full building in July of \u201824. The aggregate total of completed and pending dispositions under negotiation plus a small amount of equity we raised on the ATM aggregates $912 million or 59% of the midpoint of our guidance of $1.55 billion. While the macro environment remains challenging, we are reasonably optimistic that we can execute on our disposition plan in 2024 at values representing a reasonable cost of capital. Based upon our outlook as of today, we plan to pause on future issuances under the ATM program at least for the next quarter. We also expect to fund a meaningful amount of our equities with retained cash flows from operating activities after dividends of $450 million at the midpoint of our guidance for \u201824. Our high-quality cash flows continue to support the growth in our annual common stock dividends with an average annual increase in dividends per share of 5% since 2020 and we continue to have a conservative FFO payout ratio of 55% for 2Q \u201824. Realized gains from venture investments including FFO per share as adjusted were $33.4 million in the quarter and $62.2 million for the six months ended June. On an annualized basis based upon the first six months of \u201824 that would take realized gains towards the high end of our guidance range for the full year of $95 million to $125 million. Gross unrealized gains in our venture investments as of 2Q \u201824 were $284 million on a cost basis of $1.2 billion. We\u2019ve updated our guidance for 2024 for EPS of $2.98 to $3.10 and we maintained our guidance range for FFO per share diluted as adjusted with no change to midpoint of $9.47 which represents a solid 5.6% growth in FFO per share for 2024. With that, let me turn it back to Joel. Joel S. Marcus: Thank you, Marc. And operator, we\u2019ll go to questions, please. Operator : Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions]. Today\u2019s first question comes from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Farrell Granath : Hi. This is Farrell Granath on behalf of Josh. I quickly wanted to ask about, as you\u2019re mentioning, the Alexandria Technology Square mega campus, kind of that repositioning going from multi-tenant or going to multi tenancy from single tenancy. I was wondering if you could discuss the driver of this change and if you\u2019re seeing any shift in demand of the market for single tenants? Joel S. Marcus: Well, I think there is no fundamental change. As I think Marc mentioned, Moderna has essentially or is moving out of that space in Tech Square 200 and moving to their new R&D and HQ headquarters at 325 Binney. So, they leave behind laboratory assets in that space or spaces. And our plan is to release those generally as a multi-tenant situation. So, it\u2019s not really any change. We clearly knew for a long period of time that Moderna was leaving and this is just part of their growth and something we\u2019ve done time and time again. Just remember, Alexandria Technology Square sits right across the street from MIT\u2019s main science campus and you\u2019ve got the best location in the world when it comes to laboratory space. Farrell Granath : Great. Thank you. And also I noticed in between the 1Q, 2Q letters of intent and pending along with closed acquisitions that there was a slight kind of, I don\u2019t know, dropping off of the LOIs. So, I wonder if you could comment on that either, if things are coming out of the pipeline due to different circumstances, pricing negotiations? Joel S. Marcus: Peter, do you want to comment on that? Peter M. Moglia: Yes, I mean -- Joel S. Marcus: Go ahead, Marc. Marc E. Binda: Yes, I was just going to say, yes, I think what you\u2019re referring to is the lease percentage on the development pipeline. It wasn\u2019t that leases were leased and then weren\u2019t leased. What happened there was we actually added a little bit more square feet into one of the assets at 311 Arsenal. That was a project that has been coming back to us in phases. And so the project just got larger this quarter and as a result the lease percentage went down. So, I don\u2019t know that there was any type of surprise there. Farrell Granath : I think what I was referring to was the on the acquisition page within the supplemental, the pending acquisition signed letters of intent. I guess just when adding them together and taking out what was completed in 2Q \u201824, I think there is a slight difference just quarter-over-quarter. Is that what you\u2019re referring to for the purchase price for I think what is this Page 5 of the supplemental? Marc E. Binda: Yes. No, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s yes, look, if you look at last quarter the pending items that we were looking at, I think that number has come down a little bit. But I think that number came down by a pretty small amount if I recall correctly. So, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything shocking or surprising from our end. I think we\u2019re focused on conserving capital and putting our capital into the active pipeline and focus on dispositions at the moment. Farrell Granath : Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Anthony Paolone : Yes. Thank you. Can you talk a bit about just cap rates on the pending $806 million of sales or stake sales? And just maybe even more broadly, any updates across your markets as it relates to property values or cap rates? Peter M. Moglia: Yes. Hey, Tony, it\u2019s Peter. Yes, look, the things that we\u2019ll have cap rates published, I think you\u2019ll find to be in line with our commentary of good quality assets are still in demand. I don\u2019t want to spoil any thunder for next quarter, but we do have a couple of things that are going that are pretty good. Noncore assets though can certainly not necessarily be representative of our prime assets that we plan on holding in perpetuity. But GAAP rates are a tough thing to figure out these days what people\u2019s returns, what they are looking for largely depends on their cost of capital which has been varied throughout the last few quarters. But I\u2019m going to go ahead and wait till I think next quarter we\u2019ll have something to publish and you\u2019ll see the numbers. Anthony Paolone : Okay. And then just you mentioned a couple of times in the prepared remarks about just the increased leaning into the mega campus strategy and even shedding more noncore. Is there like a percentage of the portfolio you\u2019d characterize as kind of not fitting the long-term strategy at this point that you can provide? Joel S. Marcus: Well, I think if you look at the percentage of ARR coming from the mega campuses and that\u2019s not you have a series of assets. Remember, this company was built over decades on individual acquisitions and then individual redevelopments and developments. And then the first mega campus that we bought was Tech Square, in fact, in 2006, and that really kind of launched that strategy, followed by Campus Point in 2010, and then the New York campus, which was our first mega development campus. So, I think you just have to think of it in terms these are still really very, very good assets, and we\u2019ve moved in many cases and shed many of our more core assets in the suburbs, and we still have quite a number of standalone assets, not really in the outer suburbs that we\u2019ve transacted over the last handful of years, and I think we\u2019re looking at that. So, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s easy to give you exact percentages, but as I said, our main goal is to move our mega campus annual rental revenue into the high 80s or low 90s over the next short handful of years, Tony, if that\u2019s helpful. Anthony Paolone : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Griffin at Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Griffin : Great, thanks. My first question was just on the leasing environment. I noticed for the renewals there was a decline in weighted average lease term relative to last quarter. Can you maybe give some insights? Was it specific to the renewals that were coming up? Is it more indicative of tenants maybe being unsure of their footprint? I realize that one quarter doesn\u2019t make a trend, but any commentary around that would be helpful. Joel S. Marcus: Yes. So, I\u2019ll ask Peter to comment from his perspective. But I think if you think about again, you said it, individual leases that come up quarter-to-quarter certainly drive those stats. I think it\u2019s fair to say and Hallie has commented on this on a number of occasions, We\u2019re seeing more demand from the earlier stage companies and the revenue generating companies, it\u2019s the in between the biotechs that are in the clinic waiting for clinical milestone achievement that I think has caused some of the disruption in the normal leasing transactions that have gone on. And I think this quarter there was just more at the earlier stage, and those people can\u2019t commit to 10 or 15 year leases because they\u2019re likely to grow, and that\u2019s the reason to have them on a mega campus because we can provide them 5,000, 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 whatever they want and we can double and triple their footprint on a mega campus, whereas an individual building, oftentimes, you can\u2019t really do that. Peter M. Moglia: Yes. Hey, Michael, it\u2019s Peter. Great observation. It\u2019s one of the first things that I noticed when I started looking at the numbers and Joel is absolutely spot on. It\u2019s serendipitous. We had just a large portion of the leasing was for early-stage companies. And as Joel mentioned, those companies tend to sign shorter term leases because they expect to be much bigger in the future. And Joel is exactly right. It\u2019s one of the reasons that we adopted a mega campus strategy because we have these types of tenants that will grow within the mega campus. So, but yes, no trend other than just serendipity. Michael Griffin : And Peter, do those smaller tenants I guess require the larger TI packages? I noticed that free rent was stable quarter-over-quarter, but it seemed like TIs and LCs went up. So, what\u2019s that just a one off maybe driven by one lease or what was driving that? Peter M. Moglia: Yes, well, Mark mentioned in his comments that although it was higher than maybe the last couple of handful of quarters that TI/LC number was about our average since 2020. These are renewals, so it\u2019s going to -- the numbers will vary from quarter-to-quarter based on the work that needs to be done on the suite. Mark mentioned in his comments the recycling, the durability of our spaces. We don\u2019t have to put a lot of CapEx to continue the lease and to continue to leverage off previous investment. But in certain cases you have a tenant that might need to do some reconfiguration or you might have a lease that\u2019s in a space that\u2019s 15 years old or so, so you got to put more money into it. So, it\u2019s again, it\u2019s not a trend, it\u2019s not a market trend like it would be. We\u2019ve talked about things from shell, the TIs have gone up considerably, because tenants don\u2019t want to invest in the space like they used to have to. But in the case of renewals, it\u2019s just lease-by-lease. What is the space look like? What is the tenant need? But it\u2019s still if you consider the inflation that has happened in construction costs $30 is still not a lot of money to be averaging on renewals. Michael Griffin : And then maybe just one more if I could just on the development pipeline. I noticed that the 651 Gateway project was pushed to \u201826. Is this just a function of maybe more tepid demand in South San Francisco and at what point would you have to stop capitalizing costs on this project and start having it flow into the income statement? Peter M. Moglia: Yes, that\u2019s exactly correct. Of all the markets submarkets, South San Francisco certainly as we\u2019ve highlighted and Peter has talked about that for quite a number of quarters, has one of the most outsized supply issues. Remember too, this is an old building that we inherited in a joint venture. So, the time and effort to get this redeveloped is just what it is. The good news is we have several transactions going on that weren\u2019t alive last quarter. So, I think that\u2019s good news. Marc can comment on the termination of capitalization. Marc E. Binda: Yes. Hi, Michael. Yes, there\u2019s not a magic number there in terms of when it would turn off. There\u2019s continuing activities today on doing work on those floors that remain to be leased and delivered. But yes, if there was a situation where those activities ceased, where the demand just couldn\u2019t catch up with the supply there then we would have to shut down those portions of the project that no longer have activity. So, we\u2019ll continue to watch that very carefully. Michael Griffin : Great. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks for the time. Peter M. Moglia: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Rich Anderson at Wedbush. Please go ahead. Richard Anderson : Thanks. Good morning out there or good afternoon, excuse me. So, on the leasing front, you had the mix issue this past quarter. But if you sort of look at what you did in the first half and compare that to what you\u2019re guiding to which didn\u2019t change, that would imply like a GAAP number of 8%, average 8% up in the second half and a cash average of about 5%. Is that right? Am I thinking about that correctly if I just do a sum product of the math or am I missing something? Joel S. Marcus: Yes, I can take that one. Hi, Rich. Yes, it\u2019s not a perfect analysis, right, because volume can vary from quarter-to-quarter, particularly in that release and renewal bucket, right. That\u2019s only a fraction of the total leasing. So, it\u2019s not a perfect analysis. But yes, I mean, I think you\u2019re right that the first half of the year was very strong. It\u2019s the numbers are actually above the high end of our midpoint. But we feel comfortable with our guidance we\u2019ve got out there, which we still think is very strong in this environment. And that it does imply on average slightly lower numbers than the first half, but I think we\u2019re still very pleased with where we expect to come out for the year. Richard Anderson : Okay. And Peter, I\u2019m going to see if I can ask a cap rate question at a different angle, see if you shut me down as well. But do you have a differential between core and noncore assets in terms of cap rates? Is there a spread that you guys think about in terms of what you think is a long-term hold and what\u2019s not? Peter M. Moglia: Yes, I mean, I think about it in a way as long-term holds are going to be mega campuses in the prime core locations and you\u2019ve seen us put up really strong numbers there. And then we\u2019ve got some good assets. We own them because they were good assets, but they are not mega campuses. They are typically not within the core mark, core centres of innovation, but they were areas that supported research for different reasons and might be 100 to 200 basis point spread between something prime and something not so prime. Richard Anderson : Okay, great. Last question, you\u2019re funding a lot of your development or most of it with dispositions. And I\u2019m curious if you think by doing so, you, I guess, expose yourself to impairments in this market. Do you kind of view this in some ways as a cleansing event that and I suppose you do, like you wouldn\u2019t necessarily be using dispositions if your stock was at $200 a share, but you are. Is that the silver lining to this long-term in your opinion or is that not the way to look at it? Joel S. Marcus: Yeah. Well, I\u2019ll comment and then Peter can. I think the answer is yes in the sense that we feel that the industry has been on a tear for, as I said, the 2014 to 2021 and then the rocketship and then kind of the drop off from that. And it\u2019s pretty clear that in today\u2019s fairly, way more disciplined allocation of capital from the life science industry, more and more, it\u2019s clear to us, it\u2019s been clear for a long time, but even more so today, that the best prospects for leasing and either keeping a tenant or attracting a new tenant is to give them great optionality on a mega campus, great amenities and that\u2019s where we want to refocus or double down our efforts and we\u2019ve gone a long way to bring that to reality. But we think that\u2019s where we want to be out a period of time where we have fewer and fewer noncore assets, because I think they don\u2019t give us the optionality to attract or grow with tenants the way we want to grow, not that the buildings aren\u2019t leasable because some of them are absolutely great buildings and have great tenants. Peter M. Moglia: Yes. Look, I think it is a bit of a silver lining but I would say that it would have happened anyway because of our observation that the mega campus model was where we needed to be headed. So, ultimately those assets maybe it would have been at a slower pace, but we would have, been selling those noncore, non-mega campus assets over time anyway. Joel S. Marcus: Yes. And we really have done that if you look at Greater Boston. I mean, we didn\u2019t have the money to get into Cambridge or even Waltham in the early days, so we started out in Worcester. And so are the evolution of how we\u2019ve looked at each of the submarkets is we have gone from kind of outer burbs to kind of the inner core, just as the company has grown and now we just want to refine and hone that strategy. And we feel like we started that back as early as 2006 and now we\u2019re doubling down on it. Richard Anderson : Okay, great color. Thanks folks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Wes Golladay with Baird. Please go ahead. Wesley Golladay : Hi, everyone. Just looking at the dispositions, it looks like you have about 10 million square feet of non-mega campus development potential. How much of that would you like to I guess be part of your disposition program? Peter M. Moglia: Yes, look, I think Joel mentioned it earlier that our development pipeline may shrink in the future and something that\u2019s non income producing like land is very accretive to sell and to use to fund our current pipeline or in our future in place pipeline. So, of course, we would like to if we for certain in certain areas if we have land that we can market and sell, we will. So, it will certainly be part of our strategy. Wesley Golladay : Okay. And then looking at the ground lease purchase, you did mention it was a generational asset, did have a lot of term on it already before you extended it. Is there any other ground leases you\u2019re looking to extend actively at the moment? Joel S. Marcus: One thing I would point out, I think Marc you absolutely can answer this. But one thing I want to point out is, I think it was a really astute move for us to do that today because this was a situation where we had more leverage today than we would have in better times. So, sometimes you have to make moves even if it\u2019s a tough environment because long-term it\u2019s going to really set you up well. Marc, if you want to answer the other part of the question? Marc E. Binda: Yes, sure. Hi, Wes. I was just going to say Tech Square, if you look at the ARR subject to ground lease was far and away the largest ground lease that we have. It was about a third of the ARR subject to ground leases. The balance of that is spread across I think 29 different properties. And then if you think about where the lease terms are kind of on a pro form basis once the amendment or now that the amendment is done. It\u2019s a little bit more of 60 plus years. So, I think we\u2019ve got pretty good term on in terms of the remainder of our ground leases. Wesley Golladay : Great. Thanks for the time everyone. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Michael Carroll at RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Michael Carroll : Yes, thanks. Peter, I wanted to follow-up on Mike\u2019s question earlier in the call. I mean, is there a reason why most of the leasing activity is coming from early-stage biotech companies? Is that a trend we should expect to continue over the next few quarters? Is that just kind of unique towards the activity this specific quarter? Peter M. Moglia: Well, look it is consistent with the way we\u2019ve characterized demand. By and large across our regions there has been a barbell of early-stage companies being very active and large pharma being very active and not as much in the middle due to a lack or not necessarily a lack of wanting to grow, but lack of confidence to grow. So, we do expect that the middle will fill in over-time especially considering the metrics that Hallie started to or had presented but it\u2019s not a trend it just happened to be we had a number of earlier stage company leases rolling and it just was a coincidence. Hallie Kuhn : Hi, this is Hallie. I was just going to reiterate that certainly we see funding being strong across multiple data points. Venture certainly looks great this year, follow on financings have been very strong, and we continue to see demand across the diversity of our tenant portfolio, if you look at our tenant pie chart broken out by ARR. So, while certainly demand may look different from quarter-to-quarter from any given segment, I don\u2019t think there is one specific trend that is driving demand from only one of these tenant segments. That\u2019s the beauty of the life science industry is the diversity of the types of companies we have in our portfolio. Michael Carroll : Okay. And then can you guys provide an update on your supply outlook. I know in prior calls you provided some stats given the scheduled deliveries in \u201924 and in 2025 as a percentage of inventory in the top three cluster markets. I mean, have those stats changed at all? Or can you provide us an update on how you\u2019re viewing that? Joel S. Marcus: Yes, look we didn\u2019t want to bore you all with the same numbers over and over and over again. I would say the only real material change was there was a lot of deliveries in San Francisco this past quarter, but it\u2019s progressing like we thought. We are in the under 5% of total inventory left to deliver in this year and the next year about half of that amount will deliver next year. So, from the amount that is left to deliver in \u201824 is roughly half of what it was at the beginning of the year and so it\u2019s progressing like we thought. It\u2019s the same amount of space. We don\u2019t see a material amount of supply dissipating. We also don\u2019t see a material amount of supply being added. Michael Carroll : Okay. And then just last one for me, I know you already talked about the Gateway project, but I know you had two developments that were 100% leased at Winter Street and Harriet Tubman Way that got pushed out, it looks like roughly a quarter or so. Is that just delays in the construction or is there any reasons why those stabilizations were pushed out a few quarters? Joel S. Marcus: Yes, I can take that one, Michael. Yes, I mean, you\u2019re right. The project at 230 Harriet Tubman was pushed out I think a quarter, that projects 100% leased, same with 840 Winter actually it\u2019s a similar story on both of them that they\u2019re 100% leased in the tenant programming just ends up making the construction a little bit longer. So, that just happens sometimes. Michael Carroll : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Vikram Malhotra : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, Joel, maybe bigger picture, you laid out a pretty compelling longer-term scenario for life sciences in the portfolio. And just want you to if you could help us marry that with the near-term. It sounded like there\u2019s still some challenges, but also were inflecting from a supply delivery standpoint. So, just help us like what should we be watching for near-term inflection, it sounded like a little more tepid near-term than the long-term? Joel S. Marcus: Yes. Thank you for the question. And I think it\u2019s a good one. I think you have to remember that we\u2019ve seen the internet bubble crash in 2000 the GFC in 2008, 2009, and then kind of the blow up of the rocket ship of COVID as it kind of came down to earth, and each one is kind of different. I think this time, we don\u2019t have financial institution problems, we don\u2019t have lots of companies that had kind of fake business plans failing, like back in 2000, not so much biotech, but certainly in the dot com bubble era. I think this time, we\u2019ve never seen supply in our particular niche. Supply has always been there, but it\u2019s never been oversupplied in a sense. And so when you combine that oversupply with more muted demand coming off just rocketship demand of 2021, I mean, our leasing quadrupled during some of those quarters and years, which you just know can\u2019t be sustained. I think that\u2019s the overarching issue and the industry and Hallie did a great job of articulating the segments is mission critical. It\u2019s the crown jewel of this country, its critical to the health of our citizen and beyond. And I think that, and the funding factors and diversity is very, very strong. How that translates into is the big question everybody wants answered, but there\u2019s no algorithm to do it. How that translates into a more consistent and robust demand. And I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re all kind of working through. And every cycle is just different. And so we\u2019re very optimistic about the future. Obviously, we wouldn\u2019t be in this business if we weren\u2019t. But we know that we have to make adjustments to our assets, our capital plan and make sure that we have we\u2019re best positioning the company to help our 800 tenants grow and attract a whole lot more. And we think by selling more of the noncore assets, slimming down the future pipeline a bit and doubling down on the mega campus is the right strategy till the market really turns. And I think whether the election, whether it\u2019s the executive branch or each of the houses, helps reinforce a more robust economic environment. It\u2019s hard to say, as I said in my prepared remarks, debt service and the overall health of that, of the economy, given debt to GDP and so forth. A lot of really smart people have opined on that issue and we want to make sure that if there\u2019s a bigger shock out there to the system, we\u2019re extremely well protected. So sorry for the long answer. Vikram Malhotra : No, that\u2019s helpful. And just maybe one more, I guess maybe Marc you can or Peter. You\u2019ve done a bunch of repositionings or at least put properties into repositioning. I\u2019m just trying to understand like bigger picture what the opportunity set is or how to split it between like this was office, we always intended it to reposition the lab versus where we got to just redevelop. So like, for example, the Apple repositioning where Apple was, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, I thought that was going to be a renewal originally, but now you\u2019re repositioning it. So, I\u2019m just trying to think about the opportunity set down the road and like what the impact to numbers is. Marc E. Binda: Yes, I can take that one, Vikram. Yes, so on the Apple one that you mentioned or really in Austin, we\u2019re renewing some of that space. If you look at the lease expirations, some of that\u2019s being negotiated. The balance of that the spaces we\u2019re getting back are warehouse and R&D spaces. So, those are that space we\u2019re marketing, we\u2019ve got folks looking at that. It\u2019s possible that some of those one or two of those buildings gets converted, but we\u2019ll have to stay tuned. When you talk about repositioning, that\u2019s more in the lines of what I think Joel or Peter talked about earlier for the Tech Square 200 where it\u2019s an existing laboratory building, but it\u2019s been single tenant for a while and it\u2019s an opportunity to be able to market that space to multi-tenant. So, that\u2019s in terms of when we talk about repositioning that\u2019s we\u2019re thinking of that is in the bad CapEx bucket. But again, if you look back over a long period of time that the amount of CapEx has been relatively small. Peter M. Moglia: Yeah. And just maybe a footnote on that. So, Apple is in the process of negotiating a renewal on the majority of the buildings, but they\u2019re giving back two of the buildings, which Marc highlighted. I think the good news is, one is, I think imminently releasable as R&D and the other is warehouse, which we do have a client who\u2019s actually very interested in that. And based on what we\u2019ve seen in the market, there also could be some demand for data centre activity there. So we\u2019re not necessarily we had in our forward model, we had assumed this scenario that we would get back two buildings that weren\u2019t adjacent to their campus where their other buildings are and that they would take those forward and that\u2019s exactly how it played out. Vikram Malhotra : Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jim Kammert with Evercore. Please go ahead. James Kammert : Thank you. Apologies for a bit of a pedestrian math question, but you speak to 341,000 square feet or so of leasing activity and the development and redevelopment pipeline. But help me, where am I missing? If I go to page 37 of the supplemental and I kind of reconcile the net change in lease square footage percentages from the prior quarter to the second quarter, coming up a little shy of $340,000 So I\u2019m just trying to where am I missing or where else should I look? Thank you. Marc E. Binda: Hey, Jim. This is Marc. Yeah, you\u2019re right. There was actually one project that was already leased where the tenant actually came back to us to actually add on additional term. That project has not been finished yet, hasn\u2019t been completed. So, a bit of a conundrum where you put that, but given that that project hasn\u2019t delivered, it\u2019s in the development pipeline. That\u2019s a project in San Diego and we were happy to see that happen because we got an extra term out of it. So, that\u2019s the reason for that. That doesn\u2019t happen very often. James Kammert : I see. So, it\u2019s basically almost a give back, but then they came back with a longer requirement. So, we just can\u2019t see that and it must be in the order of 100,000 square feet plus. Does that sound right? Marc E. Binda: That\u2019s right. James Kammert : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Peter Abramowitz with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Peter Abramowitz : Thank you. Yes, most of my questions have been answered, but just one other on the mix in leasing this quarter. Could you just comment on the leasing spreads? Was there anything kind of notable that stood out that dragged them down a little bit this quarter. I know you talked about how it can be lumpy, but just wondering if there\u2019s anything to call out there? Joel S. Marcus: Yes, the answer is no. And the mix of the different segments, whether it be product and device, multinational pharma, private biotech, all were actually pretty strong and a mixture of those, public biotech was probably among the lowest. That\u2019s just how it works, given what we\u2019ve said about the barbell, but nothing don\u2019t read anything into if you look at first quarter was extremely strong, this quarter\u2019s more muted, but still pretty solid. And I think it kind of just is kind of down the middle of the fairway as we see it at this juncture. Peter Abramowitz : Got it. Thanks, Joel. And then one other for me. I think you\u2019ve talked about there\u2019s been a fair amount of activity and an increase in activity this year sort of in that small to midsize tenant group. I guess as you look out into the market and the funding environment and the macro backdrop, any idea or a sense of what you think it would take for kind of larger those 100,000 square foot and up tenants to start to get more active? Joel S. Marcus: Yes, I\u2019ll ask Hallie to answer, but my kind of the one thing that would make a huge difference would be the true opening of the IPO market, which signals that you\u2019ve got long term investors, crossover investors and even earlier stage investors participating. The IPOs that have happened to date are kind of few and far between and they\u2019ve traded down on an average pretty substantially. So, that\u2019s one thing that would be very recognizable and has been something that has led some of the other bull markets. But Hallie, you could comment more in-depth. Hallie Kuhn : Yes. I would say taking a step back, generally those requirements, particularly from the public biotechnology tenants, are very milestone based, and that is irrespective of the macro environment, whether or not a clinical trial has positive or negative data, it doesn\u2019t matter what the interest rates are. So, I would say historically, as we look at those types of requirements, it\u2019s just really dependent on companies hitting those inflection points. And we certainly have some of those types of requirements in the pipeline as data comes to fruition. And there\u2019s been some other examples of well, backside is a good example in our St. Carlos campus. They\u2019ve continued to expand off positive data. So, I would kind of shift the focus more towards as these companies continue to show that they have value in their pipelines that is really where the demand is driven from. Peter Abramowitz : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Dylan Burzinski with Green Street. Please go ahead. Dylan Burzinski : Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just sort of wanting to touch on retention here. I know historically your guys\u2019 retention has typically been in cost of 75% to 80% range. But over the last six quarters that started to trend down, I guess just curious as we sort of look out over the next year or so as the supply pipeline continues to deliver, should we expect that to continue to have an impact on your guys\u2019 retention? And I guess just looking at the last six quarters, I mean, is there something else besides supply that is sort of driving that lower retention rate? Joel S. Marcus: Yes. So, Marc, do you have the steps on that? Marc E. Binda: Yes. Dylan, I think if you\u2019re just looking at renewals as a percentage of expirations, it\u2019s really hard to get the full picture. Case in point, you\u2019ve got as an example, you\u2019ve got Moderna and Tech Square that we talked about right where large space that they will not be renewing, right. But what\u2019s missing is, right, they signed 462,000 square foot lease at a new development. So, it\u2019s difficult just to take the retention rates right off the face of the leasing page. I mean, the way we look at it, when we normalize for those sorts of things, we really haven\u2019t seen a drop off in retention. Dylan Burzinski : Got it. And so I guess given the mission critical nature of life science facilities, it seems like for those tenants new supply like simply upgrading your facility may not be worth it given the downtime and the risk associated with moving landlords, is that fair to say? Joel S. Marcus: Well, I think it\u2019s way more complicated than that. People in this industry don\u2019t move for a buck a foot difference, that\u2019s just not relevant. And also the sponsorship of who they lease from is critical because there have been a number over the last year of significant failures of others in this industry where labs have been shut down and major damages happen to the science or the people in the laboratories. So, operating with the best of breed in the industry makes a big difference. We don\u2019t see anybody that\u2019s just going to move to a place for some small difference that just doesn\u2019t happen. And if the tenants are decent, our mega campus strategy is aimed at always having inventory to allow these companies to grow and to retain them. So, that\u2019s the big issue. Supply isn\u2019t really the big issue now. Supply does impact leasing in the sense that when somebody is looking at space, they could cite other locations. But if the locations aren\u2019t really dead centre comparable then those comps don\u2019t really make a big difference and people aren\u2019t going to pick up and leave for as I say a few bucks cheaper rent, it just doesn\u2019t happen in this industry. Dylan Burzinski : That\u2019s helpful detail. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. And our last question today comes from Omotayo Okusanya with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Omotayo Okusanya : Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. I just wanted to focus on Boston a little bit. You do have a fair amount of leases that will be expiring in that market in the back half of this year and also in 2025. Trying to understand what\u2019s happening with market rents in those markets relative to you in place rents as we kind of try to estimate, guesstimate what mark-to-market could look like on a going forward basis? Joel S. Marcus: Yes. So, Marc, you could comment on overall mark-to-market and Peter, you could give some observations if you want. Marc E. Binda: Sure. Yes. I mean, we talk about the in-place mark-to-market for our entire portfolio being about 12%. We typically don\u2019t break that down kind of market by market. But you\u2019re right, we do have a fair amount of space that\u2019s rolling. The good news is a lot of that\u2019s in Cambridge, which that\u2019s where you\u2019re getting space back. It\u2019s still a place where market rents have done pretty well. But Peter, maybe I\u2019ll let you comment specifically if you want on market rents there. Peter M. Moglia: We\u2019ve been looking at a lot of data around where face rates are and Boston is and the rest of our large markets are pretty consistent where rents have come off the peaks of 2021, 2022, but they\u2019re still well above the pre pandemic rates. Of course, you still have more concessions today in the form of TIs for the newly built space. But we\u2019re pretty happy considering the supply dynamic that rents are still above the pre pandemic levels. Omotayo Okusanya : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks. Joel S. Marcus: Just want to wish everybody a safe and healthy summer and we\u2019ll look forward to talking on our third quarter call. Thank you, everybody. Operator : Thank you, sir. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. We thank you all for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz with Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Paula Schwartz : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder of Alexandria. Please go ahead, Joel. Joel Marcus : Thank you, Paul, and welcome everybody to Alexandria's third quarter earnings call. I'm here today with Hallie, Peter, and Marc. And first of all, as I do every quarter I want to extend a profound thank you and huge congratulations to each and every member of our Alexandria\u2019s family team for bringing it this third quarter to post an impressive operating and financial performance in a continuingly stubborn economic and operating environment to the team. You're an inspiration to me each and every day in small ways and large. Thank you. The continuingly stubborn economic backdrop for commercial real estate and risk on investments, Peter and Marc will address those, but let me just give you a couple of quick comments driven by the huge and unnecessary federal deficits over the last handful of years $9 trillion plus, inflation in many areas remain sticky, stubborn and structural despite what the Labor Department is saying and reporting. Our cost of capital is also stubbornly high across much of the equity and debt capital markets again despite the delayed and rather feeble responses of the Fed to date. And Main Street is hurting in the United States, it's pretty clear. Hallie will comment more in-depth on Life Science Industry, but let me say a couple of things I've said many times in the past. This is one of the few crown remaining crown jewel industries here in the United States and is the great bastion of true and novel innovation. And the only real and effective path to solve and address over 90% of human diseases which remained unsolved today, which bear an unbearable burden on our citizens and our healthcare system is the translation of this innovation. Since the downward spiral biotech began in early 2021 and kind of hit its bottom in what appears to be October of 2023 and after almost decade of bull-run from 2014 through 2021. Unfortunately, the industry attracted and almost became drug addicted to too many and too free of capital flowing in and some of the really stupid and outrageous monies both from the Fed and investors which caused a rocket ship demand for exit of what it normally is and really not wanted and sustainable. And since then things have settled down. Here we are almost 4 years later since the XBI started to tail-off in February 2021 and we're in a really a highly, I would say and toughly disciplined funding market but one in which I personally prefer to operate. As an example of this market to [PDD] less than half the biotech IPOs from 2013 to 2019, remain standalone companies, majority of either seen successful exits which is awesome, less successful exits which is less than awesome or disappeared altogether which is not awesome. Couple of thoughts my take on the third quarter, a truly operationally excellent results both operationally and financially and the continuing strong balance sheet management with great liquidity and kudos to our team. Still in a very difficult supply and demand impacted market with a challenging cost of capital. In the third quarter, we continue to deliver increasing FFO per share and dividends per share growth despite the tough environment. And I think one of my key takes is the -- our strong year to date rental rate growth which is I think pretty exceptional. We continue with strong continued high occupancy, collections nearly 100% which is sensational. And I think what truly stands out in this Q3 is the leasing activity of almost 1.5 million rentable square feet, at a 48% increase quarter-to-quarter. Future embedded NOI growth of $510 million which Marc will talk about and our very successful self-funding capital recycling program, this year, which Peter and Marc will talk about. Going forward and finally, as the master investor Warren Buffett has said, a truly great business must have an enduring mode. And out of the depths of this bear market like I was -- like we experienced and I feel, like the 2010 era of this market. I still remain more optimistic than ever about the promise of unprecedented human health innovation from our precious industry, assuming the government doesn't screw it up and Alexandria continuing at the vanguard of this industry to build, the really building the future of life-saving and life-changing innovation. And finally, let me just say a couple more words before I turn it over to Hallie. Much as predicted, as we predicted the doubling of our revenues from 2017 to 2021, which we exceeded during an unprecedented bull market on the back of our strategic -- well our I think long developed strategy on the back of our development pipeline created during the depths of the aftermath of the great financial crisis when we really conceived of it in the 2010 to 2013 era. In five short years by the end of this decade December 2029, our revenues will be overwhelmingly driven by our unique and highly competitive mega campuses, best locations, best assets, best services, that also compete and clearly demonstrates superior return on investment, higher occupancy, higher rental rates, best talent recruitment or retention for our tenants and a multiple and very convenient path for growth. And so with that I'll turn it over to Hallie. Hallie Kuhn : Thank you, Joel. This is Hallie Kuhn, Senior Vice President of Life Science and Capital Markets. This afternoon, we will provide an update on the life science industry, starting with FDA approvals and followed by a review of the current funding environment across our diverse life science tenant base. Taking a moment to reflect on the immense impact of the biopharma industry, since 2013 there have been 519 novel medicines approved by the FDA. Nearly half specifically 257 of these approvals have been developed or commercialized by Alexandria tenants. That's 257 approvals that have extended and improved lives, and is what inspires Alexandria's deeply held mission supporting the companies at the leading edge of life science innovation. Let's look at an example that will resonate for every person on this call who has personally experienced or supported loved ones with cancer. In the 1990s, the FDA created an approval process known as the Accelerated Approval Pathway with the goal of accelerating access to medicines for diseases with no effective medicines. Over the recent 16-year period, 69 cancer medicines were approved for the FDA's Accelerated Approval Pathway. These medicines have treated an estimated 911,000 patients, and led to 262,000 additional years of life. That is more than a quarter million years of lives saved. It's truly stunning. Now turning to life science fundamentals. Venture capital deployment to private biotech tenants which is 10% of our ARR is healthy. This year is tracking to eclipse 2023 and maybe the third highest year on record. As Joel mentioned, investors are highly disciplined, focused on rational valuations, de-risk technologies, and near-term milestones. The translation to demand on the ground is steady and conservative, transitioning to a just in time model for space. Scale and flexibility are core to this growth model and is why Alexandria's distinctive mega campus strategy is extremely well-positioned to meet this trend in demand. With respect to pre-commercial public biotech companies, 9% of our ARR, follow-on financing is robust, already clinching the second highest year on record. These financings are focused on the subset of companies with compelling clinical data, while those without clear catalyst continue to struggle to access additional capital. The IPO market has also narrowly opened, particularly for companies with meaningful assets derisked with clinical data. The number of IPOs through Q3 2024 has surpassed 2023 and over half of the companies that went public this year are trading above their issue price. Further opening of the IPO markets will be a positive indicator for future leasing demand as these companies grow and as investor and Board conservatism thaws more broadly. Commercial stage public biopharma, which makes up 16% ARR and large multinational pharma, which makes up around 20% ARR continue to commit considerable dollars to R&D, both to internal programs and externally via partnerships and M&A. Importantly, they remain very well capitalized with over $200 billion cash on hand amongst the Top 25 biopharma. Next, life science product service and device tenants, which represent 20% ARR. Notably, the BIOSECURE Act has passed the House and is awaiting a vote in the Senate. If passed, the legislation will limit utilization of select Chinese contract research organizations. We view this legislation as largely positive. It includes grandfathering provisions to minimize near-term impact to biopharma, while creating an incentive for U.S.-based contract manufacturing and research organizations to onshore capabilities. Long-term, this could provide a tailwind for demand across this segment. Last, Biomedical and Government Institutions, which represent 12% ARR. Institutions continue to be the catalyst for early discoveries that form the next generation of medicines. As our sale of 1165 Eastlake to the Fred Hutch Cancer Institute in our Seattle region and their expansion into our neighboring 1201 and 1208 Eastlake buildings reflect, these institutions plant deep long-term roots focused on the right location, right ecosystem, right infrastructure, and trusted relationship with landlord partners such as Alexandria. Widening the lens on healthcare more broadly as we conclude, of the $4.5 trillion in healthcare costs annually spent in the U.S., less than 15% goes towards medicines. To put that in perspective, nearly 25% of healthcare spend is estimated to be on unnecessarily or wasted administrative spend. All to say that Novel medicines have the incredible opportunity to both have a positive impact on individuals' health and drive long-term savings to the healthcare system by preventing, managing and even curing the thousands of diseases with limited or no treatment options. With that, I will pass it over to Peter. Peter Moglia : Thank you, Hallie. Before I get into my update on the development pipeline, leasing, supply, and asset sales, I wanted to comment on the improving health of the office market because it's helpful to life science real estate in a couple of ways. First, a healthy -- can create competition for life science tenants as tech tenants have historically been attracted to our locations and centers of innovation, and the appeal of our floor plates, ceiling heights and amenities. Second, office offers and alternative for some of the misguided life science real estate supply that's been added since the pandemic. We are seeing it real time with the boom of the office leasing taking place in Mission Bay. OpenAI completed a 490,000 square-foot sublease at our 1455-1515 Third Street property in the fourth quarter of 2023 and last quarter added another 315,000 square feet at the neighboring 550 Terry Francois Building, which by the way was being marketed as lab space. Our understanding is that two other tenants that were competing for that building, including a tech company, and that one of them is now negotiating at Mission Rock, which was also once identified as Future Lab Supply. In the third quarter, we delivered 316,000 square feet of development, redevelopment pipeline, 100% leased with 100% of the space contained in mega campuses located in our high barrier-to-entry submarkets. The annual incremental NOI delivered during the quarter equaled $21 million bringing the year-to-date total to $63 million. The weighted average stabilized yield of the deliveries was strong at 7.7%. After a strong second quarter, development and redevelopment leasing was light at 39,121 square feet, bringing the total for the year to 480,342 square feet. We suspect the result was driven by the fact that most of the space available for lease in the pipeline won't be available for occupancy until 2026 or later. In today's market, project leasing accelerates as projects near completion as illustrated by our 2024 and 2025 deliveries being 91% leased. Projects expected to stabilize in 2026 and beyond are 35% leased, and overall activity in these projects is encouraging because most of them are in Greater Boston, and we have active proposals or touring activity at each one of them. Transitioning to leasing and supply, overall leasing volume was very robust at 1.49 million square feet, up 33% quarter-over-quarter. This leasing was significantly driven by renewals with a strong 84% retention rate, which illustrates the power of our mega campus platform, and trust in our brand built by our internal long-tenured asset services teams providing unmatched operational excellence, and know-how in the running of our mission-critical facilities. GAAP and cash rental increases were 1.5% and 5.1% respectively, influenced materially by a large non-laboratory lease renewal with a high-credit tech tenant. Although the increases were modest, we are pleased with the longer lease durations coming in at a weighted average of 9.7 years for renewed and released space. On competitive supply, as a reminder, 2024 is going to be the peak year for new deliveries and most of that has been delivered through the third quarter. Inclusive of 2026, there is approximately 8 million square feet of competitive supply remaining to be delivered in our three largest markets. In Greater Boston, approximately 200,000 square feet will be delivered in the fourth quarter of 2024 and it is 100% leased. In 2025, 2.4 million square feet is anticipated to be delivered and that space is 65% pre-leased. In 2026, another 900,000 square feet will be delivered in Greater Boston and it's 3.5% leased. In San Francisco Bay Region, 300,000 square feet will be delivered in the fourth quarter and it's 0% leased. In 2025, 1.7 million square feet will be delivered and it's currently 23% leased. We are not tracking anything to be delivered in the Bay Area for 2026. In San Diego, 1.3 million square feet will be delivered in the fourth quarter and it's 50% leased. 700,000 square feet is expected to deliver in 2025 and it's 23% leased. And in 2026, we expect to see 400,000 square feet of competitive supply to be delivered and it's 100% leased. I'll conclude with an update on our value harvesting asset recycling program. We've commented on the past two calls that our value harvesting transactions will be heavily weighted towards the end of the year. With respect to the third quarter, we closed on just north of $300 million of asset sale transactions highlighted by the sale of 1165 Eastlake Avenue East, a core asset in the Lake Union submarket of Seattle. As you know, it's not our intent to sell core assets, but this transaction offered several constructive attributes. First, as Hallie mentioned, the sale was to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, which is one of the most prestigious clinical research institutions in the world and it afforded us an opportunity to recapitalize our neighboring 1201 and 12080 Slake Avenue East assets with them as well taking out an existing partner at a gain. This was a fantastic opportunity for us to deepen our relationship with the Hutch, who is a major driver of life science real estate demand in the region. Second, the transaction provided for early renewals at those recap properties inclusive of a 20 year lease term at 1201 East Lake, where the Hutch occupies the entire 106,000 square foot building. Third, it provides price discovery upon which analysts and investors can evaluate the NAV of our core assets. We acknowledge that this was a user sale, but any rational buyer is going to require pricing in the neighborhood of market value, so we think the 4.9% capitalization rate and 1,499 per square foot value is representative of the value of our core mega campus assets. Rounding out the third quarter transaction was the completion of the previously announced $60 million sale of 219 East 42nd Street, New York City and the sale of 14255 New Brook Drive in Northern Virginia at a 7.4% cap rate, a workhorse asset that no longer fits into our strategy, but is a testament to the enduring value of our asset base as we acquired it pre-IPO. As we look-forward, we expect to end the year strong with several value harvesting transactions on tap to close before year end. We have $577.2 million of dispositions that are subject to non-refundable deposits. Those assets include a retail development on excess land we owned in Maryland, a one-off Class B asset in our Greater Stanford submarket that will be redeveloped for another use, a one-off office building that was part of a land assemblage in the suburbs of Boston, a pair of buildings in the Research Triangle located outside of our core mega campuses and a set of buildings in the suburbs of Greater Boston, which will be sold to a user. Rounding out our fourth quarter dispositions are assets that are subject to executed letters of intent or purchase and sale agreements. Approximately 48% of the 600 and $2.5 million in sales proceeds expected from these transactions come from our land bank and are expected to be developed for residential use. The balance is a pair of buildings that will be demolished for residential development and a set of non-core standalone assets in Cambridge that will require significant capital to release and no longer fit into our strategy. With that, I'll pass it over to Marc. Marc Binda : Thank you, Peter. This is Marc Binda, CFO. Hello, and good afternoon everyone. We reported solid operating and financial results for the second quarter. Total revenues and NOI for 3Q \u201924 were up 10.9% and 12.5% respectively over 3Q \u201923, primarily driven by solid same-property performance, and continued execution of our development and redevelopment strategy. FFO per share diluted as adjusted for the quarter was $2.37, up 4.9% over 3Q '23, and is in line with consensus. Our solid operating results for the quarter were driven by our disciplined execution of our mega campus strategy, tremendous scale, longstanding tenant relationships, and operational excellence by our team. 76% of our annual rental revenue comes from our collaborative mega campuses. We have high-quality cash flows with 53% of our annual rental revenue from investment grade and publicly traded large-cap tenants. Collections remained very high at 99.9%, and adjusted EBITDA margins continued to be strong at 70% for the quarter. An important takeaway for the quarter should be the very strong leasing volume results. Leasing volume for the quarter was 1.5 million square feet, which was up 48% over the trailing four-quarter average, and was the highest quarterly volume since 4Q '22. We continue to benefit from our tremendous scale, high-quality tenant roster, and brand loyalty with 80% of our leasing activity over the last 12-months coming from our existing deep well of approximately 800 tenant relationships. The rental rate increases for the first 9-months of 2024 were strong at 16.4% and 8.9% on a cash basis. And our outlook for rental rate growth for the full year '24 remains solid at 11% to 19%, and 5% to 13% on a cash basis. Rental rate growth for lease renewals and releasing the space for the quarter was 5.1% and 1.5% on a cash basis. We did highlight the renewal of an acquired lease in Texas for tech R&D space that did weigh down the numbers during the quarter. During the quarter, we also achieved very healthy lease terms on completed leases, which were almost 10 years on average. The overall mark-to-market for cash rental rates related to in place leases for our entire asset base remained solid at about 10%. Tenant improvements and leasing commissions on second generation leasing as a percentage of starting cash rent were around 8% this quarter, which is less than our historical average over the last 3 years of about 9%. Our total non-revenue enhancing expenditures, which includes tenant improvements on renewals and releasing the space is expected to be in the 10% to 11% range as a percentage of net operating income in 2024, which this amount is below our 5 year average of 15% and is lower than that of several other REIT sectors and really highlights the durable nature of our laboratory infrastructure. This is the third year in a row that we've been in the 10% to 13% range, although we do expect next year to be higher given some larger repositioning projects on the horizon. Turning to same-property results, same-property NOI growth for 3Q24 was solid at 1.5% 6.5% on a cash basis, really driven by solid rental rate increases, a pickup in occupancy and some burn-off of free rent. Our outlook for the full year 2024 same-property growth is consistent with our last update at solid growth of 1.5% and 4% on a cash basis at the midpoints of our guidance. We do expect some pressure on fourth quarter same-property results resulting from a lease termination that occurred at 409 Illinois Street in our Mission Bay submarket where the lease will be expiring at the beginning of 2025 and we expect little to no rent in the fourth quarter of '24. As a reminder, our same-property results do include 100% of consolidated results. So even though we only have a 25% interest in this particular property, the approximately $17 million of annual rental revenue going away related to this tenant in the fourth quarter will be fully reflected in same-property results, even though the bottom line FFO results will only pick up our 25% share. Turning to occupancy, for the quarter, occupancy was very solid at 94.7%, which is up 10 basis points over the prior quarter and continues the steady results over the last four quarters. We expect year-end occupancy to be on the low end of our guidance range of 94.6% to 95.6%. On lease expirations, our team has done a great job of addressing the 24 lease expirations with very strong leasing volume again completed in the quarter of 1.5 million square feet and the unresolved lease expirations remaining for the balance of 2024 are modest at only 134,000 rentable square feet. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2025, we highlighted a few key lease expirations spread across four projects aggregating 768,000 rentable square feet with $47 million of annual rental revenue that are expected to have 12 to 24-months of downtime on a weighted average basis. 75% to 80% of the total $47 million annual rental revenue is related to our Alexandria Technology Square and 409 Illinois Street projects, which are expected to remain as operating properties with the same-property pool following the lease expiration, even though these spaces may require some time and capital to release or reposition the buildings for multi-tenancy. The Alexandria Technology Square project primarily relates to the move out of Moderna and the expansion to their new 462,000 square foot building we delivered late last year at 325 Binney. And we are in early discussions with the tenant to lease approximately half of the 409 Illinois Street property. Please refer to footnote 4 on Page 24 of our supplemental package for additional details there. On external growth, during the quarter, we continued to execute on our development and redevelopment strategy by delivering 316,691 rentable square feet from the pipeline, which will generate $21 million of incremental annual net operating income. We have 5.5 million rentable square feet of development and redevelopment projects that are 55% leased or negotiating, and are projected to generate $510 million of incremental net operating income over the next 3.5 years, including $158 million over the next five quarters. Transitioning next to the balance sheet, we continue to have one of the strongest balance sheets amongst all publicly traded U.S. REITs. Our corporate credit ratings are in the top 10% of all publicly traded U.S. REITs. We remain on track to achieve our targeted net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 5.1x on a quarterly annualized basis by year-end. We have tremendous liquidity of $5.4 billion, and our attractive debt profile highlights our commitment to long-term funding of our business with a weighted average remaining term of debt of 12.6 years and average year-end percentage of fixed-rate debt over the last 5 years of 97.7%. We continue to focus on our disciplined funding strategy to recycle capital from dispositions, and to minimize the issuance of common stock. Common stock issuances have amounted to less than 2% of our total funding sources in 2023 and 2024, and we do not expect to issue any new equity in the fourth quarter of 2024. Our disposition strategy for 2024 is focused primarily on outright dispositions of non-core assets not integral to our mega campus strategy, allowing us to enhance the quality of our asset base and include stabilized properties, non-stabilized properties with vacancy or near-term lease expirations, and land parcels. To date, we've completed $319 million of asset sales, including the sale Peter mentioned at 1165 Eastlake Avenue, which is located in our Lake Union Submarket that was sold to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Institute. We have another $1.2 billion of pending dispositions subject to non-refundable deposits or executed letters of intent or PSA agreements. About half of the pending dispositions represent stabilized property sales, most of which are expected to be sold to users with a blended expected capitalization rate of 8.5% and 7% on a cash basis.  The other half represents the sales of land and properties with vacancy or near-term lease expirations. The 3Q \u201824 annualized NOI associated with the $1.2 billion of pending sales is $95.8 million $91 million on a cash basis. It's important to note that the $95.8 million is a backwards-looking amount, and does not consider certain lease expirations for some of the non-stabilized properties expected to occur over the next 12-months, including a significant amount of non-laboratory space. On a forward-looking 12 months basis for these non-stabilized disposition assets, we expect that NOI will decline by $30 million to $35 million. And given that these assets no longer fit our strategy, we've elected to sell these assets and allow the buyer to invest the capital to reposition those assets. Included in the $1.2 billion pending dispositions are 2 key items aggregating nearly $700 million. First, a suburban campus with specialty non-traditional lab space in our Greater Boston market to the existing tenant for $369 million which represents a 6.3% cash cap rate, and second various sites in Sorrento Mesa and University Town Center to residential developers for $314 million which will allow us to monetize some of our future pipeline without adding to the lab supply. The aggregate total of the completed and pending dispositions is $1.5 billion which puts us right around the mid-point of our guidance and we're reasonably confident we can close all of this by the end of the year. We also expect to fund a meaningful amount of our equity needs with retaining cash flows from operating activities after dividends of $450 million at the mid-point of our guidance for 2024 and our high quality cash flows continue to support the growth in our annual common stock dividends with an average annual increase in dividends per share of 5.4% since 2020 and we continue to have a conservative FFO payout ratio of 55% for 3Q\u201924. Realized gains for the venture investments, including FFO per share as adjusted for the quarter, were $23 million and $85.2 million for the nine months ended September. Quarterly realized gains since 2021 have averaged about $25 million. Through the first three quarters of 2024, we've averaged about $28 million so pretty close to the historical run rate and consistent with our guidance range for the full year of $95 million to $125 million. Turning to guidance, there were a few moving pieces in our underlying guidance, including lower straight line rent revenue and lower G&A, which we highlighted on Page 5 of our supplemental. We've updated our guidance for 2024 for EPS of $2.60 to $2.64 and we maintained the midpoint of our guidance for FFO per share diluted as adjusted of $9.47, which represents a solid 5.6% growth in FFO per share for 2024. As we look ahead beyond 3Q \u201824, we continue to have conviction to reinforce our core through our differentiated mega campus strategy, which is the driving force behind our disposition strategy. With 76% of our annual rental revenue coming from mega campuses today and aspirations to enhance this number over time with non-core dispositions of land and properties, as well as disciplined development and redevelopment on these mega campuses, we expect to continue increasing the quality and resilience of our dominant platform and asset base. With that, let me turn it over to you Joel. Joel Marcus : Okay. Paula, could you have the moderator open it up for questions please? Paula Schwartz : Yes, please do. Operator : Today's first question comes from Joshua Dennerlein with BofA Merrill Lynch. Joshua Dennerlein : Yes. Hey, guys. I appreciate the time. I appreciated the comments on the Seattle asset sale to 4.9% and then the pending sales that are stabilized like a 7.5% cash cap rate. Is there any other like additional color you can provide on like what's driving the gap between those two? I know you touched a little bit on your opening remarks. Then maybe just like the second part of that would be like should we assume like the stuff that's not in the mega campus is stabilized maybe is closer to that 7.5% cash cap rate? Joel Marcus : Yes, I don't think that's a reasonable assumption, but Marc do you want to talk about Seattle and maybe how to think about? Marc Binda : Yes, sorry. Yes, Josh, I think on the stabilized cap rate, I think perhaps what you're referring to is, I think it was a 7% cash and 8.5% GAAP. The big reason for the delta there between cash and GAAP was the big chunk of that is the suburban Greater Boston market that actually had some really long lease term in place. So you had a pretty big spread there between cash and GAAP. But I think if you think about what to expect in terms of stabilized asset sales, we've given you the number for this year, and they're non-core. So we expect them to be wider than that. Joshua Dennerlein : A - Joel Marcus : Yes, So Marc, do you want to comment? Marc Binda : Josh, you're talking specifically about the Greater Boston asset. Joshua Dennerlein : No, I thought I heard you say like half the pending dispositions that $1.2 billion were going to be like sold for like a GAAP 8.5% at cash 7%. I was just trying to like contrast like that pool of assets versus that 4.9% that was sold in Seattle. Marc Binda : Right. Yes. So about half of the $1.2 billion is stabilized assets. That includes the one particular asset we mentioned in Greater Boston that, I think had a 6.3% cash cap rate and then a much wider GAAP cap rate given the long terms. The other half of the $1.2 billion is a mixture of land and also some non-stabilized properties. If you kind of reverse engineer the math, it's somewhere in the high-7s in terms of the GAAP NOI coming offline. But what I was trying to say in the prepared commentary is there's a fair amount of that NOI that for those particular assets that we're selling that happened to be in Boston that will be going away next year. And so the decision there was really to allow the buyer to invest that capital since those assets really just don't fit our strategy any longer. Joel Marcus : Peter, any further comments you have? Peter Moglia : Yes. I mean part of your question, I think referenced the 7.6% cap rate maybe that I mentioned of one of our workhorse assets versus the core asset 4.9% -- the 7.6% was in Northern Virginia. It is lab space, but it is more clinical lab space and not the R&D type of space that is in our core mega campuses.  But what I was trying to get across in my commentary was, we wanted to make sure that everyone was aware because a lot of what we've been selling has been non-core, almost everything is non-core unless it's been a partial interest sale. We haven't done a partial interest sale in a while. So we just sold a core asset in Lake Union and I explained why. And it was at a 4.9%. And even though it was a user sale, which certainly influences value. It has to be in the ballpark of market value, right? I mean from any rational buyer is not going to way overpay for anything no matter whether they are a user or not. So I thought it was a good example and reminder to everybody that we are on our way to making everything that we own or a good portion of what we own core mega campus assets. And once we're done with our disposition program, we are what we have left is highly valuable and that comp reflects that and that's what I was trying to get across. Joel Marcus : Yes, that's really good. And Josh just one other comment that you have to remember, so the company is 30 years old and so it's acquired, developed or redeveloped assets over a long period of time that now don't fit the go forward mega campus strategy. So that's pretty obvious. Operator : And our next question today comes from Rich Anderson at Wedbush. Rich Anderson : Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. So in terms of the dollar value of what you can still do in terms of non-core assets, you mentioned 76% mega campuses. I just sort of did a 24% of your enterprise value and got to $9 billion. But I assume that's a bit simplistic, but is the pipeline for additional sales to meet your development obligations in that sort of $5 billion to $10 billion range, would you agree with that number or am I wrong? Joel Marcus : Yes. Marc, do you want to respond to that? Marc Binda : Yes. I think it's true that some of that 24% of ARR that resides in non-mega campuses, some of that would be stuff that we would we may look to exit over time. But there are some really good assets in there that are located in good markets that maybe things we hang on to. The other thing I would say is that we do have some land on the books that is also not located in mega campuses. So that could also be another capital source that we look to go after. I think about 31% or so of the square footage in the land bank is not located in mega campuses. Rich Anderson : Okay, great. And then just a quick sec question here, on the realized gains guidance for the full year, it's still over $100 million I think you've done $47 million as of the Q3 year to date. Does that imply another $50 million plus in the Q4 or am I again, am I missing something? Joel Marcus : Yes, you're missing it -- Marc Binda : Yes, realized gains for the quarter were $23 million and I think we're $85.2 million for the nine months. So if you annualize that, that kind of puts you square in the middle or pretty close to the middle of our guidance range of $95 million to $125 million. Rich Anderson : I thought I saw disclosure for $47 million year to date. I must have I'll have a relook at that. Unidentified Company Representative : Erroneous, yes. Operator : And our next question today comes from Michael Griffin with Citi. Nick Joseph : Thanks. It's Nick Joseph here with Michael. Maybe just first on the 5 year lease extension with the tech tenant in Texas. Just hoping to get some more color on that and kind of what your long term plans are if you still plan to convert this to lab space and kind of the considerations that went into that decision? Joel Marcus : Yes. So we're under strict confidentiality as you probably can imagine. All big tech tenants don't want their name used. They don't allow you to put other tech tenants in the building. They're pretty strict in what they do. So we can say very little other than, we felt that, this renewal was integral to their own campus, which is actually adjacent to our site. These are highly improved buildings for their particular use. So they aren't just some kind of half-asset tech, office kind of thing. They're actually quite valuable and quite improved. I don't know where it goes over time, but clearly having the cash flow is better than in this market environment with cost of capital than trying to reposition them, but they may be an ultimate buyer here as well. So we'll see how the story plays out. Nick Joseph : Thanks. That's helpful. And then, just on leasing more broadly, have you started to see larger space requirements, kind of demand pick up, or is it still more from the medium size 20,000 to 40,000 square foot tenants? Joel Marcus : Well, I think it's pretty good in the early and steady on the revenue-generating side. I think in the middle is where it still remains challenging. And when you've got good clinical data run approval, generally you've got good news. And if not, you know, it's kind of sluggish. So I don't think that's materially changed. Operator : And our next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll : Yes. Thanks. Marc, I wanted to circle back on the valuations on some of the dispositions you provided to make sure I'm thinking about everything correctly. So I know on the $1.2 billion of pending sales. The supplement says there's $96 million of GAAP NOI associated to that, which reflects about 8.1% cap rate. Do you have the cash number for there? So how much cash NOI should we expect kind of goes away once those sales are completed? Marc Binda : Yes, that number is around $91 million, Michael. Michael Carroll : Okay. Great. And then Peter, in your comments earlier, you're saying once you're done with the non-core asset sales, the portfolio quality is going to be significantly improved. I mean, how much should we think about the timing of that. I mean is this going to be a longer-term process, or is there a line of sight when you kind of gave us that idea? Joel Marcus : Well, yes, let me say something before Peter answers. I don't think you could say the quality of the portfolio is going to be substantially improved. It is already first in class, best assets, best location, best services, best tenants. So I don't think how you're thinking about that is quite correct. We have a variety of assets, land, redevelopments, and developments that no longer fit the mega campus strategy, and will harvest those assets over the coming years as we deem appropriate to match sources and uses and also in light of the valuation in the marketplace. So that's kind of how we look at it, but Peter you could comment further. Peter Moglia : Yes, look, the best strategy for us to mitigate the supply that's gone into our core markets is our mega campus strategy. So we are going all in on it. And as Joel mentioned, we feel like all the assets we have are good assets, but we deem some of them to no longer be part of our strategy, and we're those are the ones that we're selling in order to fund our pipeline, which is increasing our percentage of mega campus assets. How long it's going to take is hard to say, but we're doing it incrementally as we build out our mega campus platform. It's good. We feel like it's good that we are able to fund this transition by selling assets that are no longer part of our strategy versus using common. So, the net effect is not we are funding the business without issuing common equity. And at the same time as those sales occur, we increase the percentage of our mega campus assets. Joel Marcus : And maintaining a great balance sheet in the meantime. Michael Carroll : Okay, great. And then just one last question for me. It does look like 99 Coolidge in the development schedule, kind of the stabilization got pushed out a year. Can you kind of provide some color, the reasoning of why that kind of got pushed out? Joel Marcus : Yeah. Well, it's pretty simple. This is a brand new building. It's one of the most highlighted buildings in all of the Watertown campus and submarket. And it's pretty clear that it's going to take us more time to build out space to deliver to tenants rather than having just some time space available. So as part of the development, we're doing that, but that takes time in this marketplace. But we did just sign a lease, I don't know and maybe after the end of the quarter another lease there which will be reported I think was October 13 or something like that for part of the space there. But the challenge there is to lease space and have available space that people can move into and that's what we're trying to get to. That's the point. Operator : And our next question comes from Omotayo Okusanya with Deutsche Bank. Omotayo Okusanya : Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. Just wanted to follow-up on Rob's question. Marc, you mentioned the cash NOI disappearing was about is about $91 million on the $1.2 billion of sales. So I'm looking at it kind of saying that that's about a 7.5% cash yield, but developments are being done at a stabilized 6.4%. So I'm a little I'm just kind of trying to understand again selling at 7.5% to fund assets at 6.4%. Are we looking at that being something dilutive to FFO? Or should we be thinking more about because you're certainly not dealing with a bunch of recurring CapEx, it's still going to be accretive on an AFFO on a free cash flow basis? Marc Binda : Yes, sure. Yes, no, you're right that what we're selling is obviously has a higher cap rate than what we're developing in if you just look at a moment in time. But I think though a bunch of those assets particularly for the non-stabilized ones will absolutely need or will require significant capital to re-tenant those. So I think the choice there was really just to allow the buyer to do that, since those assets don't fit our strategy any longer and take those proceeds and redeploy them into the pipeline where a significant amount of the product in the pipeline is all concentrated in the mega campuses. Omotayo Okusanya : Okay, that's helpful. And then if I may ask another one, the reduction in guidance for straight line rents, again, I know part of it was just write offs of associated with some tenants and some lease terminations. I mean, when you look at the overall portfolio today and you kind of think of a watch list, if I may use those words. I mean, how does one kind of think about that and kind of as I start thinking about 2025, whether we may see a few more of these instances of straight line rent write-offs? Marc Binda : Yes. Maybe, Hallie, maybe, I'll put that one over to you just to talk about kind of how we look at the watch list. Joel Marcus : Frame it for her first. Marc Binda : Yes. Look, I think this was a kind of a discrete event with this particular tenant. It was a large tenant. It was actually a tenant that we inherited when we bought the asset over a decade ago. They've been in there for a very long time, close to, not quite 20 years, but pretty close to it. They've been operating in there. And we sold out of that particular campus a number of years ago in Mission Bay to reduce our exposure. But I think what I want to communicate is that these things do happen, but that was just kind of a one-off event. Joel Marcus : Yes. And I'll maybe answer on Hallie, you can hold your fire for another question. So it's important to keep in mind, too, that this tenant who Marc said, was in there when we bought the building in 2010. It had been signed a lease with the Shorenstein team in 2006, I believe. The company, actually, when we underwrote it, I personally was involved in the underwriting in 2010, look to have one of the most promising blockbuster drugs, a replacement for Amgen's erythropoietin, but instead injectable, it was a pill. But over the course of time through a variety of development changes and just the combination of maybe strategy, science and a whole lot of other issues that come to bear it had lost that opportunity and so was faced with the prospect of continuing its business in China and winding down in the U.S. So I think we did everything prudent we could during all those years and very proud of the fact that we have one of the best track records of underwriting tenants, I think the best in the industry by far. No one has our capability. So thank you for the question. Operator : And our next question today comes from Georgi Dinkov with Mizuho. Georgi Dinkov : This is Georgi on for Vikram. What is the potential for exceeding the midpoint of the disposition guidance? And as you say, assets, what's the best use of the capital? Joel Marcus : Yes. So Marc? Marc Binda : Yes. Look, I think we're almost in late October. So I don't know that I would expect to do much beyond what we laid out in terms of the actual amounts that are either under contract or under -- have a hard asset. There are other things we're looking at that we're moving along that we'll continue to work on. But for now, I probably wouldn't assume much beyond that. Joel Marcus : And the second part of the question? Marc Binda : Sorry, could you repeat the second part, Georgi? Georgi Dinkov : Yes, yes. What is the best use of this capital as you sell assets in your view? Marc Binda : Right. Yes. So look, we planned since the beginning of the year to really fund the construction of the pipeline with this capital. So that's been happening during the year. And this money will be used to pay down debt, which we borrowed to fund the construction pipeline. We do expect, just given where we are in the year, we do expect to actually have a little bit more proceeds from the sales that we won't have the ability to pay down debt. We expect a revolver should be at or close to 0. So by the end of the year. So we do expect to hold on to some of that cash that can then be redeployed next year that ought to reduce our debt needs going forward in 2025. Joel Marcus : But obviously, as you look at funding construction given cost of capital, given the fact that many of these projects in the pipeline were committed in past years, we're only funding new pipeline opportunities, whether they be development or redevelopment where our returns can be well above cost of capital. So that's how we're looking at. Georgi Dinkov : And just one more for me. How do you see demand evolving as funding improves? And do you have any updated thoughts on AI and how that would drive lab space needs going forward? Joel Marcus : Yes. So demand, I think, has been pretty I think the word I used was the industry is in a highly disciplined capital deployment, both capital raising and capital deployment. So we're dealing with that. But we've got 800 tenants plus, and we have high-quality tenants that need lab space. And so as I think Marc said, 80% of our tenants over the last year have come from our own tenants. So we outcompete in those opportunities if we have space available and that's good. On the AI side, I think it's very early days, although AI has been around for quite a long time, very early days for AI. Obviously, the best use of AI and the world of AI is going to have to meet the world of drug development in a moment. Language models and a lot of inhibitions remain between those two, but many companies. In fact, most companies are trying to use AI to inform them to get to better targets and outcomes. And ultimately, my own view is that AI is going to make maybe the most remarkable progress in the clinical setting, where if, over time, one could predict with greater certainty, the those who would respond positively versus no response or negative response, that could save the largest amount of money in the entire drug development process, which is clinical trials. So thanks for that question. Hallie Kuhn : Joel, can I just layer on that. Hi, this is Hallie. I was just going to respond to your first question in terms of the demand. And just to -- as a reminder of as you think about medicine development, unfortunately, for public companies, it doesn't happen on a quarter-to-quarter basis, right? It takes 10 years easily to bring a new medicine from early research to a patient. And what we see on the ground is just incredible innovation, right? We're still continuing to see the discoveries and new forms of modalities that will continue to be developed and make their way to patients. And so while we are in a conservative environment right now, the outlook on the growth of the industry and that translating to needs over the long term is certainly positive. And so the leads we see for example in the obesity space, right? There's so much unmet need across Alzheimer's across still other forms of cancer that the industry outlook and the innovation driving that demand will continue. Operator : And our next question comes from Peter Abramowitz with Jefferies. Peter Abramowitz : I was just wondering if you could comment on sublease space, specifically in Boston and the Bay Area. Is it continuing to increase? Or does it seem like it's sort of stabilized. Joel Marcus : Yes. Peter, do you want to address that? Peter Moglia : Yes. It's stabilized. It has actually not state -- good sublease space, not stayed on the market long. Anything that -- when you look at the percentage of things that are still available for sublease, that space that's for a long, long time because it's just not a good space or it's not a shelf space. But we're not seeing a lot of space being put back on the market now. So what is being absorbed is generally available vacant space and not directly big enough space and not sublease space. So that's been a positive for the market, although there is still some availabilities for sure. But tenants tend to want to go direct, if at all possible, because they have no control over the space if they're going through a tenant that's subleasing it. Peter Abramowitz : Okay. That's helpful. And then just to go back to Joel's comment, I think tenants generally just being more thoughtful and disciplined in terms of their capital allocation. Could you just sort of comment on length of time and deal cycles to actually get leases done sort of where that's at today versus where it's been historically? And any sense of that changing anytime soon? Joel Marcus : Yes, Peter? Peter Moglia : Yes. The cycle of leasing has definitely taken a lot longer now than it used to, certainly, Boards are scrutinizing any growth space and tenants are looking at all the options in the market before making decisions to make sure they're doing all their diligence because Boards are requiring them to get everything pretty much, at least, for the earlier-stage companies and maybe the early IPO companies. The Boards are really looking at every dollar and wanting to ensure that all the diligence was done we feel confident when we're in the mix that we're going to win the deal, but the deals are taking longer to make for sure. Operator : And the last question for today comes from Dylan Burzinski with Green Street. Dylan Burzinski : Just one quick one on transaction markets. Given the commentary on the call, it seems like most of the dispositions this year, those that have been -- that happened in those that are said to close to year-end. It seems like most of the depth to bids have come from users. So just sort of curious on appetite from traditional real estate investors to put capital into work into the life science base today? Joel Marcus : Yes, Peter? Peter Moglia : Yes. Look, we've been fortunate that there have been users out there that want to take advantage of the opportunity to buy the real estate they wouldn't have otherwise had the opportunity to buy because weren't sellers in the past. Transaction velocity to investors is really highly dependent on the financing market. And although it's starting to improve, it's still not where it needs to be for a lot of money to get off the sidelines and back into acquiring mode. There are some investor sales that we're doing for sure. But we think that coming into next year, there'll be a lot more opportunity for us to do so. One, because rates hopefully will revert. We all thought they'd be going down, not up, at this point, but we do have confidence that they will, the 10 year will start to go down. And then we are seeing lenders now start to get back into the market. So that, that will be an opportunity to increase the velocity of transactions to investors and also an opportunity to do better on valuations because they'll be able to leverage them. Operator : Our last question today comes from Jim Kammert with Evercore. Jim Kammert : To the extent you can, where would you say are the better pockets of demand for new space, the lease-up in other words, in the development, redevelopment Is it the private biotech, is it pre-commercial biotechs, big pharma. I'm just curious if you could put any sort of hanging paper around that, where the broader or the deeper view. Joel Marcus : I think it's the -- yes, I think it's the earlier stage company by and large. And if you get a commercial or I mean a clinical stage company that has good news and then it's got to move immediately. Those are probably the 2 most common pockets today. Jim Kammert : Okay. Great. And if I could just leverage last comment on gen AI, to make sure I understood in your prior response. You thought it would be really powerful AI in terms of clinical studies, Joel. But does that -- am I mistaken to think that helps or hinders demand for space then in terms of your lab portfolio? Joel Marcus : Well, I think it's positive in the sense that it will provide way more opportunities for targets, medicines and shots on goal, if it aids in a bets in the clinical trial process, we don't lease space to hospitals or others doing clinical trial. So that doesn't hurt us, but what matters is the pipeline of products that address the 90%-plus diseases that need to be solved. So I think that would be very good news for us. Operator : And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks. Joel Marcus : Okay. Thank you, everybody, and be safe and God bless. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Paula Schwartz : Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the SEC. I'd now like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel. Joel Marcus : Thank you, Paula, and welcome everybody. With me today are Hallie, Peter, and Marc, and want to welcome you to Alexandria's fourth quarter and year end 2024 earnings call. Our team has been hit pretty hard by the California wildfires during this month of January, but luckily they are supremely resilient. Our profound prayers are with all those impacted as well as our own team, and we are by the side of our team each and every step of the way to recovery. Despite the inadequate preparation by the local utilities, the city, the county, and the state, as we have had or actually as there were several days of violent wind warnings ahead of time, largely ignored by those empowered to protect us, really disheartening start to 2025. Let me give a couple observations on fourth quarter and overall year end on the operating and financial results. We're very proud of producing an almost 6% FFO per share growth in a very tough macro environment. Another very solid year of leasing, both on a quarterly and a yearly basis, and Peter will get into depth on some of that. We had a solid fourth quarter and full year capital recycling program as we shrink our land bank to focus on future mega campuses and exit non-core assets. We have continued stability, strength, and flexibility of our balance sheet, great liquidity, and an increasing and well-covered dividend. A couple of thoughts on the life science industry, I'll leave it to Hallie to do more in-depth. But I think the three reasons for a go-forward 2025 optimistic view are one. The anti-industry ideologues of the last administration are gone and the FTC is maybe the simple example of that. The new administration is focused on cracking down on the middlemen and PBMs taking 40% to 60% of the economic value of therapeutics in the chain of value and adding very little and so that's going to be a welcome bulls eye. And then likely there will be positive reform of the IRA provisions and a repeal of the unconstitutional 95% excise tax. And as the new administration wins the day versus the Fed, interest rates are likely to come down and the life science industry will experience a solid return to a hopefully a normalized bull market. The quarter ahead, we're super laser focused as you all know on the redevelopment and development pipeline. It is as Hallie and Peter will tell you, it's been a very diversified demand from leasing. Actually biotech has been the slowest because they're really an adjusting time syndrome given the macro, but that's likely to change when we see the Fed start to ease up. The vast majority of our leasing has come from other sectors. Our pipeline for this year is almost 90% leased or undersigned LOIs. Next year is looking very strong. The year 2027 and beyond is where we have a lot of work to do. We're seeing good activity, and actually new activity across some of our submarkets. South San Francisco remains slow as we have predicted for a long time. We're laser focused on leasing spaces coming back to us as we noted at Investor Day, obviously, and the rollovers for this year, and making very good progress. We're also laser focused on capital recycling for this year, and also making very good progress as well. As I said, at Investor Day, the critical components of our enduring success have been a preeminent brand superior knowledge of our customer, a superior product, highly focused niche, our industry leadership. We believe we possess all those characteristics. And as I said, back on Investor Day on December 4th, we've been through three major cycles as a collective management team in general. And I must say that we've successfully navigated each of these very different market cycles successfully, and we've emerged in a -- even stronger industry position of leadership and strength. Finally, it's interesting that like the real-world legacy media, there are always a bunch of legacy pundents who back in 2009, urge us to unload Mission Bay and Cambridge Land during the GFC as worthless non-income producing assets that weigh on our balance sheet, and they turned out to be the growth engines of the next decade. Those legacy pundents are here again and got it all wrong. We look forward to our first quarter call where we'll give you an update on the strong leasing progress we're already seeing during this quarter and some strong new pockets of demand and give a peek into our 2026 transaction plans. And then finally, let me wish everyone, we need a new New Year since the last one, just January alone, we saw the tragedy in New Orleans in Las Vegas, and obviously the wildfires here in Southern California. So the year of the dragon starts tomorrow, and the key symbols are wisdom and transformation, which I think epitomize, Alexandria. And with that, let me turn it over to Hallie. Hallie Kuhn : Thank you, Joel, and good afternoon. This is Hallie Kuhn, Senior Vice President of Life Science and Capital Markets. To start a brief spotlight on Alexandria Tenant Intracellular Therapeutics, whose acquisition by J&J for $14.6 billion, represents the largest announced biotech M&A in over a year and a half. Our partnership with Intracellular goes back over two decades when the company was founded on research from Nobel laureate Paul Greengard's lab at Rockefeller University, leveraging breakthrough science on how brain cells communicate through chemical signals. Intracellular is developing novel medicines for patients with mental illness, including an FDA approved treatment for schizophrenia and bipolar depression. With one in five Americans affected by mental illness. Intracellular novel medicines have the potential to transform patients' lives. Turning to trends across our broad and diverse life science tenant base. Demand continues to be driven by our nearly 800 strong tenants with 84% of leasing from existing relationships in 4Q \u201824. Importantly, leasing also continues to come from each and every segment of the life science industry. Over the course of 2024, multinational pharma represented the largest proportion of life science leasing by RSF at 28%, followed by life science, product, service and devices, 22%; private biotech, 21%; biomedical institutions, 15%; and the small segment, which Joel referred to was public biotech at 14%. Now looking towards 2025, a few notable trends on the horizon. First the FDA is expected to maintain its healthy pace of novel drug approvals. In 2024, the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, CDER approved 50 novel therapies. While the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, CBER approved 8 novel gene and cell therapies. Notably over the past two decades, the average number of annual approvals has more than doubled, a tremendous win for patients. With respect to incoming appointees, we don't expect significant disruptions at the FDA. The new administration's nominee for FDA Commissioner, Dr. Marty Makary is a surgeon and public policy researcher at Johns Hopkins that is highly respected by the medical community with deep clinical trial experience. In the interim the administration has tapped Sara Brenner a career FDA official as acting Commissioner of the agency. Second, we anticipate Life Science M&A will continue to pick up. Given impending patent cliff, pharma companies are seeking to backfill their pipelines with innovative medicines through private and public biotech acquisitions. With potential for larger deals given a more lenient SEC environment. This M&A cycle is vital as returns to investors are then reinvested in the next generation of innovative companies. We benefit from M&A across our regions through upgraded tenant, credit post-acquisition, and in some cases expanded footprint from the pharma acquirer over time. Third, we expect strong follow on market performance for public biotech companies with value driving clinical data. Vaxcyte exemplifies this trend, having signed a 250,000 square foot expansion at our San Carlos mega campus in Q4. However, public companies lacking key value inflection points will likely face continued downward pressure, while the IPO window will be limited. These dynamics may contribute to sustained volatility in indices like the XBI throughout 2025. Fourth, Venture financing will remain strong and will be concentrated on fewer but larger Life Science deals as evidenced by over 120 financings exceeding $100 million in 2024. Private biotech\u2019s continue to take a conservative approach to space decisions, prioritizing just in time needs that align with their mission critical life science infrastructure requirements. Our dynamic mega campuses with their unmatched flexibility and scale are ideally positioned to meet this demand. There will still remain large uncertainty as macro conditions such as interest rates weigh on all industries. However, the long term outlook of Biotech remains incredibly bright and we are hyper focused on capturing the most promising life science companies today that will drive significant demand in the future. To put it into perspective, over the last 30 years, the size of the public biotech market has increased 20x. With only 10% of diseases with approved therapies and innovation accelerating at an exponential pace. The industry continues to have massive growth potential. With that, I will pass it over to Peter. Peter Moglia : Thank you, Hallie, I'll echo Joel's comments that the resilience of our people has been nothing short of astounding and the support from their colleagues inside and outside of the Los Angeles area confirms that we have an extraordinary group of individuals, who've shown that they're not only exceptional in what they do for the company and what they do for their friends and neighbors.  It's no surprise as it's notoriously tough to get a position within Alexandria, because Joel famously requires our team members to not only be the best in the world at what they do, but to also care about our mission deeply, which at its core is about helping humanity. I'm going to discuss our development pipeline leasing supply, and value harvesting, asset recycling, and then hand it over to Marc. In the fourth quarter, we delivered 602,593 square feet into our high period entry submarkets, bringing total deliveries for the year to 2,457,963 square feet, covering 13 projects. The annual incremental NOI delivered during the year was approximately $118 million, including $55 million in the fourth quarter. Another $395 million is expected to deliver beginning in 2025 through the second quarter of 2028. The initial weighted average stabilized deal for 2024 deliveries was 6.7%, supported by a solid stabilized deal on cost of 7.1% from our fourth quarter delivery. Development and redevelopment leasing activity for the quarter was low at 13,000 square feet due in part to linger in conservatism from life science company boards. Companies are prioritizing organic growth and delaying expansion plans until they have a critical need for the space, which is why just in time inventory that is turnkey and ready to occupy is most attractive to current demand. This trend can be seen in the least percentages of our pipeline. Projects expected to fully deliver in 2025 and 2026 are 89% and 70% leased or under negotiations with signed LOIs respectively, while projects delivering in 2027 or beyond our 15% lease or under negotiation; and I echo Joel's comments, we have a lot of work to do on those projects. Alexandria's pipeline is well-positioned to capture future demand when expansion needs arise. Our dominant existing tenant base allows us to get in front of many requirements before they reach the market and our location, scale and sponsorship matter a lot to tenants as we statistically illustrated at Investor Day. Transitioning to leasing and supply 5,053,954 square feet was leased during the year representing a 17.3% increase from last year, and 1,310,999 square feet was leased during the quarter, which was a 47.3% increase compared to the fourth quarter of \u201823. Rental rate increases for the year were consistent with guidance at 16.9% and 7.2% on a cash basis, and we're 18.1% and 3.3% on a cash basis for the quarter. Net effective rents remain positive despite elevated availability, and there was strong early renewal activity reflecting the tenant's appreciation of our location, scale, and sponsorship. With respect to supply statistics, we presented a deep dive into them at Investor Day and not much has changed. So in lieu of rehashing that, we'd like to highlight a couple interesting trends observed in JLLs recent Boston Lab market overview as they validate a lot of what we spoke about at Investor Day. First, JLL indicated that there is a flight to quality for both geography and ownership, 40% of all Urban lab leases signed in 2024 were in Kendall Square, 33% were in Watertown, 21% were in Fenway and Seaport, Alexandria's Urban submarkets, meaning that only 6% of leases were transacted in other submarkets. According to JLL, 1/3 of the leasing deals were signed by Alexandria and another experienced owner. This is proof that location and sponsorship really matters.  Second, JLL estimates that at least 1/3 and probably closer to 40% of today's available lab space is made up of zombie buildings. Meaning the building is un-leasable because it's either a bad office conversion, undesirable location, and or an inexperienced owner further proof that location quality and sponsorship matters. We're very pleased to have executed a strong finish to the year within our value harvesting asset recycling program by closing on over $1.1 billion of transactions in the fourth quarter, bringing our total for the year to be approximately $1.4 billion included in our self-funding capital plan. As presented at Investor Day, our 2024 strategic dispositions exemplified that we continue to have a very solid portfolio of diversified assets, providing us with strategic optionality. Approximately 36% of our sales were to investors, 42% to users, and 22% of the transactions were land sales. The investor sales and user sales were a combination of stabilized and non-stabilized assets with the latter requiring downtime and significant capital to stabilize. In all cases, these assets were deemed by executive management and the local teams to no longer fit our core strategy. We have provided cap rates for the stabilized transactions that range from 6.3% to 7.4% on a cash basis. It should be noted that none of these sales were in the super core life science submarkets coveted by investors. The other large sales of note were the properties with vacancy or near-term lease expirations in Cambridge and the UTC submarket of San Diego. We are bound by confidentiality agreements. Our commentary must be limited here. With respect to the Cambridge assets, the economics were significantly driven by the inclusion of 215 First Street, a historical building primarily improved as an office building. In addition to current vacancy and significant occupancy loss expected over the next two years, the asset will require material CapEx beyond leasing costs to stabilize the building in the future. The University Town Center assets have a similar profile with respect to current vacancy and future occupancy loss. The Cambridge and UTC assets served us well over time, but they are no longer part of our core mega campus strategy and the opportunity to monetize the assets by receiving capital today and avoiding CapEx in the future is a prudent and disciplined strategy. As we look to 2025, we are confident we will continue to meet our self-funding goal with our value harvesting asset recycling program continuing to drive the transformation of our asset base into the mega campus strategy that provides the location, scale, and sponsorship prioritized by today's high quality tenant base. With approximately $540 million in pending transactions, subject to non-refundable deposits or executed letters of intent and or purchase and sale agreement negotiations, we're off to a great start. So with that, I'll pass it over to Marc. Operator : Joel Marcus : We're checking with him. Marc Binda : Can you hear me now? Joel Marcus : Marc, you there? Marc Binda : Yes, I'm here. Can you hear me? Joel Marcus : Yes, we can. Marc Binda : Thank you, Peter. This is Marc Binda, CFO. Hello, and good afternoon, everyone. First I'd like to pause for a moment to recognize many of our Alexandria team members who've been personally impacted by the horrible fires that have plagued the Los Angeles area over the last few weeks. Second, congratulations to the entire Alexandria team for the outstanding execution during the quarter, including the tremendous capital recycling of $1.1 billion completed during the quarter. We reported solid operating financial results for the fourth quarter and the year. Total revenues and adjusted EBITDA were up 8% and 11.6% respectively, over 2023, primarily driven by solid same property performance and continued execution of our development and redevelopment strategy. FFO per share as adjusted was $9.47, up 5.6% over 2023, and up 36% over the last three years, which represents the highest percentage growth amongst the 15 ARE equity healthcare index over that time. On internal growth, our solid operating results for the quarter continue to be driven by our disciplined execution of our mega campus strategy. Tremendous scale advantage, longstanding tenant relationships and operational excellence by our team, 77% of our annual rental revenue comes from our collaborative mega campuses, and we hope to increase this steadily over time. We have high quality cash flows with 52% of our annual rental revenue from investment grade and publicly traded large cap tenants collections remain very high 99.9%, and adjusted EBITDA margins were strong at 72% for the quarter and represent the second highest quarterly margins reported since 2019. On leasing, an important takeaway for the quarter is the continued solid leasing volume driving our business. Leasing volume for the quarter was 1.3 million square feet, which represents the fourth consecutive quarter over a million square feet, and creates great momentum as we transition into the New Year. The quarterly volume also included 273,000 square feet of previously vacant space. The largest amount in the last five quarters. Leasing volume for the full year \u201824 was 5.1 million square feet, up 17% over the prior year, and up 19% compared to the seven year historical period prior to 2020. We continued to benefit from our tremendous scale, high quality tenant roster and brand loyalty with 84% of our leasing activity over the last 12-months coming from our existing deep well of approximately 800 tenant relationships. Rental rate growth for lease renewals and releasing space in \u201824 was solid at 16.9% and 7.2% on a cash basis. For the quarter, it was 18.1% and 3.3% on a cash basis. We continue to achieve very healthy lease terms on completed leases with 9.5 years on average for the quarter, which is above our historical 10-year average. TIs and leasing commissions on renewals and releasing space for the quarter was elevated on a per square foot basis due to two large long term leases signed in San Francisco and San Diego. But importantly, these costs were fairly modest for the year when considered as a percentage of the total rent over the lease term, which was 80.4% for the full year \u201824 and ranks as the second lowest percentage over the last five years. Our non-revenue enhancing expenditures, including TIs and leasing commissions on second generation space have averaged 15% of net operating income over the last five years including the last three that have all been below the five year average. Looking forward to \u201825, we do expect this ratio to tick up a bit due to the repositioning activities at Technology Square and 409 Illinois. On same property NOI growth was solid at 1.2% and 4.6% on a cash basis and 0.6% and 6.3% on a cash basis for '24 and the fourth quarter \u201924 respectively, driven by solid rental rate increase, the pickup in same property occupancy and some burn off, of free rent benefiting the cash numbers. Our outlook for full year \u201825 same property growth is consistent with our prior outlook at down 2% and flat on a cash basis at the midpoint. These projected results for 2025 include the impact of approximately 2.6% and 3.4% on a cash basis from the 768,000 of lease expirations expected to go vacant in 1Q\u201925 spread across four projects. As a reminder, the two largest components of those key lease expirations relate to Alexandria Technology Square with a move out and expansion to another Alexandria Property by Moderna and our single tenant building at 409 Illinois in Mission Bay. We made great progress on these specific upcoming lease expirations with 136,000 square feet already leased under negotiation with most of the balance under our ongoing discussions with several prospective tenants. We expect downtime on these spaces on average to be at least twelve months given time to complete construction work. We expect same property results to be impacted starting in 1Q\u201925 with some offsets to the cash results for the burn off of free rent across the rest of the same property pool over the first half of \u201825. Turning to occupancy. Occupancy for the quarter was solid at 94.6% which is consistent with the steady results over the last five quarters. The midpoint of our guidance range for occupancy for year-end \u201825 is 92.4%, which includes approximately 2% vacancy coming from the four projects with 1Q\u201925 lease expirations expected to go vacant that I described earlier, and are described on Page 24 of our supplemental package. During the quarter, we continued to execute on our development and redevelopment strategy by delivering 603,000 square feet from the pipeline, which will generate $55 million of incremental annual net operating income. We have 4.4 million rentable square feet of development redevelopment projects that are projected to generate $395 million of incremental annual net operating income over the next 3.5 years, including $83 million in 2025 from projects that are at least or negotiating around 89%. We also expect to see significant growth in incremental annual net operating income on a cash basis of $70 million from executed leases as the initial free rent from recent deliveries burns off over the next three months on a weighted average basis. Turning to buybacks, on December 9, we announced that our Board had authorized a common stock purchase program of up to $500 million. To date, we've repurchased $200 million under the program including $50 million in December, and $150 million in January at an average price of $98.16. Subject to changing market conditions. We will continue to monitor additional share repurchases under the plan and expect to fund any repurchases on a leveraged neutral basis through the end of \u201825. As a reminder here, our guidance range for acquisitions and other opportunistic uses of capital is zero to $200 million. So with the share repurchases completed in the first quarter, we're already on the high end of our guidance range for the year. Turning next to the balance sheet, we continue to have one of the strongest balance sheets amongst all publicly traded U.S. REITs. Our corporate credit ratings continue to rank in the top 10% of all publicly traded U.S. REITs. We ended the year with low leverage of 5.2x for net debt to adjusted EBITDA consistent with the average of our year-end leverage for the last five years. We have tremendous liquidity and we have one of the longest debt maturity profiles amongst all S&P 500 REITs with only 14% of total debt maturing over the next three years. Transitioning next to funding, we continue to be focused on our discipline funding strategy to recycle capital from dispositions and to minimize the issuance of common stock, which has been nominal over the last two years. Huge congratulations to the Alexandria team for the tremendous execution during \u201824 with 1.4 billion of dispositions completed, including 1.1 billion of dispositions completed during the fourth quarter across 12 different transactions with about half of that coming from stabilized dispositions with a weighted average cash capitalization rate of 6.9%. Important to note here that the stabilized dispositions completed in the fourth quarter were primarily located in suburban Boston, Northern Virginia, and RT Submarkets, which comprises a small fraction of our overall asset-base. In the fourth quarter, we did recognize impairments aggregating $186 million, which was primarily comprised of the following. First $40.9 million for properties at One Moderna Way and Route 128, which was sold to our longstanding tenant for $369.4 million during the quarter. And second, $102.8 million primarily related to multiple land parcels located in San Diego, some of which were sold in the fourth quarter, and many of which will close next year. The team continues to be laser focused on the execution of our capital plan. As Peter mentioned, we're after a great start. We have pending 2025 disposition subject to non-refundable deposits or contract negotiations for $539.5 million, of which about half of this represents anticipated sales of land, and in total represents about a third of the midpoint of our guidance for next year. In addition to dispositions and sales of partial interest, we also expect to fund a meaningful amount of our equity needs next year with retained cash flows from operating activities after dividends of $475 million at the midpoint of our guidance for next year. Our high quality cash flows continue to support the growth in our common stock dividends with an average annual increase in dividends per year of 5.4% since 2020, and we continue to have a conservative FFO payout ratio of 55% for the quarter. On venture investments, quarterly realized gains from venture investments included FFO per share as adjusted since 2021 have averaged about $25 million a quarter. For 2024, realized gains include an FFO per share, we're just slightly above our historical rate at about $29 million a quarter on average, or $117 million for the full year and $32 million in the fourth quarter. Our outlook for 2025 is consistent with the most recent run rate for the full year of 2024. Turning the guidance, we reaffirmed our guidance for 2025 with a $150 million change to our 25 sources of capital to reflect the closing of certain dispositions that were originally expected to close in 2024 and are now expected to close in 2025. There were no changes to midpoints of our guidance ranges for EPS of $2.67, and FFO per share diluted as adjusted of $9.33. As a reminder, we view our projected \u201825 FFO per share midpoint as flat relative to 2024 after considering the approximate $0.14 impact from the Alexandria Technology Square ground lease extension completed last year. In closing, as we reflect on the fourth quarter and the full year of 2024, we're pleased with the tremendous execution with solid FFO growth of 5.6% in a very tough macroeconomic environment. With our tremendous scale, high quality cash flows, deep industry relationships, and our highly experienced management team. We're well-positioned to continue reinforcing our dominant platform and strategically position us for future growth. With that, I'll turn it back to Joel. Joel Marcus : Okay, operator, we can open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan. Anthony Paolone : Yes, thank you, and hi everyone. My first question is Joel, I think you alluded to the first quarter here going to or trending toward having a really strong leasing picture. I was wondering, if you could give a little bit more color on that in terms of whether that's in the core or with regards to the development pipeline or the types of leases, just maybe a little bit more detail there on the comments. Joel Marcus : I prefer to make them on the first quarter, but I would say heavily, it's kind of spread among the various items you talked about. So it's not necessarily one single one. Anthony Paolone : Okay. And then just, if we look at your, the development spending guidance for the full year. Can you remind us, how much of that is related to projects that are kind of in process versus ones that you might want to start? And I guess where I'm going with the question is given the buyback, would you consider maybe moving any capital from that bucket to maybe further buybacks or thoughts there. Joel Marcus : Yes, so Marc, you could comment on that. Marc Binda : Yes, we do break that out in the back, Tony, I'd say, but the lion's share is related to active construction projects, it's $1.2 billion out of the $1.75 billion. But yes, take your point there. There's not a ton of new projects expected to start vertical construction next year. Anthony Paolone : But should we take it as though this it sounded like from your comments. If kind of hearing it right that the 150 you've done on the buyback puts you at the high end of your acquisition kind of opportunistic purchases guidance, and that's kind of about it or is there room for that to go further. Joel Marcus : Yes, I wouldn't assume that to be the case, but let us refresh that in the first quarter, Tony, much like I think the leasing color will give you on rollovers, vacant space coming back to us the development pipeline, et cetera. But give us that room. But that's current guidance, but we will definitely update it and it could change. Operator : Rich Anderson : Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Another leasing question, maybe I'm going to get shut down again like Tony, but, on the 768 and the 336 that you have leased in a lot of it's under discussion, would you say you're running at, or where you were at investor day in terms of plan? Or do you think you're running ahead of plan? Just any -- Joel Marcus : Yes, I can answer that question ahead of plan. Rich Anderson : Ahead of plan. And then, in terms of the G&A savings for 2025, can you talk about that? I mean, it's kind of fortuitous timing around maintaining some level of reasonable FFO well, in this case, flattish FFO growth for 2025. Where did that come from? Like how did that sort of materialize and sort of hit the books in 2025? If you can give some finer points around that. Joel Marcus : Yesterday -- I'll ask Marc to make comments, but let me give you kind of a frame. So yesterday we filed our 10-K, so you can look there in MD&A. We've got savings and legal expenses, IT expenses, payroll and payroll related expenses, other G&A expenses and some benefit programs. So I don't know, Marc, if you want to make any other comment, it's pretty broad and also software implementation, et cetera. Marc Binda : Yes, no, nothing to add there, Joel. Rich Anderson : And then, lastly for me, Joel, the big picture question around, I guess I could say politics, you sounded like fairly optimistic about 2025 with the new administration although, there's some interesting tactics going on around the HHS. I understand that, certainly regulatory pauses are a part for the course for new administration, but it does feel like it may be more aggressive this time, would you say there's any concern about where things are headed from a policy point of view, or are you absolutely confident that despite some of the questions that maybe are in place today, that this is a step back and a several step forward type of situation that you're looking at? Joel Marcus : Yes, I would say compared to the last administration, it's like night, the dark of night, and the light of day. Just FTC commissioner alone is one, we've also got -- I think Hallie gave you some idea. I mean, our industry is primarily governed by the FDA, and I think both the nominee and the interim are both highly skilled people. So we feel very good and we don't see any abatement of the pace of approvals both on biologics and non-biologics. And I think when it comes to HHS as an overarching area, I mean, over the past four years, you had somebody who didn't even know what healthcare was in a political appointee, Javier Becerra from California. So whether RFK Junior gets it or not, and I know there's a lot of controversy about that, that probably won't have nearly as much impact as the FDA. Also on the NIH, we feel that, the nominee there will be a solid nominee. The NIH kind of lost its way, as you know, it lost credibility during COVID. It certainly withheld, I think, accurate reporting on the cause of COVID out of the Wuhan lab. I mean, we understand BSL4 labs and things like that. And it's pretty clear that, we funded gain of function work there and people were getting sick as early as the summer of 2019. And that was on the NIH and they went from a merit-based award system to a mandated award system. And I think in the province of science, you want best science project to win, not just somebody who's mandated to win for the sake of it. So I think the NIH has a fair amount of work to do to kind of clean house, but it is a fantastic agency overall that funds some of the most important core research, the substrate of a lot of, ultimately, therapeutic products that come out, and we would imagine that, that will continue. If you look micro to us, we don't have a whole lot of exposure to the NIH directly other than a few leases, which are actually long-term leases in the Maryland market. But I think I'm pretty optimistic. Operator : The next question is from Wes Golladay with Baird. Wes Golladay : I just want to go back to that comment about just-in-time leasing. What does that mean for your 2026 developments? Would that be more back half leasing this year? Would it be all the way until next year that we see lease in there? Joel Marcus : So Peter, do you want to maybe frame that? Peter Moglia : Yes. Certainly, things that are delivering in 2026 are just not top of mind for folks that are deciding they need space and then go out to the market and identify things within 60 to 90 days. Joel Marcus : Yes, that's the biotech sector. So keep that in mind. Peter Moglia : Yes, but we certainly do have our existing tenant base that just loves our platform, loves our operations, and it's been very loyal. So we certainly do see ourselves getting things done in 2026. I think I mentioned we're 70% lease or under negotiations, which means we have signed LOIs for 70% of that space. So the other 30% will likely come from our existing tenant base or potentially some new tenants, but those are in pretty good shape. It's getting into '27 where we're still too far out for folks thinking. So we're going to do our best to generate some more activity there, but the market is really just looking at things that they can get into in a very short time or a relatively short time frame. But the '25 and the '26 leverage is in pretty good shape. Joel Marcus : Yes. So maybe with respect to that because I think it's worth noting, Hallie, do you just want to run through the percentages of leasing of the sectors because I think this is where people get 100% focused on biotech and they lose focus of the rest of the industry. So maybe just run through those for a minute, sorry to bear with us. Hallie Kuhn : Yes. Yes, absolutely. And as I mentioned in my remarks, and this is particular to the just-in-time leasing comment that is for more of the earlier-stage companies. If you think about a privately funded companies and they could be incredibly well-funded, but are a small portion of our overall ARR and for this past year, they -- private biotech, they reflected about 21% of our leasing and a good portion of those, as Peter said, were from existing tenants and then public biotech in particular, right, which has had certainly the most challenges in terms of access to capital, very much have and have-nots, represented about 14% of our leasing. So when we talk about just-in-time leasing it's very much focused on companies where it's going to be leasing that, say, 20,000 square foot space. We're not talking about the much larger requirements where that takes a lot of time from both parties, right, to really find a solution that works both for existing and new tenants. Wes Golladay : Okay. And then maybe just 1 quick follow-up. Any regions standing out from a development -- or from a demand side from the leasing? And is there any, I guess, non-biotech non-pharma, more so the AI tenants, any of those come in into the portfolio? Joel Marcus : Well, I think that I don't want to really give competitive information out. But I think we see good activity in the key hubs. The slow one, as I mentioned, was South San Francisco. But I think the good news is our presence in Mission Bay, which we developed after the decade after the great financial crisis has seen a huge boom in AI anchored by OpenAI and a number of other AI companies are moving or looking at space and certainly looking at San Francisco as a critical lynchpin base for that talent. So we're pretty optimistic about that. Operator : The next question is from Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Vikram Malhotra : I guess, Joel, just bigger picture, leasing velocity is sort of critical now given sort of deliveries hopefully coming in towards the back half, but critical for the industry, critical for the ARE story as well. Can you just -- I know you don't want to comment on 1Q, but just even bigger picture, how do you anticipate leasing inflecting? Any numbers you can share like tenants in the market or even just how the pipeline has changed Q-over-Q just feels like that's a critical piece. And I'm wondering if you can just share some statistics how '25 could evolve versus '24? Joel Marcus : Yes. I think that's the kind of question that I'd really prefer to leave for first quarter when we can give you, I think, more granularity that we feel comfortable with. Remember that the bulk of our tenants in the variety of sectors we service under the life science industry as a whole that Hallie mentioned come from our own tenant base. So we have a really, really good picture, over 800 tenants of each and every market and what the demand is quite apart from what people that the brokers may represent or what they see, they often don't see much of what we see. And oftentimes, we may sign leases or LOIs where brokers simply aren't aware of those things. So I don't really want to get into first quarter. I want to kind of get into the details there. So I'd ask you just to be patient and bear with us. But I think we're going to have some pretty good news. But I think the key to me is, as I said, is the biotech sector, apart from the other sectors who've been pretty active. That's going to take really the Fed to get their [bud] in gear. And hopefully, this administration is -- can kind of jawbone that to happen, that also impacts the servicing of debt, it impacts cost of living because people are paying outrageous interest rates on credit cards and loans and things like that. It seems to me that's the key. And that's what's going to open up the next biotech bull market. We hope it's not as wild as the last one, but one that's measured and steady. But I think that's really the secret there. And remember, I think House term comes up early '26 and you can be assured that Trump is going to replace them. Vikram Malhotra : Got it. Maybe perhaps if you could give us some relative color across sort of the key -- the 3 key submarkets and we've been hearing more and more pick up in San Diego, maybe a little bit in South San Francisco. But just like that mix of tenants you gave us overall, like how does the relative strength of each of the markets are today? Joel Marcus : Yes. I think we see strength in Mission Bay, not so much in South San Francisco and Mission Bay has driven biotech, institutional and now artificial intelligence. San Diego has been an overall good market because it's a great place to live. And it's much more affordable. The Bay Area still has a -- it's an enormous span of distance and still the highest cost of living, I think, in the U.S. As far as biotech markets, by and large. And I think Boston remains very, very steady, at least at the heart of Cambridge and the submarkets. I think Peter went through some of the leasing there. So I think the only sore thumb, I would say, is South San Francisco, again, kind of a really -- kind of a reckless oversupply there by people who really didn't know what they were doing. And then South San Francisco also suffers from being primarily a biotech market. So you've got those 2 things at work that really hurt it compared to, say, Mission Bay, which is more institutionally based and now AI-based. So that's kind of a little bit of the lay of the land. Vikram Malhotra : And then just sorry, last one, if I can clarify. You mentioned you feel pretty good about the lease-up of the development into '25, '26 maybe '27, the question starts, but would there be factors that cause you to pause any of the developments in either '25 or '26, push it out into '27 say? Joel Marcus : No. I think what Marc published in the press -- the [indiscernible] and press release is our best guess of how we think our allocation of capital should match the demand we're seeing. So I don't expect any material changes certainly to '25 or '26 post this print. Operator : The next question is from Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Tom Catherwood : Sticking with leasing for 409 Illinois and Moderna's previous space at Tech Square. Two questions on that. First, Marc, I think you mentioned 136,000 square feet of signed or negotiating leases. Was that those 2 buildings? Or was the 4 buildings with vacancy? And then the second part is on 409 Illinois and Tech Square -- Joel Marcus : So that's Tech Square. But I don't want to get any more granular than that. The 409 Illinois, remember that's a building that sits right next to -- it's got a water view, right next to UCSF and right next to the Chase Center and one could imagine the biotech company there exited, but the demand in -- for that building in South City is really, I don't mean South City. Mission Bay is heavily institutional and AI related at the moment. So I think we have fairly good optimism on that. And the location is superb. Tom Catherwood : Got it. And is that building competing against -- I mean, as tenants are looking at is it competing against new construction? Is it competing against second gen space? And kind of how does it stack up across the domains of the -- Joel Marcus : It depends on who depends on who the tenant is. Smaller tenants probably prefer existing space, bigger tenants probably for new space, but it's so dependent on -- you can't generalize it, so tenant dependent there, Tom. Tom Catherwood : Got it. Appreciate that, Joel. And then last one for me, Hallie. I want to go back to your comments about M&A, specifically the idea that deal activity provides investors with a liquidity event and can lead to reinvestment back in life science companies. Is an increase in M&A alone enough to boost early stage in biotech investment? Or do we also need a kind of sustained rebound in IPO activity to get there? Hallie Kuhn : Yes. I think it's a holistic mix across the board. But I would say, and we see this historically that there's always this balance between IPO activity and pharma licensing deals and M&A, right? It's all about where is capital coming from? And is there a source of capital and so I think we could see a really strong year for M&A and continued and very healthy investment in private biotech companies without the IPO market opening. I don't think they're mutually exclusive. M&A at the end of the day is really the lifeblood of this industry. If you look at pharma across their current revenues, around 2/3 of that came from acquired products, right? They really rest on innovation coming from private and public biotechs. And I think investors get those returns and are going to put them to work. So I think we'll see what the IPO market does. Certainly, the IPO market opening up is another avenue for capital, but that also doesn't mean it's the right choice, right, being a public company is hard. And so I think as we look to M&A, it's very positive overall, and this continues to be very significant drivers for pharma looking for that innovation. Operator : The next question is from Dylan Burzinski with Green Street. Dylan Burzinski : Just wanted to touch sort of on leasing economics. I know over the last 18 months or so that new development leasing economics have deteriorated given the supply pipeline and drop off in demand. So just curious, sort of as you think about the current environment and expectations moving forward. I mean, is it your sense that TIs and [indiscernible] have sort of stabilized at these higher levels and then sort of expectations for that over the next 12 months? Joel Marcus : Peter? Peter Moglia : Yes. I mean it's -- the TIs today for new construction are essentially turnkey if it's a biotech type of tenant not so much if it's a larger institutional or pharma tech company that you can still do a traditional deal there where you kind of split the TIs between the landlord and tenant, but it is still 50% higher than it was pre rocket ship years. But as far as the demand is looking outside of the institutional and pharma company. The demand is looking for a turnkey space. That's what the market is providing. Thus -- and we understand we need to be and we're adjusting our economics accordingly. We see that other [indiscernible] and see free rent are definitely stabilizing. I think we're reaching the bottom of the fundamental collapse. But we'll see as we report in the next few quarters. Dylan Burzinski : That's helpful. And then maybe just on the disposition side. I know you guys talked a little bit about sort of the buyer profile of the 4Q dispositions. But as you guys are sort of continuing to bring assets to market, I mean, are you seeing institutional real estate firms come back and kick the tires in terms of deploying capital in sector? Or is it still largely maybe your one-off family office-type money or your owner users that are mostly in bidding tenants today? Peter Moglia : So we haven't had a lot for sale on the institutional quality side. We had a nice sale last quarter, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Institute with a user sell. So we haven't tested that market yet to tell you whether or not there's the strength of demand, but we do meet with institutions that are current partners and folks that want to be partners on a fairly regular basis, and we keep getting assurances that life science is something that they want to be in at some level and they want to be in it with Alexandria. That's probably the takeaway. We had a meeting, a couple of us had a meeting in San Francisco recently where one of our partners, which is a very large institution said, \"hey, look, we've invested in a lot of different folks. And one of the lessons we've learned is we need to focus our life science investors with you\", that was a great meeting, a great takeaway. We've been telling people that. But I think it's -- it all ties together with what I talked about in my commentary about supply, like these zombie buildings, right, about 40% of the inventory in Greater Boston probably won't lease because it's just not good quality, the sponsor has no experience, and it's in the wrong location. And unfortunately, some institutional investors were so hyped up about life science, they funded some of that stuff, and they've learned their lesson. And so I think you're going to see life science and a lot of institutional real estate portfolios from here on out, but it's going to be with us or it's going to be with somebody else that at least has scale and experience, and there's a couple of others. But all these other flyby night want to be developers that try to get into space are just going to fail. And some of these institutions to money will be lost, but they're not going to be soured on it because they know it's a good business. They know there's a use case for life science real estate, and they know we're the ones that they may be partnered with. Operator : Next question is from Omotayo Okusanya from Deutsche Bank. Omotayo Okusanya : I just wanted to focus on some of the capital allocation as well as cost savings plan. Maybe you could just help us walk through the $32 million in expected savings at the midpoint. How quickly that could potentially happen? And then also just taking a look at the stock today trading below where you did the first $200 million of buyback. So just kind of curious how you kind of think about the remaining $300 million of buybacks and how quickly and under what circumstances that could happen? Joel Marcus : Yes. Thanks for your question. Marc, do you want to maybe address those? Marc Binda : Yes, I can address the first one, I had a little problem to hear the second one. But on the first one, on the G&A, I think the fourth quarter had actually some pretty significant savings relative to the third quarter. And in fact, '24 in total compared to '23 actually had pretty significant savings. If you strip out the acceleration of stock expense from last year, there was still -- I'm talking about '23, there was an $11 million amount of savings to G&A in '24 versus '23. So obviously, our guidance assumes that, that trend will accelerate into '25. We're expecting $30-plus million of a decline. But I think the fourth quarter should be encouraging to give you a sense for what we can accomplish. I think, at that run rate that actually is right around the run rate that's implied in our guidance for 2025. So I think the fourth quarter is sort of good evidence that we can accomplish what we expect to in terms of G&A savings headed into '25. Joel Marcus : Marc, just comment globally on the buyback where we are. Marc Binda : Right. Yes. So yes, I would definitely refer back to Joel's earlier comments. We've bought back $200 million, $50 million last quarter, $150 million in January. Our guidance assumes 0 to $200 million. So we've already blown through $150 million of that this year in our '25 guidance. So I think stay tuned. As Joel said, we'll continue to evaluate it. But as we stand here today, that's what we've got in guidance is really not much more, but we'll continue to monitor that as market conditions change. Operator : The next question is from Jim Kammert with Evercore. Jim Kammert : Is there any thematic content to be extracted regarding the lease-up of previously vacant space? And I'm suggesting that are these tenants that otherwise might have gone into some of your new developments and they're doing sort of timing over leases? Or if there's any, I'm curious because it's been picking up quarter-over-quarter that you're leasing up the vacant space. Joel Marcus : Well, again, remember, Jim, with 800 tenants and a pretty big stable in each of the core cluster markets, we have pretty good insight into the different sectors and what their needs are. So I would say it's very case-specific and really hard to generalize. Jim Kammert : Fair enough. And then finally, looking at Page 40, you look at your probable retained cash flow over the next 3 years and can you compare that to your remaining commitment to fund the developments at least in the near term. Is it reasonable to assume that maybe '25 sort of peak here in terms of absolute dollar dispositions? Joel Marcus : Yes. Well, Marc, you can comment on that. Marc Binda : Yes. Well, I would say this, we've seen construction. The construction dollars has come down the last couple of years, right, with the amount of deliveries has been outpacing the amount of projects that have been going in. We've got -- obviously got pretty good visibility here through the end of '25 on what that looks like, but '26 is -- it's a little far off to -- for us to kind of give you a sense for where construction dollars might be. So I guess stay tuned. Operator : The next question is from John Kilochowski with Wells Fargo. Jamie Feldman : This is Jamie Feldman with John. Joe, we're very sorry to hear that the wildfires had so much impact on your company and such a difficult impact on the team. But to that end, I wanted to go back to your comments regarding the handling of them when you started the call. So you're one of the largest commercial real estate landlords in California. What are your initial thoughts on the long-term impact to your business to owning commercial real estate in California in terms of political changes, any initiatives, insurance costs? I mean, what do you think the long-term implications are here? And also for incremental dollars, are you leaning towards investing in California or away from investing in California as a result of all this? Joel Marcus : Yes. So let me frame it, and then I'll ask Marc to come in. I would refer you to the 10-K, which addresses a number of the points of your question. But I think if you look at our portfolio, San Diego, I think, is in very good shape and doesn't have particularly a great exposure to the wildfires, most of which start in Hill Country. South San Francisco, I think the same is true there, not particularly exposed. So I think overall, the bulk of our assets are in really good shape. I think it is possible that because of the lack of preparation even though it was well known several days ahead of time that we're going to have 100-mile an hour winds and what that means during a very dry season. I hope the electorate here in California rethink how they elect local county and state officials and think about the election here of the current mayor versus one that lost, I think he's going to come back, Rick Caruso. You have a choice of a political person, all their lives versus someone who's a business person who operates real estate, who headed the police commission. So I think people are going to search for more common sense practical leadership. And I think that is kind of 0I hope where California is headed and not take on kind of foolish policies. I mean I lived in the Palisades for many years, and I was evacuated twice during the time I lived there and finally just gave up. In fact, my house overlooked the reservoir that was dry. And during the days when I was there, I never saw it dry. So how could a reservoir in a high fire area be dry during the fire season makes no sense. But anyway, so I think we're well protected in California. But Marc, do you want to comment anything further. Marc Binda : Yes. No, just to say that, obviously, in California, we've got a concentration of assets mostly in San Francisco and then San Diego. San Diego is the region that's probably got more exposure there to wildfire obviously, really unfortunate what's happened here in Los Angeles. But I can tell you that the company has taken climate resilience across the portfolio very seriously. It's been something that we've adopted really as part of a -- as part of the design into our buildings as well as operationally doing what we can to kind of harden our facilities and put ourselves in our tenants and their science in the best position to deal with a potential fire. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And I guess just if you think about some of the policy initiatives that are even on the table, and I know it's very early. I mean is there anything that you think could have a longer-term impact on operating expenses or your appetite to be in California? And then similarly on the insurance front? Joel Marcus : Well, I think you have to remember 2 of the 3 major clusters are in California. So this is an industry that's a knowledge-based industry and intellectual industry. And so you have to be where that tenant base or where that knowledge base is because that's where tenants cluster and hire from. And as I say, I think San Francisco, our assets there and the nature of San Francisco is in good shape [pray] fires, I think same thing in San Diego. I think insurance is a big issue. The state has made it much harder for insurance companies to operate here and make a profit here and do right by their policyholders here, and I would hope that changes whether by the ballot or whether by maybe current people just getting a lot smarter and acting more prudently. But we don't tend to exit California when it comes to our holdings in the Bay Area or San Diego. But as Marc said, we've taken extraordinary steps from our -- whether it be fire, water, any kinds of other natural disaster hazards earthquakes as well. And I think our insurances were well insured. And I think we've done a really good job of risk management, and we report to our Board quarterly on that issue. Jamie Feldman : Okay. Thank you for your thoughts on this. I know it's a sensitive topic and our thoughts are with your team. Joel Marcus : Yes. It's an amazing number of people who've been dislocated unfortunately. Operator : The last question today is from Michael Griffin with Citi. Michael Griffin : Hallie, maybe going back to some of your comments on the VC funding environment and capital flowing to more established firms with marketed products, I realize after a funding round, these types of tenants might expand their space. But do you need to see a greater increase in capital flows to the more start-up type tenants that could go from 5,000 to 50,000 square feet in order to see the cadence of leasing pickup? Hallie Kuhn : Yes. As the previous question when this came up, you have to keep it in context of what portion of our overall ARR, right, is coming from that portion. So 9% of our overall ARR comes from private biotech. So while certainly, that contingent is important and is a driver of lease-up, right? It's not, would say, reflective of our entire portfolio, right? We've really built a very diverse set of tenants to help enable, right, kind of broad demand as the market conditions change. And I would say, from a funding perspective, it has come down off the peak of '21, and we're looking at, I would say, a pretty strong funding environment going into '25. There's a lot of dry capital that venture investors have on hand to deploy. So it remains to be seen throughout the year, how that evolves. As Joel mentioned, there are still a lot of macro factors that are dampening right activity just in a more risk-off environment. So certainly tracking it closely, and we'll provide an update as the year goes on. Michael Griffin : That's helpful. And then just maybe one on sort of the transaction market and activity there. You called out kind of expectations for cap rates at your Investor Day of the low to mid-7s, but given the move we've seen in the 10-year, and I guess, it's anybody's guess whether or not the new administration's policies will be inflationary. Are you taking into account if it yields your return hurdles might be higher for prospective buyers given the current interest rate environment? Joel Marcus : Yes, Peter? Peter Moglia : Yes. Yes, we have -- I think we take into account what we have to sell and the quality of it and then just to average it to give you the numbers we gave you at Investor Day. So yes, we're comfortable at this point that we can achieve those numbers. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks. Joel Marcus : Just thank you, everybody, and we look forward to talking to you on the first quarter call. Thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
