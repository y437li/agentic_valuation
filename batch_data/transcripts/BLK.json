My name is Carmen, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated First Quarter 2014 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Matthew Mallow. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will a question-and-answer period. (Operator Instructions). Thank you. Mr. Mallow, you may begin your conference. Matthew Mallow : Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. Before Larry, Gary, and Rob make their remarks, let me remind you that during the course of this call we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results will of course or may of course differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which list some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. And as we usually warn you, BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So with that, let the call begin. Gary Shedlin : Thank you, Matt, and good morning everyone. It's my pleasure to be here to present the results for the first quarter of 2014. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results, and as usual I will be focusing primarily on as adjusted results. BlackRock delivered first quarter earnings per share of $4.43, up 21% compared to 2013. Operating income was $1.1 billion, 15% higher than a year ago, reflecting continued revenue growth and a decline in G&A expense. First quarter non-operating results reflected $69 million increase in the market value of our seed and co-investments, which were impacted by the monetization of a non-strategic opportunistic private equity investment. The first quarter as adjusted tax rate was 30% and we continue to believe this remains appropriate planning assumption for 2014. Underpinning our results was continued organic growth despite volatile market conditions in the first quarter. We saw $27 billion of long-term net new flows, representing an annualized organic growth rate of approximately 3% with organic revenue growth once again outpacing organic asset growth notwithstanding the volatility which impacted our shares during the quarter. Our highly diversified multi-client platform generated more than $5 billion of net flows across each of our Retail, iShares, and Institutional businesses. First quarter revenues were $2.7 billion, up $221 million or 9% from a year ago, and were driven by continued growth in base fees, performance fees, and revenues from BlackRock Solutions. We once again experienced year-over-year base fee growth across all long-dated asset classes. Base fees increased to $162 million or 8% from a year ago as average assets on our management increased as a function of organic growth, market appreciation, and the acquisitions of the Cr\u00e9dit Suisse ETF and MGPA real estate businesses. Base fees were roughly flat compared to the fourth quarter and part due to change in our AUM mix, which was impacted by relatively weaker data in markets with higher fee products and a lower day count in the first quarter. Performance fees for the quarter increased $50 million from a year ago, primarily due to a performance fee associated with a planned final liquidation of the opportunistic 2007 vintage closed-end mortgage fund that was partially liquidated in the fourth quarter. This fund now holds only a residual balance with limited additional performance potential. BlackRock Solutions revenues of $154 million were up 22% year-over-year and were roughly flat compared to the fourth quarter. Our Aladdin business, which represents 71% of BlackRock Solutions revenue in the quarter, was up 10% year-over-year. Sequential results were once again impacted by the timing and recognition of certain revenues as we continue to onboard a number of very large clients on to the Aladdin platform. Our Financial Markets Advisory or FMA group continues to post strong revenues. Now this quarter reflected a higher level of revenue associated with asset disposition assignments in prior quarters, the FMA group continues to develop a more institutionalized advisory model with a focus on helping clients navigate and implement requirements for the changing regulatory environment. Expenses for the first quarter rose $80 million year-over-year, driven primarily by increases in revenue-related items including compensation and direct fund expense, partially offset by a decline in G&A expense. Compensation expense increased from a year ago broadly in line with growth in the overall business. As we have previously noted, the first quarter adjusted compensation to revenue ratio generally runs higher than the full year due to the seasonality of payroll taxes, which increased year-over-year due to appreciation of BlackRock's share price.  : Our G&A expense in the first quarter also benefited from a delay in the timing of certain expense items, including marketing and promotional spend which will be incurred throughout the remainder of 2014.  : We remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by reinvesting in our business and returning excess cash to shareholders through a consistent and systematic capital management policy. As previously discussed, we announced a 15% increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.93 per share of common stock. We also repurchased an additional $250 million worth of shares during the first quarter and are committed to maintaining a steady level of repurchases during 2014. BlackRock's financial results reflect the breadth and depth of our investment and distribution platforms. Our first quarter results reflect continued focus on key strategic themes including income, outcomes, alternative, and strategic data, as clients look to both active and passive vehicles to meet their evolving long-term investment needs. We continue to see strong growth in global retail. Retail long-term net flows were $14 billion for the quarter, representing 11% annualized organic growth rate and were positive across all asset classes. International retail once again demonstrated strong results generating long-term net inflows of $9.8 billion representing a 25% annualized organic growth rate. Equity flows of $4 billion were led by our top performing European equity suite, while fixed income net inflows of $2.5 billion were driven by demand for our short duration, unconstrained and high yield bond products. Multi-asset net inflows of $2.7 billion reflect the continuing momentum in our global allocation fund, a key component of our bundled outcome oriented family of products. U.S. Retail's quarterly long-term net inflows of $4.2 billion, representing annualized organic growth of 5%, were led by fixed income's continued success in our duration managed product suite. We also saw accelerated interest across our diversified retail alternative platform with $1.5 billion of net inflows. Importantly, our global long/short equity fund, managed by our SAE team saw accelerated flows in the quarter with each of global long/short equity and global long/short credit attracting more than $700 million in net new assets during the quarter. Global iShares generated $7.8 billion of net new business in the quarter driven by fixed income flows. In the face of market volatility iShares continued to deliver the efficiency, liquidity, and performance our clients expect from the leading global ETF provider. In total, iShares equity flows for the quarter generated nearly $1 billion in net new assets, which flows into developed markets more than offsetting outflows of nearly $8 billion from EEM, our flagship for emerging markets ETF. In recent weeks, however, we have witnessed a change in emerging market sentiment and flows have reversed with approximately $4 billion coming into EEM since quarter-end. The global ETF industry experienced strong fixed income flows during the quarter and iShares was well-positioned to capitalize on investor demand with a diverse suite of offerings across duration and style. For the quarter, we captured the number one global market share of industry fixed income ETF flows generating approximately $6.6 billion in net new assets, including $4.6 billion from Europe. Our institutional business generated $5 billion in net long-term inflows for the quarter. Strong passive net inflows is $17.6 billion were partially offset by active net outflows of $12.6 billion. Overall results were characterized by a number of sizeable client inflows and outflows driven by a variety of factors. Within passive, we saw both rerisking and increased usage of Liability Driven Investing or LBI as clients rebalanced their pension plan taking advantage of strong equity markets and improved funding ratios. As markets and interest rates continue to rise, we expect to see more of this type of immunization activity. That said we also saw the redemption of single large LBI assignment in connection with the annuitization of a client's pension obligation. Active outflows were driven by several factors including corporate events and legacy performance issues. Active fixed income flows were impacted by a single $6 billion outflow driven by the acquisition of the client by an entity affiliated with a competing asset manager. Fundamental equity flows were negatively impacted by a large subadvisor redemption, which was linked to legacy under-performance. Finally despite continued strong overall performance we also experienced outflows of approximately $4 billion in SAE, including a significant client redemption that we were able to leverage the breadth of our platform to capture a larger passive mandate from the same client. Larry will discuss performance in more detail but we believe that our current investment performance in both active fixed income and equities is strong and competitively well-positioned. During the quarter, we also saw continued growth in targeted institutional sub-segments including the client contribution where we generated more than $8 billion of net inflows with particular strength coming from our LifePath, target based suite and passive equity offerings. In institutional alternatives, net inflows into hedge funded funds were offset by capital return and other liquid products. However, strong fundraising continued in illiquid alternatives with more than $1 billion in commitments raised for the fifth consecutive quarter. Across retail and institutional clients, we saw almost $2 billion of core alternative flows during the first quarter, the highest category flows we have seen four years. Overall, the quarter again demonstrated the consistency and stability by our diverse platform and we continue to believe that we are well-positioned for the remainder of the year. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry. Laurence Fink : Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. While the first quarter marked the fifth straight quarterly rise for the S&P 500, equity markets experienced significant intra quarter volatility. Central Bank policy continued to be a key focus area. Global economic indicators fluctuated relative to expectations and the market attempted to digest heightened geopolitical concerns, all of which impacted asset prices. Volatility continued in early April as valuation concerns and short-term de-risking drove the worst week for domestic equity market since 2012. And I expect this type of volatility is likely to impact markets for the remainder of the year. The industry has seen positive mutual fund flow throughout this latest market setback. That's a good sign that long-term investors are actively engaged helping to offset hedge fund deleveraging. In the midst of these challenges BlackRock clients' goals remain consistent focused on investing to improve their financial futures. More than ever our clients, both institutional and individuals need to think beyond the next new cycle and the next quarter to meet their long-term investment objectives. BlackRock's focus on long-term strategic themes, like outcome-oriented investing, retirement and longevity allows us to have a differentiated conversation with our clients and to provide them with the advice they need to meet their long-term goals. Our client dialogue is enhanced by our ability to integrate technology and risk management into our investment approach and harness our collective intelligence across the entire firm. BlackRock attracted $27 billion in long-term net new flows in the first quarter, which again reflects the diversity and breadth of our business with positive contributions coming from all client types, all asset classes, and all regions. We have more products on more buy list than ever before. The level of RFPs we're involved in and the level of client interest across our platform from active and passive and increasingly in alternatives continues to rise, and we're seeing momentum in important long-term asset classes like infrastructure where investments we've made on our platform are beginning to pay dividends. My focus and the focus of BlackRock's leadership is on capitalizing the opportunities we see to deliver the solutions our clients need. We recognize these opportunities must start with a strong investment performance and performance is at the foundation of the BlackRock culture. We structured our business to give portfolio managers the technology, the risk management tool, and a forum of information sharing, and at the end giving them autonomy to promote the superior investment performance that our clients expect. One significant differentiator for BlackRock is BII or the BlackRock Investment Institute. By bringing together our investment professionals to daily meetings, topical investment forums, and knowledge sharing events, BII heightened the best ideas from our top investors and shared some of the most interesting solutions with our clients. We're focused on fostering in an environment of information sharing to benefit our portfolio managers while which would ultimately enhance performance for our clients. We are benefiting from that enhanced performance across our fixed income business where 89% of our active fixed income AUM is above benchmarker peer medium for three years. We are also seeing strong performance in many areas of alternatives, multi-asset and equities, including European and Asian equities, and we fully expect the same from our new equity teams in the U.S. We talked at length about the work we've done to address performance issues in our U.S. equity business. This quarter, we saw $4 billion of outflows related to a legacy performance in that business primarily driven by a loss of a very large subadvisory assignment. We recognize that our fundamental equity performance was not in line with our clients' expectations; it required a significant investment and talent. We made these investments and we remain encouraged by the performance of our new teams. Since the new teams joined BlackRock over the past two years, our U.S. basic value improved from the 51st percentile to the 7th percentile, our large cap core from the 76th percentile to the 16th percentile, and our large cap value from the 97th percentile to the 37th percentile. These are the trends that we continue to expect and through these trends we expect to see investors asking BlackRock about what we could do for them in active U.S. equities. As we know from our experience in restructuring our active fixed income business several years ago, the process is costly and it takes time to build long-term scalable track records. The results we are seeing today in terms of fixed income performance inflows highlights the reward from successfully executing on this type of overhaul. BlackRock is committed to bring in the top-tier alpha producers and we are confident that the moves we made in our active U.S. equity business will position ourselves to achieve that goal. Fixed income represents a meaningful opportunity for BlackRock. The fixed income ecosystem is going through significant changes. The industry is witnessing a heightened period of client interest and on all fronts BlackRock is positioned to win. The competitive landscape in fixed income is evolving, which highlights the importance of strong performance. As we start to see a shift in the performance paradigm among industry leaders BlackRock has the product and the investment performance in place to attract flows from both retail and institutional clients. As we've discussed on prior calls, the industry has experienced a shift from traditional, long duration fixed income to more flexible, unconstrained products as clients access the risk of duration they have under portfolios. This theme drove a substantial portion of double-digit organic growth we saw in our global retail business. International retail, we saw growing momentum in our unconstrained fixed income global opportunity fund which raised over $900 million during the quarter. And in the U.S., our flagship strategic income opportunities fund continue to generate strong investor demand with $2.7 billion of flow in the quarter. SIO has generated $10 billion of flows in the last five quarters and now stands at early $14 billion of AUM. What began as a retail theme early last year is now resonating with institutional and defined contribution clients as well. We invested nearly $1 billion in SIO during the last quarter. Fixed income demand on the institutional side is also been driven by early signs of pension plans taking advantage of improved funding ratios to rebalance and immunize portfolios, and BlackRock experienced strong LVI flow this quarter as a result. Clients are also increasingly looking to ETFs to manage their fixed income portfolios. A Greenwich Associates report on the institutional use of fixed income ETFs found that one of five non-users plan to start investing in fixed income ETFs in the coming year, while two-thirds of existing users have increased their usage since 2011. Survey respondents named iShares as their preferred provider of fixed income ETFs with pricing, the liquidity and breadth our product offering their top considerations. Fixed income is a growth business for BlackRock and it has our largest flow category in the first quarter. The breadth of our product offerings and performance meaningfully in excess of our key competitor positions us well for the continuing rotation within fixed income and to gain market share as the landscape continues to evolve. Our platform breadth and diversity of our deep relations with clients are also a differentiator for BlackRock. Gary spoke about some of the large flows we saw in institutional business this quarter and BlackRock's ability to bring a variety of products and service oriented solutions to clients often position us to recapture what would otherwise be lost opportunities. In the case of one pension risk transfer to an insurance provider, although mandates moved away from BlackRock due to successful execution of an LDI mandate, we want a BlackRock Solution assignment to perform monitoring and valuation on that same asset pool. The service transition was made possibly by our existing relationships, our strong management capabilities and risk management capabilities and reputation, which includes providing Aladdin or Aladdin risk support services to 12 of the top 35 insurance providers globally. As a fiduciary it is critical that BlackRock not only provides the investment performance and solutions our clients need but also to take a leadership role in advocating for the best interest and those are the broader markets and the economy. That's why last month I sent a letter to CEOs of every company in the S&P 500 urging them to focus on the long-term to make investments in their businesses that will create opportunities and drive future growth. BlackRock believes it is our responsibility and obligation to maximize the value of the assets our clients entrusted us, and that prudent management practices and strong leadership by boards of directors promoting company's long-term successes and to lead a better risk adjusted return for investors. BlackRock is also working actively with regulator to help build constructive solutions that improve the financial ecosystem for all investors. We recently submitted a letter, comment letter to the Financial Stability Board to address concern over the impact asset managers might have on market stability. While we share the FSB's desire for a safer market environment, and we agree with our focus on products rather than firms, we argue that leverage rather than size should be the primary stream when determining the appropriate level of regulatory scrutiny. We will continue to engage with regulators and policy makers that help insure that regulation is appropriately focused on where risk may exist at the product and at the product level and the practice level. Looking forward, we remained committed to partnering with our clients around the world to deliver them all that BlackRock has to offer. Last week, we hosted our Institutional Client Conference where we spoke with more than 100 clients on paving new pass to achieve outcomes for those who entrust us with our assets. On June 17th, we will be hosting our second Investor Day to discuss key drivers of future growth for BlackRock. I'd like to close by taking a minute to talk about BlackRock's focus on our talent. Talent is something we as a management team and our board of directors review continuously in order to build a deep bench of senior executives. We view setting high standards for talent as a core responsibility to best serve our clients and investors. We are excited to have a variety of senior leaders stepping into new roles and to welcome a number of senior hires to BlackRock. Those new hires include Salim Ramji, who was a senior partner in McKinsey & Company, will be joining the firm later this month as our new Global Head of Corporate Strategy. Chris Jones will be joining BlackRock as our Chief Investment Officer and Head of Fundamental Equities for the Americas and Co-Head of our Global Fundamental Equity team. And Helen Zhu recently joined to help BlackRock in our Chinese Equity business. Our talent strategy reflects a focus effort we have taken to develop our people and enhance our culture. We are committed to rotating leaders into roles that present them with new challenges, driving their responsibilities, and maximizing their impact on the firm. These efforts to develop and invest in top-tier talent will serve to drive BlackRock's long-term growth and to enhance both the experiences of our clients and the value it deliver to shareholders. As always, I want to thank our employees for a dedicated service this quarter in helping our clients to build better financial futures. With that, I will open up it for questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Your first question is from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Ken Worthington - JPMorgan: First, I would like to see if you could talk about the level and the outlook for institutional fixed income investment dollars in motion. You called that in the press release the shift towards unconstrained and you talked in the call about short-term strategies, but taking this from another angle would you expect the amount of money in motion to increase further given the high profile performance and management stability issues at PIMCO and to what extent has this already started and, based on your past experience, what kind of scale of opportunity is there here? Laurence Fink : I don't ever comment on our competitors. PIMCO is a fabulous investment firm so and Bill Gross has been a friend of mine for over 40 years, not that quite long about 38 years so. We're in a great position; we're seeing increasingly more dialogue from institutional clients than we've seen before. We began to see accelerated inflows on the retail side but now we are in more dialogue with more consulting firms, advisory firms to pension fund. So corporations are looking at how they should look at fixed income. Some of it is -- some of the movement is towards unconstrained into like SIO products. And let me just speak about BlackRock and reiterate having close to 90% of our products above their benchmark and some of them are in -- and many of them are in the top quartile now is a reason why people are coming to BlackRock both institutionally and retail. Where we are beginning to see some increased dialogues though, Ken, is in defined contribution side where this is an area where we had very little penetration on the fixed income side, we had large penetration on the index equity side. So we are now enjoying more flows retail and institutional and in all components of institutional, and I believe we will begin in the second and third quarters to see an acceleration in terms of money in motion as you called it in the fixed income universe. Ken Worthington - JPMorgan: All right. Thank you. And then to follow-up, can you talk about the performance of the core alternative strategies so far this year? We're seeing some hedge fund strategies suffering pretty weak absolute returns earlier in this year and I'm interested to hear how your various strategies are performing and maybe which areas are performing better and which areas are performing worse? Gary Shedlin : Well, you're correct in saying there some hedge funds that have done very poorly and that was heavily oriented towards the macro strategies. Our macro strategy hedge fund has relatively poor performance. However, our single hedge fund strategies or fixed income hedge fund strategies have all done quite well, and in fact we took advantage of some of the pain within the marketplace over the last two months. I would say overall we performed very strongly in our hedge fund strategies. Our multi -- our long/short equity or long/short fixed income hedge funds where we're seeing some very large flows both retail and institutional we had good performance. So we continue to see acceleration in conversations in the alternative space too. Two areas that I would like to highlight on the outside where we're beginning to have a total change in dialogue one is our real estate area where we have had performance issues out five years ago. And we have changes of leadership there, we did the acquisition of our teams and we are now in more dialogues on real estate than we had been in many, many years and infrastructure. Infrastructure we brought along a team over three years ago and we are now starting to see accelerating flows into our infrastructure alternative area. We're about $2 billion and I expect to see a doubling of flows over the next 12 months to 24 months in our infrastructure area. This is an area that I think is going to, we're going to have to continue to do invest in. As we think about the world going forward, there is a greater and greater need for infrastructure in the developing world, in the developed world and most certainly in the U.S., and we believe this is a great asset category for many of our investors. And so we look at this as an area of extreme growth. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse : Just want to circle back on institutional fixed income specifically LDI. I thought it was interesting that the mandate wins here seems to be really concentrated in passive and not active. So first, do you think we need higher rates for this rate to really accelerate? And then, will these wins you think reside mostly in a passive business or a mix between active and passive? Laurence Fink : Well LDI is a means in which you're trying to minimize risk and I do believe because of the growth in passive fixed income strategies in the ETF area and in obviously in the index side it's a great product for moving into LDI. So I would say there would be a higher propensity for investors seeking passive strategies and active strategies for LDI. But I think you're going to see in some care areas a growth of may be the unconstrained product areas into LDI also as a way of having a diversification in terms of fixed income strategies. But you should assume when people go to an LDI strategy they're essentially de-risking and a component of that de-risking is staying pretty current on to an index and this is why you're seeing a higher propensity to go into passive strategies. Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse : Thanks, and just my follow-up here on the illiquid alt business which is mostly a retail phenomenon. Which specific types of platforms and investor basis are really demanding these products and I'm really thinking about what your long/short credit and long/short equity fund? Laurence Fink : I'll let Rob talk about that. Robert Kapito : So the retail base is thirsty for alternatives, and so long/short credit and long/short equity but both global are important for the retail base. And we've launched since 2011 six '40 act alternative products; they continue to raise money. In the first quarter alone it was $1.4 billion, and that's driven as I mentioned by the long/short credit, which has had very good performance as well as the global long/short equity funds, and each of those has raised over $700 million putting them in the selling fund. So it's really a retail thirst and of course that's coming from what else is available to them which is low rates on the fixed income side, and sometimes using dividend fund as a surrogate. So they need that double-digit returns and that's where we're seeing the interest from. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Robert Lee - KBW: First question is on just about a year-and-a-half I mean two years ago you made a move to combine the ETF and the retail distribution force. Just curious if there any way of quantifying or color you could give on what impact you may be seeing that has in terms of hoping to drive ETF flows and you like you're still at the early stages of that or is that kind of been helpful run rate so to speak? Laurence Fink : So we are still at the earlier stages in that and what it gives us the ability to do is have more holistic conversations with our clients because clients own both passive and active whether they describe that an index funds, ETFs, or active portfolios. So most clients have been focused more on asset allocation and this way having people I can talk both sides of that conversation really resonates with them creating portfolios that are much more sticky going forward or that when there's an asset allocation they will asset allocate within BlackRock because we can offer the whole slate of products. It has taken a while to get that underway because it requires a significant amount of training combining the sales force to have that and also to, in a sense, upgrade our sales force to be able to talk more holistically. So while we've seen success it's still in the early stages and we expect more to come on that. Robert Lee - KBW: And maybe as a follow-up you've had really strong retail organic growth outside the U.S. Maybe give a little bit color on maybe by geographic region or country kind of where you're seeing that and kind of if there is any specific markets that I believe or by -- I know there's the odd equity business I guess in the UK, but any color there would be helpful? Laurence Fink : Rob, it's been very broad based, it's been so gratifying. It's throughout EMEA and Latin America actually. Areas of great growth have been really, I would say the core of Europe, Italy, Germany, Switzerland where we saw very good flows. So it just continues to dominate, and then even in Asia I don't know retail flows about $2 billion came from different countries in Asia. So it speaks very broadly about our global footprint and our growing brand recognition in PacAm, in Europe and in Asia and we continue to drive a strong position as an independent asset management platform working with our distribution partners worldwide. But also let me -- also say what is a key driver to the success is the expansion of high performing products whether it's our performance in fixed income, our performance in European equities, active equities where we're in the top decile for five years, and our growing success in Asian equities where we have Andrew Swan now with about two-and-a-half years under his belt at BlackRock with exceptional performance. So it is about our positioning worldwide globally, but it also the underlying component of that success is a growing success in our active product suite. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matthew Kelly with Morgan Stanley. Matthew Kelly - Morgan Stanley : First, I wanted to just touch on the ETF landscape and there's been a lot of activity both iShares and in competitor. So I'd just be curious how active we should expect you to be on the new product launch perspective and where your efforts are focused both by product and region, and where you've seen the most interest from some of your competitors? And maybe that's a better question for Rob, either of you. Laurence Fink : Yes, let me just give you a macro view and let Rob get into the granularity of products. But if you look at -- we had real large movements within the ETF space. In the first few weeks of January, we had up to $8 billion of outflows in EM, which was pretty disconcerting. Since that we had $4 billion of inflows. But importantly, since quarter-end, which is all public, so I can talk about it, we've had $10 billion in net inflows in our iShares products. So year-to-date we're over $17 billion of net flows. At quarter-end we were approximately $7.5 billion, so huge change in momentum. And so getting into the both the competitive landscape change, generally when you have more I would say more of an international flavor of investing we benefit, when it's more of a domestic flavor some of our competitors benefit. But I would tell you we're in a very good position to remain a leader in the ETF business in 2014. Rob, why don't you go talk about some of the products that we're launching and we're proposing and\u2026 Robert Kapito : So we focus on what our clients' needs are the changing landscape in the markets. So we have eight new products already this year. And we're currency hedged to our enhanced international equity products and the other are fixed income. Obviously, there was a very big demand for short duration due to the fact that people -- most people thing that interest rates at some point have a higher probability of rising and there has also been a lot of interest in the municipal area. So we're going to be very opportunistic, we're going to follow the lead of our clients. And in some cases we're going to grow market share and in some cases we're going to take market share where we may have been late to the gain but we see an opportunity and people respect the brand, our ability to have the best tracking errors and liquidity in the marketplace. So we're going to go out in both of those. But we're going to continue to be -- have our nose close to the marketplace. And we will be very active in new products that we believe that we can have scale. Matthew Kelly - Morgan Stanley : Okay, great. And then my follow-up is, I'd just curious to get your thoughts as a management team on the recent changes in the UK budget and impact on pension markets over there and where you're kind of -- where that -- where BlackRock is positioned to potentially benefit from any of those changes that they can throw? Robert Kapito : Well, I'm glad you asked that because this is a huge opportunity for us and we spend a lot of time and effort developing our retirement products around the world and I think you heard Larry talk a lot about the need for retirement products. And what you're talking about is really the UK pension reform where there will be less money going into the annuity product and more money going into products that are created for retirement. And as you know you've heard us talk about our extensive U.S. DC experience with our LifePath products and our floating products. We estimate that this opportunity in the UK alone could be about $25 billion in assets that might have gone into annuities that now will be, as Gary likes to say, money in motion. So we intend to put a lot of effort on putting together more retirement products to capitalize in this market. And I think BlackRock is uniquely positioned because of our multi-asset strategies and our product development, specifically tailored to the retirement area of which almost two-thirds of our assets at BlackRock are retirement related. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Chris Harris - Wells Fargo : So Michael Lewis caused quite a stir with his book that came out this month. And Larry, just wondering where you guys stand on the whole debate about market structure, whether you think the markets are rigged or whether you think regulators should be doing more to kind of level the playing field, if you will? And just kind of asking this question because giving your size and obviously you guys have a lot of influence as to how the market structure unfolds? Laurence Fink : Well, we have invested tens and tens of million of dollars for making sure that the high frequency traders did not arbitrage us. We looked at it is a fiduciary responsibility making sure that we always provide our clients best execution. And we only do execution with the reputable counterparties and market venues. So this is something that we've been focused on for years. Obviously, it's a piece of -- it's a book that quits, obviously greater public awareness and we think there should be greater public awareness on these activity. But this is something we've been focused on for years, it is not -- our behavior has been consistent that our job as a fiduciary and get the best execution. We believe that market structure should always be there to be protecting investors. We believe in the concept of equal access of information. We believe in the concept of simplification of order types and message orders. So this is something we've been living with it may be in the public purview but this has been as a component of the market for years and years and years and I think I spoke about this in the past few quarterly updates that we have been vigilant in making sure that we're building adequacy in terms of our trading platform that we are providing best execution for our clients. That's what I care about more than anything else that we are there making sure that with all of the new technologies that we are not been arbitraged or that we have more friction cost in our execution. Because of the high preponderance of our equity holdings or index, as you know, we have to be so mindful of friction related to trading. And so this is why we've been very aggressive making sure we have that we focus on best execution, and I think this is a story that should be discussed, but this is a story that we've been aware of for years and have addressed it internally in terms of our platform. Chris Harris - Wells Fargo : Understood. Thank you very much for that. And just really quick follow-up on the business. You called out the performance of some of your newer team members and they're really having a very good impact, just kind of curious to get your thought, how long do you think it's going to take for the better performance to really start moving the needle on flows. Do you think it might take something like three years to really start getting a lot better or in your experiences could we start seeing a bigger opportunity? Laurence Fink : I want to say bifurcated market. In alternatives you could have no track record and announce a strategy and if the strategy makes sense, we've seen this in the marketplace; people are able to raise money. So it really depends on the product itself as we are beginning to see some nice flows and certainly much more dialogue in our Asian equity platform where we have just under a three-year track record there. It takes more than a year for the key, I would say, on products like large cap core and large cap value and it may be three to four years -- two to three-year type of process. After three years, I think you then get on many buy lists across the board. Robert Kapito : Some of these teams though actually that have joined the -- Laurence Fink : Have carried. Robert Kapito : Have a following. So even though they didn't have a track record here, they are bringing with them track record. So we are now that they're onboard we're seeing those people be more willing to move now that they know they have settled in with us, so we will see some flows from there. Laurence Fink : And that's the key if they continue to have the performance that they had at their prior place, we can benefit early. But in terms of our witnessing what happened in fixed income, in that case it was really more than a three-year process in which we needed to reprove ourselves because we had such a strong position in fixed income, we lost it, and it took three to four years of building that team back and building the performance back up. I don't think there is anyone straight line that's the way that we have review all the different products, it really depends on the circumstances around the team and the product itself. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Marc Irizarry with Goldman Sachs. Marc Irizarry - Goldman Sachs : Larry, can you talk about the growth of fixed income on constrained. It's interesting that you're now seeing I guess an institutional interest for SIO. Is that a trend, number one, the expected institutional interest will continue to drift towards on constrained you're seeing that may be with allocations? And then relatively are you concerned at all about capacity and maybe trading friction in fixed income as the quest for returns in yield, goes more sort of off index, if you will? Laurence Fink : Unquestionably we are in more dialogues with more public and private institutional plans than ever before on the concept of some form of unconstrained. It may not just be SIO there are other products, we have FIGO, we have other types of products. So we are and we're looking at creating more unconstrained type of product, so it may not just being one. And we are beginning to see more interest on the defined contribution side for unconstrained. So I think this is going to accelerate in a very large way. Unquestionably anyone specific product like an SIO will have, see this could not be $100 billion fund, it was never designed to be something like that but do we have quite a bit of bandwidth and capacity for the near about future absolutely. And so we're not concerned about capacity at the moment in any one of our products. But it -- this is just beginning, this groundswell towards -- moving towards an unconstrained type of fixed income product. I think this will accelerate and I think it will become a very large -- well it is a very large component of our dialogue with institutions worldwide today. The -- what is second part of your question? Marc was that -- did I answer that? Marc Irizarry - Goldman Sachs : Just in terms of trading? Laurence Fink : Oh, trading. Yes, friction cost. There is no question as balance sheets of the dealers are more contained you see wider spreads than fixed income. I don't think this is a long-term problem, it may be a short-term problem; it will move, it will create more movement towards exchange trading for fixed income. And I do believe this is one of the reasons why more interest in ETFs and fixed income. So you don't have to focus on a bond, you could focus on ETFs that have maturity or ETFs that are connected to benchmarks. And so this is one of the reason why we think fixed income ETFs will grow dramatically over the course of next two years. But there is no question, there is times of great illiquidity and fixed income as dealers have cut back their capital associated with fixed income. And at times it represents larger friction cost than other times, but I do believe that will create a faster evolution towards more exchange traded fixed income platforms. Operator : Your final question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Michael Carrier - Bank of America : Gary, maybe a few number questions. So I think you mentioned and you saw it in the release just on G&A, there were some items that were real estate benefit. And then I think non-op gains were a bit elevated and then same thing with performance fees. So I guess any color around some of those lumpy items? Gary Shedlin : Sure. So on the G&A expense, as we mentioned the current quarter reflects what we call a dilapidation reversal, which is a function of some building we have over in London that obviously artificially reduced expenses for the quarter. As we also mentioned, there were some lower expense due to timing of the spend; the most major component there is our MMP spend that we called out on a variety of quarters. The fourth quarter as you know was actually impacted in many cases by the opposites, we had higher MMP spending during time and we have some lease exit cost and a variety of other accruals. So I think if you listened carefully, which I'm sure you did, in the fourth quarter we tried to walk you through what portion of our fourth quarter G&A increase was kind of tied to our continued growth of the business and we really haven't changed our view on that at that moment. So I think that the type of analysis you guys generally did in the fourth quarter looking at the first quarter, we still standby. In the non-op side, you correctly mentioned that the non-op was driven by the monetization of the non-strategic opportunistic key investment that was really tied to some years ago where we had a little bit of different strategy around potentially growing our off business, which obviously has changed at the moment. And so I would say again there that the street generally was fairly consistent in terms of estimates of our non-op with the exception of that one-time item. And I think on performance fees we really talked about it. I mean, we mentioned in the fourth quarter this is really the final piece of that liquidation. And at the moment, we would expect that most of the performance fees to be generally recurring in nature tied to our core goals business. Laurence Fink : But as you think about business, we are going to have return of capital, successful monetizations of these things, this is the normal course of business and also this is why we have to continue to have an engine of growth of new products and this is one of the key components of it. Gary Shedlin : And in connection with that again another $1 billion of commitments that were in the quarter which takes that up for now five consecutive quarters. So keep in mind that those numbers are not hitting our net new business flows until the capital is actually deployed, and once that capital is deployed it then obviously becomes available both to generate performance fees in the future. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks? Laurence Fink : Just thank you for your commitment in investing in BlackRock. As I said earlier, I think the quarter is an example of the diversification of our business model, of having a strong presence in active and passive and fixed income and equities and alternatives and it really shows up quite well in our first quarter. And probably the other two major point that I would like to lead everybody, during the course of the quarter as we had this extreme volatility and market movement, every day during the volatility we had consistent inflows, which leads me to say that much of the market movement was more of a hedge fund oriented fast money type of behavior, long-term investors were committed to putting money to work and we saw no change in investor behavior in the first quarter. Also as a statement towards -- as we look towards the second and third quarter, we have never been in more active dialogue with more clients, with more consultants, with more distribution partners about BlackRock products probably in our corporate history and hopefully we can show you at the end of the second quarter that those dialogues turn into commitments. Once again, thanks for all the support, and I want to thank all the employees for all the support. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today\u2019s call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Matthew Mallow. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Mr. Mallow, you may begin your conference. Matthew J. Mallow: Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. Before Larry and Gary make their remarks, let me remind all of you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. And of course, we call your attention to the fact that BlackRock\u2019s actual results may differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which list some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. And as we usually warn you, BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So with that, let the call begin. Gary? Gary S. Shedlin: Thanks Matt, and good morning everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to be here to present results for the second quarter of 2014. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I\u2019ll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. as usual, I will be focusing primarily on as adjusted results. At our Investor Day last month, I reaffirmed the growth framework, predicated on driving organic growth, using scale to create operating leverage in a consistent capital management strategy. BlackRock executed on each of these drivers during the second quarter, resulting in continued earnings growth. We generated second quarter earnings per share of $4.89, up 18% compared to the second quarter of 2013. Operating income was $1.1 billion, 15% higher than a year ago. Non-operating results reflected a $37 million increase in the market value of our [Steed & Co.] investments. Recall that non-operating income in the second quarter of 2013 reflected $30 million \u2013 $39 million pretax gain related to PennyMac\u2019s IPO, and the results in the first quarter of 2014 were impacted by the monetization of a non-strategic opportunistic private equity investment. Our 24.8% as adjusted tax rate for the second quarter benefited from several favorable non-recurring items and an improved geographic mix of earnings. As a result of increased growth in our international businesses, we now estimate that 29% is a reasonable tax rate for the second half of 2014. And based on what we know today, 30% represents a reasonable projected tax rate for 2015. Our second quarter results were driven by $38 billion of long-term net new flows, representing an annualized organic growth rate of almost 4%. Flows were driven by our retail and iShares client businesses. As we discussed at Investor Day, faster growth in these businesses will drive favorable change in our revenue mix. And we once again saw organic base fee growth meaningfully outpacing organic asset growth during the quarter. Second quarter revenue was $2.8 billion, up $296 million, or 12% from a year ago, and was driven by continued growth in base fees, performance fees and revenue from BlackRock Solutions. We once again experienced year-over-year base fee growth across all long-dated asset classes. Base fees increased $257 million, or 12% from a year-ago, as average AUM increased due to organic growth, market appreciation and the acquisitions of the Credit Suisse ETF and MGPA real estate businesses. Base fees were up 6% compared to the first quarter, aided in part by the seasonal increase in securities lending activities we typically see in the second quarter. Performance fees for the quarter increased $26 million, or 29% from a year ago, driven by stronger performance in our broad suite of single strategy hedge funds, as well as certain long-only equity strategies. Recall that first quarter performance fees included a significant fee associated with the planned final liquidation of an opportunistic 2007 vintage closed-end mortgage fund. BlackRock Solutions revenues of a $146 million, was up 6% year-over-year, but down 5% compared to the first quarter. Our Aladdin business, which represented 75% of BRS revenue in the quarter, grew 11% year-over-year. Flat sequential quarter results for Aladdin were once again, impacted by the timing and recognition of certain revenue, as we continue to onboard a number of large clients onto the Aladdin platform. We anticipate that several of these large clients will go live in the coming months, generating revenue uplift as we move past the implementation phase. Our financial markets advisory business continues to transition from a crisis management orientation to a more institutionalized advisory business model with continued momentum in bank regulatory-related assignments, including ECB AQR and Fed CCAR diagnostics. As we mentioned in last quarter, FMA results have recently reflected higher levels of revenue associated with asset disposition assignments. While the second quarter of 2014 was also positively impacted by residual disposition activity, the revenue impact was at a lower level than recent quarters. Other income increased $17 million sequentially as a result of higher transition management service fees, earnings from certain strategic investments and real estate related disposition fees. Expense for the second quarter rose $145 million year-over-year, driven primarily by revenue related items, including compensation and direct fund expense and an increase in general and administration expense. While compensation as a percentage of revenue declined year-over-year as a function of aggregate levels and mix of performance fees and timing of certain accruals, quarterly comparisons are less relevant and our overall compensation policies have not changed. G&A expense increased $36 million year-over-year or 11%, driven primarily by increased occupancy and office related costs and other expense, including elevated legal and regulatory expense. Aggregate G&A expense in the first half of the year benefitted from a delay related to the timing of our total marketing and promotional spend, the balance of which is expected to be incurred during the remainder of 2014. Sequentially, G&A expense increased $64 million from the first quarter, primarily reflecting the timing of marketing and promotional spend, increased occupancy expense, reflecting the dilapidation reversal in the prior quarter and the previously mentioned increased level of legal and regulatory expense. Overall, total expense increased 10% from a year ago, compared to a 12% increase in revenue over the same period, resulting in an as adjusted operating margin of 42.4%, 110 basis points higher than last year\u2019s second quarter. We remain committed to a consistent and systematic capital management policy. During the second quarter, we repurchased an additional $250 million of stock, consistent with repurchase levels during the last few quarters and view that as a good planning rate over the balance of the year. Through both transformational acquisitions and targeted organic growth, we built the industry\u2019s broadest asset management platform. Our diversification whether in terms of clients, products or geographies is a critical component of our strategy and enables us to deliver more consistent growth and more stable financial results over time. Another element of our strategy is the growth opportunity in global retail. We saw long-term net flows of $13.1 billion during the second quarter; driving 10% annualized organic growth with positive flows across products and regions. results were driven by our outcome-oriented offerings, including multi-asset alternatives, and unconstrained fixed income and efficient beta. International retail, once again, demonstrated stronger results, generating long-term net inflows of $8.9 billion in the quarter. Equity flows of $2.9 billion were led by net inflows into index funds, which have witnessed accelerated activity as the post-RBR European distribution model evolves and demand for efficiently packaged retail investment vehicles increases. Multi-asset net inflows of $1.4 billion reflected continued demand for our global allocation fund, a key component of our packaged outcomes offering. Fixed income net inflows of $4.7 billion were driven by flows into short duration, unconstrained and high yield bond products, as well as index funds. Within international fixed income, we saw $1.4 billion of flows into our BGF Euro Short Duration bond fund and nearly $850 million into our Fixed Income Global Opportunities fund or FIGO, which is a cross-border version of Strategic Income Opportunities or SIO, our flagship domestic unconstrained fixed income fund. U.S. Retail\u2019s quarterly long-term net inflows of $4.2 billion were led by our duration managed fixed income suite and packaged outcomes, including our multi-asset income and global long/short credit funds. unconstrained fixed income continues to be led by SIO where we\u2019re seeing strong interest from both retail and institutional clients. We also saw growing momentum in our unconstrained Strategic Municipal Opportunities fund or SMO, which raised over $500 million. Global iShares generated $30.4 billion of net new business in the quarter, representing annualized organic growth of 13%, driven by strong equity flows. Organic growth for iShares over the last 12 months has returned to low double digits, consistent with our longer-term targets. Equity flows of $20.6 billion were driven by a rebound in emerging markets and demand for developed market exposures. In emerging markets, EEM generated over $6 billion of quarterly net flows and in developed markets; we saw continued demand across a variety of exposures and geographies. Fixed income net flows of $9.5 billion represented the leading share of fixed income ETF flows during the second quarter paced by flows into longer duration U.S. treasuries, investment grade corporates, emerging markets debt and high yield. The buy-and-hold segment remains an important growth story for iShares. During the quarter, we generated $5.5 billion of flows into the U.S. Core Series; while also extending its reach and launching a European version of the core. Our institutional business experienced $5.5 billion in quarterly long-term net outflows, as net inflows into institutional active mandates were more than offset by net outflows in index equities. Institutional active net inflows of $1 billion included $5.3 billion of net inflows into multi-asset class products, driven by continued demand for our LifePath target-date suite and fiduciary wins. Our strength in fundamental fixed income drove net inflows of $900 million with demand across unconstrained strategies; regional credit mandates and CLOs. Institutional active equity outflows included fundamental and scientific outflows of $2.4 billion and $2.1 billion respectively. We continue to experience outflows in fundamental equity products that are performance-challenged, though SAE outflows were primarily driven by partial redemptions from clients harvesting gains in appreciated portfolios. In core institutional alternatives, net inflows into alternative, hedge fund and private equity solutions mandates were offset by outflows in certain single strategy hedge funds and capital successfully returned to investors. Nonetheless, strong momentum continues in alternatives with an additional $1 billion of commitments raised in the second quarter. Since the beginning of 2013, we have raised $8.5 billion of commitments across alternatives, $6.7 billion of which has yet to be deployed. Future net new business will be generated as these commitments are invested. Institutional index equities experienced net outflows of $7.9 billion, driven primarily by portfolio rebalancing. In the face of strong equity markets and improved funding ratios, pension clients continue to rebalance their portfolios and as interest rates rise, we expect to see additional immunization activity if equity markets remain at or near current levels. This quarter once again, demonstrated the breadth and depth of our business model. BlackRock\u2019s diversification continues to enable us to deliver consistent results, one element of S&P\u2019s decision to upgrade BlackRock\u2019s credit rating to AA-, making us one of the most highly rated firms in the global financial services industry. At Investor Day, we elaborated on the strategy to achieve our growth targets. We remain confident that we have the right strategy, tools and talent to execute. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry. Laurence D. Fink: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call. thanks, Gary. The second quarter marked the sixth great quarterly rise for the S&P 500, and rising markets, equity markets across the globe. This was driven by growing confidence in the United States, and in Europe, and in pockets of outperformance in the emerging economies. The 10-year treasury is back to near 2.5%, the Fed continues to ease their bond buying efforts, and even in light of some of the recent volatility, the VIX is hovering near pre-crisis lows. Markets have been complacent in the face of this risk with down days quickly followed by elevated buying trends. Credit standards are loosening, cap rates are falling, and correlations remain very high, following the spring shakeup in the global momentum trade. However, the positive environment and the market gains we\u2019ve seen in the past several years have been driven primarily by accommodative policy decisions and coordinated central bank actions. More of the same won\u2019t be enough to move market forward from here. Corporate results and earnings growth will be needed to become larger drivers of valuation. That\u2019s where our attention has been, and in the past couple of days, we\u2019ve seen second quarter kickoffs with some bellwether names, posting very strong results. Investors are also going to have to focus more economic growth to justify driving asset prices higher. for that to happen, governments across the globe must take meaningful action beyond monetary policy. The United States needs to address issues like immigration and infrastructure, and readers like Prime Minister, Abe in Japan, and Prime Minister, Renzi in Italy must advance their reform agendas to produce tangible economic results. Around the world, infrastructure is a key area where governments and private capital providers can partner to drive long-term economic growth and job creation. At BlackRock, we remain highly focused on building a deep understanding of markets and evaluating risk from all angles. I believe that the accommodative policy we\u2019ve seen over the past five years will ultimately lead to increased volatility, as policy decision diverge and investors become more focused on the performance of individual countries, individual industries and obviously individual companies. It is our responsibility, as a fiduciary to help our clients to prepare for this type of shift by building durable portfolios designed to perform over the long-term. We do this by providing our clients with a set of capabilities and a client experience that we don\u2019t believe anyone else in the industry can replicate. We talked at our recent Investor Day about the key differentiators that set BlackRock apart, and that will enable us to drive long-term results for our clients and importantly, for our shareholders. it starts with our people. Talent and culture are critical to our success, and I\u2019m pleased to say that the management changes we announced earlier this year have gone into effect as of June 1. Our team is working together in this new structure to execute against our key strategies to meet the needs of our clients. I strongly believe that we have at this time the deepest, most talented team in the asset management industry and the strength of our next generation of leaders will drive BlackRock\u2019s future success. BlackRock is the world\u2019s most global asset manager. We manage money for clients in more than 100 countries around the world through the combination of our on-the-ground presence in more than 30 countries and our ability to provide clients with the industry\u2019s broadest set of global and local investment solutions. That global investment and distribution infrastructure positions BlackRock to capitalize on the future growth and development of the world\u2019s capital markets that will be necessary to support global economic growth. BlackRock\u2019s global platform generated $131 billion of long-term net flows over the last 12 months, representing an organic growth rate of approximately 4%. These results were driven by our diverse investment platform, another key element that sets BlackRock apart from our competitors. We have expertise across asset classes and we can deliver that expertise across a variety of investment vehicles. We have active and index on a single platform, which helps us position the firm to meet a holistic approach and needs of our clients. The second quarter showcases BlackRock\u2019s product breadth, with 12 funds across retail and iShares generating more than $1 billion in flows, tying a record number of $1 billion plus funds that we saw in our fourth quarter of 2013. These funds are spread across developed and emerging markets, domestic and international clients, equities, fixed income and multi-asset class, active and index, and short and long duration exposures, together demonstrating BlackRock\u2019s ability to be clients\u2019 needs across the investment platform and spectrum. As I mentioned many times in the past, the diversity of our platform, our deep client relationships and our global footprint all positions BlackRock to deliver consistent financial results for our shareholders. And that consistency enables our management team to look forward at the key trends impacting our business and invest aggressively, where we see opportunities. One of those key growth areas is outcome-oriented investing. The investment landscape is shifting. Investors are looking for outcomes that target their investment goals, rather than benchmark-specific performance. This outcome-oriented style of investing requires a combination of a diverse set of investment capabilities, and a focus, and a deep focus on client service. Most asset managers specialize in one thing, and so they look at every client problem to the lens of that one specialty whether it may be active investments or index investments, or fixed income, or equities. BlackRock\u2019s diverse platform allows us to instead to focus holistically on our clients\u2019 needs and draw upon and across the entire firm to meet our clients\u2019 needs. The investments we\u2019ve made to build the combination of active and index across asset classes and regions, and our technology and risk management capabilities differentiate BlackRock in the outcomes and solutions space. And BlackRock\u2019s offerings of packaged outcomes continue to drive growth in the second quarter, particularly in our retail businesses. Our five star multi-asset income fund, MAI, led by Michael Fredericks is one of our flagship package outcomes, an example of a fund that targets a critical challenge for our clients, generating reasonable income in a low yield environment by tactically balancing income across equities, fixed income and non-traditional sources of income. MAI has raised over $1 billion in the quarter and crossed the $7 billion mark in total assets. This fund has doubled in size organically over the last 12 months. Similarly, in the unconstrained fixed income area, SIO has raised $3 billion in flows in the quarter, stands at over $16 billion in AUM, and is the second most active mutual fund in the U.S. in terms of year-to-date net new flows. The interest in outcome-oriented investing is especially strong among our institutional clients. they are increasingly looking for investment partners that provide analytical insight, thought leadership, and breadth and depth of investment capabilities, all which play strongly to BlackRock\u2019s strengths. At BlackRock, we take a consultative approach with our institutional clients, focused on understanding their specific needs and leveraging Aladdin\u2019s capabilities to deliver investment solutions, a capability that is differentiated from other asset managers. Our relentless approach to risk management and technology positions BlackRock to offer a complete advice to our clients to help them not only achieve their returning targets, but to do so with a comprehensive understanding of their individualized risk and making sure they understand the risks that they are taking. The combination of Aladdin, our global platform, and our investment expertise across broad ranges of strategies positions BlackRock to deliver highly customized solutions to all our institutional clients worldwide. For example, on the first half of 2014, we closed more than $1.6 billion in custom alternative commitments and we saw strong flows in our fiduciary business, especially, in EMEA and demand for our LifePath target date suite in the United States. Our iShares business is also positioned to provide outcomes and solutions to a wide range of clients with differing investment preferences and differing objectives. iShares continues to be a major growth driver for the firm, delivering $77.5 billion of net flows in the last 12 months. And $30.4 billion of net flows in the second quarter across a variety of products and client segments. As Mark Wiedman discussed at Investor Day, there are three ways our clients are looking at ETFs and iShares specifically. One is core investments, or building blocks to construct the basis of buy-and-hold portfolios; two, precision exposures to express a specific, a targeted investment viewpoint, and three, as a financial instrument to efficiently add beta exposure to a variety of equity and/or fixed income markets in some case, replacing futures with ETFs and iShares. Each of these key product segments globally contributes to iShares\u2019 growth in the quarter, delivering the number one ETF flow market share position for both the quarter and now year-to-date. Regardless of our strengths for growth, we cannot be successful, unless we produce superior investment performance. Nothing is more important than delivering performance for our clients. After the financial crisis, we restructured much of our active fixed income business. Our focused execution has paid off and we have strong performance across fixed income, with 90% of our active taxable and 70% of our active tax-exempt fixed income AUM is above our benchmark for peer medium for a three-year period of time. As of the end of June, we\u2019ve seen strong performance in our fixed income total return fund, which is in the top decile for the one, for the three and a five-year period. Our low duration bond fund is the top decile for one and three years. And our newly launched Strategic Municipal Opportunities fund or SMO is in the sixth percentile for a one-year period of time. We also continue to see strong performance in our scientific active equities with 93% of our products above benchmark or peer medium for a three-year period. And from our index offerings, where we have 98% of our assets, we\u2019re within or above the tolerant level, risk level for over a three-year period of time. I have spoken at length about the steps we are taking in our fundamental equity business to improve performance. We streamlined our investment process and recruited tough quality managers to add to our existing talent base. Most recently, Chris Jones has joined BlackRock as our Co-Head of Global Fundamental Equities and is our new CIO of America Equity Teams. And Antonio DeSpirito joined us, or will be joining us in our Equity Dividend Team later this year, working very closely with Bob Shearer. In the second quarter, several of our fundamental equity managers who had put up strong performance in recent months suffered a setback in a variety of global momentum aided strategies, and had produced strong alpha reversals. We recognize that we remain in a rebuilding phase in this business and though, we never like to see performance setback, we remain confident today in our capabilities of our teams and all our processes. To give you a few examples of the strength of some of our new managers Andrew Swan, who manages our Asian equities and Bart Geer who manages our Basic Value are in the 14th and fifth percentile respectively, since they joined BlackRock. And that performance is starting to begin to pay dividends with flows. We believe that over time, fundamental equities will be a growth area for BlackRock. We believe the combination of investing in our talent and our global footprint, our access to information and idea-sharing and our risk management capabilities positions BlackRock to deliver sustained superior investment performance to our clients. We know this is a multi-year effort, and we are committed to seeing it through. These investments in our fundamental equity business will further enhance the depth and breadth of our global business that we build over time throughout BlackRock. As I said at the beginning, we believe that BlackRock is a truly differentiated firm from any other firm in the world. We are seeing a consistent result that this model can deliver quarter-after-quarter. If you look at our growth on a year-over-year basis as adjusted, you will see we grew assets under management by 19%, we grew revenues by 12%, we grew operating income by 15%, and we grew earnings per share by 18%. That double-digit growth demonstrates the benefits of our diverse platform and our ability to deliver strong financial results to our shareholders. And I am confident that we not only have the platform, but we also have the right leadership team in place to continue to drive growth in the future even as the environment continues to evolve as we know it will. Constantly, adapting to the changing environment and improving our performance is something we are intensely focused on. That is how we intend to continue to unlock value for our clients and then ultimately our shareholders. Finally, I would like to thank our leadership team and our employees for delivering a very strong quarter and helping our clients build better financial futures. With that, operator, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI. Please go ahead. Laurence D. Fink: Hey, Glenn. Glenn P. Schorr \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC : Hey, how are you? Laurence D. Fink: Good. Glenn P. Schorr \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC : So I guess the first question I have is the cost of leverage on the street is kind of rising as banks get their houses in order, and that pushes out the cost of leverage to various products that companies like yours run. So I\u2019m just curious, it certainly didn\u2019t seem to affect your flows in the current period, but in things like long/short credit, multi-strat products that you\u2019ve had success growing, does that factor in at all in terms of a) the growth and b) the profitability of those? Laurence D. Fink: That\u2019s a good question. There is no question, you\u2019re seeing, as you\u2019re referring to the cost of leverage, I will just say, the Basel III, Volcker rule, Dodd-Frank has forced many sell-side organizations to reduce their overall capital committing in the marketplace. And two, you\u2019re seeing obviously, liquidity issues in some asset categories. Glenn, to date, we have not seen a dramatic change in our ability to buy or sell for our hedge fund strategy. But we\u2019re mindful of that, and indeed you\u2019re correct, if we see a continuing amount of inability to navigate our trades and we are seeing larger bid/ask spreads, there\u2019s no question that can minimize the opportunities that our alternative products have. I should say though one other ways that investors are utilizing, or trying to change their behaviors, and this is a growth engine for us, we\u2019re seeing hedge funds utilizing ETFs as \u2013 instead of futures or single-stock or single-bond strategies, they\u2019re using ETFs as the mechanism to express a long or short type of exposure. So in some respects, if there\u2019s more liquidity in different products such as an ETF, you may see that. And so I think, in some respects, the changes in the world related to dealer behaviors is a benefit for the ETF market in itself, and we\u2019re benefitting from that and I tried to express one of the avenues in which people use ETFs. But one of the big things we have seen is the utilization and the cost of using futures, margins and all that has elevated and people are using ETFs as another example. But you\u2019re absolutely correct that we have to be mindful of liquidity by market in terms of the exposures we have in some of the long/short products. Glenn P. Schorr \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC : Okay. And maybe, just a follow-up, I appreciate that is related to alternatives, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a technical question, but the platform across the board seems great. Your retail penetration is clearly growing and yet the net flows into the total, the alternatives bucket is pretty modest. Laurence D. Fink: Yes. Glenn P. Schorr \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC : Less than $300 million this quarter, now I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a \u2013 some are growing, some are shrinking thing, or is it \u2013 the technical part of the question is, if you raised a lot, but have not deployed the capital, does it show up as a flow or does it show up as a flow when you get \u2013 my question is commitment versus funding? Laurence D. Fink: We do not put commitment in our AUM bucket, some firms do. So, as Gary said in his speech, we did raise a little over $1.3 billion in commitments. Over the course of the year, we raised about $8.5 billion of commitments and we funded approximately 1.8 of it. That is a big change. We also \u2013 and we mentioned this in the first quarter and we\u2019re still doing it. We\u2019re actually monetizing some of our alternative products. So you\u2019re seeing our commitments grow, but we\u2019re not \u2013 but we haven\u2019t invested in that, and yet, you\u2019re seeing on the same time, we are monetizing some of our alternatives, because of the success of the strategies and we\u2019re giving back the capital. Gary S. Shedlin: So Glenn, it\u2019s Gary. I would say one way to think about it is the return of capital hits the flows immediately and this quarter that was roughly $925 million thereabouts. And we were basically able to raise new commitments of $1 billion. So over the long-term, the new $1 billion that we\u2019ve raised will obviously replace the $900 million that we just paid out. but unfortunately, it takes some time to basically invest the money over the\u2026 Laurence D. Fink: Well, we take the more conservative approach the way we identify those with the asset raise. Gary S. Shedlin: So Larry\u2019s point is that of the $8 billion plus that we\u2019ve raised since 2013, about $1.5 billion of that has effectively hit flows, meaning it has been invested and the dry powder or the $6.5 billion or $6.7 billion will hit flows over time as it\u2019s invested. Laurence D. Fink: But we are probably in more dialogue with more clients on our alternative space than we ever have been in the history of the firm. So we like where we\u2019re positioned, but also we like the fact that we can monetize good successful strategies for our clients. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Marc Irizarry with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Laurence D. Fink: Hey, Marc. Marc S. Irizarry \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, Larry. Just following on the alternatives question, the performance fee is always tough to get our arms around, the alternatives performance. But can you give us some sense maybe of what kind of embedded gains you have in some of the portfolios that you\u2019re harvesting, and maybe, what that means for the outlook? And then I guess just broadly across the alternatives platform, how is performance holding up there? Thanks. Laurence D. Fink: I\u2019ll let Gary answer that. Gary S. Shedlin: So Marc, as you know, we obviously don\u2019t take the approach to economic net income that some of the pure play alternative managers do. so as we effectively see gains building up, which trigger accruals of, if you will embedded performance fees. We fully reserve for that going forward until they become permanent and no longer subject\u2026 Laurence D. Fink: They don\u2019t report us. Gary S. Shedlin: So that\u2019s not in our P&L and frankly, we don\u2019t really disclose those as a matter of course. I think obviously, you saw performance fees were up 29% year-over-year. I think the important thing to note for us is very broad based. So it\u2019s not a single fund that is basically driving that, it is a very deep. The breadth of the platform is evident in the fact that it\u2019s when you see the results, it\u2019s lots and lots and lots of different funds. Though it was clear that this particular quarter, we had a number of annual locks, meaning that they lock annually as opposed to quarterly, and we benefitted from a much stronger performance in this 12-month lock period than we did in the prior year. But broadly speaking, I think we\u2019re feeling very happy with the performance of the alternatives platform and the performance fees are coming through. Laurence D. Fink: And we are, as I said Marc, some great opportunities we have, I mentioned in the speech, in the infrastructure space, where we think this is going to be a great driver in the future for us and our clients. And so we have great opportunities in front of us across the alternative space, Rob Kapito and team and Charlie have spent a lot of time in a quietly rebooting our whole alternative platform under Matt Botein and Andy Stewart, and it\u2019s been in the short-term, we\u2019re starting to see real tangible results. Marc S. Irizarry \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And then Larry, just one follow-on, can you give us some \u2013 an update, if possible, on any of the asset management regulation, and maybe, specifically any update around maybe the discourse on systemic importance for asset managers? Laurence D. Fink: I wish I had something to tell you that is factual, I don\u2019t. We don\u2019t know anything more than what you\u2019ve been reading in the newspapers. Under Dodd-Frank, banks, anybody related to Dodd-Frank, whether it\u2019s SIFI, or anything. we\u2019re not allowed to have a dialogue, it is called lobbying, and it has to be publicly revealed that we\u2019re lobbying. So there is not, there is \u2013 you don\u2019t have the transparency of the process at all. this is very unusual. Any other type of world creation in Washington, there\u2019s always a process of dialogue and this was explicitly prohibited in the law of Dodd-Frank. And so we don\u2019t know anything more than what we read, and unfortunately, what we read, sometimes we believe there are leaks. And so it\u2019s a pretty inappropriate process from our perspective. But our job is a constructive participant in this. We have been occasionally asked to provide information to various different regulators worldwide on different things that they may be studying. It\u2019s a one-directional approach. we provide information and we get very little back and that\u2019s obviously what the laws say. So I don\u2019t know anything more, but what I\u2019d like to do is give you some of how we think about asset managers and regulatory oversight. We calculated BlackRock, there\u2019s $225 trillion in global financial assets. Assets that are being managed by investment firms, managed $62 trillion of the $225 trillion. So over 70% of the financial assets are owned and managed directly by the owners. And the other thing I would like to say, as you know, these are not our assets across the board. We have a contract in what we invest in and how we invest with every client. As you know, at BlackRock, we have hundreds of portfolio managers making decisions, we don\u2019t have one CIO managing all the assets across all the spectrum going left or right or forward, and we\u2019re \u2013 so this isn\u2019t, we don\u2019t take principal risk. And the last thing, I would just say related to BlackRock, if you dissect our platform, 62% of our assets or $2.8 trillion of our assets are index products. And then we manage about 32% of our assets are in active and another 6% in cash and advisory. So you think about the makeup of even as large as we look upon, much of our activities are very different than a lot of other asset managers in itself. So we believe that narrative that I just expressed is beginning to be more understood. And there was a proposal in Congress yesterday to allow for greater transparency in the process, deeper dialogues in the process and we welcome that type of activity. And we want to be a constructive participant in this dialogue. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Luke Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. Laurence D. Fink: Hey, Luke. Luke Montgomery \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good morning. thanks, guys. So a couple of questions on retail distribution. You entered 2013, I think, with a range of new strategic initiatives. Then the results over the last year or so have been pretty impressive as indicated by net flows. But aside from some of the key products that drove that growth, you\u2019ve touched on them multi-asset in the Core ETF series. Could you give us a sense of how successful you\u2019ve been with the goal of really broadening that penetration with the warehouses outside of that relationship you had historically with Merrill Lynch. Laurence D. Fink: Well, it\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m going to let Rob answer that. Rob, why don\u2019t you? Robert S. Kapito: Yes. so we have grown significantly from being Merrill Lynch-centric on retail, and in fact broadened the distribution to several others in a very significantly way. And in fact, our market share at some of the larger warehouses beyond Merrill Lynch has more than doubled over the last two years. So we continue to penetrate, because we are bringing products that a lot of them do not offer, and especially, in the ETF side, we\u2019ve seen a lot of growth in that particular area. There\u2019s other channels that have also been developed beyond just a typical warehouse, which is the RIA channel, of which a lot of financial advisors have moved from the large broker dealers into smaller channels, and we have pretty significant penetration in the RIA channel. We also as you know, have read about our joint venture was fidelity and that has been more successful than we had originally planned. So that broadens out our effort. And one of the things that has really been successful for us is that rather than going out with individual sales forces for our ETF channel and for our mutual fund channel, over the last year, we have combined our sales force to have the largest sales force going out and talking to broaden the distribution and treating the FAs more holistically, because they own in their portfolios both mutual funds, active, index and ETF. So we can talk to them about a more holistic solution. And I don\u2019t think that many of our competitors can claim to be able to do that. And the last thing that has also helped to broaden out the channels is that we announced a core series and are specifically developing in the ETF channel, specific ETFs for the buy-and-hold retail segment. And again, that\u2019s something that has also broadened out our retail network and has been very successful. So many things are going from years ago when we were more Merrill Lynch-centric. now we have a much broader and deeper retail penetration in our products. Laurence D. Fink: Let me add one other thing, Luke, which I think is not fully understood by the investment community, and that is the substantial growth in mutual fund sales in Europe. As you know, banks continue to deleverage, more and more activities are going onto the capital markets, greater confidence in Europe and the Europe\u2019s future with a huge amount of savings in Europe. And so we\u2019re seeing much greater penetration across the board in European retail. So there are two other macro trends that are going on in Europe. one, domestic managers are losing out to the global international managers. And so across the board, you\u2019re seeing the international investment managers picking up market share in Europe. And the last thing I would say you\u2019re seeing a real consolidation in flows. the top 10 managers in Europe are driving almost 90% plus, maybe 110%, I don\u2019t have the actual number in front of me, of all the flows, because with the smaller managers are actually having net outflows. but if you look at the substantial growth of $9 billion in international retail, this year-to-date that\u2019s a high component of our growth. And I would \u2013 I should say international retail means Asia, it means Europe, it means South \u2013 Latin America. So let\u2019s get back to my comments earlier about being in 30 countries, being local in 30 different countries. We are benefitting from that, and we believe as the world begins to look for other alternatives away from bank deposits looking for the strategies for their retirement, if you link in longevity and longevity issues, investors worldwide are looking for global advice and we\u2019re very well positioned across that. Luke Montgomery \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, thanks. And so my follow-up and I apologize, Larry, because I know you chafe at the comparison of your firm to Vanguard\u2019s, but a question on the distribution strategy in retail ETFs and index markets. I think over the years\u2026 Laurence D. Fink: (Indiscernible) say I chafe. Luke Montgomery \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: All right. Maybe I missed characterized that, but I\u2019ve heard some warehouse distribution executives over the years lament that Vanguard products basically free ride on the warehouse distributors who have to custody their products as a courtesy to FAs and clients. So I wonder do you see any specific opportunity based on your willingness to partner more directly with those firms to pay channel access fees, etc. Does that give you an opportunity to supplant some of the market share they\u2019ve acquired [concurrently] (ph)? Laurence D. Fink: I\u2019ll let Rob answer that. Gary S. Shedlin: Yeah. I don\u2019t think. Laurence D. Fink: Bob, do you chase? Robert S. Kapito: I don\u2019t chase that at all. I view our strategies as quite different. We\u2019re using; we\u2019re going to expand by education, the use of how ETFs are going to benefit client\u2019s portfolios, both institutional and retial. And I think in a product life cycle, this is very typical that you have people come in at first and you want to just get involved and then you have all the other uses of this product. Larry mentioned one for example, where we have a notice that ETFs are cheaper to use than futures. There is nobody better to go out into the marketplace and educate the community on a change like that than BlackRock is. And this is something that many of the other issuers of ETFs really don\u2019t think about. they are out selling products. We\u2019re selling a solution. An ETF is a part of that solution. when it comes to people that are looking for large credit portfolios, we\u2019re able to talk to them about a holistic solution where they can get diversification, liquidity and actually have a better structured portfolio by the use of iShares than just buying the individual assets itself. We have so many different ways that we are developing the users of ETFs that a broker dealer community and the institutional community looks to us to use ETFs as part of an overall solution. So we\u2019re not out there just pushing one product versus another product, because it\u2019s half, we\u2019re using this as a full part of a portfolio allocation. I think that\u2019s very important. So it\u2019s core investments, it\u2019s to get more precision exposures into the marketplace and we are treating this as a significant financial instrument, not just a product that we hope to the garner more assets in. It\u2019s a very different strategy than Vanguard is. they\u2019re a good firm. So we\u2019re glad to compete with them. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Laurence D. Fink: Hi, Bill. William R. Katz \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Hi, good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. Larry, just coming back to the regulatory front for a second, maybe a two-part question, one is what has been the sort of reaction from the institutional clients given the SEC discussion about possibly voting on a prime fund with a floating-rate NAV? And then a separate part of the question is, in certain early days, it looks like MiFID out of Europe is coming up with some pretty onerous shifts of views on how they are treating research versus trading, sort of wondering how you might be thinking about that dynamic as it relates to your business? Laurence D. Fink: So, we have continuously been a constructive organization working side-by-side with our regulators related to money market funds. So we\u2019ve been continuously engaged with the SEC throughout the process. we have made a number of recommendations. we have spoken to when asked about what we think about it, we\u2019ve had dialogues with many of the commissioners when asked, and importantly, we\u2019re well positioned regardless of where the SEC comes out on the portfolio \u2013 on the proposal excuse me. money is moving around and like we\u2019re going to see how this all plays out for our clients that when you think about where we are as a firm in terms of money markets. We have money market funds; we have separate accounts, or money market accounts. we have short duration bond funds. we had ETF. we have other vehicles. Money will be in motion; money will change if clients find whatever the outcome is as very restrictive, they\u2019ll move money elsewhere. We will also see, but most importantly, we\u2019re well positioned and I do believe the SEC has been \u2013 have been very open to conversation related to recommendations and all that. We\u2019ll see how this all plays out. The one thing I can\u2019t say, can\u2019t comment on, because I don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t know what this means related to bank deposits, necessary, bank deposits could be even a better alternative. So obviously, money market funds are \u2013 in some cases, alternative to bank deposits and the flows of money market funds is a function of what bank rates are. But a lot of people are very mindful of how much exposure they would have with any one single bank. And so I think this is why money market funds are desired by clients and this is one thing that we try to express to regulators, clients like money market funds. And we\u2019re well positioned. We have many government funds as a separate account. So we\u2019ll standby and hear how \u2013 what the outcome will be from the SEC related to their decision. We know as much as you do. In theory, there is going to be some decision next week and we\u2019ll find out. Related to MiFID and RDR in terms of regulatory changes, you\u2019re going to see consolidation with managers. Our risk management tools is a huge benefit. And I do believe our index ETF platform efficient exposures. I think you\u2019re going to see more movement towards ETFs as a result of the MiFID RDR type of regulatory changes. So it may reduce some of our business in Europe, but it\u2019s going to enhance the other side of BlackRock\u2019s business. And this is another example where, by the diversity of our products, our positioning globally really differentiates us. So we are working with regulators; we are mindful of this. We are telling regulators what clients want, what they expect. But we\u2019re pretty well positioned one way or another related to whatever the outcome is related to MiFID and RDR. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Kenneth B. Worthington \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, good morning. Just one question from me. I wanted to ask about the retirement business outside the U.S. We\u2019ve seen changes to the UK Pension Plan this year, which appears to benefit maybe asset managers over insurance companies. The EU has been underway for pension reform for I think the last four years. BlackRock has had some success in the U.S. taking market share and driving growth in the U.S. retirement business. Maybe, Larry, you could discuss what\u2019s happening outside the U.S., and maybe, where the biggest opportunities lie for BlackRock? Laurence D. Fink: Well, there\u2019s no question some of the rule changes in the UK is a big opening for firms like us, especially, related to the UK pension reform. As you suggested, it was really an insurance product and now it\u2019s migrating to much more opportunities. So the defined contribution savers will have now an option. They can take and withdraw beyond the 25% tax-free lump sum. So we believe, this is a big opportunity for us, yeah. so especially, in light of how we think about investment outcomes and solutions. I mean retirement is something that we are spending a great deal of time trying to help savers and potential retirees in thinking about longevity and how their solutions are going to have to be more weighted towards equities, less annuitized products. Historically, as you suggested Ken, annuitized products were the prime driver of this, and if you are going to be living a long time, earning 2% on an annuitized product for 3% you\u2019re just going to have to be saving a lot more money to earn the necessary pool of money you want. This is what we\u2019re rolling out, we rolled out CoRI overseas in the UK, we\u2019re going to continue to roll out our investment type of products to provide what I would say that solution based strategy. So we\u2019re encouraged, we think we\u2019re well positioned for these changes, and as you suggested, hopefully, we\u2019re in a good position to take share. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Laurence D. Fink: Hey, Craig. Craig W. Siegenthaler \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC : Hey, Larry. Good morning, guys. First, just on Target date, can you talk about how the longer-term themes of open architecture and the adoption of passes are really progressing really both in the Target date funds in the U.S.? And I\u2019m really thinking your perspective here from both your LifePath and your GlidePath products. Laurence D. Fink: Rob, you want to answer that. Robert S. Kapito: Yes, I mean, look, it is the same trend on retirement. People have not saved enough for retirement and they have lived through too much volatility in both the equity and fixed income markets. So they are looking for an alternative for someone to manage the asset allocation and the process throughout their lifetime. So to us, the opportunity is to develop the tools to the technology and one that we have is called the CoRI Index, Cost of Retirement Index, of which we can manage through target date funds and LifePath funds, a better way to do the asset allocation as a person gets closer to retirement. Do you think there is going to be incredible opportunities for us in this way because the advice and asset allocation is something that we specialize in? The models that we have specifically target retirees and manage this process throughout their life. And it\u2019s something where we see a lot of the sponsors are moving towards and, as Larry mentioned, a lot of DB and DC plans changing that have someone else to manage this asset allocation throughout their life. : Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Laurence D. Fink: Hi, Dan. Daniel T. Fannon \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Hi, I just want to talk about fixed income. I mean, can you talk about the momentum you are seeing particularly on the institutional side? Performance was flagged as improving. I just want to talk about just kind of client dialogue, kind of outlook for growth and how that compares to in the recent periods. Laurence D. Fink: Well, having 90% of our fixed income products above their benchmarks for three years, having a lot of products that are in the top decile, if there is a conversation to be had firms are going to be talked, assess what are the possibilities? That puts us into a very good position. We\u2019re seeing very mix types of conversation across board, we continue to see large-scale pension funds derisking as they\u2019ve taken profits in equities, we\u2019re seeing a lot of pension funds looking now towards looking now towards some form of immunization as they get closer to their liability or even in some cases above their liability are using bonds as a vehicle. But probably the most important key for us is our fixed income platform is more than just one product. It\u2019s across the board where we are seeing increased activities. We are in more dialogue today than we have ever have been in fixed income, in terms of new flows. In the unconstrained area we\u2019re just beginning to see public pension plans, migrate out of index based products into unconstrained products. So we are in some very large dialogues at this moment, we do believe one or two conversations constitute some large wins in the third quarter. We continue to be in deep dialogue with many clients related to credit, and high yield and whether it\u2019s an insurance company who is looking and in need of some form of income to us, to assess their annuity liabilities. And we\u2019re still seeing a large scale international investors are looking to continue to invest in dollar-based assets and expressing those investments in the form of fixed income. And so across the board we are seeing heightened interest in fixed income, even in the low interest rate environment. As I said, some of it is because they\u2019re de-risking in equities, but some of it is because they\u2019re seeing increased activity in their own business, like an insurance company. But I would say overall, probably overall theme I can say related to BlackRock\u2019s future and future activities in fixed income, having the performance that we have across our platform for our platform for five years, for three years, for one year is giving us a position where we are in dialogue with many clients worldwide. Operator : Next question will come from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Mc Hawken \u2013 UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Laurence D. Fink: Good morning. Brennan Mc Hawken \u2013 UBS Securities LLC : : Laurence D. Fink: Rob? Robert S. Kapito: I don\u2019t know, we are willing to breakdown what is coming from one place for another. But I can also tell you that the growth that we expected is probably twice what we had anticipated. Brennan Mc Hawken \u2013 UBS Securities LLC : For core series. Robert S. Kapito: For a core series. And we have high aspirations for this, because there is a segment of the market that is really not looking for the liquidity, they\u2019re looking for the buy-and-hold. And this is a particular segment of that Fidelity actually addresses, so we have expectations of future growth for that, but we don\u2019t rely especially in that just upon one distribution segment, there are other distribution segments that also cater to the buy-and-hold segment. That being said, there is \u2013 the other segment, which is the institutional or the trading segment, they are looking more at the liquidity of this and the access for asset allocation in their portfolios. So what we are trying to do is have products to appeal to the right segments and we'll price those appropriately and make sure the performance of those is appropriate for those particular targets. Laurence D. Fink: I would just say also we are benefiting tremendously this year from the, and Rob said it earlier from the integration of two sales forces. And so, you asked a question related to fidelity, but we\u2019re seeing in large activities across all the independent channels from all the major distributors, and so, I would say it\u2019s pretty broad based, but our relationship with Fidelity is strong, growing and it\u2019s a very good partnership. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Laurence D. Fink: Hey, Michael. Michael R. Carrier \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, Larry. Larry, just a question. If I look at the growth that you guys have generated in iShares and on the retail side, it\u2019s been very consistent on retail, big improvement over the past couple years. And on the institutional side, I feel like you guys have the relationships. When I look at the solution products, the alternatives, it seems like the product offering is there, but the flows just aren\u2019t as strong as on the other channel. So is it an allocation problem? I know you mentioned some on the performance side, whether it is active equity or the (indiscernible) is just not there. But just from an outlook standpoint, do you guys feel like things are in place. so over the next two years that we kind of see the same trend that we saw on the retail side, or is there something else that\u2019s somewhat of a hindrance there? Laurence D. Fink: You are right in suggesting \u2013 in terms of iShares, our rolling 12 months were growing 10%; in retail, our rolling 12 months is about 13% growth, and our rolling 12 months in institutional is flat. And so those are actual facts. What we\u2019re witnessing in institutional though, and if you look at our revenues are growing faster than our AUM, we are seeing a mix change. We\u2019re growing more in alts, which is lower AUM, higher fees. And importantly, we have seen some large scale clients derisking in equities, saying going into cash. A lot of that was international and so the net result is a flat type of growth rate over the last 12 months. I\u2019ll be bold enough to say we believe we are well-positioned in institutional and that we are going to see opportunity for growth in institutional. Whether it is in fixed income, as I said earlier about all the unconstrained conversations we\u2019re having with large pension plans in the fixed income space, we continue to be driving more opportunities in alternatives, and I hope I can comment in the future that we\u2019re going to continue \u2013 we\u2019re going to start seeing opportunities in their model based equity business, because we\u2019ve had exceptional return. But we also have opportunities in the official institution business and corporate, in the DC plans and in the financial institution group. So among those different areas, we are in more dialogue today than we have been. But I am disappointed in the net results of AUM, and I\u2019m not upset at the revenue growth that we\u2019re seeing in the institutional side. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Chris M. Harris \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. Hey, guys. So just a quick follow-up on fixed income. You guys and others in the industry, clearly benefiting from growth in unconstrained and you\u2019ve highlighted that. I\u2019m kind of curious if you guys think investors understand, or fully understand the risks of these funds and then maybe how sticky do you think these assets will be if things get a little bit more volatile in the market? Laurence D. Fink: Well, as things get more volatile, in other words, if you have more volatility, which probably means higher interest rates, you\u2019re going to be happier in an unconstrained product versus an intermediate duration target like a core product. So that is what clients are looking for. so they don\u2019t have a tethering to a benchmark that has no connection to their liability. And that is one of the big issues that\u2019s confronting a lot of investors. Investors are worried about those are in fixed income and if they are not in fixed income for immunization purposes, they are worried about the eventuality of higher rates. We are seeing growth in our global long/short credit products, which have zero duration. So do I think clients understand what they\u2019re getting into one 100%, clients were looking to immunize, they are looking for as long a duration as they possibly can have. So we\u2019re not going worse \u2013we should be clear \u2013 we\u2019re seeing movement across fixed income, we\u2019re seeing some people who are worried about being tethered to a benchmark that has no connection to a liability. They are either looking more towards liability matching in fixed income, or they\u2019re seeing a movement towards unconstrained. We\u2019re seeing some clients who remain steadfast in credit and are looking to add to credit whether it is in the form of a CLO or in the form of high yield. There is not one single behavior but you\u2019d ask me specifically related unconstrained, I believe our investors are investing in unconstrained for a reason, for a purpose. And the dialogues that we\u2019ve had with clients year-to-date, validate my view that they understand what they\u2019re doing related to the associated risk and the volatility that you discussed, I think, would be attached the higher rates. And that is one of the reasons why people are looking to unconstrained. So obviously, they have to perform in that environment, and they\u2019re going to perform much better than a tethered core product that\u2019s tethered to a four or five-year duration. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we\u2019ve reached the allotted time for question. Mr. Fink, if you have any closing remarks. Laurence D. Fink: No, I hope everyone has a decent summer. Hopefully, the volatility doesn't begin this summer, so we can take this summer. I just want to thank all our shareholders for your interest in our company. And I would like to thank the employees of BlackRock for a good quarter. Have a good quarter. Thanks everyone. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

Our host for today\u2019s call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer Gary S. Shedlin; President Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel Matthew Mallow. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question and answer period. (Operator Instructions). Mr. Mallow you may begin your conference. Matthew J. Mallow : I\u2019m Matt Mallow the General Counsel of BlackRock and before Larry and Gary make their remarks, as usual, let me remind you that during the course of this call we may make a number of forward-looking statements and we call your attention to the fact that BlackRock\u2019s actual results, may of course, differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the FDC which lists some of the factors that may determine the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today and additionally, as is also usual, BlackRock assumes no duty and does not and will not undertake to update any such forward-looking statements. With that, let the call begin. Gary S. Shedlin : It\u2019s my pleasure to be here to present our third quarter as adjusted results. Our roadmap for shareholder value creation is predicated on three main drivers : generating consistent organic growth; demonstrating the benefits of scale through operating leverage; and systematically returning excess cash flow to our shareholders. We successfully navigated that roadmap again this quarter generating double digit earnings growth. More importantly however, and as you\u2019ll hear in much more detail from Larry in a moment, BlackRock has never been better positioned to meet the needs of our clients. Our global reach, unique blend of active and indexed offerings, strong overall investment performance, risk management and analytics capabilities, and One BlackRock culture differentiate us today in the asset management industry. BlackRock delivered third quarter earnings per share of $5.21, up 34% compared to a year ago. Revenue rose 15% to $2.8 billion and operating income was $1.2 billion, 24% higher on a year-over-year basis. Non-operating results reflected a $43 million increase in the market value of our seed and co-investments largely driven by mortgage, private equity, and credit related investments.  Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 20.2% reflecting discreet benefits primarily due to the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters related to the acquisition of BGI. In connection with that transaction, BlackRock recorded a $50 million indemnification asset for unrecognized tax benefits. Given the resolution of these matters, we recorded $50 million of G&A expense to reflect a reduction of the indemnification asset and an offsetting $50 million GAAP tax benefit. Both the $50 million G&A expense and the $50 million tax benefit have been excluded from our as adjusted results.  Our 26.2% as adjusted tax rate for the third quarter also benefited from $34 million of discreet tax benefits. We continue to estimate that 29% is a reasonable tax run rate for the fourth quarter and based on what we know today 30% is a reasonable projected tax rate for 2015.  BlackRock\u2019s third quarter results were driven by $29 billion of long term net new flows representing an annualized organic growth rate of 3%. Flows were positive across all client businesses and regions, and despite a more volatile market environment, we continue to demonstrate the stability of our highly diversified platform.  Over the last 12 months BlackRock generated $134 billion of long term net new business representing 4% organic asset growth and an even faster rate of organic based fee growth as we benefitted from positive mix change associated with our faster growing higher fee retail and iShares businesses.  Third quarter year-over-year revenue growth of 15% or $377 million was driven by continued growth in base fees, performance fees, and revenue from BlackRock Solutions. We once again experienced year-over-year base free growth across all long dated asset classes. Base fees increased $315 million or 15% from a year ago as average AUM increased due to organic growth, market appreciation and the acquisition of the MGPA real estate business. Base fees were up 1% compared to the second quarter due to higher average AUM levels and the impact of one additional revenue day, partially offset by the seasonal decline in securities lending activity we typically see in the third quarter. However, we enter the fourth quarter with lower spot assets under management than our average AUM for the third quarter which will impact our fourth quarter entry rate base fee level. This decline was primarily driven by the appreciation of the dollar against foreign currencies, which given the global nature of our business, led to an $89 billion decrease in total AUM during the quarter.  Performance fees for the third quarter increased $37 million or 39% from a year ago driven by continued strong performance across our broad suite of single strategy hedge funds, real estate, and hedge funds solution offerings. As a reminder, fourth quarter performance fees in 2012 and 2013 were elevated due to similarly sized one-time fees trigged by the wind down of opportunistic funds related to the financial crisis. We do not anticipate any such fees during the fourth quarter of 2014. BlackRock Solutions revenue of $165 million was up 6% year-over-year and 13% sequentially due to increases in both Aladdin and FMA revenue. Our Aladdin business which represented 72% of BlackRock\u2019s solutions revenue in the quarter grew 6% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. We continue to successfully execute on large global implementations associated with record new business wins in 2013. Our Financial Markets Advisory business had a very strong revenue quarter driven by several large advisory assignments associated with ECB AQR Diagnostics. Notwithstanding a more institutionalized post financial crisis advisory model, future FMA results may be difficult to predict as a function of the transaction based fee structure associated with this business.  Total expense for the third quarter rose $141 million year-over-year driven primarily by revenue related items including compensation and direct fund expense. Compensation and benefits increased $112 million from a year ago or 13% reflecting higher head count and higher incentive compensation driven by higher operating income. While compensation as a percentage of revenue declined year-over-year, partly as a function of the timing of certain accruals, quarterly comparisons are less relevant as we manage compensation on a full year basis and our overall compensation policies have not changed. G&A expense decreased $8 million year-over-year or 2% driven primarily by beneficial non-recurring items including the positive FX impact of remeasuring dollar balances held overseas to their respective functional currencies. Sequentially G&A expense decreased $51 million reflecting the previously mentioned impact of positive FX remeasurement and lower legal and regulatory expense in the current quarter. Excluding the positive impact of these items and taking into account a planned seasonal uptick in yearend marketing and promotional spend, we expect to see higher G&A expense in the fourth quarter relative to the first three quarters of the year. Overall, total expense increased 9% from a year ago compared to a 15% increase in revenue over the same period resulting in an as adjusted operating margin of 44.2%. The year-over-year margin improvement of 300 basis points was positively impacted by the previously discussed lower level of G&A and compensation accruals in the quarter. We remain committed to a consistent and systematic capital management policy. During the third quarter we repurchased an additional $250 million of stock and view that as a good planning rate for the remainder of the year. As you are all aware, we traditionally review our capital management strategy with our Board each December for implementation in January of the following year. Our consistent earnings growth and stable financial results reflect the benefits of our diverse platform, long term client relationships, and commitment to alpha generation. Quarterly net flows were positive in both our active an index franchises as well as each of our geographic regions with $11 billion from the Americas, $7 billion from EMEA, and $11 billion from APAC.  In global retail we saw long term net inflows of $5 billion during the third quarter bringing year-to-date inflows to $32 billion or 9% annualized organic growth. Retail flows were positive at both the US and internationally, but were limited by macro headwinds during the quarter that impacted our high yield and European equities franchises.  BlackRock\u2019s diverse platform was well positioned to weather this market volatility as we nonetheless delivered overall positive flows with strength in outcome oriented offerings including unconstrained fixed income, multi asset, and alternatives products. US retail flows of $2.8 billion were driven by strength in our outcome oriented fixed income suite including our strategic income opportunities fund or SIO, our strategic municipals opportunities, and global long/short credit funds.  During the quarter SIO raised $2.9 billion in net new flows from a combination of retail and institutional clients and remains the number two bestselling active mutual fund in 2014. Retail fixed income results were dampened by outflows from our high yield franchise which was impacted by investor rotation out of the sector in July. Though our high yield bond fund has top decile performance, the fund experienced quarterly outflows of $1.6 billion.  Our 40 Act Alternatives Funds raised nearly $600 million of net flows during the quarter and we continued to see significant opportunity associated with delivering institutional quality alternative solutions to the retail marketplace. We recently expanded our retail illiquid alternatives suite with the launch of the Multimanager Alternatives Strategy Fund which allocate assets to a variety of affiliated and unaffiliated alternative investment managers and leverages the success of our hedge fund solutions platform BlackRock Alternative Advisors. International retail net inflows of $2.1 billion were driven by our fixed income multi asset and index capabilities but were impacted by deteriorating market sentiment in Europe contributing to $3.8 billion in outflows from our European equities franchise. Within fixed income, we saw $1.2 billion of flows into our fixed income global opportunities fund which is the cross border version of SIO and $680 million of flows into our BGF Euro Short Duration Bond Fund. International multi asset net inflows of $1.9 billion reflected demand for our BGF Global Allocation Fund as well as growing traction for the cross border version of our flagship Multi Asset Income Fund. We also took advantage of strong three year performance track records in Asian equities to capitalized on increasing demand with our top cortile BGF Asian Dragon and BGF Asia Pacific Equity Income Fund and our top decile BGF China Fund generating more than $500 billion in aggregate flows during the quarter.  Globalized shares generating $18.2 billion of net new business in the quarter, representing annualized organic growth of 7% driven by strong equity flows. Equity flows of $3.8 billion were driven by flows into the Core Series as well as demand for emerging markets and Asian equity exposures which offset outflows in European equities.  The buy and hold segment remains an important growth challenge for iShares. During the quarter we generated $7.3 billion of flows into US Core Series representing annualized organic growth of 23% and gathered $2.5 billion of flows into recently launched European Core Series representing annualized organic growth of 26%. We continue to aggressively target growth in the fixed income ETF market. iShares show fixed income flows of $3.7 billion [inaudible] by $1.3 billion of flows into our core bond product AGG as investors looked for options to maintain exposure to the broad fixed income market in the current environment. Year-to-date iShares ranked number one in market share of fixed income net flows globally.  Our institutional business generated $5.6 billion in long term net inflows for the quarter primarily reflecting index net inflows. We continue to see sizeable asset allocation driven flows both into and out of institutional index products as bar-belling continues to be a key [inaudible] among institutional clients with cost effective beta exposure being paired with alternative solutions to achieve uncorrelated returns.  Index fixed income inflows of $5.5 billion was driven by LDI activity including extensions of hedging or liability matching services. Institutional active net inflows included $5.2 billion of net inflows into multi asset class products driven by continued demand for our LifePath Target Date suite and over $1 billion of flows into our Dynamic Diversified Growth strategy of DDG. DDG is an unconstrained multi asset strategy that seeks to generate positive consistent returns in a range of market environments with significantly lower volatility than an equity portfolio. Multi asset and scientific active equity inflows were offset by outflows from active fixed income and fundamental equities. Despite strong performance across our active fixed income platform, our institutional net flows were impacted by several client specific outflows driven by rebalancing and asset allocation decisions partially offset by continued strength in unconstrained fixed income strategies.  As you\u2019re going to hear from Larry shortly, our broad fixed income platform and performance track record continued to position BlackRock extremely will to capture opportunities in the current environment.  In institutional core alternatives, inflows into hedge fund solutions were offset by outflows from several single strategy hedge funds and return of capital. However, we had another strong quarter of fund raising in illiquid alternatives with nearly $1 billion in commitments reflecting ongoing momentum in hedge fund and private equity solutions and infrastructure. As a result of strong fundraising in illiquid alternatives over the last two years that has brought in over $9 billion, we still have approximately $7 billion of committed capital to deploy for clients. While return of capital impacts our inflows immediately, committed capital only translate into flows and assets under management as those dollars are invested.  In summary, in a quarter marked by increased volatility, our diversified business model delivered solid financial results and we are well positioned to take advantage of the numerous opportunities that lay ahead of us. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry. Laurence D. Fink : Thank you Gary. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining the call. We\u2019ve seen some meaningful shifts in market dynamics since we spoke last quarter. Divergent monetary policy, changes in global economic growth expectations, and heightened geopolitical unrest all impacted the investment landscape and resulted in higher volatility in both asset prices and currencies in the past few weeks. That volatility is likely to continue as conflicting central bank policies and questions about the timing and magnitude of US interest rates hikes, led to an ongoing market uncertainty. Investors are also questioning whether the ECB\u2019s recent efforts will be enough to reinvigorate the economy and stave off deflation. I believe it\u2019s going to take longer to stabilize Europe than many think and we are likely to see an aggressive ECB behavior for a long time.  It is in these times of volatility and uncertainty that clients turn to BlackRock for answers and we\u2019re having more conversations with our clients that are deeper and more meaningful conversations than ever before. Clients are turning to BlackRock because of our platform that we built over the past 26 years as a result of a comprehensive and deliberate process focused on culture, technology, and talent.  Our platform is built on the foundation of our One BlackRock culture, a belief in putting our clients first in all that we do and managing risk better and more thoroughly than any other asset manager in the world. We built Aladdin with this in mind, to create a premier risk management and technology platform that allows everyone at BlackRock to speak a common language. BlackRock doesn\u2019t eliminate risk but it helps us to create an environment where our team is constantly aware of the risks and we are connected across the firm worldwide to optimize these results. Increased connectivity through Aladdin and other sources leads to improved communication and in the BlackRock investment institute we have a forum for investment teams to share knowledge, to share insights with the idea that this will enhance Alpha generation across the firm. This team based approach is a critical differentiator for BlackRock. We do not and never had have a centralized CIO. We don\u2019t have a house view or any one person setting a single investment strategy for our platform. Our process enables our teams to make independent portfolio construction decisions to meet client objectives. That may result in differing performance for our clients at times but it means we don\u2019t have an overwhelming bias towards one strategy or another and we minimize the risk that it entails. We also believe that having a deliberate process to develop our people is critical for BlackRock\u2019s success and our connectivity with our clients.  At our most recent Board meeting in September, we spent two days reviewing 320 individuals at BlackRock across the entire firm to identify BlackRock\u2019s best talent. This is an annual exercise and includes a process to develop each of those individuals as global leaders, as global investors, and as global citizens. This might mean moving into a new region of the world or into a new business and it helps to develop a team that will be deeper, with broader and global experience which will enable us to have better investors and better leaders in the future. The leadership changes we announced in the second quarter is an example of how we do this. The move involved new roles for 10 senior leaders across the firm and those leaders are now in their new seats driving growth and enhancing our value proposition for our clients. Finally, BlackRock\u2019s global diversified platform is a critical component of our strategy. BlackRock is the only asset manager to offer active and index capabilities globally across all asset classes on one platform and we are constantly looking to innovate to find new ways of meeting our client\u2019s needs. When we combine our people, our technology, and risk management investment platform and wrap it all in the One BlackRock culture, the totality of the firm comes together to serve our clients\u2019 needs. Nothing here is accidental. BlackRock was built to highlight these strengths and to minimize the risk of getting it wrong. While we will never compromise on our philosophy of building our culture, sometimes we do get it wrong and when we do we will do what\u2019s necessary to rebuild. We rebuilt our scientific active equity platform which now has 96% of its assets above benchmark or peer mediums for the last three years and while flows have not improved as quickly as we might have expected given the strength of the performance, this quarter we saw inflows in scientific active equity for the first time since we did the merger with BGI. We made changes in our Asian equity business several years ago and Andrew Swan today has a top cortile three year track record. As you know, we\u2019re now in the process of rebuilding our US fundamental equities. We are excited about the progress we are seeing from our new teams and remain committed to that effort.  Our confidence in our ability to rebuild the US equity platform stems in part from the success we\u2019ve seen elsewhere highlighted by the rebuilding process we started over six years ago in our fixed income business. The investments we made in that business are clearly paying off. BlackRock saw $11.1 billion of net inflows in fixed income in the third quarter and now we have seen, in total, $48 billion year-to-date in fixed income across both active and index reflecting the stability, the breadth, and the strong performance of our fixed income franchise. We have a deep bench of talented senior fixed income investors with more than 400 fixed income investment professionals including 150 sector specialists. They manage $1.3 trillion in AUM across a full range of high performing active, index and iShare strategies. With 87% of BlackRock\u2019s active taxable fixed income assets above the benchmark or peer mediums for the three year period, BlackRock\u2019s offerings are positioned to help clients achieve their desired investment outcomes regardless of their specific needs or macro expectations.  Our unconstrained fixed income strategies continue to be a core theme for clients and we saw nearly $5 billion in flows in the third quarter and nearly $20 billion in the last 12 months across our top cortile unconstrained bond franchise including SIO and strategic municipal opportunities in the US, our fixed income global opportunities product in Europe, as well as our flagship retail alternative fund global long/short credit. We have seen continued momentum early in the fourth quarter as well as heightened client interest and we expect unconstrained strategies to remain a strong driver of growth for BlackRock going forward. The breadth of BlackRock\u2019s fixed income franchises further highlighted by our top decile total return and high yield bond funds in total return we\u2019ve seen a significant recent increase in flows and client interest and see a meaningful long term growth opportunity. In high yield, while we experienced some market headwinds in the quarter our performance continues to position us to win in this asset class.  As a result of BlackRock\u2019s strong active fixed income performance track record, we\u2019re increasingly being rewarded by retail and institutional gatekeepers with improved positioning on platforms and buy lists. We see a sizeable opportunity in fixed income in the coming quarters and we believe BlackRock is the best positioned firm in the industry to capitalize on that opportunity both in active an in index. On the index side, more and more investors are recognizing iShare as an efficient tool for investors to manage market exposure to generate Alpha through asset allocation. Investors have been increasingly turning to iShares as core component of their fixed income portfolios. In the first few weeks of October we\u2019ve seen more than $7 billion in net new flows into fixed income iShares including our Barclay\u2019s Aggregate ETF AGG. We\u2019ve seen a substantial uptick in secondary market trading volume as well exhibiting iShares ability to provide liquidity for our clients. BlackRock believes fixed income ETFs represent a substantial growth opportunity given they only represent about 4/10ths of 1% of the global fixed income markets. A fraction of the ETF penetration compared to the equity market where ETF represents about 3% of the global markets. We believe iShares can offer an attractive solution to the needs for fixed income liquidity with nearly $200 billion of AUM across a 189 fixed income ETFs. BlackRock\u2019s product breadth and depth are key differentiators. I need to reflect for a moment because when BlackRock acquired BGI five years ago BlackRock\u2019s global iShares assets under management were $385 billion. I\u2019m proud to say that BlackRock\u2019s iShares closed the third quarter with nearly a trillion of assets under management. We continue to drive global expansion and grow our iShares market share by pursuing several areas of [inaudible] ETF usage including core investment, precision exposures, and financial instruments.  BlackRock\u2019s ability to combine active and index strategies and deliver the entire full firm to clients is critical as client demand for investment outcome and solutions increase. One of the most common outcomes investors are targeting is to sustain a certain level of income leading up to and through retirement. Just this month, we launched an income campaign in Europe and the Middle East targeting advisors and consumers with a dual objective of raising brand awareness for BlackRock as well as educating clients on the importance of income investments as part of their portfolios. Outcome oriented income focused products have been a significant driver of retail flows and products like SIO and multi asset income or MAI were significant contributors to our results in the third quarter. Our global basis or our multi asset income franchise crossed over $10 billion in AUM and as seen $4.5 billion of net inflows so far in 201. BlackRock\u2019s multi asset franchise is a key differentiator and our team based culture enables our multi asset managers to benefit from the best alpha engines and risk management capabilities BlackRock has to offer. I\u2019d like to turn to a business through which we serve as a trusted advisor to some of the most sophisticated financial institutions in the world. This is our financial markets advisory business or FMA business within BlackRock solutions. Since BlackRock started FMA business in 2008 we have completed now more than 330 assignments for 185 clients in 30 countries generating more than $1 billion of revenues in BlackRock solutions. In the third quarter we reached a significant milestone for the team and the firm. With the substantial completion of FMA\u2019s crisis era liquidation assignments. FMA\u2019s track record includes the risk control liquidation of long term wind down vehicles totaling more than $110 billion which resulted in strong performance for our clients. That track record also includes supporting clients with execution advice on strategic transactions totaling more than $660 billion. As a result of this track record of proven success and a more stable environment marked by heightened financial regulation, we are now helping clients position their balance sheets to maximize value and thoroughly managing risk including numerous assignments as part of the Dodd-Frank Stress Test in the United States CCAR planning initiatives, the ECB AQR and most recently in August, the FMA business of BlackRock was selected to provide consultancy services to the European Central Bank on the design and implementation of their ABS purchase program. This marks a real transition for the FMA business from a crisis oriented work to differentiated advisory and consultancy services. In all our businesses BlackRock strives to be a trusted advisor to our clients from institutions to end consumers. As a trusted advisor to our clients we also believe we have a responsibility to engage with regulators to promote a safe and sound financial system. We know there is growing concern for many around about liquidity and markets. We believe our success at BlackRock depends on investor\u2019s continued confidence in the markets and so we have a shared interest in working with regulators on these issues. In closing, I want to share with you the reaction to BlackRock I witnessed during the last four days where I spent at the IMF Annual Meetings in Washington DC last week. During that time I met with more than 30 clients. In total BlackRock meet with 141 clients who are among the world\u2019s leading financial institutions and I was struck by how BlackRock\u2019s reputation and position in the financial marketplace came through in each and every meeting. Investors are turning to BlackRock for advice and for investment solutions and it was a very gratifying time for us to be as part of these exceptional discussions and to see the actions clients are looking to give to BlackRock to be a thought leader and to help them provide them with better financial futures.  I believe BlackRock has never been better positioned to meet the needs of our clients around the world. We remain focused on performance, we remain focused on strengthening our leadership team, remain focused on developing our talent, remain focused on enhancing our differentiating platform to unlock value for our clients, and of course, to our shareholders.  With that, I want to thank our leadership team and all of our employees for delivering a strong quarter and continuing to work towards building better financial futures for our clients. Before we take up your questions I wanted to mention that in addition to Gary, Matt, and myself here in New York we have Rob Kapito joining us on the line from Hong Kong where he and the BlackRock team there are hosting BlackRock\u2019s Second Annual Asia Wealth Symposium bringing together our clients across the region. Rob is also leading our fourth Knowing BlackRock Event, a series of internal events around the world that are part of an ongoing effort to foster a One BlackRock culture, to foster driving better leadership, and to foster driving better performance and better execution. Let me open it up for questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question is from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Robert Lee \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: I wanted to ask a question on the alternatives business and I think Gary, you mentioned in your comments that you obviously had some realizations, returned some capital, and also had maybe some outflows from discreet hedge funds. But if you look at that business it\u2019s pretty sizeable, it\u2019s a hundred odd billion and that\u2019s one place that despite the success you\u2019ve had across the firm where flows have continued to be kind of break-evenish despite the size. Can you maybe give us a little bit more color on underneath the business, kind of maybe which strategies are having kind of the flow issues or some of the puts and takes, if you will, that are going on behind it? Laurence D. Fink : I\u2019m going to open it up and then I\u2019ll let Gary really get into some of the details. We are very excited about our flows and the situation we have in alternatives. We have returned some large pools of money back to our investors. We had huge [inaudible] mortgage strategies that we liquidated in July that were quite successful to our investors and so that is a decline in our assets. But in our illiquid strategies we do not put those assets under AUM until those monies are invested. So we have a firm commitment for those monies, and that\u2019s now totaling $7 billion of flows over the last few years and they continue to grow, and we put those monies to work over the course of the next several years. So in reality, we are recycling our alternatives strategy quite successfully and I believe the momentum is accelerating towards more opportunities for BlackRock in the hedge fund arena. I\u2019ll let Gary go into some specifics, but the macro number masks the successes we\u2019ve been having. Gary S. Shedlin : Rob, no one would like this to be a little cleaner and simpler to understand than I would and we spend a lot of time on it. But we\u2019ve got about $113 billion of total alts of which we classify $88 billion of those effectively as core and we strip out currency and commodities from that when we think about the core business. I think obviously, as Larry mentioned, return on capital, it does complicate the matter a little bit. I mean, obviously, this quarter alone we had return on capital of a little over a billion which effectively matched about a little less than a billion of new commitments that we raised in the current quarter.  Year-to-date, our return of capital is about $2.8 billion and that was again versus last year where it was close to $3 billion. It\u2019s clear that over the last two years, I guess since the beginning of \u201913 and Larry mentioned we\u2019ve raised about $9 billion in commitments and I think, you know, candidly we\u2019re looking for the right opportunities. In a perfect world perhaps we would have invested some of that money a little quicker to basically match the timing better. But you know obviously, we\u2019re not going to put client interests behind what happens in our core flows in terms of return on capital versus putting the assets in the ground. It also is impacted by a lot of ins and outs which, you know, is frankly the same phenomena that impacts some of our institutional index business. But, if we basically look excluding the return on capital, and I know this is a little unfair, but if we effectively exclude kind of one larger hedge fund that has frankly been a little more challenged in the last year or so and the way we look at the core health of the business, that would put up about $1.4 billion of core alts flows in the quarter with retail alts being about $400 million of that and institutional being about a billion. On the retail side that\u2019s really again, being driven as Larry has mentioned, our flagship global longshore credit but we\u2019re also now having good flows from global longshore equity. I mentioned we recently launched the new multi manager fund which basically pulled in about $100 million this quarter already so that\u2019s off to a good start. On the institutional side again, excluding return of capital and this one challenged hedge fund, we saw strong flows into BAA of close to $350 million, our fund to private equity business invested about close to $275 million in the quarter, real estate had about $200 million in the quarter. Our alternative solutions which is a key growth area, was close to $150 million. So there\u2019s actually very strong pockets of momentum around it however, it takes a little bit of commitment from you and us to make sure you can see all of that happiness. Robert Lee \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: If I could maybe ask one follow up which I\u2019m sure is on a lot of people\u2019s minds, you know, the turmoil from one of your competitors and the assets that may be kind of in play or in motion as a result of that. I guess I\u2019m particularly interested in your thoughts as it relates to the DC world where, you know, certainly the total return fund has been pretty well entrenched and there\u2019s usually not a lot of fixed income options out there. But how do you feel about if you look at the opportunity set how do you feel about your ability to kind of start capturing some share there and at the same time are you starting to see more DC plans thinking about a broader range of options within their fixed income selections. Gary S. Shedlin : I think you\u2019ve identified a great growth opportunity for us. A, on the DC land, managers are entrenched until they\u2019re not. We have had a historically very strong presence in the DC side in the index equity and target date products and so we have great relationships and now because of our strong performance and breadth in our fixed income, we have an incredible chance now to leverage those relationships and indeed we are indeed winning more wins in the DC side and we do believe this is going to be a great opportunity. In addition, as people think about fixed income especially on the DC side, we are seeing evidence of people moving out of a total return type of product into a more unconstrained strategies too so this is going to be an opportunity for us in the coming years. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ken Worthington with JP Morgan. Kenneth Worthington \u2013 JP Morgan : Topic de jour, a lot of the intermediate term investment dollars in motion \u2013 so first to what extent do certain categories of institutional investors already have so much money managed by BlackRock that it\u2019s hard for them to invest more with you? By following up with Rob in DC, you\u2019re doing so well on iShares in the DC channel, does that somehow constrain you on the fixed income side for example, or are there other categories? Laurence D. Fink : Ken, we have not seen one example where our scale and our presence with our clients are being impacted. We actually won some business from one client already in the DC side where when we did the BGI merger they were concerned about our large presence within their plans. Over the course of the years they\u2019ve become accustomed to our large presence and they\u2019ve indeed since then awarded us more business. Well, we\u2019ve been awarded more business again from them.  So we\u2019re not seeing any evidence of that at the moment. I think importantly, more and more clients are separating the amount of business we have in beta products versus alpha products so I think we\u2019re in a very good position now to take on a larger share of wallet with more clients. Kenneth Worthington \u2013 JP Morgan : Then money in motion again, it seems to be going into cash, short term bond, intermediate term bond currently, what asset categories do you think are best positioned over the next year? So for example when capital had its issues you had money go out of equities actually go into PIMCO and into fixed income so there was a big switch. What categories do you think are best positioned over the next year or plus? Laurence D. Fink : Where are you identifying the flows? Are you doing it in the mutual area? What people can\u2019t see is what\u2019s going on on the institutional side and let me just highlight the institutional side. On the institutional side, generally consultants determine how given managers are perceived and if there\u2019s changes in perception there\u2019s money in motion. That\u2019s a slow process, in some cases it\u2019s going to take quarters, maybe even a year. But we have had more buy recommendations added to BlackRock in the last few months mainly because of our five year success in performance. So much of it had to do with the timing of our success. There is not a single event that is stimulating some of this it is just because the consistency of our positioning in fixed income and obviously because the events that you\u2019re alluding to there\u2019s been more change. We are seeing more opportunities over the next quarters and years of money in motion into various fixed income strategies. What we are seeing more and more clients looking at, they\u2019re looking for outcomes, they\u2019re looking for solutions. They\u2019re not moving money across asset categories so most of the money, if it is being moved, it\u2019s being moved from one fixed income to another fixed income player and then you\u2019re seeing biases moving. The one area where we\u2019ve just been awarded a big assignment is a big institution that would have been awarding us something in the total return side of fixed income and they determined to award us a large assignment in the unconstrained fixed income. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing the biases change but there is a lot of money in motion going from total return in one shop to another shop and I believe there is quite a bit of movement today in the institutional side that should show up worldwide in the next few quarters. Operator :  Your next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler \u2013 Credit Suisse. Craig Siegenthaler \u2013 Credit Suisse : First just to hit on the margin, the adjusted result of 44.2 looked very strong. I\u2019m just wondering if you can provide some color on the sustainability of this level and it also looks like G&A expenses were a little light driven by FX and there\u2019s always the seasonal G&A trends in 4Q which tends to be higher. So maybe just provide us a little color there and maybe you can help us in terms of what a good go forward range is? Gary S. Shedlin : So a couple of things on margins. Obviously, in the context of year-over-year comparisons you obviously have to look at the relevant quarters that you\u2019re comparing and so I think from Q3 to Q3 if you will a couple of things went on. Obviously, we had strong beta from that Q3 to Q3 period which obviously helps drive revenue growth and you saw not only in addition to our organic growth, we actually put up 15% year-over-year revenue growth which is a pretty good number. On the expense side really two things. As you\u2019ve mentioned, one is our G&A clearly was low in the quarter. I think we highlighted sequentially that there was about a $51 million gap which was primarily attributable to the FX remeasurement and lower legal fees and expenses relative to the last quarter where we called them out as being somewhat high.  So beta driving one direction, expense driving the other direction and then obviously, as we\u2019ve mentioned both this quarter and last quarter some changes in comp accruals that make quarter-over-quarter comparisons a little less relevant. But mentioning that we really hadn\u2019t changed comp philosophies and so as you look at full year accruals I think that\u2019s a better indicator. Then of course you take all of that and you go into the fourth quarter and I think there\u2019s no question that beta comparisons year-over-year will look much less muted. It was a strong fourth quarter in beta last year. It\u2019s not looking like a very strong fourth quarter this year so that will impact obviously year-over-year comparisons. We mentioned the FX impact so we\u2019re going in with lower spot AUM into the quarter than our average and as you correctly mentioned, in addition to the seasonal uptick in our [MMP] spend which is actually also planned, we\u2019ve got some rougher comparisons on the performance fee because of the opportunistic fees that we booked last year. I think if you take all of that into consideration I would suggest that the 44.2% in the quarter is probably not something we\u2019d be looking to repeat in the fourth quarter and I think as it relates to margin guidance, I think our margin guidance hasn\u2019t changed as it relates to the overall business. Craig Siegenthaler \u2013 Credit Suisse : Just a follow up on the management turnover at one of your competitors. We\u2019ve only had three business days in the third quarter result and we only have mutual fund data there but if you could size of the potential opportunity given your good performance, wide product menu across 401k, retail, and then institutional, which one are you more excited about in terms of growth in your active bond business? Laurence D. Fink : It\u2019s still too early to determine how much is going \u2013 it\u2019s fair to say there\u2019s a sizeable opportunity. It\u2019s in the 10s of billions of dollars. We\u2019ve seen recent strong momentum but it\u2019s going to play out over quarters and maybe a year and as I said, it\u2019s going to be \u2013 in the core fixed income strategies it\u2019s going to be in the unconstrained fixed income strategies.  You may see people, and I think there is evidence that you\u2019re seeing some people moving into ETFs and maybe this is as a holding pattern. But I just want to underscore we are seeing this type of flows because of our five years of performance. I just want to remind everybody that we had $48 billion of flows in the first nine months and so we continue to just think it is all about performance, it is all about positioning, it is also because of our strength in beta and alpha products and fixed income.  So it is our platform that has also differentiated and our global positioning. But as I said this is a sizeable opportunity and there is increased momentum. Operator :  Your next question comes from Luke Montgomery \u2013 Sanford Bernstein. Luke Montgomery \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : Kind of a big picture question here, you\u2019ve got institutional index strategies contributing just 10% of your revenues but I think those AUM receive about a 40% weight in the conventional calculation for organic growth. So if you exclude those assets I think the organic growth on what I think we might call revenue critical AUM has been ranging between 5% and 7% on a trailing year basis. I don\u2019t know of many asset managers of any size that are flowing at that rate and perhaps I\u2019m wrong, but it really doesn\u2019t seem like that\u2019s reflected in your multiple today. The question is sort in terms of messaging what\u2019s it going to take how investors view your organic growth rate. Gary S. Shedlin : Hopefully, you tell everybody. I mean, look it\u2019s a great point, it\u2019s one that you know we have been trying to tell a little bit differently than the way you just stated it both at investor day and even today. We\u2019re trying to basically point to a concept of organic based fee growth being in excess of organic asset growth which is by virtue of stronger growth in our retail and our iShares business, or obviously relative to the institutional business and in particularly institutional index business. I would say that we do give you ways to get there in terms of the disclosure. There\u2019s ways to back that out but I\u2019m mindful that it\u2019s always easier if we do that for you and I think it\u2019s fair that we are always thinking about ways to improve our disclosure and to help investors and analysis better understand our business and we\u2019re actively considering whether or not we should make some changes going into next year. I mean, we do break out on the AUM tables exactly that component of flows and obviously, the beginning balance of our institutional index business so you can actually go ahead and do that and I don\u2019t want to suggest that the institutional index business is not a very important component of the firm, but you\u2019re right to suggest it has lower revenue characteristics than some of our other businesses and that in markets such as this the velocity of those assets tends to be a little bit greater so even though you\u2019re seeing $5 billion of net flows there\u2019s basically significantly more inflows and outflows that happen every quarter to get to that net number. So we take your point, we appreciate it, and we are going to give it a lot more thought as we go into the end of the year. Luke Montgomery \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : I think the fee versus AUM basis for presenting organic growth is interesting but maybe it\u2019s just as simple as showing organic growth figure excluding institutional index in your press release. That\u2019s what I might suggest. Gary S. Shedlin : I think that\u2019s one way to do it. Though again, that data is there for people who want to figure it out. Laurence D. Fink : I would just also want to say that I don\u2019t want to dismiss the institutional index business and we love it, we think it\u2019s a growth area, we think it\u2019s a very important connector with our clients as I discussed earlier especially on the DC side which is really an institutional component and it\u2019s a connector to so many of our other businesses. That\u2019s the opportunity of it. Obviously, Gary and team will look at how we can better account so you have a better understanding of our growth rates and our revenues. But we don\u2019t want to dismiss a great component of our business. Operator :  Your next question comes from Marc Irizarry \u2013 Goldman Sachs. Marc Irizarry \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Just following up on the organic growth, you know, you are out there with a forecast for 5% organic growth and I just want to get a sense of two things. You\u2019ve constructed that view that you can get to that organic growth rate at some point in time and I think you\u2019ve given us some of the building blocks. Maybe you can just review that but also, what kind of assumptions are embedded in a forecast like that in terms of manager replacement? Obviously, there is a lot of money in motion, some of which you would have expected to be on the fixed income side, but I\u2019m curious also, manager replacement and volatility, how that sort of plays into that forecast and what we should expect? Gary S. Shedlin : A great question. Look, 5% when we laid it out was viewed as a target. It\u2019s an aspirational target. We\u2019re very serious about making sure we have strategies, business strategies, and appropriate talent, and making sure that we provide resources for those businesses to get there. We very much still believe in the fact that that is a number we can achieve. We are very much still focused on the three components of that growth with iShares being low double digit growth, retail being high single digit growth and our institutional business being low single digit growth obviously, with faster growing parts of that business offsetting some of the headwinds we face in DB. So, we\u2019re continuing to prosecute the strategy and we still feel incredibly comfortable about that. I would say that it\u2019s not a quarter-to-quarter number for us. It\u2019s basically getting there on a more long term stable basis. We obviously \u2013 I\u2019ll come back to the discussion we just had with Luke, which is actually if you strip out some of the more lower fee components which have been a little bit more volatile in recent quarters, one might suggest that we\u2019re already there on a trailing 12 basis for some of those businesses but I\u2019m mindful that\u2019s changing the goal post a little bit and I think in the context, and Rob\u2019s on the phone, he may want to chime in obviously, there are significant amounts of cash yet on the sidelines that when that gets deployed that will actually have an important element to our ability to attract some of those assets. I think we\u2019re still moving forward and we\u2019re holding people accountable to get there and our sincere hope is that we\u2019ll be able to, in the near term, be able to talk about getting there very consistently. Operator : Your next question is from the line of William Katz \u2013 Citigroup. William Katz \u2013 Citigroup: Just coming back to the money motion discussion [inaudible] very topical, Larry you highlighted sort of the five year track record as being a key differentiating factor for you. Just coming at scale the other way, how important is scale and capacity as well as a consideration for all the consultants as they think about incremental opportunities, maybe perhaps some PIMCO? Laurence D. Fink : As I said earlier Bill, I don\u2019t think CL is a negative, I think CL has proven to be a positive for us and we have plenty of growth opportunities in our unconstrained area. That\u2019s going to be the area where we will ultimately have capacity issues but we have measured that and we have a lot of bandwidth to continue to grow in our unconstrained strategies. This is something we look at with our strategic product management group. This is the group that is trying to design new products and trying to eliminate products that are underwhelming.  I think that\u2019s another reason why we are winning so much business in some many different fixed income strategies. I think the highlight is it\u2019s not just the active fixed. We actually won some inactive fixed, and unconstrained fixed, and iShares fixed income. We\u2019re seeing inquiry in our model based fixed. It is the scale and breadth of our fixed income platform across the globe, is the reason why we\u2019re having so much dialog with the consultants worldwide and it is allowing us to be well positioned for that money that is moving. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Carrier \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Michael Carrier \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : You guys put a whitepaper out I think a few weeks back just on some of the issues in the fixed income markets and some of the longer term solutions. Just given the recent volatility we\u2019ve seen \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you want to call it hiccups but some new issues in terms of liquidity I just want to get your view, I think a lot of the things you guys discuss in terms of the long term fixed makes a lot of sense. Some of those things is just a lot tougher to do in the near term, you know, when we may fax increased volatility and given the amount of assets that have gone into fixed income and the reduced inventory on broker or dealer balance sheets I just want to get your sense what are you guys doing or what can you do to try to protect your investment returns in some of the lack of liquidity in the market which can impact the returns for investors. Laurence D. Fink : I would say overall the markets are performing quite well. There have only been a few circumstances where you\u2019ve seen really [inaudible] type of trading behaviors in the last few months. In any one single day or single week you may have seen some spreads widening but over a course of a two to three month period of time they narrow back. I think there\u2019s been some great consistency across the fixed income market. That said, we are worried about the liquidity in the fixed income markets, especially in the corporate bond area where there is just so many different [inaudible] and so many different issuances and there\u2019s no consistency and importantly this is a big role that the investment bankers and Wall Street play in terms of providing balance sheet and navigating your positioning within the fixed income universe and that balance sheet has been reduced significantly and so it does, at times, present liquidity issues. This is why we have been so loud in stating that we need a more expedient adoption of electronic protocols and markets. I do believe this is one of the areas where regulators need to focus. I spoke about this at an [IMS] session this past weekend, that I think it\u2019s imperative that we focus on this. As the regulators have put more capital demands on banks, by definition the capital markets are playing a larger and larger role in terms of financing corporations and financing different organizations.  With that in mind now, we need to be focusing on how to improve the capital markets in making sure they provide a stable, a mechanism for buying and selling securities. We\u2019re in this transition phase right now and the faster and sooner we have this adaptation of electronic trading the sooner we have standardization of some form of corporate bond issuance, and then importantly we need behavioral changes across the board. This is going to take time and so the worry we have is do we have enough time before there\u2019s a true liquidity event that really destabilizes the market. This is why I said in my prepared statement, we need to be working with regulators to make sure we have a more stable trading environment. We are the biggest beneficiaries in the world as the largest asset manager. We benefit when there\u2019s greater liquidity. We need to make sure that our clients believe that investing is safe for them too so this is key. Now, in saying that though, because we are a large client of all the different firms worldwide, if there\u2019s balance sheet that is off or just because of our relationships, we have an advantage but that\u2019s not a lasting type of thing and this is why we are so much in front, whether it\u2019s writing or working with regulators, working with the street to build a more robust electronic market. Operator :  Your next question comes from Glenn Schorr of ISI. Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI: Just a follow up question. You mentioned a couple of things impacting on the retail side but the last 12 months your organic growth rates is in like 11%, this quarter it was 4%. I\u2019m curious how much you think of that as more environmental versus maybe talk about some of the successes you\u2019re pushing through on your distribution strategies. Laurence D. Fink : As Gary suggested, we had outflows in high yield, that was environmental. We had outflows in European equities, that was environmental. On the positive side we had inflows in other products. I think it speaks very loudly to our platform. Obviously we want to be beneficiaries of all the areas where there\u2019s going to be inflows but there are going to be periods of time where our client interests are going to be navigating out of those platforms.  We also saw even in iShares, in the last few weeks of September we saw large movement out of some European iShares products, European equity iShare products. So this is all environmental. We truly believe we\u2019re penetrating more distribution channels, more [RIA] channels, a broader distribution channel in Europe than ever before and so I think we are in a very good position for whatever is money in motion in the retail channels, we are going to continue to see some elevated growth. We are strengthening our positions across the world. As I talk about our strategic product group we\u2019re evolving our product set so we are responding to the needs of clients and so I feel very good about how we are positioned in retail and iShares and importantly we are going to continue to build our brand and I think we have done a very good job at building brand awareness and now we need to continue to do that and be successful in that. Gary, do you have any more to add to that? Gary S. Shedlin : I mean to put some numbers into perspective in terms of European equities, I mean it happens, again maintaining still good three, five year performance there, you know, that cost us close to $4 billion in the quarter in retail in outflows and then high yield again top decile performance and rotation there cost about $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion for the quarter. So if you just think about the magnitude of those two products still with decent performance in fact, some exceptional performance in some cases, that [inaudible] the growth rate just in the quarter alone in those two areas. So the good news is as Larry said, we had continued strength in the EMEA index, we had continued strength in fixed income, continued strength in multi asset, and I think without that there\u2019d be a very different story and that\u2019s part of the diversification and stability story we\u2019re trying to tell. Operator :  Ladies and gentlemen we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks? Laurence D. Fink : The last comment Gary just said I think is really key as you think about BlackRock. I think we have a unique business model, a unique culture that is differentiating us and once again allowing us to deliver a strong third quarter. We have never been as well positioned to meet the needs of our clients worldwide and I think clients are turning to us more than ever before because of the consistency over 26 years of a comprehensive and deliberate process of focusing on our culture, our team, our technology, and our talent and I think this is very critical. As I said earlier in my prepared remarks, when we combine our people, and our technology, and our risk management on top of our investment platform and wrap it up with one common BlackRock culture, the totality of the firm comes together and it serves our clients well. I can say in the fourth quarter and going forward we\u2019re going to just be as intently focused on achieving our performance, on strengthening our leadership relationships with our clients, continuation of developing our talent. As Gary said it really well, our highly diversified platform allows our investors to have a greater stability with more consistent growth than any other asset manager and I\u2019ll leave it at that. Thanks everyone. Talk to you at the end of the fourth quarter. Operator :  This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

Bernstein & Company Dan Fannon - Jefferies & Company Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Bill Katz - Citigroup Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Operator : Good morning. My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Matthew Mallow. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer period. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Mallow, you may begin your conference. Matt Mallow : Thanks very much. Good morning everyone. I'm Matt Mallow, the General Counsel of BlackRock and before Larry and Gary make their remarks, I want to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements and call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results, may of course differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. And additionally, BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So with that, let's begin the call. Gary? Gary Shedlin : Thank you, Matt, and good morning everyone. My pleasure to be here to present our fourth quarter and full year 2014 as adjusted results. Overall 2014 was another strong year for BlackRock's clients, shareholders and employees. We continue to drive shareholder value by generating consistent organic growth; demonstrating the benefits of scale through our operating leverage, and systematically returning excess cash to our shareholders, even in an increasingly volatile macro environment. As Larry will discuss in more detail, our 2014 results highlight the stability and diversification of our business model and evidence the significant investments we've made in recent years to enhance the depth and breadth of our global platform. For the fourth quarter BlackRock delivered earnings per share of $4.82 and operating income of $1.2 billion. Full year earnings per share of $19.34 was up 17% compared to 2013, and operating income of $4.6 billion was 13% higher. Non-operating results for the quarter reflected a $2 million decrease in the market value of our seed and co-investments, down $63 million year-over-year driven primarily by a reduced economic investment portfolio and lower gains from investments in our hedge funds and fund to funds vehicles. Our 25.4% as adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter benefited from $39 million of non recurring items. While we continue to estimate that 30% remains a reasonable projected tax rate for 2015, the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of additional non-recurring items that arise during the year. BlackRock's fourth quarter results were driven by $88 billion of long term net new business, our highest ever quarterly net flows representing an annualized organic growth rate of 8.3%. For the full year 2014, BlackRock generated total long term net new business of $181 billion, representing an organic growth rate of 4.5% together with net flows from our cash management business, BlackRock generated over $200 billion of net inflows for the year. During 2014, we achieved organic asset growth of 11% in iShares, 11% in retail, and 1% in institutional in line with the growth targets we outlined at our June Investor Day. This resulted in organic based fee growth in excess of organic AUM growth, as we benefited from positive mix change associated with our faster growing, higher fee retail and iShares businesses. Equally important, net long term flows were diversified by asset class and region with positive flows across all categories for both the quarter and the full year. Fourth quarter revenue was flat with a year ago, as growth in base fees and revenue from BlackRock Solutions was offset by a decrease in performance fees. Full year revenue grew 9% from 2013, driven by growth in base fees and revenue from BlackRock Solutions, both of which reached record levels in 2014. Fourth quarter base fees was 5% year-over-year as average AUM increased due to organic growth and market appreciation. However, base fees were down 3% compared to the third quarter due to a lower fourth quarter AUM entry rate, the continued impact of divergent beta and ongoing dollar appreciation against foreign currencies. While the S&P 500 was up 2% on average during the fourth quarter, the MSCI World was down 2% with emerging markets and natural resources indices lagging even further, down 8% and 12% respectively. Such divergent beta impacts our financial results as only 34% of our equity base fees are generated in U.S. markets. In addition, ongoing dollar appreciation led to a $59 billion decline in long term AUM in the quarter. Performance fees for the quarter were $144 million driven by a broader suite of single strategy hedge funds, real estate and hedge fund solutions offerings. Performance fee decreased $124 million from the fourth quarter of 2013, which included a large fee associated with the partial liquidation of a closed-end opportunistic fund. The decline also reflected relatively weaker performance across a variety of hedge fund products, in line with broader industry trends. BlackRock Solutions revenue of $170 million for the quarter was up 8% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, due to increases in both Aladdin and FMA revenue. Our Aladdin business, which represented 75% of BlackRock Solutions revenue in the quarter, grew 9% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. We completed a number of large global implementations in 2014 and expect continued business momentum from trends favoring global investment platform consolidation and multi asset risk solutions. Our FMA business ended 2014 with $161 million in revenues. While revenues benefited from meaningful transaction based disposition activity during the year, our business model remains well positioned to help clients navigate and implement requirements attendant to CCAR and the new ECB single supervisory mechanism. Total expense for the fourth quarter was flat year-over-year, as increased direct fund expense was offset by decreased levels of G&A expense. Full year compensation expense increased $273 million or 8%, reflecting higher headcount and higher incentive compensation, driven by higher operating income. Importantly, our compensation to revenue ratio declined 30 basis points in 2014 to 34.2% driven by continued reshaping of our employee base and the benefits of scale across our platform. Fourth quarter G&A expense decreased $23 million year-over-year or 6%, reflecting lower professional services and other G&A expense and various leased exit costs included in the fourth quarter of 2013. Sequentially, quarterly G&A expense increased $61 million primarily due to volatility in FX remeasurement, the planned seasonal uptick in year end marketing and promotional spend, and closed-end fund launch cost associated with the $437 million BlackRock Science and Technology Trust. Overall, total expense for 2014 increased 6% from a year ago compared to a 9% increase in revenue over the same period, resulting in an as adjusted operating margin of 42.9% for the full year, a 150 basis point increase over 2013 levels. Since closing the BGI merger at the end of 2009, we have expanded our operating margin by over 450 basis points, while also significantly reinvesting in our business. In line with that commitment, on November 5th, BlackRock entered into an agreement to acquire certain assets of BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors, the external investment advisor to BlackRock Kelso Capital Corporation. This transaction enhances our fixed income platform to the addition of a middle market private credit capability. Pending BDC shareholder approval, we expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2015. During 2014, we were trying approximately $2.3 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and $1 billion in share repurchases, representing a total payout ratio of 71%. As we enter 2015, we remain committed to a predictable and balanced approach to capital management. Consistent with this, our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $2.18 per share of common stock, representing an increase of 13% over the 2014 level. Since instituting a dividend in 2003, BlackRock has grown its dividend on a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 22%. Our Board has also authorized the company to repurchase an additional $6 million shares under our existing share repurchase program, giving us authorization to repurchase a total of $9.4 million shares, including $3.4 million shares which are remaining under our prior program announced in January 2013. Our consistent earnings growth and stable financial results reflect the benefits of our differentiated global business model. Fourth quarter net flows were positive both our active and index franchise, as well as in each of our geographic regions, with $62 billion from the Americas, $50 billion from EMEA, and $11 billion from APAC. BlackRock's global retail franchise saw long term net inflows of $23 million during the fourth quarter, bringing full year inflows to $55 billion representing 11% organic growth for the full year. As usual fourth quarter retail close reflect the seasonal impact of reinvested capital gains distributions. Fourth quarter U.S. retail flows of $21 billion were driven by strong fixed income flows across a diverse set of products, including our top performing total return and high yield franchises, and our flagship strategic income opportunities fund. SIO was the leading unconstrained bond fund in the fourth quarter with nearly $5 billion of quarterly net inflows. Our multi-asset income fund or MAI continued its momentum with nearly $2 billion of flows in the fourth quarter, making it the top multi-asset income fund in the industry ranked by 2014 flows. Fourth quarter international retail net inflows of $2 billion were driven by BlackRock\u2019s fixed income, multi-asset and index capabilities, which more than offset headwinds and ongoing outsource from our European equities franchise. Globalized shares generated over $44 billion of net new business in the fourth quarter and approximately $101 billion for the year, representing full year organic growth of 11%. iShares once again captured the number one share of global ETF industry flows. During the fourth quarter, iShares record fixed income flows were broadly diversified by asset class duration and geography. We continue to aggressively target growth in the fixed income ETF market and were the global leader in fixed income inflows in 2014. Fourth quarter equity iShares flows of $24 billion were driven by flows into the core series with particularly demand for U.S. equity exposures. The core segment remains an important growth channel for iShares posting an organic growth rate of 30% in 2014. Our institutional business generated approximately $21 billion in long term net inflows for the quarter and $25 billion of net inflows for the year, representing the highest quarterly and annual institutional flows we've seen in the past five years. The investments we've made in our diverse global platform position us well to meet the ever changing needs of a sophisticated institutional client base and we expect this momentum to continue in 2015. Barbelling continues to be a key theme, as institutional clients pair cost effective beta exposure with alternatives and other high conviction alpha solutions, to achieve uncorrelated returns. We continue to see sizeable asset allocations driven flows both into and out of institutional index products, resulting in net inflows of $20 billion in the quarter. Institutional index equity flows were driven by clients looking to increase risk exposure while fixed income inflows reflected asset allocation decisions and solutions based LDI activity. Institutional active net inflows based by positive flows and for fixed income, multi assets and alternatives, fixed income net inflows of $3 billion were diversified across exposures and we continue to see institutional demand for our unconstrained strategies. Multi asset net inflows of $2 billion were highlighted by solutions based wins, as well as continued demand for our LifePath target-date suite. Excluding approximately $600 million of return client capital, institutional alternatives generated nearly $2 billion of net new business led by hedge fund solutions and private activity solutions. In addition, we had another strong fundraising quarter for illiquid alternatives raising nearly $3 billion in new commitments, reflecting ongoing momentum infrastructure debt, and renewable power. Over the last two years, we've raised more than $12 billion in commitments, and have nearly $9 billion of committed capital to deploy for clients. While return of capital impacts our net flows immediately, committed capital only translates into flow and AUM as those dollars are invested. Outflows from both scientific and fundamental active equities continued in the fourth quarter. By its strong performance, client demand for scientific active equity remains muted. Fundamental active equity outflows continued in products with historical performance issues. However, these flows were partially offset by select wins and categories where our new managers are building strong track records including large cap growth. In summary, in the year marked by periods of increase volatility, our diversified business continued to deliver solid and consistent financial results. We've remained confident that our differentiated business model is well-positioned to meet the needs of our clients and shareholders in the year to come. And with that, I will turn it over to Laurence. Larry Fink : Thanks Gary. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining the call. 2014 closed with heightened volatility due to political and social instability. And that volatility obviously is continuing today and in the New Year. However, markets proved resilient in 2014 and the fourth quarter marked the 8th straight quarterly rise for the S&P 500 with data suggesting a rebound for the U.S. economy. As Gary discussed, the U.S. equity markets outperformed emerging European and Asian markets, and certainly outperformed natural resource markets and the U.S. dollar continued to appreciate relative to other currencies. This market divergence is likely to persist in 2015, creating both large challenges and large opportunities for our investors. Anemic global growth has led to an overdependence on politicians to implement reforms to rebuild the global economies. But we have seen limited action globally from politicians and as a result, we continue to rely on accommodative central bank policies whether we\u2019re talking about Europe, China, Japan, and even at this moment even the United States. This will also put more pressure on the U.S. dollar, as it will rise higher, as well as the mixture of regional policy successes and failures, again increasing more global volatility. The technology revolution that most people always underestimate is so evident in the oil industry, and through this technology the growth and supply of oil is outpacing demand which has led to a period of volatile price discovery in the petroleum markets with greater than a 50% drop in oil prices. This is leading to a global redistribution of wealth, which people underestimate how this is going to transform the world. With the high cost of energy production economies experiencing major headwinds, countries like the U.S., like China, like India, will be seeing huge benefits in stimulus. In countries that have seen currency devaluation such as Europe in recent months will experience only modest and moderate gains. We see more shocks as production decisions and the demand side equilibrium but overall this oil price movement should be a great benefit for the global economy. With a back drop at divergent market performance, volatility, regulatory reform, persistent low rates, our clients near long term investment challenges are becoming more complex, but our goals at BlackRock steadfastly remain the same. We are a fiduciaria and BlackRock is well positioned to address our client's needs and deliver return for shareholders in all market environments. The combination of our global multi-asset platform, our insight and thought leadership and Aladdin, our unified technology and risk management platform has resulted in a more deeper client interactions than we have ever seen before. It has also enabled our investment team to collaborate ahead of key macro events to both protect the assets and in most cases generate alpha for our clients. In the fourth quarter BlackRock generated $88 billion of long-term net inflows, the strongest quarterly long-term flows in our history. And for the whole year, BlackRock saw a long-term net inflows of $141 billion and together with the net flows from our cash management business, we generated more than $200 billion in net inflows in 2014. But I want to emphasize one important thing, it's not about the magnitude or the scale of the assets that we raised, but I want to emphasize the composition of the flows, which we believe is much more important. For the year, we saw a $35 billion in active and $146 billion in index flows. We saw $52 billion in equities. We saw $96 billion in fixed income, $29 billion of flows in multi-asset and $4 billion in alternatives where we put the money to use. We saw $55 billion of flows in retail, $101 billion of flows in iShares and $25 billion of flows institutionally. And we saw these flows in all regions, from all investor types, and importantly in the face of wide range of economic and investment conditions. What we like to highlight is there were 13 countries where we had net inflows of excess of $1 billion in 2014. We now manage assets in excess of the billion dollars for clients domiciled in 41 countries, demonstrating the increasingly global and differentiating nature of the BlackRock platform. In addition, we added our first Aladdin client based in Latin America and now have clients actively using the Aladdin system in 47 countries around the world. As the nature of our client's investment challenges change, so does the nature of the solutions they require. More and more, a single investment product asset class or style does not provide a sufficient long-term solution. BlackRock's business model, which was deliberately built to deliver a multifaceted solution to clients and BlackRock's ability to leverage these capabilities across are truly diverse global platform of active and index, equities, fixed income, multi-asset, and alternative strategies all backed by Aladdin analytics and risk management has resulted in continued organic growth and revenue growth for the firm. BlackRock saw 27 distinct retail in iShare products each generating more than $1 billion net flows in the fourth quarter. For the year, 56 individual retail in iShare products generated more than $1 billion in net flows compared to 43 such products in 2013. The breadth of our platform is resonating with clients as they continue to seek a diverse set of global investment solutions. As Gary mentioned, we made significant long-term investments over the past few years in our people, our process, and our platform and those dividends and those investments have paid off in 2014 and I strongly believe this will continue to differentiate BlackRock overtime in an increasingly competitive industry. The strength of BlackRock's fixed income business is an area where past investments are translating into differentiating results for our clients and for our firm. BlackRock was built on a foundation of superior fixed income performance and now we have 91% of our active taxable fixed income platform outperforming the benchmark or peers for the three year period and no single category was a primary driver of the $96 billion inflows we gathered this year. Active index flows were diversified across high yield, unconstrained and core bond offerings and positive across all client businesses and we saw several key buy list ads across categories in 2014. Our flagships strategic income opportunity fund or SIO raised more than $13 billion in 2014 and we now manage more than $31 billion across or unconstraint fixed income franchise for both retail and institutional clients. BlackRock saw increased client interest in our total return fund, which is in the top 3% of our peer group for one year, for three years, and for five years. Total return generated $2 billion of net inflows in the quarter and represents the meaningful long-term opportunity for us. Fixed income is also a core strategic priority for BlackRock iShares, which led the industry in fixed income ETF flows for the quarter and for the year driven by iShares constituting 15 of the top 25 fixed income ETFs by net flows in 2014. Assets across classes, BlackRock's iShare franchise as I said earlier, generated more than $100 billion in net flow this year and was the industry leader inflows in the United States, inflows in Europe, and inflows globally. We continue to focus on growing global iShare market share and driving global market expansion and we expect client and product segmentation to drive the next wave of our iShare's growth. We saw $32 billion inflows in our global core series in 2014 as by-and-hold investors are increasingly turning to iShare for efficiently constructing larger portions of their portfolio. IShare's are used as financial instruments where ETFs are providing a compelling alternative to individual securities, to swaps, the futures, and we are seeing a strong initial progress in this newly formed area of the marketplace. And clients are also using iShare as precision exposures to express targeted investment viewpoints to generate alpha with efficiency. In the fourth quarter, BlackRock kicked off some high iThinking, an innovative new initiative design to help distill market insight into clear actionable ideas for our client and matching them with different iShare solutions. We continue to be product innovation - was evident in December when we launched our CRBN or our low carbon targeted ETF design for individuals and institutions we're focusing on environmental sustainable activity. The United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund and the University System of Maryland Foundation provided the initial funding for this ETF and BlackRock now managed more than $250 billion in socially responsible strategies across our platform. 2014 was a turning point for our institutional business and as we entered 2015 with substantial momentum. Our scale and our global presence enables BlackRock to interact with our increasingly sophisticated client base in a highly specialized manner, and our financial institution group businesses are great example. In 2014, BlackRock was selected to manage mandates spanning multi-asset, fixed income, infrastructure debt, and its whole balance sheet outsourcing for global insurance clients driven by regulatory changes by M&A, and investors are looking for better ways to navigate in this low interest rate environment. In conjunction with asset management mandates, many of these clients also chose to partner with BlackRock and Aladdin on evaluation on risk and advisory services and even acquisition support to our BlackRock Solutions business. BlackRock is the only firm in the industry that can bring all of these components together to meet the needs of our clients and we do this with dedicated relationships and with investment teams who speak with our clients in their own language, we understand their industry and we can partner with them to create their needs, to provide the most proper solutions to their issues. Another area where we are creating tailored outcome is in the alternative space, particularly in the emerging alternative solution business, where BlackRock is building a holistic multidimensional solution portfolio, leverages our full global platform. We\u2019ve seen strong fund raising across our illiquid alternative product set, as the target of strategy we laid out on Investor Day unfolds. BlackRock raised nearly $6 billion in new commitments in 2014, across a variety of strategies including private equity, hedge fund solutions, opportunistic credit, renewable power, and infrastructure debt. We've recently completed our annual institutional clients rebalancing survey, which indicated that institutions are looking to significantly increase allocations to real estate including infrastructure. In the fourth quarter, BlackRock closed our second renewal power infrastructure fund, positioning us as one of the leading global renewable platforms in the industry. 2014, BlackRock rates commitments of nearly $800 million in renewable power and $1 billion in infrastructure debt. Momentum in this space demonstrates BlackRock's proprietary transaction source and capabilities and abilities to act as an extension of our clients internal teams. The tangible impact of the investments made to-date in our renewable power fund is also being felt by providing energy and electricity to more than a 100,000 households. We continue to make progress on the reinvigoration and globalization of our fundamental act of equity business and have seen meaningful impact on performance for some of our clients. We\u2019ve seen a major improvement in the performance of our U.K. equity strategies, we generated top cortile performances as we had our three year anniversary and our new management team in Asian equities, and our European equity strategies as posted in leading market share and solid broad based three and five year investment performance. The most recent leg of our investments in this area was focus on U.S. equities. We hired a world-class group of investors with strong processes and track record for generating alpha, we are now in our second year of the investment and seeing good progress, and hopefully we will improve on our investment performance. Although we have a lot of work to do, and quite frankly we\u2019re not at the space where I would like to be at this moment. 2014, was a challenging year for our active managers, with only 20% of the industry U.S. active equity funds outperformed their benchmarks. We saw a significant rise in volatility in the fourth quarter, but it was encouraging to see many of our active teams deliver stronger performances in the environment especially in December. Our basic value strategy achieved top quintile performance since the new manager inception, our large cap series, the strategy has improved from a second - to a second cortile from a fourth cortile, and our U.S. opportunity strategy is in the top quintile over three years. While our active business continues to feel the impact of plans balancing high conviction alpha strategies now with index exposures, the breath and diversity of our platform and the presence of the only skilled player in both active and index around the world will differentiate us in the ability to give our clients the full menu of solutions they need. We expect investor preference to vary over time and BlackRock stability to evolve alongside our clients is critical in the future for our success. Before I open it up for questions, I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank our employees for their hard work, incredible dedication in 2014, in helping our clients in the most complex investment challenges in the world by helping them to provide solutions. I\u2019d like to thank my entire management team, many of them who are thriving in their new role following successful organizational changes earlier this year. And I\u2019d like to recognize some of the milestones that BlackRock achieved in 2014. In retail, we crossed over $500 billion in assets under management. In iShares in 2014, we closed with more than $1 trillion in assets under management. In institutional, we garnered the best floors that we\u2019ve seen in over five years. Since the financial crisis or essentially since the end of 2007, the final year of the pre-crisis earnings, BlackRock has grown EPS by 142% versus the S&P 500, growing at 76% and the S&P financial index growing at only 9%, highlighting both the differentiation of our business model and our ability to execute on key growth strategies. All of the areas I\u2019ve spoken about whether it\u2019s fixed income, iShares, or financial institution group, alternatives, infrastructure, our active equity platform, all are areas where we made significant strategic investments over time and we\u2019ll be seeing the impact of those investments over time to our shareholders and to our clients. We will continue to make investments in BlackRock's future and keep very high margins and utilize the full scale of our Aladdin risk management and technology capabilities to meet our fiduciary duties to our clients and to deliver returns for shareholders in 2015. With that, operator let's open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Luke Montgomery with Bernstein. Luke Montgomery : I think obviously some unusual dynamics have been helping the institutional fixed-income ETF usage but it is a question really about the long-term opportunity. You have been adding talent to the sales force there. I think given the need for customized portfolios and immunization of specific liabilities in that context, how do you envision fixed-income ETF shares fitting into institutional portfolio construction? I think it's a question about how you characterize the value proposition rather than any liquidity challenge they might help address in the fixed-income market. Larry Fink : That's a good question. I'm going to let Rob Kapito answer that. Rob Kapito : So, the fixed income ETFs have been in increased demand as people are learning about the product. We're still in the early stages not only of institutions using the product but retail using the product as well. So there are three segments - there are the buy and hold segment where people are using ETFs as a part of their fixed income portfolio for the beta and fixed income, and we have products that are focused on that. The second thing is that as the financial markets change, ETFs are a surrogate for many financial instruments that have because of regulatory reasons and liquidity reasons become very expensive and they are surrogates for example in swaps and futures where ETFs are now being used, in fact more than futures are being used. And as people learn about that, they add that into their portfolios. On the other side of that, there also being used as we call it precision instruments where people are looking for a specific allocation and ETFs provide that specific precision tool for them to be investing it. So, this is just a beginning of where fixed income ETFs go and as you know that the fixed income markets are much larger than the equity markets are. So we just see continued growth in that. So for retail we\u2019re attacking that by adding on to our core series where we are adding products that can offer the full suite to what our retail investor would need over the long term in ETFs whether that be in high yield, in corporates, in treasuries, or just generic fixed income. And then on institutions, because they\u2019re looking for more of a trading vehicle and they\u2019re looking for the transparency and they\u2019re looking for the liquidity, we\u2019re adding more specific type of precision instruments for them. So, I would tell you that the demand to learn about ETFs grows and grows and we\u2019re just - we just think this is a market that we're very positive on going forward. And also for portfolio managers that are managing large portfolios, getting the beta exposure from ETFs is cheaper, it\u2019s more diversified and it\u2019s more liquid than the alternative, and I might add that's really important when you\u2019re in a low interest rate environment like we're in. So, we look forward to more growth in the fixed income and to be the leader in the ETFs in that area. Larry Fink : And one other point, fixing ETF utilization is far less than equity utilization and the opportunity for that to converge quite a bit. Luke Montgomery : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Dan Fannon : Good morning. I guess kind of building upon that and just thinking about your comment about substantial momentum in the institutional business heading into 2015, outside of what we just talked about there with the fixed-income ETF can you get a little more specific about where you see that demand and kind of maybe a way to characterize it versus previous periods in terms of either size or opportunity? Larry Fink : Well, the momentum is as I said carrying on into 2015. We\u2019re seeing \u2013 I think much of it has to do with the continuation of performance that we have generated with some top decile performance in our core business, our leading performance in our unconstrained fixed income, our top quartile maybe top decile performance in high yield. So across the board the performance in all the different fixed income products continues to be quite large and we\u2019re seeing more and more clients are just also using beta products for fixed income. So, across the board we're seeing that but in terms of where we\u2019re seeing clients looking to put more money to work, we're seeing increased activity in the client contribution area where we\u2019ve had some rather substantial wins. We continue to see in terms of insurance companies, always at the beginning of the year, they get big infusions of cash, this is one of the fundamental reasons why we thought that rates would be going down in the first part of the year, obviously we didn\u2019t expect some of the activities that occurred but fundamentally you always see some very large activities from insurance companies because of the beginning of the year. So, it's across the board and it\u2019s geographically diverse too. So we think this is going to continue but I must say with where rates are at this moment more and more clients are going to be looking for different types of expressions of exposure that I do believe with where rates are it's going to lead to more and more clients searching things like infrastructure debt, other activities like that and this is one of the reasons why we\u2019re so heavily invested in our infrastructure teams. We will continue to see clients reaching for yield and high yield whether that's a good strategy or a bad strategy. I specifically believe, rates are going to stay lower longer and I think the activities that you\u2019re seeing in Europe whether the court's approval of the OMT for the ECB and the greater possibility of QE from the ECB but continual easing in Japan and importantly as Chairwoman Yellen has said, she's going to be very data-dependent related to what the Federal Reserve does. So, I actually believe this just creates more money in motion and more opportunity for BlackRock especially with our flows. Dan Fannon : Great. That's helpful. And then Gary, if you could please just characterize the budget and how your outlook for 2015 with regards to kind of core expense growth. Gary Shedlin : I would say, let\u2019s break it down. I think that in terms of G&A, I think when we look at the fourth quarter on G&A obviously it was slightly elevated by virtue of some closed end fund launch cost, and obviously some FX measurement. But I think once you kind of exclude those two items, I think the fourth quarter is generally a decent run rate for the year in terms of G&A. And then more broadly as we think about margins, obviously notwithstanding some of the seasonality that we have in our own margins especially in the first quarter, margins more broadly are dependent on lots of things, especially the beta environment, the future business mix, the various reinvestment opportunities that we see in our business and obviously the competitive compensation environment. So I don\u2019t - our margin guidance really hasn\u2019t changed, as you know, we don\u2019t manage the business to a specific margin target and we remain ever committed to generating operating leverage, we\u2019re also reinvesting in the business. Dan Fannon : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Craig Siegenthaler : First, I was wondering if you could provide a quick update on SIFI? Found new commentary from both the SEC and FSOC, especially related to some of the activities that it seems like they are targeting like ETFs, alternatives, derivatives, securities lending with those being pretty relevant for you guys. Larry Fink : I don\u2019t think they\u2019re targeting any one product. I think you\u2019re investigating products where there is obviously large growth and where there is areas where you may have mismatches of liquidity and or you may have need for greater disclosure. So, there is nothing new from our point. We are - if a regulator asks us to provide information we do that worldwide. We are embracing in a very positive way the movement towards the review of activities. We will be the largest beneficiary if the market is perceived to be stronger or transparent, easier to understand by more investors we will be one of the largest beneficiaries of that event and so we are embracing the concept of better financial ecosystem for our clients and if that means greater disclosure, greater transparency, we will embrace that. But I think it\u2019s incorrect to say they are targeting because I don\u2019t think they are targeting at all, the conversations we\u2019re having - there are open dialogues, they\u2019re expressive. We are providing information as asked. Obviously the dialogues are one dimensional asked, why can\u2019t we provide information - and that\u2019s all we know. We presume these questions are being asked by dozens of dozens of different managers and - but we\u2019re up in this process and we will all wait and see alongside with you what the outcomes will be. And I think this will be quite granular, I think we will see how this plays out and - but unquestionably you\u2019re going to see probably different disclosure requirements or different liquidity issues in some products and by enlarge we're into more of that. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks, Larry. Very clear. Second question, 2014 was a year where we saw big pickup in pension risk transfers, pension closeouts. I was wondering if you have any thoughts on how this could trend in 2015 given some of the drivers like the change in the mortality tables? And given that BlackRock is a large manager of assets for clients on both sides of the aisle, pension plans, insurance companies, really maybe share some perspective here. Larry Fink : I don\u2019t know how this is going to play out with where rates are today going forward. I think it\u2019s very hard in most cases to be closing up pension funds, but let\u2019s step back and why have we seen elevated pension closeouts because you\u2019ve had significant rallies in U.S. equities over the last five years. Companies have been closer to meeting their liabilities and they have a desire to minimize income statement volatility because of the issues related to the pension fund. So, we are in dialogues with many people. Some of the firms have used annuities and working with insurance companies. As you said, we are in dialogue with many organization, some of the organizations are transforming the DB plans to DC. As I said, we\u2019re seeing elevated growth in our DC business in the fourth quarter and we expect that in the first quarter, and we are having dialogues with many, many institutions worldwide about the possibility. But I would just caution that with rates being so low, unless you see significant equity rallies it becomes a little harder to do that or the companies are going to have to infuse some type of money to making sure that they\u2019re matched. But I would say unquestionably BlackRock\u2019s global platform, the ability of having our strength in target date and in terms of DC plans and having like path on the DC side, we have a lot of components working with our clients whether it\u2019s LDI products which obviously will create a derisking and obviously we could help quite a bit in helping them think about how can a pension fund ultimately transfer some of the risks. But I don't want to call it unified across the board, I do believe depending on where each company is related to the liability. And as you suggested quite correctly about the elongation of age, these are all big issues. We've actually had conversations with organizations that did LDI years ago and now how do they factor in this elongated aging process and are they properly matched. So, but one thing is very clear to companies that have done the derisking, it is not a static one time event, they have to be constantly monitoring as depended on how the liabilities are changing. And as I said earlier, we are very involved in these dialogues, and I do believe this plays really well with our global platform of having great analytics and helping company think about it. We have long period of time of being involved with insurance companies and doing a lot of liability matching type of products for insurance companies that plays really well into LDI and other areas for us. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks Larry. Operator : You next question comes from Robert Lee with KBW. Robert Lee : I guess my first question is I am just going to capital management. You guys have certainly been very clear on how you think about capital management and you had the dividend increase that you just announced. But I'm just curious, if we look at the 250 commitment to share repurchase per quarter, that has been in place since the beginning of 2013 and I think since the end of 2012 GAAP earnings are up maybe about 35% or so. So is it reasonable to be thinking that that kind of 250 base commitment may be subject to some upward revision, too, as you continue to scale the Company? Larry Fink : Let see if Gary can answer this question. Gary Shedlin : So I think broadly we remain committed to consisting capital management. I think that we spoke last year a little bit about some of the uncertainty in the environment which I think, clearly still out there I think Larry commented more broadly on it. So consistent with that and as we've seen the earnings trajectory increase, we did obviously increase the dividend at our Board meeting yesterday by 13% to $2.18. Our buyback program is clearly a function of a number of things. We've already mentioned beta and other reinvestment opportunities that we see, as Larry likes to say, it's data-dependent I think you mentioned that earlier. But our expectation more broadly is for the year of the buyback program would be greater than the billion dollars that we repurchased last year, obviously we\u2019re going to watch markets as they evolve during the year and plan accordingly. Robert Lee : Great. Thank you. And maybe just a follow-up, and Larry I know you did mention you've had some nice wins in the DC space and this is the inevitable question about money in motion and fixed-income, but where do you think we are in the DC replacement cycle? I know you had talked about that in the past given strong performance you guys have had and how well entrenched or ubiquitous maybe one of your competitors has been. Do you feel that that is still in the early stages of that 401(k) replacement cycle, or is that kind of well underway? Larry Fink : Well, I truly believe the successes we had in 2014, will continue in 2015. The composition of our successes in fixed income across so many different products whether it\u2019s unconstrained, high yield, total return, MIA, is a great indication of the rest of our platform and importantly where we believe continue flows will be. On DC specifically, I think we're in the early component of that. We're in dialogue with many different contribution platforms and I do believe in the DC side, one of the reasons why we have the dialogue is there to strengthen our data products in fixed income, our strength in our index equities, our target date products, and because of the large and in depth conversations we have with our clients it\u2019s giving us a great avenue to help them think about how they\u2019re going to be thinking about the DC business. As I said, our total return business - total return product in DC is in the top 3% for one, three, and five. So, you come across whether as I said, target date or other products we\u2019re in a very good position to win or clients pull the money as that money remains in motion. Robert Lee : Great. Thanks for taking my questions guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Bill Katz with Citi. Bill Katz : Larry, you went through just a ton of things that are working very well for BlackRock. But one area that seemed to not get that much attention was active equity. I am sort of curious just stepping back maybe for BlackRock and for the industry at large, where are we in terms of investor appetite for coming back into that type of product versus as you mentioned earlier the barbell dynamic? Larry Fink : Well, the one area that I had a large amount of dialogue most recently is in factor based equity investing. That\u2019s the biggest most recent type of dialogue. So the one area where we\u2019ve done quite well is in the model base equities and we\u2019re still not seeing really any flows but we\u2019ve had now five years of great success there. I do believe the traditional fundamental equity business is alive, it\u2019s not well, it had poor performance as an industry, I think that\u2019s where you\u2019re alluding to. We\u2019ve seen great movement as an industry, movement out of maybe more of the fundamental investing into index. But I would say now, Bill, if you believe in a greater divergent market, a more volatile market - I've been asked many times questions related, should I be in an indexed product with a great divergence because I can't capture some of the great opportunities that are going to be masked by the great failures. So when you think about the energy market, if you think about an emerging market world context, China, India, is going to be hugely benefited by this. Countries like Russia, Nigeria, potentially Brazil, are going to be harmed by this, how do you play that. And so this is why more and more of our clients are asking about things about smart beta, factors, and I do believe we're going to need to capture different ways of finding alpha, but importantly in our actions related to fundamental equities, we\u2019ve always said this is a five year project, 2015 begins the third year. We are committed to this and if you do believe in the world of great divergence, if you believe in a world that one day you will have - whenever that day will be, higher rates, it generally means - historically you would think this is a better environment for stock picking in fundamental equities. So our model is purposely built and positioned to benefit on this active and passive world, but the one thing that I am going to be pretty loud about, I do believe the most neglected component of the equity investing is basically model or factor based investing where we have a great platform, we\u2019ve had great returns specially overseas. And I am very bullish on building this out as a component of our active equity area and I am quite frustrated to be frank that we haven\u2019t seen the momentum that I thought we would, but this is an area where in my most recent meetings, last week in Asia, every client asked about factor based investing in a divergent world. So we\u2019ll see how that plays out, Bill. But I do believe in this divergent world and the way we are built the model of BlackRock will be a beneficiary of that. Bill Katz : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our last question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Larry, if you can just comment on the inflow situation from the money in motion and PIMCO and other competitors in terms of your fixed-income franchise and do you think a lot of that went into the ETF component and might shift over as those investors reallocate throughout the year? And do you still see that as a tens of billions opportunity next year? Laurence Fink : We see because of where rates are and the expectation where rates might go, I think people are focused on having a higher allocation to a fixed income ETFs and the R&D generics. And there is a lot of money in motion because of people's plans for fixed income and rate of use for fixed income this year. And certainly because some money is flowing from various competitors and I think that\u2019s money because of the rates are, because of the fees are in general in the asset management business that EPS will see a larger percentage of [indiscernible]. Rob Kapito : I just had one thing. There is so much noise about our West Coast friend and competitor. Much of the money in motion is totally in related to what's going on there. I think there is more dialogue going on because of this low rate environment and how should that be played out. And I think that's the compelling story. How does an income oriented investor whether it\u2019s an insurance company, a retiree who is struggling to meet the income needs of the \u2013 this is where we are in much greater dialogue. I have had great dialogue on where interest rates are and what does it mean for some of the largest suburban wealth funds. So, I think the dialogue start with the macro environment and how to play it. And that is the most forceful reason why there is so much money in motion. Obviously you have cyclical changes in one manager versus another but that's always evident in the marketplace. And I think it is just weighing too much commentary related to that and its masking what lower rates are doing related to client's needs. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks? Larry Fink : Yeah, let me just touch on one more thing. Our fourth quarter and full year results as I think we have kind of expressed in our formatted speeches and in the Q&A, truly highlight the diversity and the differentiated platform of BlackRock. We are seeing the impact of our large scale investing that we made over a year and we are continuing to make those large scale investing in infrastructure and equities. We're going to continue to make these investments and those investments are going to pay-off in the next few years. And I think it\u2019s vital to understand that we believe this differentiated platform is the key component of what is been delivering, this type of compounded growth that we have had on behalf of our clients for our shareholders. And I think that will continue and most importantly what I'm proud of as an organization we were able to deliver these investments and I'm not here to tell you all investments paid off, but we\u2019ve been to continue to deliver these investments. And at the same time as Gary discussed, we saw a consistent increase in our margins over the course of the last five year. I think this is what differentiates BlackRock and I'm certainly not suggesting that we\u2019ll continue forever. But I do believe that continual investment in people, I have to remind people, three years ago we only had \u2013 we had less than 10,000 employees. Today, we have 12,000 employees. This is just an investing in our platform, investing in our client connectivity, and investing in products and in most cases we're delivering. And this is something that really has given us that differentiated business model. And I do believe it's going to continue to drive our future at BlackRock. So, I just want to thank you everyone for taking the time this morning. And thank you for your interest at BlackRock. Have a good quarter and hopefully the next few weeks are going to be little less volatile than the last few weeks. So enjoy. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference.

My name is Regina and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated First Quarter 2015 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today\u2019s call will be, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel Matthew Mallow. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question and answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Mallow, you may begin your conference. Matthew Mallow : Thanks very much. Good morning everyone. I am Matt Mallow the General Counsel of BlackRock and before Larry and Gary make their remarks, let me remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock\u2019s actual results, may and most likely will of course, differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today and additionally, BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So with that, let\u2019s begin the call. Gary? Gary Shedlin : Thanks, Matt and good morning everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to be here to present results for the first quarter of 2015. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I will review our quarterly financial performance and business results. As usual I will be focusing primarily on as adjusted results. We are committed to generating strong organic growth demonstrating operating leverage and maintaining a consistent capital management policy as a framework for generating long-term shareholder value.  Our first quarter results once again highlight the value of the investments we\u2019ve made to assemble the industry\u2019s broadest suite of active and index investment offerings and to deliver differentiated, customized investment solutions to our clients.  BlackRock delivered first quarter earnings per share of $4.89, up 10% compared to a year ago. Revenue rose 2% to $2.7 billion despite the negative FX impacts on our non-dollar denominated base fees and over $70 million of transaction-related revenue in last year\u2019s first quarter. Operating income was $1.1 billion, 1% higher on a year-over-year basis. Non-operating results for the quarter reflected $58 million of net investment gains including a one-time gain of $40 million related to the fair value of our pre-existing interest in BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors. Our 23.7% as adjusted tax rate for the first quarter benefited from $69 million of non-recurring items. We currently estimate that 30% remains a reasonable projected tax rate for the remainder of 2015. BlackRock\u2019s first quarter results were driven by $70 billion of long-term net new flows representing an annualized organic growth rate of 6.5%. Flows were positive across all asset classes, investment styles, client types and regions and organic revenue growth once again outpaced organic asset growth.  Over the last 12 months, despite an increasingly volatile macro environment, BlackRock generated over $250 billion in total net new business representing a 5% long-term organic growth rate evidencing this fidelity of our highly diversified platform.  First quarter base fees rose 4% year-over-year as average AUM increased due to organic growth and market appreciation, despite almost $220 billion of negative FX impacts associated with dollar appreciation against foreign currencies over the last 12 months. On a constant currency basis, we estimate that base fees grew approximately 8% year-over-year. Base fees were roughly flat compared to the fourth quarter, primarily driven by a lower day count in the first quarter, entry rate headwinds and the continued impact of divergent beta and FX. Performance fees of $108 million were broad based, but nonetheless decreased $50 million from a year ago, due to the impact of a large fee associated with the liquidation of an opportunistic mortgage fund. BlackRock Solutions revenue of $147 million was down 5% year-over-year due primarily to declines in FMA transaction-related revenue and 14% sequentially due primarily to the timing of completed advisory assignments.  Our Aladdin business which represented 86% to the BlackRock Solutions revenue in the quarter grew 13% year-over-year, but was flat sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by several sizable clients going live on the Aladdin platform in 2014, while sequential results were impacted by the timing and recognition of certain revenues, as well as FX movements, we continue to see strong market demand for global investment platform consolidation and multi-asset risk solutions. The year-over-year revenue decline in our FMA business resulted from meaningful transaction-based disposition activity during 2014. We continue to believe that our FMA business model is well positioned to benefit from partnering with sophisticated financial institutions and governmental entities to address the most complex balance sheet, risk and governance challenges in the ever changing political and regulatory climate. Total expense rose $38 million year-over-year or 2% driven primarily by increased G&A, AUM-related and direct fund expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was roughly flat year-over-year as the combination of a stronger dollar and a global employee base offset and increase in headcount.  As we have previously noted, the first quarter adjusted compensation-to-revenue ratio generally runs higher than the full year due to the seasonality of payroll taxes. G&A expense increased $26 million year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher marketing and promotional expense, and the impact of a one-time real estate-related benefit in last year\u2019s first quarter. Sequentially, G&A expense decreased $48 million, primarily reflecting seasonally lower marketing and promotional expense, lower foreign exchange remeasurement expense, and closed-end fund launch costs incurred in the fourth quarter of 2014 consistent with last year, aggregate G&A expense in the first quarter benefited from a delay in the timing of certain expense items, which will be incurred in the remainder of 2015.  We remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first, reinvesting in our business, and then returning excess cash to shareholders. In line with that commitment, on March 6, we acquired certain assets of BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors, enhancing our credit platform to the addition of a middle-market private credit capability.  We previously announced a 13% increase in our quarterly dividend to $2.18 per share of common stock and also repurchased an additional $275 million worth of shares during the first quarter. Based on what we know today, this increased level of quarterly share repurchases represents a reasonable run rate for the remainder of 2015.  Our consistent earnings growth and stable financial results reflect the benefits of our diverse platform, long-term client partnerships and commitment to investment performance. First quarter long-term net inflows were nearly evenly split between our active and index franchises and were positive in each of our geographic regions. BlackRock\u2019s global retail franchise saw long-term net inflows of $14 billion, representing at 11% annualized organic growth rate. Flows were driven by continued strength and outcome-oriented offerings including unconstrained fixed income and multi-asset strategy. Despite slower net flows in the US mutual fund industry during the quarter, the diversity of our franchise and strong performance in active fixed income positioned BlackRock to continue to enhance its market share position. US retail flows of $7 billion reflected strong fixed income flows across a diverse set of props including our top defile total return and high yield franchises and our flagship strategic income opportunities fund which was again the industry-leading unconstrained bond fund during the quarter. International retail net inflows of $7 billion replaced by strong flows into our global unconstrained fixed income and multi-asset franchises. In addition, our leading European equities franchise benefited from a return to a risk-on environment and our top quartile Asian equity funds gathered more than $800 million in average inflows during the quarter. Global iShares generated over $35 million of net new business in the first quarter representing 14% annualized organic growth. iShares retained the number one market share position of flows globally with strong flows in each of our product segments, core, precision exposures including our minimum volatility, factor and currency head suites and financial instruments where we saw ongoing momentum in replacing swaps and futures with ETFs.  iShare\u2019s results were led by fixed income net inflows of $19 billion and we again captured the number one global market share of the industry\u2019s fixed income ETF flows. Equity flows of $17 billion were driven by flows into the core series and demand for international developed market and European exposures.  iShare\u2019s flows were also diverse quite globally, with particularly strong growth in Europe where we are seeing broad based acceleration in ETF adoption across all segments and all asset classes. European iShare\u2019s flows of $15 billion in the quarter represented annualized organic growth of over 25%. Our institutional business generated approximately $21 billion in long-term net inflows for the quarter, the highest institutional flows we have seen since the BGI acquisition. Institutional index net inflows were led by strength in index equity, driven by defined contribution flows, offsetting outflows in our traditional defined benefit business.  Institutional active net inflows of $18 billion reflected BlackRock\u2019s strong multi-asset capabilities and top performing fixed income platform. Multi-asset inflows reflected significant solutions-based funding, particularly in the insurance outsourcing space and strong demand for our dynamic diversified growth strategy and our LifePath target-date series.  During the quarter, we also saw the funding of a $2 billion unconstrained fixed income separate account. While institutional active equity flows were flat for the quarter, we saw inflows of nearly $2 billion into our scientific active equity business, where 96% of assets are performing above benchmark over a five year period.  Bar-belling continues to be a key strength as institutional clients pair cost effective beta exposure with alternative and other high conviction alpha solutions to achieve uncorrelated returns net of approximately $700 million of capital success in return to clients, institutional alternatives generated $1 billion of net new business, led by infrastructure and hedge fund solutions.  In addition, we had another strong fund raise in quarter for liquid alternatives raising more than $2 billion in new commitments and now have over $10 billion in committed capital to deployed for clients.  $800 million of net new flows from the recently announced ABR re-transaction funded in April and are not included in first quarter results. In connection with this funding, we will incur a product placement fee of approximately $5 million in the second quarter. In summary, in the quarter marked by continued volatility and divergent macro trends, our diversified business continue to deliver stable financial results.  With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry. Laurence Fink : Thanks, Gary. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining the call. Our strong performance over the last quarter\u2019s result of the significant investments we made in our firm over the last few years. The investments we made in our people, the investments we made in our process and importantly, the investments we made in our technology, all of which have been driven by our efforts to continually adapt to our changing market environments, the changing world environments, and to meet the needs of our clients. BlackRock is focused on helping our clients navigate an increasingly difficult, unpredictable, and divergent financial and economic landscape. Investors today are faced with volatility in currencies and commodity markets; they are faced with sustained low and even negative interest rates and shifting long-term macro trends including longevity, and the significant impact on technology on jobs.  Divergent economic conditions and Central Bank actions have sent currency markets into one of the most volatile periods on record affecting both developed economies such as Japan, and the Eurozone, as well as the emerging markets. The relative value of the US dollar and associated currency volatility is obviously having a rapid and material impact on large multinational companies. But it\u2019s also affecting smaller US companies and consumers, whereas a result of advancements in technology are increasingly buying and selling products in a virtual global economy.  Historic low rates have been having a tremendous impact on how investors save for the future. The flow of funds in search of returns to meet future liabilities is growing larger everyday. This mix of growing assets of shirking supply of low rates is creating a dangerous imbalance and the increasingly desperate search for yields is now the greatest single source of prudential risk in the financial system.  At the same time we are seeing a powerful changes in longevity and retirements and the investments in technology making the global economy and the way capital flows throw up flow through it and this is having a major impact in how we and our clients are living, how our clients work and how we invest. At BlackRock we are constantly looking at the world and at ourselves to assess whether our platform, our services, our strategies can help our clients meet the challenges of evolving investment landscape. The need to anticipate changes and develop solutions is why we have deliberately equipped BlackRock\u2019s business model with such a wide range of capabilities, a capability of no other asset manager possesses.  The issue impacting financial markets are beyond our ability to control, but what we can control at BlackRock is how we respond to these issues, how we build out our platform, how we execute our strategies we\u2019ve set forth for our business and how we deliver investment solutions to our clients. BlackRock\u2019s first quarter results demonstrate the investments we made to differentiate our platform over time are driving value for our clients and most certainly are driving value for our shareholders. In the first quarter, BlackRock generated $70 billion of long-term net inflows representing a 6.5% quarterly annualized organic growth rate and a 5.5% organic growth rate over the last 12 months. Similar to our fourth quarter in 2014, we had a diverse composition of flows, something that was very, very important for me as I think about our business. This composition flows is positive across our client base, positive across asset classes, regions and investment styles.  Particularly, we are seeing a significant momentum in our active business where we experienced the highest total active flows we\u2019ve seen since 2007 at $32 billion representing a 9% organic - annualized organic growth rate in the first quarter.  Roughly, two-thirds of the assets BlackRock manages are related to retirement. So core of what we do? And particularly we are focused on helping investors shift their focus away from the next day and towards an annual income and retirement. This is a difficult adjustment for many investors but a critical one for helping our clients achieve their goals. They face significant challenges in a narrow zero rate environment, or by allocations of loans are insufficient to meet the liability burdens of pension funds, to meet the needs of insurers, and to meet the needs of our individual investors.  The diversity and strength of BlackRock\u2019s fixed income business is helping investors in all types to navigate that environment and drove $36 billion of net inflows, across our global platforms. We continue to benefit from strong performance across our fixed income business, where 91% of our active taxable fixed income AUM is above benchmark or per medium for a three year period.  SIO is in the 14th percentile. High yield bond is in the 10th percentile and total return is in the second percentile and the first percentile over one year. Clients also continue to adopt iShares\u2019 fixed income ETFs as an efficient asset allocation and exposure tool. And iShares remains the global leader in fixed income in the first quarter capturing the never won market share of flows of 53% with $19 billion of net inflows. Today, investors are increasingly focused on outcome-oriented strategies that target specific goals while they are generating an income stream preserving capital, or growing assets within a certain risk profile and they are moving beyond the balance of traditional fixed income strategies into global, unconstrained or multi-asset strategies to achieve those objectives.  BlackRock\u2019s multi-asset platform the combination of our investment management expertise, a robust portfolio of construction business and superior risk management, is all leveraging or unifying the Aladdin platform enabling us to provide investment strategies that will help our clients achieve the investment outcome inline with their needs and their objectives. To counter low yields, retail investors are leveraging our multi-asset income fund which has a wide net across asset classes to tap into income opportunities both within and beyond bonds and has a dynamic approach to balancing risk, return and income, while seeking to mitigate volatility. Institutional investors are similar trained to our dynamic diversified growth fund for diversification for stable returns and also manage volatility.  Our ability to have deep and robust dialogue with our clients and to work closely with them and to provide some thought leaderships is what is allowing us to provide more tailored, customized strategies and this is a very important component of what is transforming BlackRock with our clients, the breadth of products as I said earlier, our risk management capabilities and you dovetail it altogether, we have a more and deeper dialogue with more clients than we\u2019ve ever had in our 27 year history. We saw more than $9 billion of solution-based funding for insurance clients in the quarter as they continue to search for holistic solutions to navigate a low-yield environment, the transformational partnerships with the combination of a true One BlackRock effort and the resulting mandates span the best of our firm from active to passive to alternatives, all powered by risk management and Aladdin capabilities. These custom solution assignments leveraged our complete platform, they build deeper and more robust relationships with our clients and clients are finding out that no other firm in our industry has the capabilities to create this type of partnership and to replicate these types of capabilities. One key area where we are continuing to build out those capabilities even further is in infrastructure. Infrastructure investments help our clients access an alternative asset class that provides inflation protection diversification, and the potential of our capital appreciation and importantly for so many of our clients a long duration returns.  A key aspect of our work has been to promote improved public private partnerships which jointly increase opportunities for investors and to help governments access much needed sources of capital to drive economic growth to create countries to have a better economic future to improve the quality and life of countries and to create job creation. This is a perfect marriage of building a base of clients and their capital with the needs of countries and building a better economic future and this is one of the strong reasons why we are emphasizing infrastructure over the next coming years as a major component of our positioning at BlackRock, our positioning with the client, and our positioning with various countries of the world.  In March we teamed with PEMEX, Mexico\u2019s national oil company to finance two natural pipelines, gas pipelines, critical to Mexico\u2019s continued economic growth. The partnership builds upon the well established track record of our existing infrastructure business and by extending our infrastructure footprint in Mexico, will offer BlackRock\u2019s local and international clients access to a previously untapped investment opportunity.  Another area where we continue to invest is technology, which is always been central to our business model. Our Aladdin platform which we transformed from an internal risk and investment management system to a revenue generating business providing a unique competitive advantage for BlackRock.  Aladdin revenues grew 13% year-over-year and increasing value as third parties operating platforms position BlackRock to consistently invest a growing stream of revenues into improving our technology, into expanding our technological offerings, to powering a constant upgrade cycle for the Aladdin community and driving a network effect benefits for our clients and for our shareholders.  Technology has not only shaped the way BlackRock serves clients through Aladdin and how we view risk management, it also drives the way we build investment solutions. Technology and data science are enabling BlackRock to bind our fundamental investment expertise with the best of our scientific and index investing to create innovative investment strategies. And we are investing in people with exceptional strong backgrounds in data technology to drive this effort.  Another area where we have been building out our capabilities is to meet the growing demand from investment offerings that have a measurable positive social impact; I would infrastructure as one of those capabilities. In the first quarter, we announced the launch of our new BlackRock impact platform which will truly unify the firm\u2019s approach to impact investing where we currently manage more than $225 billion in assets.  As a fiduciary, BlackRock thinks seriously our responsibilities not only to provide the investment performance and the solutions our clients need, but we also are taking a leadership role in advocating for the best \u2013 for our clients\u2019 best interest and those of the broader market and economy when it comes to long-term investment by the companies we invest on behalf of our clients. These efforts are led by our corporate governance team which engages extensively with thousands of companies in order to help foster the best long-term outcomes for those companies and by doing so increasing value for our clients. Our corporate governance team has a gold standard for the industry and is another key differentiating factor for BlackRock and our responsibilities with all our clients. As part of our engagement effort, earlier this week I sent a letter to CEOs globally including those of every company in the S&P 500 urging them to engage on key governance matters then in our experience supports long-term and sustainable financial performance.  We recognize that some of the market dynamics that I described earlier present an overwhelming challenge for companies working to reset short-term pressures, but companies can help diminish these pressures and improve their own positioning by developing and articulating a clear convincing and creating a long-term strategy and long-term value.  These efforts will help them attract long-term stakeholders and lay the foundations for a stronger, a more sustainable, and more stable economic growth for our country and other countries around the world. Once again in the first quarter we initiated some truly innovative and unique mandates that will drive our long-term value for our clients and our investors. Our PEMEX partnership is the first of its kind since Mexico passed its historical energy reform since 2013. We announced several highly customized solution mandates to help our global insurance clients navigate a historical challenging interest rate environment.  We partnered with Ace to launch a new vehicle that pairs the strength of their insurance businesses with our ability to provide best-in-class investment returns. And in Asia, we are expanding our relationships with some of the world\u2019s largest asset owners in new ways, in one big case using Aladdin to better understand risk and enhancing the quality of returns and clients portfolio and a second case, employing our transition management team to both implement a lion mark asset allocation changes that a client is undertaking in an effort to stimulate their nation\u2019s economy. Individually and collectively, these mandates demonstrate the BlackRock creativity, BlackRock\u2019s innovation, and the breadth that BlackRock provide for solution-oriented offerings. And more importantly, through that process, this creates and fosters deeper and more meaningful relationship with our clients which will then allow us to have and working with them a larger share of their wallet. It is the strengthening of these relationships, our relentless focus on improving the firm that will drive our future growth, and will drive and create long-term value for our shareholders.  Once again I want to thank our employees for the continued unwavering dedication in creating a better financial future for our clients. I want to thank the employees for being excellent students of the financial market to be prepared to answer questions for all our clients and with that, I\u2019d like to open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Laurence Fink : Hi Glenn Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. I guess, I\u2019ll focus on the retail side of the house. You continue to make progress, you made a lot of investments, it\u2019s paying dividends, $14 billion in this quarter, $11 billion last quarter and you\u2019ve changed some of the way that you comp your people there. So, I consider BlackRock a big winner and some of the fiduciary changes, the Department of Labor is suggesting, but I am just curious how you think about it on both the iShares side of the house but also the traditional retail distribution, because it impacts you guys in a lot of ways. Laurence Fink : The DOL proposal? Glenn Schorr : Correct, correct. Laurence Fink : First of all, there is a 75 day common period and we have to recognize this is just a proposal and it may evolve and change. I said all along, we are a huge supporter of regulatory efforts in the protection of clients\u2019 interest. I think as you just suggested, if clients feel more secure in their investments, and they believe that their investments will indeed produce the outcomes that they are looking for, no firm is a better winner on having more participation in financial markets than BlackRock. So, on a macro basis, we are a huge supporter of making the investment world somewhat better for the investors, so the investors feel that they have a equal opportunity to win over the long run. As proposed, there is certainly going to be changes in how people navigate their interest. As you suggested, we are \u2013 in some categories, some people have said this is going to benefit indexing more than active. We are not 100% certain there, but obviously, we will be a big beneficiary of this. We have benefited and are proven in retail and iShares has to do with as you said, we have built a bigger and a more robust team working with our client base. We combined our retail and iShare sales force to provide what we call a client-centric approach. We are agnostic about beta products versus alpha products. We are trying to help and achieve outcomes and I don\u2019t think we are harmed in anyway related to whatever that\u2019s proposed in the DOL, but this \u2013 what DOL is doing is actually playing into our approach of how we are trying to navigate beta products and alpha products, mutual fund products with index and ETF products. So, we are well positioned for that, but I do believe we are well positioned because how we organize ourselves for related to client-centric approach. Glenn Schorr : Fair enough. I guess, the only follow-up I had is, is at the highest level, couldn\u2019t agree with you more, $70 billion of flows, very broad based. It underscores all the points you made. At the end of the day, when I look at it and I see flat operating leverage and flat margins albeit at very high levels, it just took me back a drop and I just don\u2019t know if they are just a bunch of moving parts with some of the year-on-year stuff and the FX impacts. So, wonder if you could\u2026 Laurence Fink : I am going to let Gary talk about it. I think Gary could give you a little more color on the FX. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate. Thanks. Gary Shedlin : Well, I think your question is specific to the operating leverage and margin point. So, I would say the following, Glenn. I think first of all, let\u2019s break it down. If we look at the revenue side, obviously, the revenue was impacted as we said by about $70 million and in the year ago quarter that we would deem more opportunistic. So obviously, that\u2019s a big chunk of that came from the performance fee and then we had some significant transaction-related revenue in our FMA business. Obviously, then we got the FX impact and we noted that on a constant currency basis, we think that base fees alone would have been probably up closer to 8% year-over-year. Then we look at the expense side, and I think on the expense side, we are obviously benefiting to a certain extent from significant non-dollar expense that we have. We have about 5800 employees that sit outside of the Americas that represents close to \u2013 I think 47% or 48% of our total employee base. But obviously, notwithstanding that, there is still margin associated with our non-dollar sources of profitability. So, I think, what I would suggest to you, I hate these start to get into a so-called normalization, because who knows what the definition of normalization is and that\u2019s a difficult concept. But I would say that on a more recurring basis, if we thought about our \u2013 both our revenues and expenses, there is obviously been some timing differences that we also noted on the expense side versus last year in terms of the real estate credit and taking into account FX more broadly, we look at our own business on a more normalized basis and we\u2019d suggest that we see positive year-over-year margin improvement and operating leverage. Glenn Schorr : Okay. I appreciate that guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Will Katz with Citi. Please go ahead. William Katz : Laurence Fink : Hi, Bill. William Katz : Hey, good morning guys. Thanks so much for the update. First question I have is maybe we stand the expense side for a second, Gary, you mentioned you expect to see a bit of a seasonal pick up in G&A as you go forward. Just sort of wondering, where the growth might be and how we might be able to frame it out in absolute dollars? Gary Shedlin : I\u2019m sorry, Bill, you are talking about expense more broadly, or? William Katz : Well, I think, you mentioned G&A was seasonally low, timing was little bit delayed for some of the initiatives. So I was curious of what \u2013 where you focus on in terms of the initiatives and then absolute dollar size, what kind of rate of increase are we talking about? Gary Shedlin : Yes, I mean, we obviously, try not to give a whole lot of guidance on that. But I do think that we tend to see a little bit of a lower ramp up in our G&A spend at the beginning of any part of the year. And I think as we mentioned on a sequential basis, versus the fourth quarter, we obviously had \u2013 we basically benefited from the fact that we didn\u2019t have a closed-in funds launch in this quarter that we did mentioned that we\u2019ll be having about $5 million of product placement fees associated with AVR RE. There is obviously some FX re-measurement stuff that also goes on that creates some noise quarter \u2013 quarter-to-quarter. But I think generally speaking, we haven\u2019t really changed our estimate for run rate G&A over the course of the year. It just means that a lot of it\u2019s going to be pushed into the latter part of the year as it was last year. William Katz : Okay, and as a follow-up question, I may have Larry or yourself, scientific turned around a little bit this quarter, you have great performance. How much of that is market share gain versus sort of a step-up of demand and the broader question is, you mentioned both passive and alternatives or high concentration alpha, where is the market in terms of more generic long only relative value you mandate these days? Gary Shedlin : Well, we are seeing increased flows as you suggested in our scientific equity offerings. We are seeing more \u2013 we have more dialogue on our model-based, factor-based products and we have had now in five years. I was frustrated as you know in other calls over the years that we have not seen as much flows in that area. I think as some fundamental products have underperformed and people are starting to recognize that 96% of our SAE products are above our peer medium over five years. And I think there is more interest today than we\u2019ve seen in over five years for some type of model-based, factor-based investment strategies. You are seeing more and more in the mutual fund, even in some cases, ETFs more smart beta type of products. And I believe this is going to finally begin a period of substantial momentum in these areas. And so I do believe you are going to see shifts in that area as an industry more towards smart beta factor-based investing. And I am not suggesting fundamental is going away, it\u2019s not. And so, but I believe we are positioned at BlackRock to benefit from that re-looking at the scientific or model-based equity. We intend to be announcing some very substantial hires in this area. I talked about data management. We believe other sources of information like big dad is going to be an important component to how one looks at investing and so we are investing in these areas to \u2013 for the fundamental and our scientific side. And this is probably one of \u2013 this is going to be one of our more exciting offerings in the coming years and this is an area that I believe is going to finally start to seeing accelerated growth. So, it\u2019s not a matter of share, Bill, as you ask, it\u2019s a function of the world is re-focusing on these products. Both on the retail side and the institutional side. William Katz : Okay, it\u2019s helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Laurence Fink : Hi, Craig. Craig Siegenthaler : Hey, thanks. Good morning everyone. With many large prime money market funds converting to government funds now, and now the LCR also requiring banks to hold more short-term government paper. How do you think the demand supply dynamic will impact T-bill yields and accordingly the yields for government money market funds here? Laurence Fink : I will let Rob talk about that. Robert Kapito : So, obviously, [Indiscernible] changes and where rates are going to go over the next year are going to have a pretty big impact than where we are going to see flows in the money market arena. So right now, we are seeing more flows internationally than domestic. We are seeing more clients than in government and if rates change that will reverse. So we are taking an approach where we have gone out to our clients and talking about the future regulation and preparing products for them that will make sense depending upon where rates are. So, some of those things sort be for example. We are going to be going with constant net asset value, government money market funds and those will be without redemption gates or liquidity fees. We have the floating net asset value of institutional prime money market funds and we plan to maintain our largest prime fund which we have about $66.5 billion and that\u2019s the temp fund and that will be our private institutional fund. And then we have others that were preparing a floating rate short maturity institutional prime money market fund and a constant NAV government money market fund and short maturity national and state-specific muni funds. We are also prepared to do separate accounts. So, it really is going to depend upon where the regulation ends. Of course, you know that the implementation date of all of these new products are around October of 2016. So, I think working together with our clients to make sure that we are prepared, no matter where rates go is important for us and year-over-year, we have about $39 billion that\u2019s been added into the cash fund. That\u2019s about a 15% year-over-year growth. So there is still a lot of demand for money market type products and it will just change some of the nuances to be able to apply with the regulatory issues. But this is a big business for us and we also see some of the smaller money market groups approaching us as well because scale and size is also going to be very important to be able to satisfy our clients\u2019 needs. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks, Rob. Just as my follow-up here. I was wondering if you guys can provide some background of flow trends between the retail focus core series and also your higher fee generating equity EPS and you know what while it\u2019s positive to see growth, it seems like there maybe a little bit of a mix shift undergoing in the equity business. So maybe you can just provide some color here. Robert Kapito : So, certainly there is a big change in mix depending upon performance and also depending upon what areas clients are focused on. So there is two-parts to that question. One is, people looking on an institutional basis for precision exposures in particular areas like emerging markets which would have a higher fee versus, buy and hold segments that are looking to supplement what they own with ETFs and what they call a core series. Now, there is a difference in fee between the precision instruments like in emerging markets and the core series which is more of a buy and hold segment. So, quite frankly, we are seeing growth in both of those right now. But, this is an area that is starting to gain attention. It\u2019s starting to mature and what we are trying to do is develop a core set of products that is going to be for the buy and hold segment. We continue to round that out. We had over $12 billion that\u2019s going into that core segment. In the quarter, we\u2019ve had about a 25% organic growth in this global core segment versus just a 14% overall market share in the iShares business. But the point here is that, there is a somewhat of a fee shift, but it\u2019s not that dramatic and it\u2019s not the overriding factor in people buying these iShares. Its segmentation is spilling out their portfolios and what they want and then of course you have to be competitive in what they are buying. But we don\u2019t see an overall dramatic change in the pricing and this removing from high fee to lower fee, particularly where you need. Laurence Fink : Craig, I would also add, in terms of the fees and fee mix, as I emphasize, we saw strong flows in fixed income and so some of that you are just saying, the fee mix change because of great flows into fixed income ETFs. So, as Rob discussed, it\u2019s not necessarily moving from one product in equity to another. So, I would tell you there is a constant amount of pressure to making sure we are competitive related to fees. We are going to continue to have that pressure and we want to be a leader in that. And so, we are very comfortable with the mix of business and how business is evolving. But more, we are winning new clients that we did not have or more buy and hold where this was not where BlackRock had great market share and as we penetrate more and more of the independent advisors that historically was more the landscape of a vanguard, where we are starting to see increased flows in our core series. So it\u2019s not that we are seeing a substitution with some of our clients, we are penetrating more in different clients. As Rob said, we are penetrating more buy and hold clients too. So, we look at this as our broadening of our platform not necessarily an outright fee mix change. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks, Larry. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Please go ahead. Laurence Fink : Hi, Robert. Robert Lee : Hi, thanks. Hey guys. Good morning. I have a question really on the \u2013 I wanted to on the DC business. I guess, first question is, you certainly have had very strong fixed income flows, but just curious in your perspective have you seen the replacement activity in the 401(k) market that has been talked about for a while. I think you guys expected and kind of maybe how do you feel like if that\u2019s happening if you are kind of getting your fair share of that activity? Laurence Fink : We grew, in the first quarter, defined contribution business by $20 billion, so, I am not sure if that\u2019s a fair share. I believe it is, I think we had a very good quarter of defined contribution. We are investing quite a bit which then represents about 14% organic growth. So, we are well positioned in it. We are increasingly working on more trends that are impacting in a favorable way for us. So, keep in mind, what are the trends in DC. There is a greater trend towards open architecture, really good for us in BlackRock. I mean, historically, we were harmed by close architecture, more open architecture allows us to provide our products. Two, in DC, there is a greater demand for indexation that obviously plays into our strength. Three, as a innovator in target date, we are benefiting from that. So, do you add those three combinations plus, we have witnessed in lot of the $20 billion of flows because our strong active fixed income performance we are seeing accelerated flows in those DC plans that are consistent and staying with the active strategies. So, across the board, I would tell you, we have \u2013 probably, as large of opportunities in DC than we\u2019ve had in years, and years, and years and much of it has to do as I discussed earlier, our positioning, our strength in performance in fixed income, our strength in designing target date products and moving towards indexation, and much of it has to do with, DC market not growing as a whole. In fact, there is a belief that DC can slowly start decreasing as the men and women are getting closer to retirement are spending what they accrued. But I believe BlackRock has a great opportunity in front of us to gain market share and we are very well positioned in product and we are well positioned to take advantage of this because our positioning in the index and in active fixed income. Robert Lee : Okay, great. Thanks. And then, maybe just one follow-up on the ETF business, I mean, obviously, business is going gangbusters in the US, outside the US and I am just curious, I mean, you guys have come up with different ETF product structures and I am thinking of particularly of kind of some of the term date fixed income strategies you\u2019ve come up with, developed. And it doesn\u2019t feel like those particularly have taken off. I am just kind of curious to know your thoughts on that, just it would seem to be a kind of ideal structure for these low rate environment if investors are nervous about higher rates to kind of turn things out. But, just, kind of your thoughts on why maybe that hasn\u2019t taken hold as much as you would have \u2013 maybe should have \u2013 would have expected? Robert Kapito : So, your guess is as good as ours. We try to have different products in the pipeline to satisfy what we think our clients should be looking at. But there is a whole product process here of awareness going on a socking to clients that will take them a while to understand what the product is, they like to see its performance a bit before they invest in it. So, I can\u2019t tell you exactly why we think that it makes sense as you do. But we like to have different products in the pipeline and actually we have pretty high aspirations for these. One of the ones that I am a little disappointed in is, is the iBonds that we have, because it really fits a client\u2019s portfolio so much better than buying individual bonds and taking to risk of the bid offer spread and having more liquidity and pricing diversification and look through treatment. So, I am a little disappointed, but, if I axe on that and not propose the fund, I can tell you took about ten years to get our emerging markets fund off the ground and see real money come into it. So we are just going to go out there, if we think it\u2019s a good product, talk to our clients, make sure we have the awareness, show them the positives of it. Be able to evaluate the performance and then I hope that it catches on. This is very different than some others and you tell me what they caught on. We have our mid ball strategy, the currency hedge. It also is a matter of when you produce the product and what\u2019s happening in the market at that particular time. So, I think for us, our growth strategy is to continue that, come out with innovative ideas. Have a pipeline of these. Make sure we are in the markets and then over time depending upon those environments, the factors and awareness that will ground. Robert Lee : Great. Thanks for taking my questions guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Laurence Fink : Hi, Ken. Ken Worthington : Hi good morning. Just one question on the regulatory front for me, really looking at FSOC and SIFIs, so, how is the conversation evolving with regulators on systemic risk today? I guess, to what extent is the conversation still moving for of the corporate risk to the product risk? And then how effectively do you think the asset management industry is at kind of regulator education and is it really effectively making its case? Laurence Fink : I think the dialogue at the FSOC in the United States is principally activity-based. In Europe, it was going towards activity-based, it has migrated a little bit to more corporate-based and activity-based. It is in a common period that we are sending comments to the FSB related to that. I think there is going to be a long dialogue. There was a meeting earlier this week at the \u2013 I think that\u2019s our reports related to it, related to the FSB meetings in New York with large investment management companies. I would say from BlackRock\u2019s perspective, a year ago, year-and-a-half ago, it\u2019s was pretty lonely for us that we were one of the few firms having those meetings and educating regulators related to the risk associated with asset managers. We always note importantly that the asset management industry represents less than 20% of the capital markets. Asset owners are principally the largest players. They manage their own money and they play a significant role too. So if you want to effect the ecosystem and making sure the ecosystem is safe and protected for society and for investors as we said publicly and we continue to try to educate it has to be activity-based. And today now, because of the efforts of the FSB, tens of asset mangers are now working alongside us. Industry groups are working alongside with us. So I am actually pretty thrilled that there is more companies, more people hoping spending time educating. I don\u2019t know what the solution or the outcome will be, but we look at this as a long-based process. We want to be constructive that it\u2019s our number one responsibility in making sure that in the end, it leads to a better sounder financial system. If we have that as I talked about other issues related to long-term, I think BlackRock is a biggest beneficiary of more participation by more people because they believe it\u2019s a safer environment to invest will be all, I am all in favor of it. However, there are difference of opinions and we are trying to push our opinions. It\u2019s going to be a long process. It\u2019s going to be very public about how the process plays out. I don\u2019t feel any \u2013 I actually believe the process is more robust now with more conversation that we\u2019ve had in a long time and we\u2019ll see how this all plays our, Ken. I don\u2019t, I can\u2019t give you any degree of where this is moving internationally. I would be kind of odd as the FSOC is moving towards outcome activities that therefore becomes in a different way, I would then question is this a Europe versus US phenomenon. It\u2019s interesting to know what Europe is doing with Google and other issues in technology, attacking US technology companies. So, I am \u2013 we are participating this. We are going to be good corporate citizens and we are trying to do our best in education. Ken Worthington : Great, that was very helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Our final question will come from the line will come from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Laurence Fink : Hi, Mike. Michael Carrier : Thanks guys. Hi. Hey, Gary, maybe just a follow-up on the margins and I understand a year ago like the elevated BRS and performance fees, if I just take the second quarter going forward and thinking about the year-over-year trends, organic growth coming in above 5%, markets up, and obviously got the FX hurdle. As we start to looking at second quarter, third quarter going forward, assuming these trends are similar. Should we still see that year-over-year ability to generate operating leverage or is there something changing on the expense front? And I know there is a lot of moving parts, but just wanted to get a sense relative to the first quarter year-over-year trend. Gary Shedlin : Michael, I am going to go back to something Larry said in his comments. It\u2019s about what we can control and what we can\u2019t control. So, I think we feel incredibly comfortable with our ability to grow organically and we feel incredibly comfortable with the ability to manage our expenses as we have over the last four plus years and as you know notwithstanding reinvesting over $1 billion back into the business through the P&L, we have expanded the margin over 350 basis points during that time. But there is certain things we can\u2019t control, I mean, which obviously is beta and FX and notwithstanding all of those things, which clearly is impacting our fee rates year-over-year. We still think if we have kind of stable markets, we are very much committed to the original margin guidance we\u2019ve ever \u2013 we\u2019ve always given people which is that we think that our business has obviously benefits from scale in a bunch of areas and we see no reason that we won\u2019t be able to continue to evidence margin improvement that we have over the last three plus years. Michael Carrier : Okay, that\u2019s helpful and then just quick follow-up, this is two quarters, I think in a row that you guys have commented above like a 6% organic growth rate. And Larry, I think, when you talk about all the trends and the products that you offer, what you guys are doing on the distribution front. It makes sense that new clients are gravitating towards lot of the offerings. I think when you guys look at investments being made currently for the outlook, do you \u2013 like what ending do you feel like you are in, in terms of still being able to either launch new products or gain additional share in certain distribution channels to be able to be in this, whether it\u2019s a 5% organic growth rate, but obviously it\u2019s been higher than what we\u2019ve been used to? Laurence Fink : Sure. So, I think we are now starting to witness the impact of having better performance in our active products, especially fixed income. Two, our expansion in the RIA channels and the buy and hold channel is now being exhibited in their mutual funds. It\u2019s been exhibited in our core series ETF products and I can underscore and that\u2019s how we are building on and expanding our global platform and I am using infrastructure also as a mechanism to get stronger within these areas, countries, side-by-side building our brand in those countries, building our opportunities in those countries. Obviously, that\u2019s a long-term strategy, Michael, that\u2019s not something that we are going to witness and see significant changes. That\u2019s a good example of a five, seven year investment where we see on behalf of our clients, but it also has a very significant impact on our positioning in the various countries as a leader in the investment business. So, you think about those investments. We are \u2013 I think we are going to continue to build market share in retail. We witness that for four straight years. Two, I think it\u2019s fair to say that ETFs are in a secular growth period that is not over yet. We are the biggest beneficiary of that secular growth and then three, which I said for many years, if we can begin to build a stronger relationship institutionally with more clients and building not a product-based relationship, but cross-selling of end solutions, we are going to start benefiting on the institutional side. So, you add those together, it does allow us to have above industry and I want to underscore above industry organic growth trends. And then if you add the amount of investments we are making not just in alternate \u2013 not just in infrastructure, but across the board in alternatives, where it\u2019s not really shown up in the organic growth area because, as I said, we won $10 billion commitment. We don\u2019t \u2013 unlike lot of the private equity firms, we don\u2019t show that in our AUM, but we identify the unfunded commitments. That\u2019s another good example of the power and the growth of the opportunity. So you tie this together, cross-selling products with institutions with better performance by providing solutions, by having even more market share opportunities in our Aladdin business, our iShare secular growth and our positioning in retail worldwide, plus better positioning, country-by-country, I think we are in a very good position to be leading above industry trend market share. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen\u2026 Laurence Fink : And market growth \u2013 let me, I am sorry, operator. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks? Laurence Fink : Well, I think it\u2019s just that some of that \u2013 first of all, thank you for taking your time. I know there are lot of other people, institutions that you are going to run to because of all the first quarter results today. Let me just reiterate, we believe that our first quarter results really highlights the diversity of our product platform, the global nature of our platform that truly differentiates us versus from every player in the world. As I said, just earlier, we are seeing that impact of those investments. We are seeing a continued positioning. I truly believe as a firm, if we continue to talk about long-term issues, try to be helpful in the narrative in the world of investing a more balanced long-term approach and if we continue to execute those strategies on behalf of our clients and our clients\u2019 needs, we will be positioned quite well for our clients worldwide, our institutional clients, our retail clients. And I would just underscore these are very exciting times for BlackRock and all the citizens of BlackRock. And so I feel very good about where we are, where we are going and the opportunities in front of us. With that, I would like to just thank everybody for joining us this morning and your continued interest in our organization. Have a good quarter.

As you know, BlackRock has filed and will file reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. And BlackRock assumes no duty and will not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So, with that, let's begin the call. Gary? Gary S. Shedlin - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Managing Director : Thank you, Matt, and good morning everyone. It's my pleasure to be here to present results for the second quarter of 2015. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. As usual, I will be focusing primarily on our as adjusted results. Our second quarter results again demonstrate the value of the investments we've made to assemble the industry's broadest and most global suite of active and investment investment \u2013 index investment offerings, and to deliver differentiated customized investment solutions to our clients. Our business model was purposely designed to deliver differentiated results in the current viable market environment. Second quarter revenue of $2.9 billion was 5% higher than a year ago while operating income of $1.2 billion was 10% higher on a year-over-year basis. Earnings per share of $4.96 were up 1% compared to a year ago reflecting lower non-operating results, and a higher normalized tax rate in the current quarter. Non-operating results for the quarter reflected $3 million of net investment losses, largely driven by net losses on unhedged or partially hedged multi-asset and fixed income seed investments. Recall that our first quarter non-operating results included a one-time gain of $40 million related to the fair value of our pre-existing interest in BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 30.1% compared to an as-adjusted tax rate of 24.8% in last year's second quarter that benefited from several favorable non-recurring items. We currently estimate that 30% remains a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2015. Second quarter long-term net outflows of $7 billion reflected elevated market volatility, as $24 billion of net new business from active and iShares products was more than offset by $31 billion of low fee institutional index outflows. While this resulted in an organic asset growth rate significantly less than our target for the quarter, our annualized long-term organic base fee growth rate was in excess of 5% as each of our retail and iShares businesses along with the active component of our institutional business generated positive organic growth in the second quarter. Over the last twelve months, notwithstanding the increasingly unsettled macroenvironment, BlackRock's highly diversified platform generated approximately $180 billion of long-term net new business, representing a 4% long-term organic AUM growth rate and a 6% organic base fee growth rate, as faster growth in our higher fee channels continues to contribute to a favorable overall change in our base fee mix. We previously discussed the importance of organic-based fee growth rate to our business and we're always thinking about ways to improve our disclosure to help investors and analysts better understand our business. As you will note on Page 2 of our earnings supplement, we have now expanded our financial disclosure to include organic base fee growth on a trailing 12-month basis to better reflect this positive mix change over time. Second quarter base fees rose 4% year-over-year as the average AUM increased due to organic growth and market appreciation despite $191 billion of negative FX impact associated with dollar appreciation against foreign currencies over the last 12 months. On a constant currency basis, we estimate that quarterly base fees grew approximately 8% year-over-year. Sequentially, base fees were up 6% reflecting organic base fee growth, the effective one additional day in the quarter, and seasonally higher securities lending fees. Performance fees of $136 million were up 18% from a year ago, reflecting strong alpha generation in certain equity products that lock annually in the second quarter. BlackRock Solutions' revenue of $161 million was up 10%, both year-over-year and sequentially. Our Aladdin business, which represented 80% of BRS revenue in the quarter, grew 14% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, the year-over-year increase driven by several sizable clients going live on the Aladdin platform over the last 12 months. We continue to see strong market demand for global investment platform consolidation and multi-risk solutions. Revenue in our financial markets advisory business was flat year-over-year, reflecting the positive impact of residual disposition activity in last year's second quarter, but up $11 million sequentially driven by increased revenue from several advisory assignments associated with Fed CCAR diagnostics. Other income declined $9 million from a year ago, reflecting lower 12b-1 fees and the impact of real estate-related disposition fees a year ago. Total expense rose $12 million year-over-year or 1%, driven primarily by revenue-related items including incentive compensation, AUM-related expense, which were largely offset by a decline in G&A expense. Compensation and benefits increased $65 million year-over-year or 7% due to higher head count and incentive compensation, partially offset by the impact of a stronger dollar. G&A expense decreased $65 million year-over-year as a result of lower levels of marketing spend in the current quarter and the impact of elevated legal and regulatory expense in last year's second quarter. Sequentially, G&A expense decreased $27 million from the first quarter, driven by lower levels of marketing spend. Second quarter G&A expense also included a previously disclosed $4 million product placement fee associated with the recently announced ABR Refunding. Our second quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 44.9% was positively impacted by the lower level of quarterly G&A spend. Looking forward, we continue to anticipate a higher and more normalized level of G&A spend during the second half of 2015. We remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first reinvesting in our business and then returning excess cash to shareholders. In line with that commitment, on June 12, BlackRock announced the acquisition of Infraestructura, the leading independently managed infrastructure investment business in Mexico. We expect to close this acquisition in the fourth quarter of this year. During the second quarter, we also repurchased an additional $275 million worth of shares and refinanced $750 million of debt with a 10-year \u20ac700 million denominated note bearing a 1.25% coupon. This represented our first euro-denominated debt issuance better aligning our capital structure with our global business. Our consistent earnings growth and stable financial results reflect the benefits of our diverse platform, long-term client partnerships, and commitment to investment performance. Second quarter long-term net flows were impacted by over $30 billion of low fee institutional index outflows, which masked almost $13 billion of active inflows driven by our improving fundamental equity performance, top tier fixed income performance, and strength in our multi-asset and alternatives businesses. BlackRock's global retail franchise saw long-term net inflows of $11 billion, representing 8% annualized organic growth for the quarter and 10% organic assets growth over the last 12 months. Flows were driven by continued strength and outcome-oriented offerings, including unconstrained fixed income and multi-asset strategies. International retail net inflows of more than $3 billion were paced by strong flows into global unconstrained fixed income and international equities. For the quarter, our leading European equities franchise generated nearly $2 billion of net inflows, while our top quartile Asian equity franchise gathered more than $1 billion in new assets. Leadership in these areas contributed to BlackRock maintaining its year-to-date number one ranking in cross-border mutual fund flows and its market leading position in the United Kingdom. U.S. retail inflows of more $7 billion reflected strong fixed income flows (9:33) broad-based even in a period of rising rates. Despite a challenging quarter for industry flows in U.S. active mutual funds, the depth and breadth of our franchise positioned BlackRock to continue to grow market share as we rank in the top five in U.S. retail industry flows for the quarter, and saw a strong demand for iShares from U.S. retail clients. Global iShares generated $11 billion of net new flows, representing 4% annualized organic growth for the quarter, and 11% organic growth over the last 12 months. While the ETF industry experienced quarterly volatility amid uncertainty in global economic growth and central bank policies, year-to-date flows for both iShares and the ETF industry remain in record territory. iShares retained its number one global market share position for the first half of the year, and remains well ahead of the competition in global fixed income flows. iShares equity inflows of $9 billion were led by flows into non-U.S. equity exposures, including our EAFE and Japan funds. We continue to see heightened investor focus on risk management as our currency hedge funds gathered nearly $4 billion, and our minimum volatility funds raised more than $2 billion during the quarter. iShares fixed income inflows of approximately $2 billion reflected flows into investment grade corporate and emerging markets bonds, offset by outflows from treasuries and high-yield as investors repositioned portfolios amidst global rate movements. Our institutional business experienced $29 billion in quarterly long-term net outflows, primarily driven by $35 billion of low fee index equity outflows from several large clients looking to reallocate, rebalance, or meet their cash needs. As previously mentioned, these low fee index outflows had a limited impact on organic base fee growth for the quarter. Institutional active net inflows of more than $2 billion reflected BlackRock's strong multi-asset and alternatives capabilities, offset by outflows in active equities. Multi-asset inflows of more than $4 billion were driven by solutions-based funding, particularly in the insurance outsourcing space and continued strong demand (11:37). Excluding return of capital of approximately $1 billion, net inflows of $2.3 billion into core institutional alternatives were broad-based, including alternative solutions, hedge funds, real asset, and fund-to-fund offerings. Fund raising momentum continued with an additional $1 billion of illiquid alternative commitments raised in the second quarter, bringing total unfunded commitments, a source of future net inflows, to approximately $11 billion. Active equity outflows of nearly $2 billion resulted from a single sub-advisory redemption. Overall, BlackRock's second quarter reflected continued growth and stability in a more volatile environment, and once again, demonstrated the value of our highly differentiated and diversified platform. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry. Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Gary and good morning everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Our second quarter results were driven by clients' continued trust in BlackRock, to help them navigate an increasingly unpredictable financial and economic landscape. Uncertainty and anticipation around the first Fed rate hike in nine years and concern related to the possible impact of a Greek Eurozone exit has led to persistent volatility in currencies, in risk asset prices, and global interest rates. Turmoil in China's equity market has reached unprecedented levels, and the impact of intervention is yet to be fully understood by our markets. Falling commodity prices continue to put pressure on commodity exporting economies, and both governments and corporations are being meaningful impacted by a relative currency valuations. Constrained liquidity conditions are further magnifying market stress and volatility, and I believe, this elevated volatility will be going forward, and I believe are part of the market. Both asset allocation to beta and alpha products in active management will be material drivers of returns for investors as they look to stay ahead of the changing market dynamics. Each of those drivers impacted client behavior in the second quarter. As we saw a shift inflows from a range of high-performing active products and iShares precision exposures, while experiencing redemptions in low-fee broad market index accounts. The investments we made in our platform over time once again has enabled BlackRock to create this highly differentiated investment solutions across asset classes, investment styles, and geographies for our clients. At BlackRock, we are focused on delivering our best thinking and resources to our clients and our portfolio management teams. The BlackRock Investment Institute continues to lead that discussion, as evidenced by a recent client call in Greece, which was attended by nearly 3,000 clients. This level of engagement by our clients is translating into increased partnership with BlackRock to meet their investment needs. And more clients throughout the world are looking for BlackRock and BlackRock's ideas, which we believe over a long cycle, will lead to more share of wallet with these clients. Our internal culture of information sharing and our relentless focus on risk management and performance in our active businesses is also enhancing BlackRock's ability to generate alpha on behalf of our clients and has resulted in strength across our active platform in performance and inflows. We've been very vocal about addressing the performance challenges in our active equity business. More than three years ago, we began upgrading our portfolio management teams in our Asian and U.S. fundamental active equity franchises. While we knew these changes will result in a near-term outflows and it would take our teams many years to build the performance track records, we have the conviction based on past successes in revamping our active fixed income business, and we kept our focus on the long term for our clients. We brought in new portfolio managers who are currently responsible for more than $50 billion in assets, and those managers are delivering on their objectives of generating high quality risk adjusted returns. We not only hired new talent, we invested in technology, we elevated young talent from organic growth internally, and linked the global equity platform together, to more effectively leverage the benefits of BlackRock. Since the respective start dates, those managers have generated more than $2 billion in alpha for the BlackRock clients. As a global firm, our objective is constantly outperform across our fundamental active equity platform, and we've seen top performance in a range of products and regions. For the three-year period, in the United States, our basic value fund is at 11th percentile. In Europe, our European value fund is in the fourth percentile. And in Asia, our Asian dragon fund is in the 16th percentile. In the second quarter, BlackRock saw improvement in our overall fundamental active equity performance figures with 78% and 61% of our AUM is above market or peer medium for the one- and three-year period. And strong long-term track records for our European and Asian equity franchises as Gary discussed is translated into flows, raising more than $3 billion collectively in the second quarter. We still have work to do with our fundamental active team, but we remain highly confident in the enhancements we made with the team that we have onboard and we are very encouraged by the direction the business is headed. We also saw continued strength in generation of strong performance across our model or scientific active equity platform. With 85% and 95% of our assets above benchmark or peer medium for one- and three-year period. And in our active fixed income, performance remained strong across the platform with 89% of our assets above benchmark or peer medium for the three-year period, translating into continued momentum and flows. Against the divergent and volatile backdrop and a challenged quarter for industry flows, BlackRock saw a total of net long-term outflows of $7 billion, as $24 billion of net inflows into active and iShare strategies was offset by a $31 billion net outflows in these low-fee institutional index strategies. Importantly, from a regional perspective, we saw $18 billion of net inflows in the Americas, offset by a net outflows of $25 billion from international clients who were more directly exposed to all the macro challenges that I discussed. As Gary discussed, focusing solely on organic asset flows misses a critical component of our story. BlackRock generated long-term organic base fee growth of 5% in the second quarter, reflecting the effectiveness of our differentiated business model and the combination of active and index on a single platform, as higher fee active flows drove robust revenue growth more than offsetting any revenue loss from our index outflows. In the second quarter, we saw sizable institutional index equity outflows driven by redemptions from international and official institutional clients due to a variety of cash needs and asset allocation decisions. A number of those outflows from institution clients, however, have been offset by inflows by the same clients into BlackRock's active strategies. This is a very important component that we all should be focusing on, because as we discussed how we are building our unique business model, having the ability to have clients internally move assets around whether it's from beta to active or active to beta, this allows us to continue to build deeper and more elongated relationships with our clients. Year-to-date, a desire to reallocate or address cash needs drove ten of our largest clients to redeem over $40 billion in institutional index assets. However, those same clients reinvested across BlackRock's active equity and fixed income, multi-asset and, also, alternative strategies resulting in a positive net revenue impact for the firm. This demonstrates the value, as I said earlier, of a deep strategic relationship we remain with our clients and validate strongly the strength of our solution-oriented business model. Second quarter active net inflows of $13 billion was driven by fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives. We remain bullish on the opportunities in active fixed income as investors stuck to a prolonged low rate environment searching for both yield and capital preservation. BlackRock generated $9 billion of active fixed income net flows across unconstrained, high-yield and total return strategies. The breadth and diversity of BlackRock's fixed-income platform resonated in the second quarter as clients reposition assets to achieve their investment goals. For example, our iShares high-yield range saw net outflows of $1.8 billion in the quarter. The top performance we have in our active high-yield franchise positioned us to capture $2.4 billion of net inflows. Alternatives was also a contributor to inflows in organic base fee growth in the quarter with $2 billion of net inflows. Alternative flows were led by alternative solutions, where BlackRock is leveraging our differentiated model, and our market position to construct outcome-oriented, multi-alternative portfolios for our clients. BlackRock continues to build out our capabilities and infrastructure, which is an important asset class that provides long-term returns for our clients. In the second quarter, BlackRock announced the acquisition of Mexico's leading independent managed infrastructure investment firm. This acquisition advanced to BlackRock's growth strategy all throughout Latin America, obviously, and including Mexico, and demonstrates our firm \u2013 strong commitment of being a leader in infrastructure investments. This is a continuation of the expansion of our infrastructure footprint in Mexico, following the partnership with Pemex, we announced in March. We also believe that building out our infrastructure platforms throughout the globe will make us a stronger and a more meaningful leading player in each local market. And I believe it's very imperative to understand, infrastructure investing for BlackRock will lead us to have a stronger mutual footprint as we grow out our businesses worldwide. And as I said repeatedly over years and years, we need to be a local firm in every country to build the trust and the strength as we become much more of a global platform firm. Technology remains a key area of focus and investment for BlackRock across all aspects of our business to enhance our investment process, client service, operational efficiencies, and our unifying Aladdin technology platform. Aladdin generated 14% revenue growth year-over-year and Aladdin's growing value as a third-party platform positions BlackRock to invest a consistent and growing stream of revenues into improving our technology and expanding our offerings. And indeed, more and more clients are looking for risk management platforms as more investors need to go more global, the need for a more robust capital market focused technology platform is more imperative today than any other time and BlackRock Solutions' Aladdin is becoming the driving risk management platform and that more and more clients are looking to take on. The next step into the evolution of our business and ability to generate alpha is a further harnessing technology to create innovative investment strategies for our clients. Over the last few years, we have become increasingly focused on becoming a data-driven company. Available data is exploding for the financial services industry and the true winners will be the firms that can extract information and package it into innovative solutions that generate alpha and outcomes for our clients. We recently hired Dr. Andrew Ang to be our head of our new factor-based strategy group. Andrew joins us from Columbia Business School and is an innovator in factor-based investing and portfolio construction. Technology is also going to become a more important part of our \u2013 adapting to our evolving fixed income landscape. Throughout the quarter, there has been elevated focus on the state of the fixed-income markets. There are a variety of dynamics at play including extraordinary monetary policy, increased bond issuance and regulatory reform, which has contributed to reduced dealer inventories and lower turnover. While media attention has only spiked in recent months, BlackRock has been focusing on the issues for several years, how to enhance our trading capabilities, how to enhance our portfolio construction and risk management, as well as being a thought leader on the topic. Going forward, it is important for all market participants to recognize that we can't turn back the clock. We need to shift the dialogue to look forward and focus on solutions. BlackRock hopes to play a constructive role in helping our clients meet the challenges of today's market environment. We are also making recommendations on what the regulators and market participants can do to help improve the market ecosystem using a three-pronged approach, including modernizing the market structure, addressing liquidity challenges at the product level, and embracing product innovation like fixed-income ETFs. As our client investment challenges evolve, so does the nature of the solutions they require. BlackRock's business model was deliberately built to deliver a multi-facet solution to our clients. And I don't believe any other investment firm can provide this multifaceted solution. BlackRock's ability to leverage these capabilities across a diverse global platform of active and index, equities, fixed income, multi-asset and alternative strategies, all backed by Aladdin analytics, risk management, and advisor capabilities, leading investment performance and client service \u2013 big sentence here \u2013 continues to result in improved outcomes for our clients and our shareholders. As always, I want to thank our employees for the continued dedication to working and to create a better financial future for our clients. With that, I'll open it up for questions. Operator : your first question comes from Luke Montgomery with Bernstein. Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Luke. Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good morning. Thanks. I really appreciate the addition of the organic revenue growth disclosure in the supplement, so thanks for that. I was hoping you might provide a little context \u2013 just a little more context around the various drivers of revenue yield and base fee growth between FX translation, AUM inflow mix shift and anything around the anterior rates of AUM and revenue yield as you head into Q3? Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : That feels like a half an hour answers though. Okay, Gary. Gary S. Shedlin - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Managing Director : Well, Luke, we appreciate that you recognize that we are trying to add to a more appropriate disclosure for you guys. I think as we've talked about at length with you guys, the fee rates are constantly changing for us. It's a function of not only the organic component, which I think we're now demonstrating to everybody that is in our control. And as we continue to see stronger growth in our higher fee retail and iShares businesses, which carry higher fee rates on an organic basis. If nothing else changes in the world, we would expect the overall fee rate to be accretive for us. In other words, obviously, organic revenue growth in excess of organic AUM growth obviously helps that over time. However, we can't control things like divergent beta and FX. And obviously, as we've talked about over time, that will have an impact depending on where we go. In this quarter, it happened to help us, but in other quarters, it has hurt us over time. As you know, U.S. equities rose about 5% over the last year in terms of U.S. benchmark AUM that's about 32% of our equity base fees, but in fact is the lowest fee geography for us at around 13 basis points. On an FX adjusted basis, year-over-year, we saw EM in Europe down between 10% and 12% each, commodities down close to 30%, and those buckets are about another third of our equity base fees and have average fee rates significantly higher around 46 basis points. So in this case year-over-year the overall fee rate was down about 0.6 points or roughly to about 22 basis points due to that. But we benefited from some of that. In the current quarter, also, we had better mix and we had an additional day, which basically helped the sequential fee rate up close to 0.9 basis points. Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Look I would also add a little more color to what Gary just said. Three, four years ago, if we saw outflows in index funds, we may not have seen the active flows. What I think what is really illustrative of all the hard work we've done over the last few years is we are now part of that dialogue and more and more clients that we are able to do this. As we suggested, a lot of money that was, in terms of the outflows, was more cash need driven by our clients for rainy day issues and it's raining in some of the commodity-based economies, and so they're utilizing some of that. I think one of the things that is important to understand. I don't think the market understood how much flows that were generated by these large institutions internationally into the equity markets and in some cases, it's turned because they have needs for domestic needs, but we are seeing we have more increased dialogue on multi-assets in European equities, Asian equities, alternatives than we've ever had in the history of the firm. So, the dialog is more robust and certainly a lot more complete and I think that's a component of the story. As Gary said, we can't control FX, we can't control divergent beta. As Gary suggested, there has been quite a bit of divergent beta in the commodity-based stuff, even in the last few weeks of June or first few weeks of July, we've seen more divergent beta again. And so we can't control that but we certainly have and probably the key issue that we can control deeper, more robust conversation with more clients worldwide. Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, thanks. And then separately, now that IOSCO has filed the FSOC impact off the approach of indentifying specific asset managers as SIFIs in favor of a focus more on products and activities. Do you think that change in the odds of how the FSB will ultimately approach regulation of the industry and if we reached a favorable tipping point or it's not time to relax yet? Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I would not relax. I won't \u2013 I don't think we should ever relax. Obviously, let me just step back and say, A, if the market is a safer, stronger market and more people believe that the market is a great place, if regulation does add greater safety and soundness in the minds of more and more investors, we'll be the biggest beneficiary. So our whole approach to regulatory conversation is somewhat different than with some of the other leaders in the industry. We are \u2013 we have traditionally \u2013 and I continue to believe, we will continue to do that tradition of having a deep dialog with regulators using our international knowledge of what's going on and helping them try to understand what would be the best way to make a safer and sounder dialog. So, I don't want to say the conversation is going to be more relaxed in the future because we need to still work with the regulators, understanding what are the potential issues as the world becomes more dependent on capital markets. And that's happening now as the ecosystem change with higher capital standards with banks and more and more enterprises whether it's companies or individuals are using capital markets for raising capital, both debt and equity. We need a safe and sound ecosystem. And if it means that having more supervision in some of the activities, we may be in favor of that. So we are going to work towards building a safer and sounder capital markets, and we have enjoyed deep relationships with the regulators. And obviously they don't have to listen to us, they are our regulators. But, by having, what I would call, a constructive dialog, I believe it allows us to be part of that conversation, and hopefully, this will lead to a better outcome. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Alex. Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, good morning, everyone. Larry, first question, on fixed income markets for you guys. Obviously, we saw a pretty big move in the ten year and the quarter, BlackRock's overall fixed income franchise did a pretty good job, obviously handling this move. When you look out, with respect to client's response to prospect of higher rate announcing the move we've seen so far, what are you hearing with respect to the overall allocations and just kind of the remix... Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So, I find this a humorous narrative. There is a big article a couple of days ago, I think even Barron had a big article about, oh, what's going to happen in fixed income. Hey, higher rates will lead to more players in fixed income, not less, and I'll get into that in a minute. Secondarily, 70% of our fixed income investors are pension and insurance companies. They're not influenced by market moves. They're trying to match a liability, and that's the problem with the narrative, they're not the players who're going to whip around the interest rates. But the true component is, so many pension funds and insurance companies were so harmed by lower interest rates. In some cases, we know many insurance companies have actually a wide gap \u2013 their liabilities are longer than their assets. So, if we actually saw a rising rate environment, this is actually quite additive to the balance sheets of insurance companies. If we saw a rise in interest rates, especially in the short end, the pension funds liabilities will look less onerous, because it's all based on their funding rate and the capital rate they used for their short-term rates. In fact, many pension funds, if we saw a real spike in interest rates, would (36:39) a lot of their pension liabilities. So, higher rates actually is good for most long-term investors and they're not particularly concerned about rising rates and they're going to have money, because their liability \u2013 they bought these fixed interest items against certain fixed-based liabilities. And so, they're not going to be that harmed on that. Now, they may have some accounting treatment differentials, but it's not going to be a big issue. And for those who believe they want to navigate around the potentiality of higher rates, they're going to navigate from a long-dated asset \u2013 longer duration fixed-income product to a shorter duration one. And for those who still need to be in more long duration, but they're going to go into more the unconstrained products that we are the leading driver in flows. So I think people just forget they're implying that everybody is a hedge fund when higher rates means everybody's going to be abandoning bond funds. Now some individuals were in fixed income because of safety and soundness. They don't generally whip them around either. They're going to hold them to maturity. But another thing, Alex, that I think we are miscalculating too, more and more money is going in defined contribution plans. More and more defined contribution plans are using target date types of structures. And last I checked, we're living longer, but more importantly we're all aging, at least I am. And as you age, you're going to have a higher component of fixed income. So I would tell you fundamentally, demographically, and all the things that we're structurally seeing the way people are positioned, higher rate is not a bad thing for the fixed income market for the core investors. Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. All makes sense. And just a follow up I guess around the regulatory discussion. Given what it looks like more of an increased focus on liquidity and risk management on a product base as opposed to the, hopefully, a firm basis. Can you talk a little bit about the opportunity set to monetize Aladdin's capabilities of your sales or licensing the product to other asset managers since it seems like that's going to be the area of focus for a lot of your peers? Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We are \u2013 we probably have increased dialogue for Aladdin than ever before. Unquestionably, higher regulatory supervision for activities would lead to more need for risk management. Aladdin is one of the \u2013 obviously, one of the risk management participants in the marketplace. Fiduciary standards are increasing \u2013 people want to have better understanding of their risk embedded. As more and more managers, embark in more \u2013 in a larger, more robust global portfolio, they need better risk analytics. And so, all this is leading to greater utilization for platforms like Aladdin. Obviously, we have many great competitors, so I'm not trying to suggest we're the only player, but we are in a very good position, to have deeper, longer, and probably more numerous conversations. Operator : Your next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Dan. Daniel T. Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Can you discuss a little bit more detail about some of the rebalancing that is occurring in the index products. Maybe the type of customers, are the kind of discussions, something you anticipate ongoing and it does seem, I think you referenced most of it, coming from the EMEA region, but just a little more color that would be helpful? Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, I don't think, I referenced what region. It's international what I said. We've had times, if you go back six quarters or eight quarters and we had big rebalancing then. People use beta as a place holder of a tactical allocation, I mean that's one thing that people still don't understand how much beta products are being utilized now for alpha. And there are many enterprises are tactically allocating whether overweighting or underweighting using beta products. And we see this more increasingly every day and in some \u2013 and in the second quarter and part of the first quarter, we saw some of the big utilizers who had beta as an alpha component of their tactical allocation for \u2013 in some cases, they were taking profits and then they \u2013 because of domestic issues, they are sitting with higher cash balances, some of them may have been a little more frightened of what's going on in some components to the world and are putting more and more money in cash. But more importantly, I would say, most of the tactical allocation was out of investment products, more into cash for domestic issues. And this was not a performance issue, this was not moving money from BlackRock to another manager in most cases. It was moving from BlackRock to another BlackRock product and in most cases, the money was used for domestic needs, work needs. Daniel T. Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Okay, thank you. And then, Gary, a question on just the G&A outlook. It's been a volatile for you last few quarters, I guess. Are we still expecting a ramp into the back half of the year, and if you could help kind of think of \u2013 help us with some quantification around that? Gary S. Shedlin - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Managing Director : Sure. Look, I think as we look at the quarter, I think there's no question that our second quarter margin benefited from a lower level of G&A spend. If you recall, last quarter, where many of you've pointed out a year-over-year decline in our operating margin, we communicated to you that we felt our reported year-over-year margin comparison really understated the operating leverage in the business. And I think this quarter, frankly, we had the opposite. I think that our 250 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion is overstated by a lower level of G&A spend that frankly is not likely sustainable. Look, part of the lower level of G&A spend in the quarter is better financial discipline in the current environment, but part of it is frankly simply expenses that came in lower than we expected, and I wouldn't \u2013 I really wouldn't read too much into it on a trend basis. It was simply a low G&A quarter relative to historical spend levels. Looking forward, I think I would say we continue to anticipate a higher, more normalized level of G&A spend in the second half of the year, and at this time, we're not intending to \"push out,\" I think the words that you may have used, that reduce second quarter spend into the back half of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Brian. Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, good morning. A question on ETF and maybe if you could dissect the flows between core series and what you're seeing in the institutional usage. May be, Larry, if you can comment on. Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I will let Rob. Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I'm sorry. Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I will let Rob comment on that one. Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, sure. Yeah. Just a comment on the traction that you're getting in the financial advisory community on the core series and then also a commentary on institutional usage including hedging and may be as you mentioned as a substitute for fixed income, both cash trading and derivatives increasing usage of ETF. Robert S. Kapito - President: So the exciting part of the ETF business is that as people become more aware of the benefits of ETFs, they're coming up with other uses for ETF. So it's become not only a way to express your view in the market, but you can express it in a much more precise way. So a lot of the flows that we're seeing are coming from this new usage. One of the new usage is as you cite is that ETFs became cheaper to use than futures. So we've seen a lot of institutions now as they become aware of that and we know how to talk about it, they are coming to us and asking us how they can use ETFs to better express their views in the marketplace. So we're seeing flows coming in from that as well as just a generic core. And as you know, the two segments are certainly the buy and hold segment and we have introduced the core ETFs for that and we're seeing growths in \u2013 growth in that to the tune of $3.8 billion, which is a 7% organic growth in the quarter. So we're very excited as that continues to grow. But at the same time, we're seeing those who are utilizing those for trading activities to express their views continue to grow as well. And a lot of that is in the high yield area, where they're expressing their views, positive or negative, so you see flows in that. And then you just see people that are actually looking at ETFs as a replacement also for their mutual fund business as well. So I think there is lots of opportunities in this. We're just beginning to scratch the surface and new uses for this. We continue to think that it's going to continue to grow going forward, and we want to be the innovator using ETFs to innovate and to solve people's issues in their portfolios. Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. And just in the quarter, I guess, the lower flows on the institutional side is more of a beta issue than anything structural that you're seeing? Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we actually had good flows in the active side, and obviously, institutional side was all related to those beta stories that I discussed previously. Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Right, great. And then just a follow-up, Larry, maybe on the Department of Labor proposed rules on how do you think that might impact allocations in the 401(k) plans longer-term, and what it might mean for your target-date business if that's another catalyst for that business? Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We shared the Department of Labor's goals in promoting better retirement and security. This is one of the big issues and we've been stressing. I do believe our retirement \u2013 our inadequacy in retirement is going to be the big story in the coming years. I do believe the elevated savings rates that we're just seeing so far in the first six months, possibly could be related to people starting to become more aware that they have an inadequate retirement plan. So, we will be vigilant and outspoken on retirement issues. Look, related to specifically your question, the need of investors are going to be differing, we all want good investment outcomes, and we need to make sure that we, as an industry, provide client choice \u2013 hopefully client choice with low cost. Cost is \u2013 it can't be primary because we have to be outcome-focused, obviously, outcome-focused with cost is the emphasis, not the other way around. So the DoL's indicated interest for our comments, we submitted the commentary, we're going to have to see, wait and see how this all plays out. I think \u2013 I don't believe we understand or have enough information to know how this will all play out. I think this will be evolving, but we are working constructively with the DoL, and whatever they determine, we'll \u2013 I'll be able to tell you in the coming quarters how that will play out for BlackRock and the impact. On the surface, it's going to have \u2013 it has impact on BlackRock, if it is as it is today, because it has impact on some of our distribution platforms, but we'll be able to navigate that. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Chris. Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Quick question on your retail business. Clearly, it's been a great performer for you guys for quite a long while now, your top five. Just wondering at this point, what additional opportunities do you see for that part of your business? And really, I'm wondering due to the fact that your share has seemingly gone up quite a lot, just wondering if incremental gains at this point might be a little bit harder to come by? Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Three years ago, four years ago, we started talking about our building out of retail. Three years and four years ago we started talking about building a stronger brand in retail. Two years ago, we integrated our retail and our iShares teams to be \u2013 to offer more outcome-oriented solutions that are \u2013 instead of just product pushing. And I think this has all created a more elevated position with our distribution platform. And I believe we have much more to go. We are still way behind other firms related to the RIAs. We still have deeper penetration to go with some of the big distribution platforms. And importantly, I believe because of our technology \u2013 because of Aladdin, I think we can provide better models from \u2013 to assisting our distribution partners in creating better models, better advice, and if we can continue to help our distribution platforms to be better at what they do, combination of beta products and alpha products, maybe with liquid alts, we should enjoy higher penetration of wallet, and I believe, we're just beginning on that path. Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great, thank you. Operator : And your final question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Craig \u2013 operator, we have time \u2013 we have 10 more minutes. So, if there is no one behind, Craig, we could carry on. Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): I think so I will get started here. So... Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): First, just on active ETFs. I'm wondering, do you guys have plans to launch some of your active products into a transparent ETF structure? And also, do you think your competition will more aggressively pursue this option just given the lack of non-transparent ETF options today? Robert S. Kapito - President: Yeah, so, we've looked at this, we continue to look at this, and right now collectively, we're not sure that this is going to be a big opportunity in the marketplace. One of the benefits of the ETFs is the transparency, the diversification, and that enhances the trading and the liquidity of these. So, we're not sure that this is an opportunity we're going to pursue. We're thinking about it, and we'll just see how the market continues to evolve. So, we're not ruling it out, but right now, we're not looking at that, and we view that as something that will compete more directly with mutual funds than it will with the normal ETFs. Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I would \u2013 once again, I think I've said in the past. I think there's way too much emphasis on this product. We have said that we believe the ETF industry is going to go from a $3 trillion to $6 trillion industry. Active ETFs will be a component of it, but it will be dwarfed by the industry's growth in traditional beta products. Where you may see ETFs grow is really more based on model or smart beta products, so where you're going to have tilts, but I still don't see active ETF playing a large role in the totality of the market, and I agree with Rob. If there is growth in it, it's going to be growth that's going to be taking away more growth from traditional mutual funds. Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): And if I can just squeeze one follow-up here. I heard your commentary on the RIA market and how you'd like to increase market share there, but as demographics increasingly become difficult for 401(k) plans, what is your plan to increase your market share in the RIA segment? Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I said the RIA \u2013 they were independents, not the \u2013 not IRIS, but I was talking about the independent advisor. So Craig, I'm not sure \u2013 I did not make a statement related that define (54:37) contribution on IRIS... Gary S. Shedlin - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Managing Director : I think he's talking about RIAs. Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : But RIAs, we had very weak penetration three years, four years ago. We had very little visibility with many of the RIAs, and these are \u2013 we have to become a trusted partner. There are some other firms that have had a long-standing trusted relationship with these independent channels, and I \u2013 we are very pleased with the growth that we have in our RIA channel in 2015. And I expect, as I said earlier, that we're going to build more share because I do believe we can become another trusted advisor to their channels. Operator : And your next question comes from Ken Hill with Barclays. Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Ken? Kenneth W. Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So I wanted to follow up on one of the earlier questions. You guys have a really nice story to tell on the fixed income market as ETFs play a greater role in supplying liquidity in what has otherwise been a pretty illiquid corporate bond market. When you think about the dynamics of ETFs playing a larger role longer-term, is there anything in there that you're particularly concerned about as these passive products grow as a percentage of the market? Do you think that really increases your regulatory bullseye here? And while it's still a relatively small piece of the market now, do you think there's a natural cap on how much of the market ETFs can make up? Robert S. Kapito - President: So, our view of ETFs is a bit different. We think it actually enhances the liquidity of the markets because of the transparency. So you know what the underlying securities are. So there is a market in those. And then there's a market of those as a whole. And in periods of volatility, we've actually seen very little creation or redemption of any of those assets. We've actually seen the ETFs trade themselves. So, we think it enhances the liquidity. And, therefore, we think this market could continue to grow. So, we don't really \u2013 I wouldn't agree with you on illiquidity in the corporate bond market. It's just that it's been more one-sided because there's more demand right now. So there really isn't a large secondary market. I don't call that illiquid, I call that overdemand for yield securities because of the environment. So if interest rates rise, that will change a bit, but we think that this has been providing good opportunity in the marketplace, and just think of how large the fixed income market is, and when you take a look at that, any percentage, any small percentage increase in ETF, so the fixed income market is going to be very substantial and very large. So, we're very bullish on the future of ETFs and how large they can grow relative to the fixed income market. Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : But, let's just talk about market dynamics a little bit. So, ETFs are far more liquid and constructive versus a mutual fund. An ETF throughout the day has a buyer that matches with a seller. So every time you have a buyer matching a seller during the time, the underlying assets are not traded. And so, this is one of the \u2013 people don't understand \u2013 when they talk about this, they just not talk about the market dynamics. So for every buyer, there's a seller. You are not creating or redeeming the underlying assets. So for \u2013 during the market opening, the ETF is providing more liquidity. When you think about a mutual fund, a mutual fund in bonds is accumulating buys and sells throughout the day, and at the final \u2013 end of the day, they find out if they have to sell the underlying stocks or \u2013 excuse me, bonds at the end of the day or the next morning to get the cash. So, the ETF actually is, as Rob suggested, a provider of liquidity. It also creates a transparency of where the markets are, and it's \u2013 this is another surprise to me on the narrative, the narrative that you are able to transact bond sales and purchases in mass by utilizing one stock \u2013 you're able to reduce the underlying assets and the need for a lot of sales bonds, a lot of purchases bonds intra-day, and that's a major component of why ETFs are additive to the liquidity and more importantly, they create transparency. And we've been telling this story for years, we witnessed it. The Federal Reserve actually came out with a research report \u2013 this is more related to emerging market equities, on the same construct that it provided liquidity. So we're still dismayed at the narrative. Kenneth W. Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. I'm sorry. I wasn't trying to imply that ETFs were part of the problem. I was just talking about dealer inventory levels and a relatively illiquid corporate bond market. Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, keep in mind, I don't know how dealers report because this is a stock. More and more dealers are big market makers in ETFs. And if it's under the equity desk, a bond ETF, because it's an equity, that's a major component of the business today. Kenneth W. Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Right. Okay. I appreciate all the color there. Thanks very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks? Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I just want to thank everyone for joining us this morning and for your continued interest at BlackRock. Once again, our second quarter highlighted the investments we made over many years to enhance the differentiated platform that we have \u2013 a platform that's diverse, a platform that's global, a platform that can work in both alpha and beta products. And I believe the second quarter was a good testimony to all that buildup. We continue to take a long-term view and hopefully, we're staying ahead of our clients' needs. And most importantly, as I suggested, when we have 3,000 clients calling in to \u2013 BlackRock Institute call, we're winning more and more hearts and minds of our clients, which in my \u2013 our deepest hope, that leads to larger share of their wallet. And if we continue to do that, we'll continue to drive performance for our shareholders in a landscape that is obviously very volatile. Everyone have a good quarter, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Teleconference. Our hosts for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Matthew Mallow. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Mallow, you may begin your conference. Chris Meade : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, let me remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results, may of course differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So, with that, let's begin. Gary Shedlin : Thank you, Chris. Good morning everyone. This is Gary Shedlin. It's my pleasure to be here to present results for the third quarter of 2015. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. And as usual, I will be focusing primarily on our as adjusted results. Against a challenging market backdrop, BlackRock\u2019s third quarter results demonstrate the stability of our diverse global platform, highlighted by continued organic growth, stable operating margins and systematic capital return. Third quarter revenue of $2.9 billion was 2% higher than a year ago while operating income of $1.2 billion was up 1%. Earnings per share of $5 were down 4% compared to a year ago reflecting lower non-operating results and a higher tax rate in the current quarter. Non-operating results for the quarter reflected $6 million of net investment gains, largely driven by gains on private equity and real estate investments which offset market driven losses on certain hedge funds and unhedged or partially hedged Multi-Asset and fixed income seed investments. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 29.3% compared to 26.2% a year ago reflecting several favorable non-recurring items. We currently estimate that 30% remains a reasonable projected tax run rate for the fourth quarter of 2015 and based on what we know today reflecting changes in our geographic business mix estimate that 31% is a reasonable projected tax rate for 2016. BlackRock generated $35 billion of quarterly long term net flows representing an annualized organic growth rate of 3%. Flows were positive across investments styles and client types, reinforcing the value of our broad based diversified business model. In a volatile market characterized by double digit quarterly declines in a number of global equity industries and significant FX movements, clients continued to look to BlackRock for strong risk management and long term investment solutions. In total, market depreciation and FX impact reduced the value of our assets under management by approximately $265 billion during the quarter. Over the last 12 months BlackRock generated approximately $186 billion of long term net new business representing a 4% long term organic AUM growth rate and a 6% organic base fee growth rate as faster growth in our higher fee channels contributed a favorable overall change in our base fee mix. Third quarter base fees were approximately flat year-over-year despite over $200 billion of negative FX impact to market depreciation over the last 12 months. On a constant currency basis, we estimate that quarterly base fees grew approximately 3% year-over-year. Sequentially, base fees were down 3% due to lower quarterly average AUM, a seasonal decline in security\u2019s lending activity and the impact of divergent data on our fee rate as emerging and commodities market underperformed developed market. Going forward, our fourth quarter entry base fee level will be impacted as we enter the quarter with lower spot AUM than our average AUM for the third quarter. Performance fees of $208 million were up 56% from a year ago and while broad based benefitted from a single European hedge fund that delivered exceptional full year performance unlocked in the third quarter. BlackRock Solutions revenue of $167 million was up 1% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Aladdin revenue which represented 81% of BRS revenue in the quarter, grew 11% year-over-year driven by several sizable client implementation and has now more than doubled since 2009. Strong connectivity between our BRS and institutional client teams is facilitating improved dialogue with our more sophisticated clients as we continue to see increased demand for global investment platform consolidation and multi risk solutions. Revenue in our financial markets advisory business was down $11 million from a year ago though flat sequentially as revenue in the third quarter of 2014 reflected the impact of several large ECB AQR advisor assignments. Despite lower levels of opportunistic revenue post financial crisis, FMA is benefitting from a more stable revenue profile driven by an increased number of mandates and more repeat engagements in the current market environment. Total expense rose $48 million year-over-year or 3%, driven primarily by compensation expense which increased $52 million from a year ago due to higher headcount, higher levels of performance fees and increased deferred compensation expense partially offset by the impact of a stronger dollar. G&A expense decreased $7 million from a year ago due to lower levels of marketing spend offset by a lower benefit from the FX impact re-measuring dollar exposures held overseas to their respective functional currencies. Recall that our GAAP G&A expense a year ago reflected an additional $50 million charge related to the reduction of an indemnification asset which has been excluded from our asset adjusted results. Sequentially, G&A expense increased $7 million primarily due to higher levels of professional fees in the third quarter. Our third quarter as adjusted operating margin of 43.9% reflecting expense awareness in the current market environment. Looking forward, we continue to be mindful of our discretionary level of spend as markets evolve but currently anticipate the higher level of G&A spend during the fourth quarter driven by seasonal factors and transaction related expense associated with the recently consummated acquisitions. As we stated in the past, we do not manage the business to a specific margin target. We do remain keenly focused on delivering long term value to our shareholders and will work to strike an appropriate balance between strategic investment needs and prudent discretionary expense management. We remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first reinvesting in our business and then returning excess cash to shareholders in a consistent, systematic manner. In line with that commitment, we closed the acquisitions of Cuadrada the leading independently managed infrastructure investment business in Mexico and Future Advisor, a leader in digital wealth management earlier this month. We do not expect these transactions to have a material impact on BlackRock\u2019s consolidated financial results. During the third quarter, we also repurchased an additional $275 million worth of shares and view that as a good planning rate for the remainder of the year. In the quarter while our clients faced significant market volatility, BlackRock generated $50 billion of total net flows, including $35 billion of long term net inflows reflecting the benefits of a diverse investment and distribution platform and a commitment to alpha generation. BlackRock\u2019s global retail franchise saw long-term net inflows of $7 billion; positive across all asset classes representing 5% annualized organic growth for the quarter and 10% organic growth over the last 12 months. International retail net flows of $5 billion were paced by strong flows into international equities and unconstrained fixed income highlighting the global nature of our platform. BlackRock\u2019s U.S. retail business generated long term inflows of $2 billion demonstrating resilience from what was a challenging quarter for the U.S. mutual fund industry. BlackRock\u2019s flows were led by broad based fixed income activity or strong and consistent performance across the platform continues to differentiate us despite industry outflows in a number of product categories including unconstrained fees income and high yields. Global iShares generated $23 billion of net new flows; representing 9% annualized organic growth for the quarter, and 12% organic growth over the last 12 months. iShares value proposition especially with respect to liquidity and transparency was extremely evident in a market characterized by heightened volatility and year-to-date flows remained in record territory. iShares fixed income inflows of $18 billion reflected ongoing adoption of ETFs as a means of rapidly accessing and investing in fixed income markets. iShares equity inflows of $5 billion were led by flows into developed market exposures, including our Japan and Euro zone funds. We saw increased investor focus on risk aware smart data products with our minimum volatility funds raising more than $2 billion during the quarter and gaining the number one ranking within the domestic product category. Our institutional client business saw over $5 billion in quarterly long-term net outflows, driven by higher fee active offering as clients increasingly partnered with BlackRock to generate alpha across active solution and alternative mandates. Institutional active net inflows of $6 billion reflected over $4 billion across fixed income strategies and nearly $2 billion into core alternatives and marked our sixth consecutive quarter of active institutional inflows. Alternatives flows were broad based including infrastructure, private equity, real estate, fund-to-fund and alternative solutions offerings, in addition strong fund raising momentum continued with an addition of $1 billion of illiquid alternative commitments raised in the third quarter, bringing total unfunded commitments, a source of future inflows, to approximately $11 billion. Overall, our third quarter results reflect the benefits of the investments we\u2019ve made to build a differentiated global business model. Diversification across investment styles, distribution channels, products and geographies enables us to serve clients irrespective of market environment or investment preference. Our goal remains to deliver consistent and differentiated growth overtime. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry. Laurence Douglas Fink : Thanks, Gary good morning everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Our third quarter results were driven by clients' continued trust in BlackRock\u2019s ability to manage risk and deliver holistic investment solutions as we look to achieve long term goals and navigate uncertainty and increasingly volatile economic environment. A slowing economy in China persistence, weakness in commodity prices, uncertainty around the Fed\u2019s decision on rates and continued fluctuation in currency evaluations has contributed to significant declines in global markets. Emerging market equities were down 19%, natural resources stocks were down 23% and European and U.S. indexes fell 9% and 7% respectively in just the last quarter. Government actions continue to influence markets as Central banks policies have caused imbalances in interest rates and currencies. Emerging market currencies have experienced significant volatility following nearly 9% in the third quarter before rallying over the past several days. More than ever our clients value the model we built at BlackRock. BlackRock\u2019s global, multi product platform, our market leading risk management capabilities through Aladdin and our focus on long term solutions enables us to have a more robust conversation with more clients as they address portfolio composition and asset allocation. These conversations are not just focused on what products BlackRock can sell, they are focused on outcomes our clients are looking for and how we could bring together capabilities across our global platform to help our clients achieve their goals. This approach has resulted in a stronger, longer lasting relationships with our clients than ever before which truly contributed to more than the $50 billion of net inflows this quarter. Clients not only turn to BlackRock to manage assets, but to help them to understand the longer term impact on developments in the financial landscape. The BlackRock investment institute continues to lead that discussion and hosted several client calls in the third quarter to address market volatility. The BIIs [ph] most widely attended call reaching more than 4000 client participants. This heightened level of client engagement is translating into consistent growth and BlackRock\u2019s $35 billion of long term net flows in the quarter, positive across as Gary suggested in investment styles and client types. The fact that we are seeing such diverse inflows in a volatile market speaks to the power of our platform that we built overtime at BlackRock and the differentiated experience we provide to our clients. We continue to grow our global distribution footprint and a product set to serve a diverse set of clients with a holistic range of outcome oriented solutions as clients are looking for income and uncorrelated returns in the current investment environment. In the U.S. we anticipate client demand for income focused products and since they were launched our strategic Income Opportunity and Multi-Asset Income funds have garnered more flows through the third quarter than any fund in these categories. With more than $35 billion of total inflows. Building upon the strength to these funds in the U.S. our global versions of BlackRock unconstrained fixed income and multi-asset income funds are gaining momentum with clients internationally. Year-to-date FIGO our global unconstrained offering saw net inflows to $3.8 million, and our global multi-asset income funds, our net inflows were more than $1.4 billion. On the institutional side, client demand for active fixed income and alternative strategies continues to drive positive organic base fee growth. For example, while official institutional clients have generally been environmentally driven net sellers and low fee index equity exposures, we have seen enhanced demand from the same clients for our active and alternative products and solutions, which have driven positive overall revenue growth among these clients this year. And this is some focus that we've talked about over years, having client navigate from index into active and back in forth. And the biggest differentiating feature BlackRock today versus few years ago, we have both active and fixed and passive products. BlackRock recognizes that even the most comprehensive and global set of solutions will be insufficient without strong investment performance. As a global firm our objective is to outperform consistently while our entire \u2013 throughout our entire investment platform. We remain focus on embracing a team oriented approach leveraging our connectivity, our knowledge showing firms and translating all this information into insights from technology and big data to drive top tier performance across all assets categories and investment strategies. We're seeing consistency in areas where we were strong and improvement in areas where we've been reinvesting in talent. And our scientific active equity business 97% of the AUM performed above benchmark, our peer medium for the three-year period and in our active taxable fixed income business 90% of assets performed above benchmark, or peer medium for three-year period. Over the last few years we've invested in our fundamental equity business in hiring new talent in technology and in unifying this global equity platform to be more effective to tap the resources entirely through our BlackRock. We're seeing the benefit of this investment and our fundamental active equity business 80% and 58% of our AUM is now above benchmark, our peer medium for the one year and three-year respectively. And importantly our global platform continues to deliver results. BlackRock's European and BlackRock's Asian Fundamental Equities platform have 99% and 91% of their assets respectively above benchmarks or peer medium for the three-year period. Investors continue to turn the iShares amidst heighten volatility to gain market exposures and enhanced portfolio construction. And iShares show as Gary discussed $23 billion in net total inflows. iShares captured the number one market share of the net new business globally in the U.S. and in Europe and in the third quarter year-to-date. iShares flows were driven by fixed income as investors utilized fixed income ETF as an effective tool for diversification and liquidity. Equity flows were driven by $5 billion into European listed iShares and we saw positive inflows in Canada and Asia Pacific as well. Extreme market volatility resulted in a disjointed market open on August 24. Lack of pricing clarity, widespread delayed in stock openings and an unprecedented number of trading halts impacted a large number of both U.S. listed single name stocks and equity ETF. We've spoken with many different market participants and based on our own experience and these conversations we have made several recommendation with respect to U.S. equity market structure in a viewpoint article titled \"U.S. Equity Market Structure Lessons from August 24th\", which we published on our website last week. Demand of iShares has remained strong and net iShares flows following August 24th has been robust, at nearly $25 billion through yesterday. Despite near term market fluctuation we continue to focus on the long run by investing in areas that we believe will resolve in a more complete offering for our clients and delivering value for our shareholders. Over the last two years our institutional clients rebalancing survey indicated that institutes plan to increase allocations to real assets. We continue to expand our real assets offering including BlackRock's infrastructure platform. We've provide clients with current income, diversification, income protection and potential for capital appreciation while helping to drive economic growth and job creation. As Gary mentioned earlier this month, we closed on the acquisition I Cuadrada, Mexico's leading infrastructure firm and BlackRock now manages nearly $7 billion in infrastructure investments on behalf of clients worldwide. Technology is another area where we built on our existing strength to recent investments to enhance a way we serve our clients. We continue to enhance our Aladdin platform by building out our multi-asset capabilities, driving 11% revenue growth year-over-year and we're seeing growing demand as investor become more focus on risk management in the evolving financial and regulatory landscape. Earlier this month we completed the acquisition of Future Advisor, a leading digital wealth management platform. As consumers increasing engaged with technology to invest BlackRock and Future Advisor are positioned to empower our distribution partners to better serve their clients by combining Future Advisor's high quality technology enabled advise with BlackRock's multi-asset investment capabilities, our proprietary technology and most importantly our risk analytics. We built and continue to invest in our platform and our people so that we can have a deeper dialogue with the clients and deliver consistent results for shareholders especially through times of heighten uncertainty. On a very personal note, as many of you know, Charlie Hallac, who was named our Co-President last year passed away in September following a lengthy battle against cancer. Charlie has missed by many of his friends across BlackRock. Our greatest tribute to him will be the carry forward his life work by continuing to deliver excellence to our clients, to consistently innovate and more importantly to look relentlessly for ways to evolve as Charlie always did. Finally, I want to thank our employees for their continue focus and dedication in creating better financial futures for our clients. So let's now open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Robert Lee with KBW. Robert Lee : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Laurence Douglas Fink : Hey, Robert. How are you? Robert Lee : Great, thanks. Just maybe question starting with the iShares business. And clearly, flows there have been strong across a variety of products. One of the things it feels like you're seeing, or start to see like a surge of firms kind of crowding into, I guess, what I'll call the smart beta space. Just curious if you're seeing any impact from this in terms of price competition or kind of your thoughts about how that may or may not evolve, particularly as it relates to price competition? Laurence Douglas Fink : Let me tell Rob Kapito to answer that. Robert Kapito : So most recently we haven't seen the price structure that we had seen in asset. That has settled down. Certainly, [Indiscernible] in the market look to use price as one of the ways to enter the market, but I haven't seen that really in the last quarter. Going forward I think smart beta is one of the areas that going to continue to be a successful product than a necessary product. We currently have about $125 billion in client assets across a variety of factor based products and smart beta products. We actually recently hired Dr. Andrew Ang and he is going to lead our factor-based strategies group so that we can lead in the factor-based investing on portfolio construction. And we're going to combine our skill set and his systematic investments skill set along with Aladdin to focus on the factor in the smart beta area. So, I think you are still seeing that something that clients are going to look for. We already have a number of these, one as our minimum volatility fund. We've raised about $2 billion. And we are the leader in U.S. ETF in the smart beta area. But just to step back on the price, please keep in mind that prices are only one reason why people buy ETF. They are looking for precision or what you're discussing a new approach in smart beta or factored investing, they're certainly looking for liquidity, which means, you have to have a fund and have some sort of size depending upon the type investor they could get core investor which we call it buy and hold or they are looking to be more active. So, price is important but its only one aspect and I just haven't seen the price pressure that we've seen a year ago and up to the first half of this year. Robert Lee : All right, great. And maybe the follow-up, just looking at the multi-asset class products, I mean that actually had a little bit of outflow, it wasn't too much, but little bit, but you mean that's a category that for years now has been pretty consistent solid inflows quarter after quarter. So I'm just curious was there anything unusual that quarter that may have driven that or anything we should be looking at net product line, product set? Robert Kapito : I don't think there's anything unusual. The multi-asset product segment is a segment that clients have felt very comfortable on the long-term performance of that and they sometimes use those products as a cash alternative. And so when there are movements in and out of the markets risk on, risk off, they use that particular product. And in the last quarter we've seen a lot of risks off trades and that product has been used for that, but there's nothing out of the ordinary. We're seeing inflows now in that area, the performance is good, so it's really just an aberration over the core. Laurence Douglas Fink : And I would say one of thing Robert, and specific in the third quarter we had one client move from multi-asset into an alpha product, so as Rob said, people are utilizing that but one client actually had greater conviction and went into a totally oriented market exposure alpha product. Operator : Your next question comes from Bill Katz with Citigroup. Laurence Douglas Fink : Hi, Bill. Bill Katz : Yes. Good morning everyone. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Obviously a very good flow story for the quarter, maybe to pick on one of the areas that was a bit weak, just to get your perspective on what might be going on underneath that. Could you talk a little bit about Asia-Pac? Is this just risk on, risk off for the market, and what do you think might reverse some of that recent attrition? Laurence Douglas Fink : Well, there are some very large \u2013 without getting into client detail or any clients, there are some very large movements from some clients that are actively moving out of government securities into more risk oriented securities that's pretty well advertise without me going into the specifics of that. We have seen some clients because of cash needs have been selling products. So I think Asia-Pac has been dominated more by three or four large institutions moving around. I think I'm talking about the whole ecosystem of the markets. And then, while we saw more consistent flows in Asia-Pac iShares. We are seeing actually more utilization of dollar assets today related to our institutional clients. And I would say, in some parts of Asia as Rob suggested in the fourth quarter there is more and more movements towards multi-asset. So, I don't see any major change in specific to BlackRock in the third quarter. We did have index outflows in APAC and however as I suggested in my formal speech some of these clients moved into more active products and so we had actually positive overall revenue growth in that region. So, I would say nothing that was extraordinary, just some large actions. And I think you're going to see a consistent growth on Asia-Pac overall as some of the major clients are looking to investing more global products away from their host products or host country products, so we feel good about Asia Pacific and Australia right now. Bill Katz : That's helpful. And then just a follow-up and this might be a little too early, but I'm sort of curious, there's been some recent rule changes promulgated by the SEC around mutual fund liquidity. Can you talk about how you see that playing out? Obviously, nothing is in written form quite yet in terms of where the industry has to go. But might some of the pros and cons of that regulatory change might be for the business? Laurence Douglas Fink : So, obviously this is a proposed comment, proposed liquidity risk management role. And also they are focusing on stress testing funds. I think it's very important that we have better disclosure on liquidity for all funds. We have better disclosures on stressing funds. There are certainly more and more dialogue about one directional trades worldwide from the regulators. And so, I actually believe the SEC is leading this effort and trying to come up with the appropriate analysis to help guide investors, understand the embedded issues, risks or opportunities in mutual fund. So, we look at this as a net positive that and we are always in favor of better disclosure. The one cautionary thing we would say to any regulator. Let's not make retail products less competitive than institutional products. So, for instance if they suggested that a mutual fund product should have a higher cash buffer and that would probably mean most institutional clients would move to a separate account, we may not achieve what we're trying to achieve. So, we are in favor of better disclosures. I think few better disclosures going to have better processes, possibly stress testing of fund depending on the methodologies that may work too. So, we have an open mind and I don't know Bill exactly where it's going, but we want to play a constructive role globally on these issues, if I would say, as we talked about over the last few years regulators worldwide have gone from analysis of firms related to SIFI designation to activities. And we were a big supporter of that as a firm and these are the type of activities that most certainly the regulators is going to be focusing on and as I said we have constructive positive dialogue with the regulators throughout the world on this. So we'll wait and see. Bill Katz : Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question is from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Robert Kapito : Hi, Ken. Ken Worthington : Hi, good morning. First on iShares, you highlighted about a year ago the opportunities for ETFs in Europe, given changing regulations. Today you highlighted European iShares as one of the reasons that equity iShares sales were so strong. So I guess, things kind of coming together with regulation in European ETFs, and is this really the beginning of the beginning for European ETFs? Laurence Douglas Fink : I'm going to let Rob answer. Let me just start off in saying and then Rob will, because he has much more texture on it. Regulation has evolve in Europe, regulation in terms of the inability to pass on fees have led to obviously more opportunities with ETFs. And we are beginning to see that I would say, specific about European ETFs and the equities. We are seeing more interested investors in equity exposures in Europe, so I think that is a single -- that's a trend as a market exposure trend, but I think distribution trends are going to lead to much greater reliance by distribution platform utilizing ETFs. We actually have also you saw Ken, that we had positive inflows in our mutual fund platform and we had consistent mutual fund flows in our EMEA operation. So I think the third point that I would make and then Rob will go into this specifics. I think our positioning in Europe is just getting stronger in both mutual funds and ETFs. Robert Kapito : Okay. So I would just say there is two movements. One in Europe, certainly with the RDR rules, people are moving more towards advice and asset allocation. And when you look at that the best product to achieve that is iShares or EPFs. And so we're seeing continued demand because of those rules being so important. But we are also seeing the same thing in the U.S. where our clients are using iShares for asset allocation purposes and that bodes very well for EPFs going forward. And the last trend is the products are trending to be more global products rather than just U.S. and just European. The global products are also seeing some demand. So some of it from changes and regulations, but a lot of it is due to education and people are having knowledge that iShares can actually play a big role in achieving the results that people want in their portfolios. Ken Worthington : Great. Thank you. And then sovereign wealth funds have been in the media again. Maybe discuss how diversified BlackRock's exposure is between commodity-related sovereign wealth funds and maybe non-commodity related funds. And is exposure of BlackRock weighted to any particular size or asset class? I was thinking active versus passive and/or fixed income versus equity. Thanks Robert Kapito : Ken, that's a great question and it is a question I'm not going to answer because I don't talk about my clients. I just \u2013 it just something we have never made even any reference to any specific sovereign wealth funds or anything, so I'm going to leave it that. Ken Worthington : Worth a try. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Robert Kapito : Hi, Craig, how are you? Craig Siegenthaler : Good morning. So maybe first, you just hit on fixed income here. Very good results across all three of your fixed income bases and it looks like [Indiscernible] was a large driver for retail, but are there any underlying themes that really surprised you in fixed income in this quarter? Robert Kapito : Well, I think the narrative about high rates and what does it mean for fixed income flows is just an entirely incorrect viewpoint. And this is one of the key elements of what I think is differentiating BlackRock. We're focusing on helping clients, meet the needs of their liabilities. Many clients have liabilities that are very long dated, many clients have under invested and so they actually have a gap between their during of their liability versus the duration of their funds. As interest rates rise, if they rise, I think they will rise one day. We are actually going to see an accelerated movement towards clients buying longer duration assets. And that's I mean, I'm not talking about trading strategies, but clients that are pension fund oriented or long dated insurance type of products, they're going to use this as an opportunity to buy different long dated assets. Clients who are more interested in any trade obviously they're going to get out of the long duration and moving to the low duration or something like our strategic income opportunity fund where they are not going to be constrain to a duration, it will be unconstrained products. So, what the third quarter saw? We saw lots of moment. We saw some clients were adding duration. We saw some clients were reducing duration. We saw some clients taking advantage and this is one thing that I haven't seen in the narrative. We saw, we have clients who are taking advantages of the rising high yield market because high yield underperformed in the third quarter and we saw clients are moving back into high yields, because the coupon and risk adjusted basis in the categories are achieving their needs to match their liability. So, this is an important component of why I believe we have differentiated ourselves because we are working with our clients, trying to keep the narrative on what is their outcome that they are seeking. It's not about trading in and out, it is about how can they best achieve and composition of assets to meet their liabilities. And by continuing to drive home this concept of long termism and outcomes instead of the noise of the moment has allowed us to have deeper dialogue and I think the flows and fixed income shown the results of having deeper dialogues and focus on outcomes. Craig Siegenthaler : Got it. And then, I just have a follow-up here on multi-asset. Just given the softer results in 3Q in this one product set, could you give us an update on kind of the three main funds here, Global All, LifePath, and also Multi-Asset Income? Robert Kapito : Gary. Gary Shedlin : Absolutely correct. So, I think that there has been as Rob talked about and making Larry has on further on, we're seeing some movements in the multi-asset category. MAI and keep in mind also one other additional point is that when we talk about multi-asset that you're looking at in the context that our reporting we're really talking about the bundled outcome products that I think you're talking about. There's lots of other multi-asset discussion and solutions that are going on around the firm that frankly fit into lots of other categories. But as you talk about bundled products like LifePath and Global All, which obviously two of our flagship products, they did see flattish flows in the quarter. And I think while we would say that MAI's flows were not as strong as prior quarters, it still was positive t the tune of 500 million and it\u2019s still remains a top selling or the top selling multi-asset income funds since launch about three years ago. Larry talked about SIO and other similar products which is a fixed income products and obviously that and in addition to that with LDI and some other things we've seen very positive flows there. But there is no question that as we saw some slow inflows where there was MAI, DDG or even LifePath we did see some slows, some slowing of the flows. I think it's early for us to figure out whether in particular around target date that was an industry phenomenon or not, obviously we did see unprecedented volatility. I think that if we actually look across a lot of those products with respect to different dates we definitely did see more flows in so called near term maturity dates as oppose to the long-term which may suggest that has people who are looking to basically approach retirement more quickly they saw volatility and we're deciding to eliminate some of the equity exposure in the near term, but I think we'll be watching that very closely and see to what extend those change direction in the next few quarters. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks, Gary. Operator : And your next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Michael Cyprys : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Could you talk a little bit about the opportunity for ETFs being used as an alternative to futures contracts, and then also ETFs being used as a form of collateral? How do you see those opportunity sets progressing today and how much, would you say, of your book is in that capacity right now? And then just maybe if you could touch upon some of the longer term opportunity sets there? Thanks. Robert Kapito : So, this is the beauty of ETFs that we constantly have been finding new uses for the products, so as futures becomes more expensive to use than ETFs had opened up a whole new world that we didn't even think about because of the collateral cost behind futures contracts. So, when we are going into the capital markets and we are meeting lots of fixed income and equity clients and having discussions and talking about to them about uses, most of the time we walk away with some other ideas that we didn't think about that they have needs for. So as you know now ETFs are being use as a surrogate for futures across many institutional accounts, so we think that's going to continue, how big that can be, just think about the size of the futures markets and certainly regulation is going to play a big role in that as well. So, as capital costs are going up or lots of institutions, ETFs are starting to play a bigger role. So that's sort of where we're adding and I would tell you in the fixed income side, fixed income really let the equity market when it came to new uses and we have added a bunch of people in our capital markets group for iShares to go out, and to really work with different institutions in both education and also both learning what some of the needs are so that we could innovate those products for. Michael Cyprys : Okay. Thanks. And then shifting to the institutional index side, could you talk about some of the opportunity sets they are converting some of the lower fee institutional index mandates to higher margin or higher fee oriented mandates, so basically increasing the share of wallet or moving upstream and shifting the share of wallet? How big of an opportunity set is that, and is there any low hanging fruit left? Any color around that would be helpful. Robert Kapito : I think the opportunity remains to be quite large as we saw in our investment survey that the clients were looking to add more alternatives. And this is worldwide across the globe. We are \u2013 this is one of the big reasons why we are building our infrastructure platform, continue to build out our hedge fund platform, our real estate platform. So, as I said earlier, we are in deeper conversation with clients than we are ever been before. Much of it has to do with the quality of our relationships, our focus on risk management, and our ability to deliver solutions, I mean, that sounds like a lot of talk, but that positioning is now transformed us to have those dialogues five years ago when we in many relation where we strictly had a beta relationship we were not \u2013 we did not have ability to provide the products or have the dialogue with many more clients. I believe today, we have more dialogue. We have deeper dialogues with clients worldwide that is going to allow us. If the opportunity prevails when a client is looking to reduced beta exposures to go into other forms of outlet exposures whether it is active equity management, active fixed income of alternatives, we have those dialogues and I \u2013 once again I do believe the third quarter is starting to show that evidence that we are able to navigate. Rob and I spend a great deal of time on the road. We have \u2013 we are constantly reminded that if we could provide the holistic solution to our clients, that we can provide a deeper analysis what the needs of our clients we have seen consistently that we are able then to have a broader product range solution for our clients. And as we continue to drive that and build these relations, I think you are going to see that navigation and interflows in our business. If you look specifically in the third quarter, we grew many different types of alternatives, we had $2 billion in positive flows, we had another $1 billion in forward commitments and the most positive thing I could tell you related to those flows, those flows principally came in six different products, which is another statement of the growing product breadth that we are developing for our clients. Michael Cyprys : Great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Laurence Douglas Fink : Hi, Alex how are you? Alexander Blostein : Hi, Larry good morning. So sticking with the regulatory line of questions I guess you know we\u2019ve gone through a bunch of comments from the industry and the [Indiscernible] proposal it looks like we are getting a little bit closer to some sort of a final ruling and it looks like a lot of these you know a lot of things will kind of come through as they were written. So maybe hoping to get your perspective from one, what risk and opportunities does that create for BlackRock against the ruling, about the rules set today [ph] Laurence Douglas Fink : I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know how the rules are going to be coming out. On the surface it will change the relationships with the distribution partners with their clients, we have to adapt our business with our distribution partners on that business. I think one thing is very clear how this outplays that it means greater emphasis on beta products and ETFs. But until we see how this has rolled out, and we\u2019ve had comments on it that are very public about our opinions related to the DOL. I would also say that if investors feel more confident because of however the DOL [ph] plays out that if investors feel more confident that they can invest fairly, securely we are all benefited by that. Now, I\u2019m not sure how that will play out, but we\u2019ve always believed that we could have a market place where our clients feel more secure that they have an opportunity to earn a fair return over a long cycle everyone will be benefited by that. The Clients obviously our distribution partners and the investment management team. So we once again, we have tried to take a constructive approach to the SEC, mindful that some of the SEC Fiduciary rules would change the relationship with our distribution partners and we\u2019ve tried to work with the regulators in terms of finding a sensible solution that meets the challenges of our distribution partners, the asset manager that importantly giving the end client the trust that they need in terms of investing for the future. Alexander Blostein : Okay, thanks for that. And then on the product side of things, I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the active equity business. Nice to see flows turning positive here, I guess it\u2019s one of the better quarters we\u2019ve seen in a little while, so any granularity here in terms of where the strength has been coming from, whether its scientific I think you guys highlighted that in the press release or the fundamental equities where we are starting to see some turnaround? Laurence Douglas Fink : So where we are starting to see the biggest turnaround is from the fundamental equity business. We spent a lot of time and money I should know in trying to rebuild our efforts there and the teams. And I feel very good about this, certainly in Europe our team there has been together longer. Their record across the board is now very strong and now we are starting to see the same efforts in the U.S. through our capital appreciation fund, our equity dividend fund. So the performance is actually really good. Now on top of that the scientific act of equity grew to more quantitatively driven and manual driven portfolios. The three here a record which had left a lot of the consultants look at the 98% of the assets are above the benchmark or appear immediate. We had work to do domestically and today the fundamental act of equity business 81% of the assets are above the benchmark for the one year period. So as time goes on, the performance is really, really much better. So when you see better performance it translates directly into flow and we are starting to see those flows or having much better dialogue with our consultants who are now putting us in the mix for proposals and we\u2019re also internally very focused on building out the equity effort and you are going to hear a lot more from us, from our marketing teams and the rest of the teams across the firm, because we are going to be much bigger in the active equity space and we are very happy to have the performance to back that up, so very important part and we\u2019re still adding people but we are getting results at the same time, good positive feedback from our clients. Gary Shedlin : Let me just add one more thing. As I said in my prepared remarks the strength of our performance 98% are for Asian equities and European equities. We are seeing close and within those categories and we continue to be differentiated and I truly believe as the market settles down we believe the category where many investors will be seeking market exposures and that\u2019s going to be in Asian equities. And with our performance I would think over the next few years we are going to see accelerated flows there. Laurence Douglas Fink : And just \u2013 just drill down as you have asked just a couple of notes for you, our equity dividends, our product was now in the 37 percentile. Our basic value has come from the 51st percentile to the 20th percentile and our large cap core has risen from 76 to the 29th percentile. Those are big loans and I believe those are sustainable, it\u2019s just the beginning of what we could do when we combine the knowledge and the communication across the platform. Alexander Blostein : Got it. Thanks for all the color there. Appreciate it. Operator : And your next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Laurence Douglas Fink : Hey Brian. Brian Bedell : Good morning, folks. Hi, good morning. Just to go back on the SEC liquidity rule proposals, I guess first of all I know it\u2019s very early, but as they are proposed do you think it\u2019s generally workable for investments in less liquid areas in high yields in small cap emerging markets. Laurence Douglas Fink : Absolutely. That\u2019s right. I\u2019m sorry, go on\u2026 Brian Bedell : And then on the counter side of that how do you think Aladdin can play a role in this for fund companies if it owns? Laurence Douglas Fink : So different products have different liquidity sets. This is one of the reasons why I think liquidity disclosure is a good thing. We have mentioned high yields. High yields have somewhat less liquidity than an investment grade product, a treasury fund has more liquidity than an investment grade corporate product. You are paid a higher income for those types of returns and I do believe having a measurement hopefully a dynamic measurement, a dynamic measurement will allow investors and we are talking mostly retail investors having a better understanding and so if we can come up with a metrics that is dynamic, that is informative about of liquidity of anyone product and differentiating that liquidity amongst different funds, because some funds some mutual funds have systematically always even in the asset categories of let\u2019s say high yield have been consistently invested in the lower grade of high yield with less liquidity and some mutual funds have invested in the higher grade high yield that had more liquidity and so some form of dynamic measurement is probably good. I don\u2019t \u2013 I actually believe once again as investors are becoming more informed and they better understand the risks and the returns I actually believe it will lead to greater investments in different asset categories. This is something we should all embrace. So I don\u2019t \u2013 as I said I look at this as a positive. It\u2019s a constructive way of analyzing, we just need to make sure that we don\u2019t cause so much problems at all institutions run out of mutual funds and go to separate accounts and we may not be achieving everything that is necessary. But \u2013 we want smart investors, smart investors is better for the entire asset management industry. We should not run away from markets that are opaque, we should always be trying to find ways of making more transparency in terms of risk. In terms of Aladdin, greater risk analytics, whether its liquidity analytics or stress test analytics is a very large positive for the future direction and needs of clients utilizing Aladdin. As I said in my prepared remarks, Aladdin is growing 11% a year. We are in deep dialogue with many clients right now and I feel very good about how Aladdin is the risk management platform of choice by so many investors worldwide. Brian Bedell : Okay, great. Thanks and then just a follow up on the retail distribution strategy especially as it relates to ETF. Can you talk about the role of Future Advisor as you\u2019ve I guess the stages of planning that out and integrating with your RIA efforts and also your plans for sales force built to better penetrate your RIA segment? Laurence Douglas Fink : So we \u2013 we are very excited about what Future Advisor will bring for us. We believe having better technology to interface with our distribution partners will give us a real opportunity. It is too early for me to really go into detail how we are navigating it, but in the early weeks we\u2019ve had a refreshingly large amount of interest with our distribution partners in the utilization of this technology. Once again, through this technology if we could increase the knowledge base of products, increase the knowledge base of information through this technology we will have deeper and more robust conversations. If we can our hope is to and our intentions is to link our Future Advisor technology with our Aladdin technology to help our distribution partners to have both better risk analytics and better client interphase information so they could be providing better guidance to their clients. This is a long term investment for us, we are more excited about the investment today than we were as we thought about making the investment. And as I said earlier we are thrilled with the response by our distribution partners to have more engagement utilizing this technology. So it\u2019s too early to really get into any details but our management team of Future Advisors are running around the country right now having many dialogues and conversations alongside our BlackRock solution team. So it is very important to note that we never really talked about it, putting Future Advisor into our BlackRock solution platform really gives us this ability to really create a third party platform to provide independence information for our clients that is very similar to what BlackRock Aladdin does for our clients independent risk management. So we look at this as a great stepping stone for a deeper connection with our RIAs and our all our distribution platforms. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks? Laurence Douglas Fink : Once again, I thank all of you for joining this morning and your interest in BlackRock. Our third quarter results once again highlighted the investments we made to enhance a differentiated platform, a more diverse platform, a global platform, a risk management platform. We continue to differentiate ourselves by taking a consistent long term view while staying ahead and navigating the near term developments in the financial markets. I think we help our clients by having this diverse multi product platform to help them navigate and I think the third quarter results speak loudly with those results. Have a good quarter and we\u2019ll talk to you in the New Year. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So, with that, let's begin. Gary S. Shedlin: Good morning. Thanks, Chris. Happy New Year to everybody. Its my pleasure to be here to present our fourth quarter and full-year 2015 results. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. As usual, I will be focusing primarily on as adjusted results. In a year characterized by significant market and FX volatility, 2015 was another strong year for BlackRock as we generated industry leading organic growth, maintain stable operating margins, while continuing to invest in our business and return to approximately $2.6 billion of capital to our shareholders, representing a total payout ratio of 77%. The differentiation and strength of BlackRock\u2019s diverse global investment platform, once again enabled us to generate consistent and stable financial results, allowing us to continue playing offense despite global macro uncertainty. We saw strong results from our core business areas and remain committed to investing in a variety of strategic initiatives that will further enhance our client value proposition and generate long-term value for our shareholders. In the fourth quarter, BlackRock generated operating income of $1.1 billion and earnings per share of $4.75. Full-year operating income of $4.7 billion, increased 3% versus a year-ago and earnings per share of $19.60, were up 1% which included the impact of a higher tax rate in 2015. Non-operating results for the quarter included $46 million of net investment gains, primarily driven by $35 million unrealized gain on a strategic private equity investment. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 30% compared to a tax rate of 25.4% a year-ago that reflected $39 million of non-recurring discrete tax benefits. We continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable projected tax rate for 2016, reflecting changes in our geographic business mix, though the actual effect of tax rate may differ as a consequence of non-recurring items that could arise during the year. BlackRock\u2019s fourth quarter results were driven by $54 billion of long-term net new business, representing an annualized organic growth rate of 5% and the third highest low quarter in BlackRock\u2019s history and reflects resilience of our differentiated business model. For the full-year of 2016, BlackRock generated long-term net new business of $152 billion, representing a 4% long-term organic AUM growth rate and a 6% organic base fee growth rate as faster growth in our higher fee retail and iShares businesses contributed to a favorable overall change in our base fee mix. Long-term net inflows were diversified by asset class and investment style with positive flows across these categories for the full-year. BlackRock continue to deliver top line growth despite the challenging market. As fourth quarter revenue of $2.9 billion and full-year revenue of $11.4 billion were both 3% higher than a year-ago. Organic growth and improved investment performance drove increases in base fees, performance fees and Aladdin revenue, all of which reached record levels in 2015. Fourth quarter and full-year base fee each grows 3% year-over-year, primarily driven by organic growth, despite over a $150 billion of negative FX impact and market depreciation on our AUM over the last 12 months. FX was a significant drag in 2015 and we estimate that full-year base fees grew 6% versus 2014 levels on a constant currency basis. Sequentially, quarterly base fees were essentially flat, despite positive organic growth due to a lower fourth quarter AUM entry rate, the continued impact of divergent data on our fee rate as emerging and commodities markets once again underperform developed markets and ongoing dollar appreciation against foreign currencies. Performance fees for the fourth quarter were $169 million, up 17% from a year-ago, driven by our broad suite of active offerings, but down $39 million sequentially due to a single hedge fund that delivered exceptional full-year performance and locked in the third quarter. Full-year performance fees of $621 million rose 13% versus 2014, evidencing strong alpha generation across our diverse investment platform. Fourth quarter of BlackRock Solutions revenue of $171 million was up 1% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Full-year 2015 Aladdin revenue were $528 million, which represented 82% of BRS revenue, grew 11% year-over-year driven by several sizable client implementations and has more than doubled since 2009. We expect continued business momentum in Aladdin, driven by trends favoring global investment platform consolidation and multi asset risk solutions. Our financial markets advisory business ended 2015 with a $118 million in revenue. Despite lower levels of opportunistic revenue post financial crisis, FMA is benefiting from a more stable revenue profile driven by an increased number of mandates and more repeat engagements in the current market environment. Total expense for the fourth quarter rose $90 million year-over-year, driven primarily by an increase in compensation, and G&A expense. For the full-year of 2015, compensation expense increased $184 million or 5% due to higher headcount associated with our growth initiatives, higher incentive and deferred compensation partly offset by the impact of the stronger dollar. Recall that year-over-year comparisons of fourth quarter compensation expense are less relevant, because we determine compensation on a full-year basis. Fourth quarter G&A expense increased $23 million year-over-year or 6%, primarily driven by $23 million of deal related expense associated with strategic transactions executed in the quarter. Sequentially, quarterly G&A expense increased $91 million primarily reflected a planned uptick in year-end marketing and promotional spend, higher technology expense, and the previously mentioned $23 million in deal related expense. Full-year G&A expense of $1.4 billion was 2% below 2014 levels, reflecting expense awareness in a volatile market environment, not withstanding the G&A spend in the fourth quarter. If markets stabilize and given the impact of recent acquisitions on our run rate, we would anticipate a higher level -- higher annual level of G&A spend during 2016. Overall, total expense for 2015 increased 3% from a year-ago compared to a similar increase in revenue over the same period, resulting in an as-adjusted operating margin of 42.9% for the full-year, flat to our 2014 level. We remain committed to generating operating leverage in our business, and have expanded our operating margin by over 450 basis point since closing the BGI acquisition at the end of 2009. However, as we stated in the past, we also do not manage the business to a specific margin target, either quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year. The diversification and stability of our business model affords us the option of investing through a market cycle to grow share. We remain keenly focused on delivering long-term value to our shareholders by striking an appropriate balance between organically investing for future growth and practical discretionary expense management. At times, our strategic investments will also begin organic. During 2015, BlackRock closed several transactions, including BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors, a domestic middle market lending platform, I Cuadrada, a Latin American infrastructure investor and Future Advisor, a digital wealth manager. In addition, on November 3, BlackRock announced an agreement to assume investment management responsibilities for approximately $87 billion of cash and liquidity AUM, currently managed by Bank of America Global Capital Management. We expect that transaction to close in the first half of 2016. During 2015, we also returned approximately $2.6 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. As we enter 2016, our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $2.29 per share of common stock, representing an increase of 5% over the prior level. Since instituting a dividend in 2003, BlackRock has grown its dividend on a compound annual growth rate of approximately 22%. We repurchased $1.1 billion of our shares in 2015, and have now repurchased approximately 10 million shares since we instituted a consistent and predictable approach to capital management in 2013. We remain committed to this approach and a similar level of share repurchase in 2016, but could increase such amounts based on potential changes to the relative valuation of our stock price. Our 2015 financial results reflect the benefits of our differentiated global business model. Fourth quarter and full-year net inflows of $54 billion and $152 billion respectively were positive in both our active and index franchises and benefited from significant flows into iShares. Global iShares generated $60 billion of net new business in the fourth quarter and record flows of $130 billion for the year; representing full-year organic growth of 13%. iShares captured the number one share of global, U.S., and European ETF industry flows for both the fourth quarter and the full-year. Record fourth quarter equity iShares inflows of $48 billion were driven by demand for U.S equities, and a broad array of developed market exposures. Fourth quarter fixed income iShares inflows of $12 billion reflected flows into core, high yield and investment grade corporate bond funds. BlackRock\u2019s global retail franchise saw a fourth quarter inflows of $7 billion, reflecting the seasonal impact of capital gains distributions. Full-year of 2015 net flows of $38 billion representing 7% organic asset growth were driven by diversified flows across our top performing fixed income platform. International retail net inflows totaled $20 billion in 2015, and were paced by strong flows into international equities and unconstrained fixed income, allowing BlackRock to maintain its year-to-date number one ranking in cross-border mutual fund flows. U.S. retail net flows of $19 billion in 2015 demonstrated resilience in a challenging year for the U.S mutual fund industry. BlackRock\u2019s institutional franchise had long-term net outflows of $13 billion for the quarter and $16 billion for the year as we continue to see sizeable asset allocation driven flows both into and out of low fee institutional index products. However, we also continue to benefit from demand for higher fee active offerings as clients recognize the value added alpha generating platform we\u2019ve built across traditional and alternative active strategies. The positive fee impact of this mixed shift is in line with our growth strategy and enabled BlackRock\u2019s institutional business to deliver organic based fee growth of 4% in 2015. We generated $4 billion of institutional flows into core alternatives during the year. Flows were broad based across a diverse alternatives platform including infrastructure, fund of hedge funds, fund of private equity funds, and alternative solutions offerings. We ended 2015 with another strong fund raising quarter for liquid alternatives raising $1 billion in new commitments. Over the last three years we\u2019ve raised more than $17 billion in commitments and have nearly $11 billion of committed capital to deploy for our clients. Committed capital translate into flows and AUM as those dollars are invested and will be a source of future revenue growth. In summary, in a year marked by periods of increased market volatility, divergent data, and significant currency movements, our diversified business model delivered consistent financial results and allowed us to continue investing for future growth. We remain confident that BlackRock\u2019s differentiated platform is well positioned to meet the needs of our client and shareholders in the years to come. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry. Laurence D. Fink: Good morning everyone, and thanks, Gary. Our fourth quarter and full-year results demonstrated that in times of rapid change and market volatility, BlackRock\u2019s diverse business model can consistently generate strong results. Over the last year, energy prices have deteriorated significantly with the price of oil dropping to levels not seen in more than a decade. Growth in China remains sluggish, so will emerging markets including Brazil, face significant political and economic challenges, and divergence of developed market monetary policies driving heightened volatility and rates, currency, and equity markets. The Federal Reserve\u2019s action to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly 10 years marked a end of a historical period of monetary policy, a combination in the U.S and the beginning of an extended gradual tightening cycle. All of these factors are leading to a much more divergent world in 2016, while higher levels of volatility ahead, as already witnessed in the first few weeks of the year. And as the investment landscape changes, our clients need change as well. The differentiation of BlackRock\u2019s core business model drives consistency and resilience in our results. This positions BlackRock to invest in a platform, investing in technology, investing in people, even in the most challenging and volatile times and to anticipate and adapt ahead of change, so that we\u2019re positioned to provide our clients with investment solutions to meet their evolving needs. In a more fragmented investment landscape impacted by continual low rate, modest beta driven returns, investors will search for income, they will search for capital appreciation, through a combination of both active and alternative investments, factors, smart beta strategies, and hybrid solutions. No other firm in the world can provide all of these capabilities on a single platform, supported by superior risk management, technology, and investment performance. And this is what\u2019s driving a deeper connectivity with our clients than ever before and once again drove BlackRock\u2019s fourth quarter and our full-year results. BlackRock generated $54 billion of long-term net flows in the fourth quarter and a $152 billion for the year, representing annualized organic growth of 5% and 4% respectively. Flows were driven by client demand for both active and index solutions across asset categories, asset classes across regions. We saw $61 billion in growth in a year when most people talked about there is not demand for active strategies, we saw $61 billion in growth in our active strategies and $92 billion of growth in index and iShares flows. We generated flows of $53 billion in equities, $77 billion in fixed income, $17 billion in multi asset, and $5 billion in alternatives. We raised $38 billion in our retail platform, $130 billion in our iShares platforms, and in our institutional platform we raised $27 billion of active strategies that was offset by $43 billion of low fee institutional index of flows. What I\u2019m particularly very pleased with is the platform and how broad it is and its evident in 2015 there were 13 countries where we had net inflows in excess of $1 billion. In addition in 2015, we had a record amount of 65 different retail and iShares products generating more than $1 billion in net inflows. The industry leading organic growth story at BlackRock that we delivered in 2015 is in addition that we raised a 11% growth rates in our Aladdin product. Alpha driven performance fees and expense awareness translated into positive results in both the top and bottom line, even in the face of tremendous headwinds that we saw in global equity markets and FX. BlackRock is committed in having a deep and broad understanding of the world in which we and our clients operate and invest in. Our commitment in being truly local in more than 30 countries that we operate in worldwide, completely positions BlackRock to understand our clients needs and a specific investment requirements to better help them navigate these markets. And we\u2019re in a better position I believe than any other firm in the world to do that. The BlackRock investment institute provides a platform across regions, across asset classes, across investment styles for our investors to exchange the knowledge they built in local market, debate investment topics, share expertise with the goal of generating better alpha and managing risk for our clients. This connectivity, this worldwide connectivity also has enabled us to have a deeper dialogue and level of trust with clients around the world. This year the BlackRock investment institute touched nearly 20,000 clients globally through in person meetings, hosted conference calls and critical market events, and in in-depth publications. This knowledge and the connected tissue combined with the talent of our investment teams has contributed to a strong performance across our active platform. As of the end of the fourth quarter, 91% of our active taxable fixed income assets and 90% of our scientific active equity assets are above benchmarks or peer medium for the last three years. Throughout 2015, we continue to make progress on the revigorization and globalization of our fundamental active equity business, generating strong result for our clients with 76% of our fundamental active equity assets above benchmark or peer medium for the one-year period highlighted by the strong turnaround we seen in the performance in our flagship equity dividend fund. The strength of our active performance has translated into flows, as I said early in -- we saw $61 billion of flows in 2015 in our active strategies, despite a challenging year for active fund flows across our industry. We continue to diversify our institutional active platform and deepen existing client relationships by creating hybrid solution based strategies to solve our clients most complex investment needs. Institutional active net flows of $27 billion in 2015 were primarily driven by fixed income and multi asset solutions as institution look to BlackRock to solve their most complex investment challenges. On the retail side, the diversification of our EMEA retail business was a significant driver of results in 2015. And BlackRock saw active net inflows from retail clients led by our European equity and income, our unconstrained fixed income products, our high yield products, and our Multi Asset income products. in the United States, the breadth of BlackRock\u2019s product suite across active index and iShares resonated with our retail clients. We remain focused on growing global iShare market share and driving market -- global market expansion, which translated into strong flows in 2015. The fourth quarter was a record quarter for iShares as investors continue to turn the BlackRock iShares franchise which generated $60 billion in net inflows across asset classes. For the quarter and for the year, iShares captured the number one share of flows in the U.S., Europe globally with 37% global market share for the full-year. 2015 iShares flows was a $130 billion, primarily driven by developed market equities and fixed income. The global core series saw flows of $46 billion representing a 23% organic growth and record fixed income flows of $50 billion was concentrated in our high yield products, including investment grade, corporate bonds, and our high yield funds. Fixed income is a strategic priority for iShares which led the industry and fixed income ETF flows for the quarter and for the year, driven by iShares consistency of having 15 of the top 25 fixed income ETFs by net flows in 2015. Fixed income market volatility rose in December and during this time the market stressed BlackRock\u2019s flagship high yield ETF, HYG, enabled clients to transact directly with one another at known, transparent, minute-by-minute pricing with ample liquidity. More than $20 billion of HYG traded in the two weeks ending December 18 were less than $1 billion of net redemptions providing our markets and our clients\u2019 substantial liquidity with limited impact on the underlying markets. As we look back in 2015, despite these spikes in market volatility, ETF and specifically iShares are increasingly being relied upon by clients for transparent, liquid, cost effective investment solutions. We continue to find opportunity to learn from market events to educate investors and focus on the long-term needs of our clients and iShares and across BlackRock\u2019s platform by investing in areas that we believe will result in a more complete solutions offering for our clients and deliver value for our shareholders. Being aware of what is going on in the world around us, anticipating change and having the willingness to adapt is a critical part of our responsibility as a fiduciary to our clients.  Throughout the year BlackRock has made significant enhancements to our platform through a combination of investment for organic growth, for acquisitions, and the evolution of our talent. Technology is increasingly impacting our clients and our business. In 2015, we made investments to utilize technology to gain new investment insights and to reach our clients more effectively. We are investing in big data and tax analysis to make better portfolio management decision across our broad platform of quantitative and fundamental investment style. Factor based analysis will become more prevalent as market dispersion increases. We made significant enhancements to our smart beta and factor based investing platform, including the hiring of Andrew Young and BlackRock generated nearly $10 billion of smart beta net inflows in 2015, driven by iShares minimum vol funds. We are investing in retail technology to empower our intermediary partner for a high quality technological enabled advice capabilities to improve our clients\u2019 investment experiences. We close on the acquisition of Future Advisor in the fourth quarter and we recently signed our first two clients, representing the first B2B contracts of their kind in the U.S digital wealth management space. We continue to see strong demand for alternative solutions as investors move beyond the boundaries of traditional strategies to investments and real estate infrastructure, other forms of real assets across the liquid platform. Our hedge fund platform has grown 9% annually over the past five years and now stands at $31 billion in AUM and we continue to invest to broaden our platform and leveraging our top performing internal talent to develop products organically as well as bringing in new managers. We remain focused on our responsibility to partner with clients and simultaneously generating long-term returns and create positive social outcomes. Over the past several years, we\u2019ve grown our infrastructure platform to more than $7 billion. This includes the industry leading renewable power franchise, a strong infrastructure debt capability, and meaningful investments in Latin America, like our acquisition and our partnership with PEMEX. These activities offer long-term benefits to both investors and the economies, where they contribute to economic growth, contributes to the country\u2019s job creation and most importantly it contributes to a positive environmental impact. In 2015, we continue to invest in the BlackRock impact platform which manages now more than $200 billion to provide investors with the opportunity to generate long-term competitive financial returns and positively impact society. At BlackRock embracing change has always been a core part of who we\u2019re. Nearly every year we take a fresh look at the organization and reflect on ways to improve it. We then evolve the organization in anticipation of changes of our clients needs in anticipation of the global markets. Together with our Board of Directors, we undertake a deliberate process and effort to continually position our leaders in roles that can broaden their experience and maximize their potential both for BlackRock and our clients. This is critical in building a truly global firm. We did this in 2012 and 2014 with very positive benefits. This week again we announced a number of enhancements to our leadership team that are part of this consistent process of developing our people and evolving our organizations to meet these challenging needs. Looking at the quality of the leaders, taking on new or expanded roles, I\u2019m incredibly proud of the depth of the talent that we\u2019ve and I believe today we have the strongest leadership team we\u2019ve ever had in the history of BlackRock. And it is the quality and talent of this team that allows BlackRock to deliver the performance we did in 2015, despite the vol of the markets and positions us very well for 2016. It is this team; they\u2019re the reason that we\u2019ve forged such a trusting relationship with our clients and why our clients are increasingly turning to BlackRock to solve their biggest financial challenges. As we head into 2016, we will continue to make investments in our future. We will continue to develop our talent and seeking ways to leverage and grow our diverse platform to meet our fiduciary responsibilities to our clients, our fiduciary responsibilities to our societies where we operate, and to deliver the returns for our shareholders. With that, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Laurence D. Fink: Good morning, Craig. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks. Good morning, Larry. So first question on active bond flows. I\u2019m just wondering, given the improvement in yields over the last six months what are you seeing across your institutional client base and how is this compared to retail where there has been a historic reaction already to high yield bond prices, bank loan prices and global bond prices where there has been a decline? Laurence D. Fink: Well, the widening in spreads is a blessing for our insurance clients. That\u2019s first and foremost. Insurance companies are adding to their fixed income exposures now. As I\u2019ve commented in the past, the whole insurance industry or a good part of it is short-term liability duration and are hoping for higher rates. We haven\u2019t seen higher rates; obviously, we are sitting here with a very low 10-year Treasury rate, but we most certainly have seen a widening in credit spreads. And I think as evidence of a few large bond issues that went public this week, we saw huge demand. And so, as spreads widen, we expect to see more demand institutionally. And as you suggested, some of the widening of spreads are the fears if higher rates are going to produce some selling possibly from retail, but we haven\u2019t seen anything dramatic yet. We haven\u2019t seen really any dramatic outflows on iShares yet. So, I don\u2019t think there is any real massive change yet. And I think one thing you should be aware Craig, at this time, this is when you have the institution sitting down on their net, this year\u2019s asset allocation. You\u2019re going to start seeing behavior changes probably in February and March when they start doing their reallocations maybe. And so most recently one would think, in some cases some pension funds because of the decline in equities they\u2019ll rebalance out of fixed income back in the equities as they, if they want to have consistent asset allocations. But our performance in fixed income, I think you know we had 91% of our products above peer medium over the last three years and so -- and that\u2019s across all our European fixed income, our U.S. fixed income, our unconstrained products, our low duration products, mortgage products, high yield. And so, we\u2019re in a pretty good position to have broad based conversations with our clients. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks, Larry. Just as my follow-up, I had an expense question here for Gary. Gary, G&A expenses have trended down two years in a row now. I heard your color that, I think they\u2019re likely going to be up in \u201916. But can you help us in terms of magnitude, and also given the revenue headwinds in the first quarter just from beta. Do you have any wiggle room that if things get worse you can actually maybe cut a little bit into G&A too? Gary S. Shedlin: Thanks, Craig. So I think -- yes, I think first of all we wanted to make sure that people understand kind of some of what went on in the fourth quarter. And as you recall, during the year we told you we\u2019ve been under spending versus our original expectation going into the -- into 2015. And I would say that was a function initially of timing. And as the markets became more volatile during the year frankly overall expense awareness. The fourth quarter G&A was clearly higher, and in fact we booked roughly a third of our annual M&P spend in the quarter alone. And as you saw we incurred about $23 million of onetime deal expenses. Given that elevated level of G&A, the fourth quarter is clearly not representative of a good run rate for next year. Not withstanding that -- not withstanding as you saw, G&A expense was 2% below last year and I think that reflects our ability to manage the discretionary portion of our G&A expense in an uncertain market environment. And we continue to remain conscious of the tradeoff between growth and margin especially as we think about that discretionary portion of our spending in the current markets. That being said, I think that if markets stabilize and given the impact of recent acquisitions on our run rate, we would anticipate a higher level of G&A spend during the year, but there is obviously some discretion tied to that and we\u2019ll be watching it very carefully. Laurence D. Fink: And Craig, every year during the financial crisis and after, we do pay attention to our margins, and we navigate our expenses accordingly. And I would say that would be consistent going into 2016. Craig Siegenthaler : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Laurence D. Fink: Good morning, Michael. Michael Carrier : Thanks guys. Hi. How are you doing? Maybe just a question on, it seems like there was some more regulatory items on the agenda with the most recent one, maybe the SEC liquidity proposal. And I know you guys just submitted a comment letter. I just wanted to get your sense on for the industry particularly given like the market dynamics, like maybe what are the pros, what are the cons? You guys mentioned the nuances between EPS and funds. And I guess, the hard part like, I think for a lot of you who are in the industry is how to calculate some of these things based on different environments. So just given your guidance positioning, I wanted to get your thoughts on how you think this plays out, and what are some of the challenges for it? Laurence D. Fink: This is a real difficult issue that I don\u2019t -- I think the SEC is going to have, be broad in how they think about this issue. I think it is appropriate as an industry that we identify the risk associated to liquidity of every product. I think there should be an appropriate measurement that it\u2019s consistent. And there should be probably different variants by product as how you think about liquidity. And I think it\u2019s important for our investors worldwide to have some form of measurement tool so they could access the liquidity risk associated with any one product. And then you could see if there is a sharp divergence between one fund and another in terms of liquidity. I think we learned that with the Third Avenue episode earlier, this late last year with their divergence and related to liquidity and their product. So to me that is a great example where you can -- if we had some form of measurement tool, the investors who invested in products like that or funds like that could have accessed, is it, am I getting the returns necessary to offset the illiquidity that is a component of that investment strategy. So we\u2019re pretty sympathetic to all these things. And the dilemma really arises for the SEC because, if there is some assessment of some sort of a large liquidity for every product, it really then will reduce investment dollars into the markets. It\u2019s going to put -- it will degrade returns for retail investors. The last thing you would want is, having retail investors having degradation in their returns because we are all going to be assessing some type of liquidity threshold. And then all the institutional managers will go to a separate account that may have only a 30 day redemption features. So, the last thing I want to do is hurt retail. So, I think a measurement tool of some sort is probably correct, beyond some type of a measurement tool of having some type of cash holding, I am kind of -- I don\u2019t have a hard fast opinion on that, but I do believe it represents some risk. And then I think there are different characteristics between liquidity of an ETF and liquidity of an open end fund. I think our application that is asked that they access and look at the characteristics differences between ETF and open end mutual funds. And we\u2019ve recommended to the SEC to develop a separate and comprehensive rule addressing those different investment product types and their associated risks. So, this is going to be addressed probably sometime in 2016. I think there\u2019s going to be quite a bit of time for a common period into discussion and we\u2019ll see where this goes. But I think this is -- we are in favor of this. I mean, the one thing is important especially in an environment where markets are really unpleasant like what we\u2019re experiencing now. One of the big issues is, whatever America is doing now with their big energy savings, are they investing for retirement? Are they sitting with more of their cash in cash? If we could have more and more investors feel comfortable that they could invest safely and soundly and they have a better understanding of the risk and characteristics of investing and understanding the liquidity of all the products. If that can then translate into more clients feeling good about investing for the outcome of the retirement, this is all good. So this is why we\u2019re in favor of this type of narrative and dialogue. Obviously we\u2019ll have opinions on how that will play out. Michael Carrier : Okay. Thanks for that. And then, Gary, just a quick follow-up on the expenses. The transaction cost, I know you said $23 million that\u2019s very clear. Just in terms of the normal seasonality, in terms of what you see in fourth quarter versus the first -- fourth versus the first; what's that normal like maybe drop off unlike the marketing spend just so we, you kind of understand and you guys do that every year meaning from the first to the fourth, but I just want to make sure we get that. And then, if the markets do remain volatile and pretty challenging, is there any way of guiding in terms of the expense base whether it\u2019s G&A or overall, what's more variable meaning you have more discretion there? Gary S. Shedlin: Yes, I mean, I wish I could give you a better answer than you\u2019re probably looking for here, Michael. But I think we obviously are, from an M&P standpoint we plan a spend level during the year. But frankly we react during the year and maintain appropriate flexibility to make sure that we can get the biggest bang for our dollar, and make sure that we\u2019re not simply spending money in a time period where we don\u2019t think people are going to be receptive to a lot of the messages. I think Larry, has talked about in volatility, a lot of investors basically may sit on the sidelines almost nothing you\u2019re going to tell them or communicate to them is really going to change their mind. So there is an element of kind of managing it real time, and we\u2019re going to continue to do that. So I can't really give you a whole lot of guidance there. But I think important in terms of thinking about broader margin trends. I know you\u2019re tired of hearing me say this, but we really aren\u2019t managing the business to a margin target either quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year. We are absolutely committed as part of our financial framework to growing and delivering operating leverage. And I think we\u2019ve shown you that we\u2019ve done that, right? I\u2019ll go back; I\u2019ve said this in my opening remarks. But we\u2019ve expanded the margin by 450 plus basis points since BGI. We\u2019ve reinvested probably $1 billion back into the business, and we\u2019re going to continue to commit to striking the right balance between strategic investments and managing our spent. It\u2019s a lot easier for everyone sitting around this table candidly to cut cost than it is to invest for growth, that\u2019s the hard part. And I think that the diversification of our model at the moment gives us the option to continue to invest through a market cycle when may others are maybe forced to pull back. But we\u2019re not going to be blind to that. I think the key is obviously kind of watching what's going on here and trying to determine at what point it really becomes more of a near-term item and more of a mid to long-term, and then obviously we\u2019ll react appropriately. Laurence D. Fink: But let me add one more thing. Our success in 2015 was directly related to the investments we made in the last few years. I think our differentiated business model has much to do with these investments, and we\u2019re going to -- I\u2019m not suggesting we have five or six investments in mind for 2016 or \u201917 or \u201918. But I do believe we have to have the mindset of growing revenues through investments. And however as we -- as you witnessed when shareholders in 2008 and \u201909 we managed expenses quite extraordinarily at times when you had to do that. So it\u2019s going to be a mix. But we do have a mindset of growing the business and that\u2019s the differentiating factor. As Gary said, it\u2019s a lot easier to just in cutting expenses or cutting headcount, it\u2019s a lot more bold to make the investments at the time when everybody is running away from investments and we\u2019ll continue to look at both. Michael Carrier : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from Luke Montgomery with Bernstein Research. Luke Montgomery : Good morning. Laurence D. Fink: Hi, Luke. Gary S. Shedlin: Good morning. Luke Montgomery : Thanks. So, organic base fee growth has been tracking steadily, and I think quite robustly at 6%. One of the key dynamics though is the fairly rapid growth of your core ETF theories and you\u2019ve been reducing fees there. I know you\u2019re targeting a different kind of investor with those products, but wondered whether you expect those products to eventually get enough liquidity that maybe they\u2019ll attract more institutional interest and whether you see that as a longer term challenge to maintaining the current level of organic base fee growth? Laurence D. Fink: Rob? Robert S. Kapito: So, we\u2019re going to respond to what we think investors\u2019 needs are and certainly for the retail or buy and hold customer. They\u2019re looking for the core series to get more specific allocations to the generic product, and we\u2019re going to respond and we\u2019ll respond as far as the fees go as well. But we see that continuing to grow as it gives the client much better access to that precision instrument that they\u2019re looking for. Institutions on the other hand, I think we\u2019ll see. We\u2019re seeing they\u2019re expressing first in the high yield, because they\u2019re yield hogs and they\u2019re looking for yield. But as we expand out the product set, I think they will be looking to invest in a core series as well. But I don\u2019t really think that\u2019s going to put pressure on our fees quite frankly because the institutional set looks differently at the ETF market than the buy and hold set. They\u2019re looking for liquidity. So it\u2019s important that we grow these particular products so they have the liquidity and they\u2019re willing to pay for the liquidity and access into those sectors. So it started out the global core series, which has been very successful for us this year, and we\u2019ve raised a significant amount of assets about $46 billion. I think that is going to expand institutionally. And we\u2019re going to also buffer that with other products that institutions are looking at to get that precision investment. Laurence D. Fink: And Luke, I might just add, just to put into perspective not withstanding the growth in core. Today iShares is a trillion one franchise and the aggregate of the core on a global basis is just -- is a little over $200 billion. So today it represents probably a little less than 20% of the overall business. And keep in mind that the average fee rate for our overall iShares business today is still in the low 30s with that 20% obviously reflecting in much lower fee rate. So it just gives you a sense of the fee rate is still in the overall book of business. Luke Montgomery : Okay. Thanks. And then as a follow-up, just touching on the leadership changes you made recently, I was hoping perhaps you could expand on the decision to combine leadership for active equity and scientific active equity, and if you anticipate whether that could have a meaningful effect on how you\u2019re seeking to managing active equity products? Laurence D. Fink: Yes, so there is less distinction between the active equity business than we were getting credit for. And the scientific active equity business, it\u2019s a business that we use signals, data and lot of quantitative screens for. And in the fundamental business we relied more upon our long-term views of the market, management, the product et cetera. And we find that, there is a tremendous amount of crossover between the two and overlap. And so rather than let, our own internal bureaucracy get in the way of the returns for the clients, we have these groups now working very closely together and understanding where the overlap is and utilizing that overlap to add additional alpha into the portfolios. So I think by having these two teams really merged together you\u2019ll see better results and better alpha from the active equity business. And it will be much less confusing to our clients as to when they come in. How we are driving alpha, and I think that will add to also increased interest in the BlackRock portfolio. And my goal is to make sure that we are considered a very formidable manager of active equities. So there will be no one that will have the span of equity products that we have across both the quantitative and the fundamental offerings. So yes, I\u2019m very excited about it, and I think having this group work together has already shown us some very good results, and this year our equity performance is better than it\u2019s ever been. So we\u2019re going to continue working on coming up with new ways in the market to hit alpha. So very, very positive on this change that we made. Luke Montgomery : Okay. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Laurence D. Fink: Good morning, Alex. Alexander Blostein : Hi. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to start with a question around capital management. It looks the dividend increase this quarter was maybe a little bit lower than what we\u2019ve seen in prior several years. Is that a reflection of just the markets being a little bit choppier? Is it the way you guys are kind of looking to cash flow stream over the next 12 months or just alternative uses of capital? And I guess within the same question, Gary your comments on a kind of flattish buyback but relative to value issuance of stock, I wonder if you could flush it out for us a little bit more. Gary S. Shedlin: Sure, Alex. So, on the dividend as you know our stated policies to target a 40% to 50% dividend payout ratio. That has migrated somewhere between 40% back in 2013 and about 44% last year. And based on what we know today, we think a 5% increase in the dividend is prudent and aligned with that philosophy. As it relates to the buyback, I think in the current market as I mentioned we continue to repurchase -- we are going to continue repurchasing stock in an amount no less than last year. However there\u2019s been a lot of market dislocation and we\u2019re certainly not trying to target or signal any type of beta call on this. But we will be watching the relative valuation of our stock to see if it\u2019s prudent for our shareholders to potential increase as markets evolve over the coming months. Alexander Blostein : Got it. And then, Larry \u2026 Laurence D. Fink: Alex, let me just add one more thing related to our dividend. I think in the volatile years especially if you look at some of the high paying dividend stocks today, I think you\u2019re going to see quite a few companies are going to have to lower their dividends. One of the histories of our platform, we never lowered our dividends ever even in the financial crisis. And so, to me it\u2019s about a discipline, it\u2019s a commitment. As Gary said, we are always committed of having a proposed dividend rate of somewhere between the 40% and 50% level. And we\u2019ve stuck to that level and we never had -- at some years we had it a little more elevated when we especially after the \u201908 crisis above that range. But we know obviously with the market turnaround and our business growth it became more normalized again. But importantly when we look at capital management, as Gary said, we do look at the combination of dividend and stock repurchases and I think we have quite a bit of flexibility in 2016. Alexander Blostein : Right. Understood. And then Larry, just a question for you on the Future\u2019s Advisor platform, and the two relationships that you managed, if you guys were able to lock in? Can you spend a minute I guess; on the type of services you\u2019ll be providing the economics of that business to BlackRock as a whole? And then, I guess, just more importantly the opportunity that you see for yourself in that market place? Laurence D. Fink: We\u2019re very pleasant, at least surprised how well our, the reception from our distribution partners were leaded to the desire of using Future Advisor. The business proposition is, the user technology, it is their name on the platform powered by BlackRock Solutions Future Advisor, not unlike how we use Aladdin. The business proposition is that uses technology on behalf -- to empower their advisors, ultimately to empower their clients with better digital information. Many of our products -- all the products are from our iShares platform. And we believe this will enhance our connectivity and the utilization of iShares to many of these platforms and that is the key business proposition. Probably the most encouraging thing I would not be surprised over the next coming months we announced a number of other licensing and an agreement. So it is very clear more than ever before, our distribution partners are in need of digital advice and they\u2019re looking for different ways of connecting with their clients. And we believe the combination of the Aladdin services that we can provide plus the digital advice through Future Advisor. No organization has that combination -- no organization has that combination. So it is actually allowing us to possibly expand our Aladdin business on top of the digital advice. But let me be clear, we are paid through the utilization of our products and possibly the licensing of Aladdin products. So it\u2019s -- but it sets us up to have deeper connectivity with our distribution partners and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do. Alexander Blostein : Yes. That makes sense. Thanks so much. Operator : Your final question comes from Bill Katz at Citi. Laurence D. Fink: Good morning, Bill. William Katz : Good morning, everyone. Maybe points of clarification, because a lot of my questions are already asked. Just on the relative valuation dynamic Gary, you had mentioned. Is that relative to your historical multiple or relative to the group, relative to the S&P? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense or sensitivity about what we should be watching for there? Gary S. Shedlin: Yes, yes and yes. William Katz : All right. Laurence D. Fink: That was a good question, Bill. Gary S. Shedlin: Yes, I mean we\u2019re -- again, as I said we\u2019re not trying to make -- it's not to me a call on whether beta is going to go up or down. It\u2019s a call as to whether or not we think the market is valuing our stock consistent with our growth. And I think that\u2019s -- I think consistency is incredibly important. We\u2019ve been buying the stock all the way up from the low 200s to where we are and we haven\u2019t been looking for moments of beta weakness and we\u2019re going to basically continue with that along and just, and be mindful if we see there is a disconnect. Laurence D. Fink: We have a lot of flexibility, Bill. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks? Laurence D. Fink: First of all I want to thank everybody. I felt the questions were quite good this morning and sorry that we didn\u2019t have time to reach everybody. But I\u2019m sure Gary and Tom will spend the time with all of you related to further questions. Our fourth quarter 2015 results reflect the strength in a differentiated business model. And I think hopefully this is what resonates with all of you. It is those investments we made. It is our ability to execute and manage expenses accordingly, grow accordingly, especially in these challenging business environments. We\u2019re going to continue to invest to meet the demands of our clients, to meet the demands of society and hopefully to deliver the long-term returns to our clients so they have a better future also. It is incredibly important in these vulnerable times that everybody, all of us focus on the long-term needs of our clients, not to short-term noise that we\u2019re experiencing everyday but focusing on outcomes for our investors. I do believe BlackRock is the firm that clients are looking for that outcome conversation. And I do believe we will have later dialogue with our clients in 2016 than we did in 2015. With that everyone, hopefully lets enjoy 2016 a little more, and lets hopefully we have -- we can enjoy our day to day job in a better environment. Have a good quarter.

My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated First Quarter 2016 Earnings Teleconference. Our hosts for today\u2019s call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink, Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin, President, Robert S. Kapito and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference. Christopher J. Meade: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019m Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock\u2019s actual results, may of course differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So, with that, let\u2019s begin. Gary S. Shedlin: Thanks, Chris and good morning everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to present results for the first quarter of 2016. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I\u2019ll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. As usual, I will be focusing primarily on as adjusted results. In the context of continued market challenges over the last 12 months including global equity markets down high single-digits, emerging markets and natural resources each down over 20%, and a continuation of a low and in many cases negative rate environment. The differentiation in strength of BlackRock\u2019s broad global investment platform enabled us to deliver another quarter of positive organic asset growth. While, we are not immune to market headwinds, consistent organic growth and prudent expensed business allowed us to deliver relatively stable base fees and increase margins from a year ago and continue to consistently return capital to shareholders. Our first quarter results highlights the value of the investments we\u2019ve made to assemble the industry\u2019s broadest offering of an active and indexed investment products, and to deliver differentiated customized investment solutions of our clients. The diversity of our platform positions us to serve our clients\u2019 needs in a variety of market environments, helping to drive consistent and differentiated organic growth. As we stated last quarter, we remain committed to investing in a number of strategic initiatives that will further enhance our client value proposition and generate long-term value for shareholders. Doing so requires us to be smarter at reallocating resources in challenging markets. With that in mind this quarter we undertook restructuring to streamline and simplify the organization. For the goal of efficiently optimizing growth, it will also create new opportunities for our strongest people. This resulted in a restructuring charge of $76 million during the quarter, primarily comprised of severance and accelerated amortization expense of previously granted deferred compensation awards or approximately 400 impacted employees. This charge appears as a single line expense item on our GAAP income statement and has been excluded from our as adjusted results. First quarter revenue of $2.6 billion was 4% lower than a year ago. While operating income of $1 billion was down 3%. Earnings per share of $4.25 declined more significantly versus the prior year quarter driven by a one-time non-operating gain in a lower effective tax rate a year ago. Non-operating results for the quarter reflected $8 million of net investment gains and decreased from the first quarter of 2015 due to lower marks in the current quarter and a $40 million one-time non-cash gain related to the acquisition of BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors in last year\u2019s first quarter. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 29.6% compared to 23.7% a year ago reflecting several favorable non-recurring items. We continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable projected tax rate for the remainder of 2016, though the effect of the actual tax rate may differ as a consequence of non-recurring items that could arise during the year. BlackRock\u2019s first quarter results reflected $36 billion long-term net inflows, representing an annualized organic growth rate of 3% and demonstrated the continued resilience of BlackRock\u2019s differentiated business model. Flows were positive across both active and indexed and across regions as positive momentum in March more than offset a slow start to the year. While organic based fee growth for the quarter was 2% lagging organic asset growth of strong fixed income flows were offset by outflows from higher fee equity products. Over the last 12 months BlackRock\u2019s organic based fee growth still remains above our long-term organic AUM growth. First quarter base fees were down 1% year-over-year as organic AUM growth of $118 billion over the last 12 months partially offset the impact of $148 billion of negative market and FX movement. Sequentially base fees were down 4% despite positive organic growth over the quarter as first quarter average AUM declined from fourth quarter level due to significant market declines in January and early February. Market improvements that occurred at the end quarter had a limited impact on first quarter base fees, but should act as a tailwind as we move into the second quarter. In a difficult period for the Hedge fund industry, with the HFRF index down 2% in the quarter, performance fees of $34 million decreased significantly from a year ago, driven by declines in fees associated with single strategy hedge funds, funded hedge funds and certain long only equity products. Underperformance during the first quarter may have a negative impact on performance fees for the full year as certain quarterly locking funds are below high watermarks, while others lock based on trailing 12 months performance periods. BlackRock\u2019s solutions revenue of $171 million was up 16% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Our Aladdin business which represented 82% of BRS revenue in the quarter grew 12% year-over-year driven by several sizable clients going live on the Aladdin platform in 2015. We continue to see strong market demand from institutional asset management and owners, as they look to consolidate global investment platforms and invest across multi-asset class portfolios. Additionally a rapidly changing regulatory and technology environment is driving accelerated conversations with retail intermediary about leveraging both Aladdin and the FutureAdvisor capabilities in the wealth management space. Non-Aladdin BRS revenue was up $9 million year-over-year although down $3 million sequentially due to completion of a number of assignments in last year's fourth quarter. Our Financial Markets Advisory business continues to reflect a more stable revenue profile driven by a higher level of repeat engagements and is well positioned to benefit to changes in the regulatory landscape affecting financial institutions and official sector clients worldwide. Other revenue was down $12 million year-over-year primarily due to lower earnings from equity method investment. Total expense decreased 4% year-over-year and 8% sequentially driven primarily by lower compensation and G&A expense. Employee compensation benefit expense was down $32 million or 3% year-over-year reflecting lower incentive compensation driven primarily by lower performance fees partially offset by a higher headcount. Sequentially compensation and benefit expense was down 4% reflecting lower incentive compensation, partially offset by higher employee payroll taxes and an increase in stock-based compensation expense related to grants of prior year awards. Looking forward, despite the first quarter restructuring and assuming stable markets, we currently anticipate ending the year with higher total headcount than we have today, but with a compensation to revenue ratio modestly lower than 2015. G&A expense was down 6% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower discretionary marketing and promotional spend and an increased benefit from the impact of foreign exchange re-measurement. Sequentially G&A expense decreased $92 million, primarily reflecting the seasonal and discretionary impact of lower marketing and promotional expense, reduced foreign exchange re-measurement expense and $23 million of deal related expense associated with strategic transactions executed in last year's fourth quarter. As discussed last quarter, we remain extremely expense aware in the current market environment, and we will continue to be prudent with our discretionary G&A spend. At present and again assuming stable markets, we currently anticipate full year 2016 G&A expense to be approximately in line with 2015 results. Our first quarter as adjusted operating margin of 41.6% was up 40 basis points year-over-year and flat sequentially. BlackRock\u2019s ability to generate positive year-over-year operating leverage in a negative beta environment highlights our commitment to prudently managing expense, while continuing to invest for future growth. We remain committed to using our cash flows to optimize shareholder value type first to be investing in our business and then returning excess cash to shareholders. In line with that commitment, we anticipate closing the Bank of America Global Capital Management transaction later this month, assuming investment management responsibilities for approximately $87 billion of related cash and liquidity AUM. We previously announced the 5% increase in our quarterly dividend to $2.29 per share of common stock and also repurchased an additional $300 million worth of shares in the first quarter. We saw an opportunity to modestly increase our level of share repurchases during the quarter as a sizable market moves and changes in the valid valuation of our stock in January and February created an attractive buying opportunity. We stand by the guidance we previously provided in last year\u2019s fourth quarter as it relates to share repurchases for the reminder of the year. First quarter long-term net inflows $36 billion reflected the diversity of our platform, those were positive and in active in index and across all regions. BlackRock\u2019s global retail franchised from minor long-term net outflows as positive flows in the United States were broadly offset by international outflows. BlackRock\u2019s U.S. retail business generated long-term net inflows of $1 billion. Demonstrating resilience to what was a challenging quarter for the domestic fund industry, with the U.S. actively mutual funds experiencing negative flows during the first quarter for the first time since the financial crisis. BlackRock\u2019s flows were driven by strong long-term investment performance across our fixed income platform, including flows into our total return, high yield and strategic municipal opportunities funds all of which are performing at a top quartile for the trailing five year period. International retail net outflows of $1 billion were primarily related to outflows in international equities and multi-asset funds, amid market uncertainty and industry-wide derisking. These flows were partially offset by inflows into our natural resources franchise which benefited from commodities re-risking during the quarter. Global iShares generated over $24 billion of net in the business from the first quarter representing 9% annualized organic growth at a record fixed income net inflows of $27 billion, partially offset by outflows from developed market equities. Our institutional business generated $12 billion from long-term net inflows in the first quarter, driven by higher fee active offerings. Institutional active net inflows of $11 billion represents the eight consecutive quarter of positive active flows for the business and reflected BlackRock\u2019s strong multi-asset capabilities and top-performing fixed income platforms. Multi-asset inflows reflected solutions-based findings particularly in the insurance outsourcing space and demand for our LifePath Target Date Funds. Fixed income net inflows were led by flows into investment grade strategies. Institutional active equity outflows of $2 billion reflected outflows in our fundamental equities business, partially offset by inflows into our scientific active equity business where 98% of assets are continuing to perform above benchmark on a trailing five year period. In addition, we had another strong fund raising quarter for illiquid alternatives, raising more than $1.5 billion in commitments and now have $12 billion in committed capital to deploy for clients. Illiquid alternatives remain a key area of growth for BlackRock as our institutional clients increasingly search for additional sources of income and uncorrelated returns. Institutional index of $1 billion of net flows are strong inflows into LDI strategies were partially offset by outflows from index equities. Overall, our first quarter results reflect the benefits in the investments we\u2019ve made to building differentiated global business model and our ability to effectively navigate expenses in a challenged beta environment. Diversification across investment style, distribution channel, products and geographies enables us to serve clients irrespective of the market environment or investment performance. We\u2019ll continue to be mindful of the trade-off between growth and margin looking to strike the right balance between investing in key strategic initiatives and optimizing expenses. Our goal remains to deliver consistent and differentiated organic AUM growth overtime. With that turn I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry. Laurence D. Fink: Thank you, Gary. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining the call. Our first quarter results demonstrates that BlackRock continues to earn our clients\u2019 trust in an uncertain market environments, as we manage risk and deliver investment solutions to achieve our clients\u2019 long-term investment goals. Economic, social and geopolitical instability drove dramatic market swing in the first quarter. Here is a global recession and the risk of Chinese currency devaluation drove stocks lower to start the year. Investors continue to struggle to digest lower energy prices, negative rate spreads in Europe and Japan, and uncertainty grew from political development country including the United States, Germany, Spain, Brazil and the pending vote in the UK on whether to lead the European Union. Cushing global markets down more than double-digit percentages in the opening weeks of the year. In February stabilizing commodity prices a more dovish commentary from the Federal Reserve helps spark a risk on rotation. Despite continued policy uncertainties and questions surrounding global growth. As Gary mentioned, given the fact that we earned fees on average AUM, we did not realize much of the financial benefit of the market upswing in the first quarter, while we\u2019re positioned to benefit from the tailwinds going into the second quarter. It is especially in times like this marked by volatility and investor uncertainty that more clients are looking to BlackRock for their investment guidance. Our goal is not to just sell them individual products, but rather to understand the client\u2019s objectives, their needs and to fashion a cohesive solution that helps achieve those goals. While many firms claim to do the same, no other asset manager draws on the same breadth of active index and alternative strategies. Investment styles across asset classes and regions, risk management and technology and focus on long-term solutions. These capabilities combined with the talent and fiduciary culture of the BlackRock team enables us to have a deeper conversation with the client. As they make important decisions around portfolio construction and asset allocation. This heightened level of client engagement is translating into consistent growth with $36 billion of long-term net new flows in the quarter representing 3% organic growth, driven by our strength in iShares and institutional active. The fact that we are again seeing such diverse inflows in this very volatile market, speaks to the power of our platform we\u2019ve built overtime. We consistently invested in the capabilities to meet the involving needs of our clients and we will continue to invest to helping our clients, so we could show future growth in the quarters to come. As clients increasingly look to ETFs as alternatives, the individual stocks and bonds, derivatives and mutual funds, we continue to grow our iShares business to meet their needs. Investors turn to iShares in the first quarter as they navigated tight volatility and our ETF business saw $24 billion of net flows. As was the case for the full year in 2015, BlackRock captured the number one market share of net new business globally in the United States and in Europe. And the number one market share in fixed income. Two global iShare priorities drove our inflows, first was fixed income. BlackRock has been building our fixed income ETF capabilities for several years. We now manage more than $290 billion in fixed income iShares, which as a standalone franchise would represent the fourth largest ETF there in the industry. After seeing $50 billion in fixed income inflows for the full year of 2015, this quarter we generated record quarterly net inflows of $27 billion. Risk-off sentiment initially drove demand for U.S. treasuries and as the market conditions improved client added to their U.S., European credit exposures. We see significant growth ahead for fixed income iShares, a widening range of clients are adopting fixed income iShares as diversified efficient investment tools and as substituted for cash and derivatives as bank balance sheets continue to be shrunk. Despite rapid growth fixed income ETFs currently only have one-tenth of the share of global bond market assets that equity ETF have in the global equity markets, offering a significant opportunity to increase the penetration in $100 trillion global fixed income market. The second priority is smart beta, BlackRock is investing in factors and factor products that we believe will become increasingly important as asset allocation tools and alternatives through traditional beta or lower outlook capture active strategies and BlackRock now manages more than $125 billion across a range of factor based solutions. Our iShares minimum volatility products raised nearly $7 billion globally in the quarter, leading the ETF industry\u2019s smart beta category and increasing our smart beta ETF AUM to $67 billion. Additionally, our newer single factors products have started to achieve scale at 5 billion and we are now bringing multi-factor iShares to market top complete our offering. In our institutional business, first quarter net inflows of $12 billion were driven by strong active fixed income and multi-asset flows. As the investments we made to diversify our institutional platform are generating results. As we strengthen the diversity of our institutional platform overtime, they are deepening our existing client relationships and more than 50% of BlackRock\u2019s largest institutional clients now have five or more products managed by BlackRock. For those who have been in our investors since 2009 when we did the BGI merger, we have talked about this in great detail as one of the merits of why we thought the merger would work. At that time, we had less than 20% of our clients having more than one product. And so one of the quarter results than why I truly believe our positioning, our penetration with our clients is through this metrics of how many products we have in terms of positioning ourselves with our clients, and once again I\u2019ll repeat it again because I am very proud of it, and that\u2019s more than 50% of our largest institutional clients have more than five or more products managed by BlackRock. We saw institutional active fixed income net inflows of nearly $11 billion driven by flows from financial institutional clients. As we further expand our relationships with these clients through our solution orient approach. BlackRock\u2019s financial institutional team continues to deliver differentiated investment strategy for these financial institutions, especially in this extended low and negative rate environment. In alternatives where we invested to strengthen the diversity and quality of our platform, we generated more than $1.5 billion of additional illiquid commitments. In the last several years, we have expanded our capabilities in our real estate platform, including infrastructure and real estate. Real estate, real assets especially infrastructure provide clients with the ability to achieve long-term financial goal, while helping to creating more fertile long-term investment environment. Hopefully by generating jobs and aligning the longer time of horizon afforded by greater longevity. BlackRock currently manages more than $30 billion in real assets across our global multi-products platform. BlackRock\u2019s solutions revenue grew 16% year-over-year led by Aladdin, our unifying technology platform. We are seeing growing demand from clients, as asset owners and managers our focusing on risk management. And they are now learning to utilize more risk management as they adapt to the regulatory changes. As the retail marketplace evolves, we are also seeing increasingly opportunities to provide our distribution partners with institutional quality asset allocation, risk management and digital advice capabilities. BlackRock is also intensifying our efforts to leverage the industry\u2019s most advanced technologies to enhance client service to build better investment products and portfolios and importantly to identify new and better sources of alpha. On the distribution side, FutureAdvisor, which operates within BlackRock Solutions allows us to strengthen relationships with our distribution partners by offering our clients high quality technology enabled advice backed by BlackRock\u2019s broad investment platform, our Aladdin risk analytics, our proprietary retirement technology and our longstanding experience as an enterprise technology partner to other financial institutions. We\u2019re seeing growing demand from our intermediary partners for BlackRock FutureAdvisor solution including our latest partnership we announced yesterday. On the investment side, BlackRock\u2019s investment team including our active equity, our model based fixed income and our multi-asset strategy teams continue to expand their use of technology based tools and research methodologies to produce investment insights that contribute to sustainable consistent alpha generation. These tools include things such as machine learning, natural language processing and scientific data visualization. In these challenging beta environments, our clients look to us more than ever to deliver the investment performance they need to meet their liabilities and their financial goals. We maintain a constant focus on enhancing alpha generation across our platform ended with a quarter with 89% of our fixed income, 97% of our scientific active equity and 52% of our fundamental active equity products above market or peer medium for the five year period. The investments that we\u2019re making to leverage technology across our platform are a part of BlackRock\u2019s focus on continuously solving our client\u2019s long-term challenges. As I discussed in my annual letter to shareholders earlier this week and a letter I sent in January to CEO\u2019s of companies we invest in on behalf of our clients. It is critical that companies focus their strategy on the long-term and clearly articulate their plans for long-term growth and in the context of the environment and the ecosystem in which they operate. Just as we continue to invest for the long run, we are constantly evaluating our ecosystem in which we operate, including the markets, regulatory environment, the competitive landscape to identify the changes that might require us to pivot our strategy. Last week the Department of Labor published their Fiduciary rule which has implications for our clients and our own business. While we\u2019re currently reviewing the final role to thoroughly assess its implications, we are likely to see changes in our distribution partners\u2019 accounts and fee structures, their product preferences and importantly their use of technology, to both build portfolios for clients at the manager increased risk and most importantly their compliance needs. BlackRock believes in the importance of always acting as a Fiduciary to our clients and doing so is one of the core principles that we founded our firm upon. BlackRock has also extensive experience with adapting and helping our clients adapt, to change in the regulatory environment most recently through RDR, method in Europe for leveraging this experience directly with our distribution partners. In the U.S. as we listen to and work with them to address the challenges and the opportunities as a DOL rule presents. This is another example where the combination of the breath and dept of BlackRock's investment platform, our global footprint and experience, our focus on technology and risk management solutions, and our strong fiduciary culture differentiates the value proposition that we can deliver to our clients. They have always embraced change and we will always be looking for ways to better serve our clients, to operate work efficiently, to focus resources on strategic priorities and to create new opportunities for our strongest employees. We began 2016 by enhancing our investment platform by increasing connectivity among our investors by aligning with the evolving needs of our clients and positioning talented investment leaders to drive our success and these changes are working well. Most recently, we initiated restructuring to streamline and simplify the organization driving efficiencies across our platform to better serve our clients, to deliver returns for our shareholders. It will also create opportunities for our strongest employees. Over the last three years, we have grown our employee base by more than 20%. We added 2,500 employees to support improvements in client service and technology and enhancing alpha generation. We remained committed to investing in our business to leverage the opportunities ahead of us to drive continue to growth despite current market volatility, doing so requires making smart and unfortunately difficult decisions about allocating resources which we must us always do. While the uncertain environment we face is unsettling at times, it is also an opportunity to look out in the future to capture new alpha generating opportunities, to use technology and innovating ways and to build on our platform to serve our clients\u2019 evolving needs, creates a continued opportunity for our employees to deliver consistent returns for our shareholders. Now let me open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instruction] Your first question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Dan Fannon : I guess Larry, you could expand on your DOL comments and maybe discuss in more detail what some of the changes or/and preferences that your distribution partners as you highlighted might be undertaking and maybe just kind of characterize how well prepared you think the industry is for these changes coming forth? Laurence D. Fink: Well let's start up with the contacts for a second. Well probably most importantly BlackRock has supported the changes to the financial ecosystem, if we can enhance confidence with investors, I believe through that mechanism is going to increase and promote more investing, less savings in their bank accounts. So the more investing and the more money clients are putting to work with greater confidence and then it's a benefit actually for the entire industry. And I think that\u2019s one of the big points that haven't been part of a dialog and I think that\u2019s a really important point. We need to have more investor confidence, I think one of the great problems we have with longevity, we in human agent process and importantly with the inability of so many people investing what I would call properly too much cash by their over emphasis in bonds. If they believe the DOL rules will give them better transparency, better certainty that we are treated like, and they invest more money for the long run. It's better for the country, it's better for their financial future and it's really very good for the entire industry. And I think that message is totally lost in the conversation. Directly to the issue around how this is going to play out, first of all, it's a very lengthy rule, it's going to take a quite some time for everyone to determine, how it meets their business model. But I would say to position BlackRock given the breath of our product platform in both active and index and the investments we made in technology and I really want to underscore technology and risk management. We are having really deep conversations with more of our distribution partners and helping them work on solutions for them and their clients. It's still too early to determine the outcome for the DOL rule more broadly, but I think we are as better positioned than any organization. I do believe it's going to require much greater compliance and risk management so it is very powerful for Aladdin platform. We believe it can be very powerful for our entire BlackRock solutions product suite, including FutureAdvisor and I think if it means more business than in passive we will be benefited, if it means more business in active we\u2019re going to be benefiting too, so I will just leave it at that and I actually have a happy general council with that answer. Sorry Chris. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Ken Worthington : So BlackRock has been in the press with the lay-offs indicated and also some of the hiring that you\u2019re pursuing and you mentioned in the prepared remarks asset or resource allocation changes. From a higher level perspective can you give us the sense of may be what\u2019s getting less and what\u2019s getting more in terms of resources. And in particular I\u2019m interested in the resource increases you\u2019re making to technology, what I think you highlighted in your letter to shareholders. So both as it relates to the how Aladdin is going to evolve, as well as how you\u2019re thinking about expanding other technology related services to clients? Laurence D. Fink: Yes let my allow Gary to answer that and then I\u2019ll give a little color after that. Gary S. Shedlin: Great, Ken thanks so much, so Ken I think as you started out as we stated last quarter, we\u2019re really, we are maintaining our commitment to investing in a variety of strategic initiatives that will further enhance our client value proposition and generate long-term value for shareholders. And obviously we\u2019re all mindful that in challenging markets as Larry and I both have said that we need to make tougher and smarter decisions especially when it comes to reallocating those invest dollars. And one thing I want to make very clear is this restruction was not about cost cutting, it was about streamlining and simplifying the organization so that we can use those savings to reinvest more efficiently in those strategic growth areas, and as mentioned also to create new stretch opportunities for our strongest people. It\u2019s important to understand that we\u2019re really not deemphasizing any particular business, rather I would say we\u2019re looking to ensure that the foundation of our businesses are really running it as efficiently as possible so we can take those reallocated resources and maximize our investment in the higher growth areas that you mentioned. I say there are probably four or five of those and I will let Larry and Rob in particular to chime in and many of those have been mentioned in some of the remarks today. Illiquid alternatives in particular the real asset platform which includes our infrastructure business factor based Larry mentioned over $125 billion there across smart beta and enhanced factor products. A sustainable investing where we have $200 billion across exclusionary screens, ESG factors and impact of that. Obviously continuing to invest in our iShares business which we believe continues to have significant runway in growth from both new users and importantly fixed income which Larry also mentioned in this comments. And then you mentioned technology as well and I think before that Larry comment the issue there on technology is it really impacts everything we do across the organization, it impacts how we invest in particular big data and alike scheme learning, language and alike that Larry mentioned which is importantly critically important for improvements in our active platform, as well as technology to enhance serving our clients whether it be to allow them for wealth FutureAdvisor and the others. So I think those are a number of the areas that we\u2019re really looking to make sure that we\u2019re continuing to see because we think there is incremental and differentiated growth available to us. Laurence D. Fink: I would just add one more point because I think Gary said it pretty clearly probably said it better than I could, that is can\u2019t underscore enough how the ecosystem is changing, that\u2019s going to require more of capital market participants of your insurance company or asset managers, they are going to -- the need for better risk management technology is slowly increasing. The need for better interfacing with clients is only going to be more and more important. And I do believe we have great solutions at BlackRock to help and assist these organizations in terms for them to raise their bar to be a stronger fiduciary towards our clients. And so we believe our Aladdin system, our FutureAdvisor product are going to be, we\u2019ll see even more accelerated growth, if we can handle the growth, but importantly also as we are -- we believe there is a great need to develop better information flows for better investment insights and so these are the areas where we are really emphasizing, where we are growing alongside the areas that Gary discussed. Operator : Your next question comes from Bill Katz with Citigroup. Bill Katz : You mentioned twice now of the focus on smart beta, can you just elaborate a little bit more on that, may be take us down level in terms of product geography and even pricing and then just anecdotally we have been hearing that some distributors have been anticipating invoking a rev share for ETFs so we are wondering if could comment on what you might be seeing there as well? Laurence D. Fink: Sure, I am going to let Rob talk about it. Robert S. Kapito: Well when there are you know when we have this type volatility people are looking to add alpha in other ways. And the smart beta category is one of these ways. We have made some very substantial hires in this area. We have hired the person that wrote the book in this area and this is Dr. Andrew Ang and he is the Head of our factor based strategies group and he is going to help us to grow our presence in this group and he has already had significant experience with some of our largest clients in the portfolio construction using a very established model based investment skill. And when we combine what he has done with the analytical power that we have with Aladdin, we think that we\u2019re able to offer some of the best solutions to our clients. So this is a way of breaking down the performance within an active category to areas that can provide that additional performance. Now we currently managed about 125 billion in these factor based strategies and within that about 150 billion is smart beta. So we think this is going to grow BlackRock\u2019s iShares, smart beta ETFs are leading the industry now with about 8.5 billion of net inflows in the first quarter, including about 7 billion into the iShares minimum volatility strategies. So these are in asset strategies that take advantage of various sectors and factors in the marketplace and additional value. So we\u2019re adding a lot of people in this category, adding a lot of technology. And we think that it\u2019s going to be a very good way a successful way for our active managers to add additional alpha. Laurence D. Fink: Bill to add one more point, you asked about geography. We\u2019ve had dialogues in probably every region in the world. The demand for information of connectivity and health related to this is beyond our imagination. It\u2019s from Asia to all throughout Europe, Middle East and all throughout the Americas. It is so much on the minds with our investors as a way of rethinking how they invest. I think this will become a larger component of the landscape of investing and investors are going to utilize us with separate accounts, they are going to utilize these types of products through ETFs. But the application and understanding the analysis is really shocking how much people are interested studying this and hopefully the enormity of our meetings is going to translate into future flows. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Michael Cyprys : Could you talk a little bit about how you see negative rates around the world impacting asset allocations and also touch upon how you\u2019re managing your bond funds and vehicles for negative rates and the opportunity set for BlackRock here in particular on the multi-asset front? Gary S. Shedlin: Well I did write quite a bit about it this week in my annual letter which is getting beyond what I thought sort of in terms of commentary by any publications worldwide. Well negative rates, if you think about 70% of our clients more, our pension funds, I was some form of retirement and insurance companies. We hear worldwide how negative interest rates or low interest rates have been impactful in how they are actually harming their objectives of attaining an asset base to meet their liability needs. In fact last week, we were with one of the largest New York State funds, a U.S. State funds, not in New York State funds, one of the largest U.S. State funds it happened to be in New York City after our meeting we had and they were in the top deciles of performance last year and because of lower negative interest rates and their discounting rate, they actually deteriorated their asset and liability gap. We\u2019re hearing this worldwide, we\u2019re hearing from savers worldwide they\u2019re not going to meet the needs of building their pool of savings to meet the needs of retirement. We\u2019re hearing some insurance companies that they\u2019re going to have a really hard time meeting their liabilities. And so as they are looking for more advice, importantly what we saw especially in the first six weeks of the year when you had major selling pressure in many components of the world. We saw huge insurance company interest in buying we saw widening of spreads, we talk about infrastructure if we could find large opportunities for infrastructure globally we have the demand, so clients are looking for more opportunities, they are looking to invest in different types of products. I believe our platform is giving us more connectivity with our clients. And I do believe this by shareholder, Larry stated, I believe a lower negative interest rates has served a great purpose in the short run. But I don\u2019t believe lower negative interest rate was supposed to be a permitted feature of the investment landscape. We are now entering the eighth year, and I believe that we are going to have a stronger more robust economy and the IMS has lowered their forecast even more, all right. I think the fifth time in a row we are going to need a policy of responses by governments. And I think the dependency on Central Bank behavior is one of the problems that we have in the world and we need policy of response by governments related to fiscal policy. Operator : Your next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : So just wanted to touch base quickly on, how much momentum you guys are seeing in some of the structural changes that you all have spoken in the past about as far as bond ETFs and allowing owners to treat them not just as equity but rather as fixed income? Are you guys seeing any momentum there, are you getting in-roads not only from the customer base but potential regulatory getting over potential regulatory hurdles, what's the outlook there? Gary S. Shedlin: So this is probably the largest growth area that we are experiencing right now and what we expect to experience going forward. I think it's actually quite incredible the amount of cash that\u2019s sitting in banks today, earning zero and that money has typically vanished from the fixed income market. And in order to have access to fixed income, our clients are using more and more ETFs because of all the features that they see which is the liquidity, the low cost, the tax efficiency and it's just easier access and this is where the money is going to flow first, and most people have more their money in fixed income than they do in equities anyway. So this has been the growth in the first quarter, we are set by having a wide variety of types of fixed income ETFs that they can invest in and we do see a lot more secondary trading that is going on in these. But we are seeing investment grade and high yield profit bond ETF assets under management grow from about 5 billion to 165 billion and that\u2019s from 2007 through 2015. And this is going to be a very strategic growth area for us and as Larry cited in his opening, we saw a record 27 billion of net inflows into the fixed income ETFs in the first quarter. So this is really, I think the big growth area. We have a very long-term history at BlackRock in fixed income, and we are using that historical background in the technology that we build to even enhance our reputation more in this business. Laurence D. Fink: I would just like to add one more thing. As ecosystem of bonds and secondary bonds and liquidity continues to be changing and we are seeing phase of more illiquidity. The utilization of ETFs has a mechanism to find liquidity and to have the ability to navigate the factors that impact valuations of fixed income whether that\u2019s duration or in subsidy or credit, a navigation with the utilization of ETFs is going to -- it enhances the opportunities for returns and so we believe as I said in my prepared remark, the utilization, the implementation of fixed income as a fixed income ETFs as a component of the fixed income strategy that clients are employing are going to be larger and larger in the coming years. Operator : Your next question is from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Craig Siegenthaler : So just on the back of the BRS FutureAdvisor win this week, I am just wondering if you can help us to think about the underlying economics for the business-to-business global advisor platform, and then also think about what type of products they will be using in this platform? Laurence D. Fink: I will let Gary answer that then I will spin a color for it later. Gary S. Shedlin: So there is a variety of different drivers of momentum behind this, Craig. We talked about technology is having increasingly a significant impact on the retail space. And obviously we are enhancing our technology for our retail clients. FutureAdvisor is just one, where we are foreseeing the digital, this type of a digital end, but we are also using and leveraging Aladdin to bring portfolio construction, and risk analytics tools to financial advisors as well as private bankers and we are doing that with a number of different areas of growth whether it be Aladdin portfolio or to the portfolio of construction services or Aladdin for wealth accordingly. And we are streamlining our sales process used with technology and to enhance yielding greater efficiency and effectiveness through doing that. FutureAdvisor in particular which as you know operates within BlackRock solutions allows us to strengthen relationships with our distribution partners by offering their clients high quality technology enabled device. And most importantly backed by BlackRock\u2019s broad investment platform or Aladdin risk analytics, our proprietary retirement technology and obviously our longstanding experience as enterprise technology partners to other financial institutions, I think that is probably the key differentiating factor for us at the moment because what we are noticing whether it\u2019s the commercial arrangement announced this week or some others that frankly we have signed but haven\u2019t publically announced. This looks like a very long-term and complicated implementation that frankly is exactly what we have been doing with Aladdin over the last couple of decades. And so while there are certain competitors I think we are trying to mimic or follow or in many cases replicate the type of strategies that we are doing here. The real difference is that we have been involved in client implementation very complex client implementations for a significant period of time and I think that is really going to be the differentiating factor. As it relate to the economics, the economic on these things are frankly very much customized in some aspects, there are platform fees, there are implementation fees, in some cases there are minimum fees, there will be underlying of management fees to the extent that the client chooses to either use our own model or populate those models with iShares. But importantly we are looking to customize it as much as we can to meet our intermediary partners\u2019 objectives, so we have signed which we haven\u2019t announced although we have signed four contracts. Already but we are in dialogue with many more without citing the number, name more institutions are interested. I think Gary, Craig said it very clearly think of this is an Aladdin implementation. Margins were quite low for the first during the implementation stage. In some cases there is as you know there was more expenses than revenues in the early year. And as it's being implemented then -- and the utilization and we have all the other service fees, it starts throwing off and generating depending on the utilization, we hope large fee increases. But more importantly we also believe having this linkage created a deeper connection with our clients and our distribution partners. So it's not just the singularity of having worked products through these types of channels, but it is also deeper more consistent connection with these clients. And so this is one of the reasons why we saw earlier than anyone related to the connectivity that digital advice can give for us with our distribution partners. And so we are very excited about it. I would also say that it\u2019s the desire, the demand, the interest, the request for presentations is far greater than we ever imagined. Operator : Your last question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Larry just may be if you can drew in on the define contribution business, you have I think about a 9% plus market share of that in organic growth which is very strong for you, and last year it was a 6% pace, maybe if you can elaborate on whether you think the Department of Labor rules longer term will accelerate the shift to DCIO and how do you think behaviors which means among planned sponsors and how you are positioning in the second half? Laurence D. Fink: Well, the first of all, we are just interpreting what the DOL have said related to DC and I am going to let Rob answer it. But more importantly it looks to us that you are not going to see rollovers as fast, and people are going to stay within their define contribution plan longer. So, this is an initial view, we are studying this more and more but obviously as you suggested DC is a very important component where we are and we believe we are well positioned, I am going to let Rob discuss. Robert S. Kapito: Yes, I think Larry said it there, I thing that the big issue with DC and you know that with a number one DCO by an industry of about 639 billion of assets under management. And what we are seeing is the increasing need for open architecture. So we are seeing the increasing need for indexed target date and also high performing active strategies and these are really trends that are driving the market share changes in the DC space. And that\u2019s why we have been building that infrastructure to try to meet that. And now once we get a better view of the changes on how does the DOL and in terms of these I think their ability to place into that infrastructure is very, very well, but how soon the movement of assets takes place is something that we are still trying to figure out and thus you know. Christopher J. Meade: So let me thank all of you for joining us this morning and for your continued interest in BlackRock. I think our first quarter results once again highlights the investments we made to enhance and differentiate BlackRock\u2019s diverse global platform. We\u2019re continuing to take a long-term view. We\u2019re trying to stay ahead of our clients\u2019 needs. We\u2019re trying to stay ahead of our competition. We\u2019re trying to navigate these near-term developments in the financial economic landscape, but we\u2019re doing this on behalf of our clients to making sure that we are providing them with a service that they require from us, a more volatile world it plays to our advantage that clients are looking for BlackRock by providing more information, by helping them navigate the complexity that we\u2019re living in a world of a low and negative interest rates. And we\u2019re trying to help them navigate the balance between investing in more illiquid products to achieve the yields and the returns that they need and the balance of how to build a better financial future for all our clients. I think we have done that in the first quarter and we\u2019re doing that again in the second quarter. Look forward to seeing and hearing from all of you at the end of the second quarter. Have a good April-May-June. Operator : Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock, Incorporated Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President; Robert S. Kapito, and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference. Christopher J. Meade: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may of course, differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC which list some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. BlackRock assumes no duty, and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So with that, let's begin. Gary S. Shedlin: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the second quarter of 2016. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as adjusted results. Clients are struggling to navigate an incredibly difficult investment landscape. Notwithstanding the recent market rally over the last 12 months, many global equity markets were down double-digits and interest rates touched historic lows worldwide. The current macro environment including negative yields in many jurisdictions, Brexit and U.S. election uncertainty is causing clients to defer investment decisions resulting in significant increases in global cash balances, lower active flows, and a shift from equity to fixed income assets. This environment is also resulting in lower revenue capture across the asset management industry. In times like this, growing and evolving our business are critically important, as client needs for our investment advice and risk management capabilities are greater than ever. BlackRock is having richer dialogues with clients than in any time in our history, and we are well-positioned for growth when client activity accelerates. Last month, at our 2016 Investor Day, we described how BlackRock is built for change. Our strong foundation drives consistent financial results and stable cash flows, enabling us to fund innovation and invest in new growth areas. This is critical to clients, especially during volatile times when other investment managers may be forced to pull back, and to shareholders, as we have an opportunity to win market share. During the second quarter, strength in our global investment platform and Aladdin risk management business, coupled with continued expense discipline enabled us to continue investing in our business despite market headwinds that impacted both base fees and performance fees on a year-over-year basis. Second quarter revenue of $2.8 billion was 3% lower than a year ago, while operating income of $1.2 billion was down 6%. Earnings per share of $4.78, was down 4% versus the prior year quarter. Non-operating results for the quarter reflected $14 million of net investment gains, primarily attributable to net gains on private equity and hedge fund related investments. Our as adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was 30.6%, compared to 30.1% a year ago. We continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable projected tax rate for the remainder of 2016, though the effective \u2013 the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of non-recurring items that could arise during the year. Second quarter long-term net inflows of $2 billion reflected $16 billion of net new business from iShares, offset by outflows in active strategies and institutional index mandates. Over the last 12 months, BlackRock delivered long-term net inflows of $126 billion representing 3% organic growth. Second quarter base fees were down 2% year-over-year despite generally flat average AUM, reflecting more than $250 billion in AUM mix change favoring lower fee fixed income and cash assets, including the impact of diversion equity beta. While the S&P 500 was down only 1% on average year-over-year, many markets linked to our higher fee equity products including emerging markets, Europe, Asia, natural resources and commodities experienced double-digit declines. Sequentially, base fees increased 6%, driven by higher average AUM following the market rally in March. More recent market volatility associated with Brexit had a minimal impact on second quarter base fees. While the operational implications of Brexit will evolve over the coming quarters, we are well-positioned versus the industry as a function of our globally diversified manufacturing, distribution and operating platform. Performance fees of $74 million decreased 46% versus a year ago, reflecting continuing performance challenges in the hedge fund industry generally, and the impact of high watermarks on certain funds specifically. The year-over-year decline was driven primarily by fees associated with hedge fund related and certain long only equity products. BlackRock solutions revenue of $172 million was up 7% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Our Aladdin business which represented 85% of BRS revenue in the quarter grew 13% year-over-year, driven by several sizeable clients going live on the Aladdin platform during the last year. We continue to see strong market demand from institutional asset managers, evidenced by the recent signing of one of our largest clients to date, which will be implemented over the next 18 to 24 months. As discussed at Investor Day, the rapidly changing regulatory and financial landscape is also driving accelerated conversations with retail intermediaries about leveraging Aladdin's value proposition in the wealth management space. Aladdin remains a key differentiator and a competitive advantage for BlackRock, enabling us to communicate more effectively and to serve clients more holistically and efficiently. Total expense decreased 2% year-over-year, driven primarily by lower compensation expense. Sequentially, total expense increased 3% driven primarily by higher compensation and AUM-related expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was down $31 million or 3% year-over-year reflecting lower incentive compensation. Sequentially, compensation and benefit expense increased $32 million or 3%, reflecting higher incentive compensation, driven by higher operating income and performance fees relative to the first quarter, partially offset by lower seasonal employer payroll taxes in the current quarter. Distribution and servicing costs increased 12% sequentially due to the acquisition of BofA Global Capital Management, and reduced money market fund fee waivers which have historically been shared by our distribution partners. G&A expense was essentially flat year-over-year and sequentially, reflecting continued expense discipline despite the impact of recent acquisitions on our run rate. As we mentioned last quarter and assuming stable markets, we still anticipate full year 2016 G&A expense to be roughly in line with 2015 levels. Our second quarter as adjusted operating margin of 43.9% was down 100 basis points year-over-year, but up 230 basis points sequentially primarily reflecting marginal impact of changes in base and performance fees and their respective time periods, coupled with G&A expense discipline. As we've stated in the past, we do not manage the business to a specific margin target. We do remain keenly focused on delivering long-term value to our shareholders, and will continue working to strike an appropriate balance between organically investing for future growth and practical discretionary expense management. We remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first reinvesting in our business, and then returning excess cash to shareholders. In line with that commitment, in the second quarter, we closed the acquisition of BofA Global Capital Management, assuming investment management responsibilities for approximately $81 billion of related cash and liquidity AUM, and leveraging the scale of our cash management franchise. During the second quarter, we also repurchased an additional $275 million worth of shares. Second quarter long-term net inflows of $2 billion were driven by the diversity of our platform. Importantly, we saw strength in strategic focus areas including fixed income ETFs, smart beta and factor products, and infrastructure offerings. Global iShares generated $16 billion of net new business in the second quarter, led by fixed income inflows of $10 billion. We continued to see investor appetite for risk aware smart beta products, with our minimum volatility funds raising more than $6 billion during the quarter, and maintaining the number one market share position in the product category. We also continue to see strong results in the Core Series, which is less sensitive to the macro environment raising $12 billion in net flows during the quarter. Throughout the quarter, investors once again used iShares at their preferred vehicle to navigate market volatility, and express rapidly changing investment views. Since the UK's decision to exit the EU, we have seen particular strength in our European iShares range across asset classes, capturing over 70% market share over the past several weeks, as clients leverage our industry-leading product breadth and liquidity. BlackRock's global retail franchise saw $6 billion of long-term net outflows in another challenging quarter for the industry, as both domestic and cross-border fund flows suffered in light of political and macro economic events. The global retail market is changing dramatically. DOL, RDR and MiFID are impacting the way wealth managers are serving clients. Digital and technology offerings are proliferating, and efficient beta products continue to take share from active products. While year-to-date industry, domestic, and cross-border active gross sales have slowed significantly due to macro uncertainty and continued offer performance, we are confident that the breadth of our retail platform including active and passive investment products, solutions, and portfolio construction tools, and digital and risk management capabilities collectively position BlackRock to be a market leader in this new environment. Our institutional business saw $8 billion of long-term net outflows, primarily due to active fixed income net outflows of $7 billion, driven largely by client reallocation activity. Despite volatility in EMEA, BlackRock continued to expand our presence with institutional clients in Continental Europe generating $8 billion in net inflows during the quarter, and illustrating that while many clients are taking a wait-and-see approach, BlackRock remains the partner of choice when they are prepared to invest. In the United States, our defined contribution business generated net inflows of approximately $4 billion, driven by LifePath and other target-date inflows, and now accounts for over $650 billion of assets under management. Finally, we saw positive flows in institutional illiquid alternatives driven by continued momentum in infrastructure. Illiquid alternatives remain a key area of growth for BlackRock, as institutional clients increasingly search for additional sources of income and uncorrelated returns. We now have more than $10 billion in committed but uninvested capital to deploy for clients. As we communicated at Investor Day, we are intensely focused on adapting ahead of change. While the current market environment is putting pressure on asset management companies and challenging historic business models, BlackRock has built the industry's broadest global product and distribution platform to meet the changing needs of our clients, and drive long-term value for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry. Laurence D. Fink: Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. As Gary mentioned, our clients are facing unprecedented challenges as they attempt to navigate the current investment environment which I'll describe in more detail in a moment. While this has caused many of our clients to pause their investment activity for the moment, it has also led to a more and deeper conversation with our clients than ever before. They are seeking our advice; they are looking for our investment solutions and are wanting the risk analytics and technology that BlackRock can uniquely offer. We are better positioned, I mean, we BlackRock, are better positioned than we've ever been to deliver the solutions they need. Political and macroeconomic uncertainty including Brexit, the upcoming elections in France and the United States, historically low yields and elevated market volatility, regulatory pressure including the DOL, Solvency II, these factors and others are leading clients of all types to pause, as they assess both their own needs and their investment options available for them. Our pension clients with 7%-plus return expectations are facing an ever-expanding liability gap. Our insurance clients with significant regulatory constraints cannot make their business models work in a zero yield environment. Sovereign wealth funds have been forced to focus on liquidity and funding needs after years of rapid growth, and individual savers are wrestling with a choice of too much risk versus too little return, as they face the prospects of their own underfunded retirement plans. Where can clients turn to address these challenges? Today, there's $10 trillion of sovereign bonds that are delivering negative returns and negative yields, yet central banks continue to be buying, and global derisking continues to bid up fixed income prices. Active equity managers as a group have underperformed over a multi-year period, and are seeking record out flows \u2013 or seeing record outflows. The blanket beta strategy that worked so well post-crisis has come to more volatility and divergence, and as Gary said as many European and Asian equity indexes have fallen year-to-date, even as the S&P is at a record level. Today, as the environment asset managers are operating, this is the operating model that we're seeing, and the environment we're seeing as an asset manager. Clients do not know what to do with their money. They are afraid and they are pulling back, as evidenced by more than $55 trillion in bank deposits sitting in the United States, China, and Japan alone. And even as markets have rallied recently, many clients have missed that upside, and find themselves feeling even further behind. In difficult times, our clients need BlackRock more than ever. We believe that asset managers must evolve in an anticipation of the fundamental shifts taking place in our industry, driven by technology, demographics, regulation, so that they are positioned to meet the clients' needs. And we, BlackRock, are doing that. As we highlight at our recent Investor Day, BlackRock is constantly adapting. The differentiating platform we have built at BlackRock over the past 28 years is resonating with our clients, and the diversity of product offerings, the risk capabilities of Aladdin, the market insights offered by the BlackRock Investment Institute, our clients will need to put their money to work. I can't predict when and how much, but when they do, I am confident that BlackRock has never been better positioned to capture those flows. Whether a client is looking for an illiquid alternative investment or an ETF, or an unconstrained fixed income strategy, or a smart beta or factor strategy, or a multi-asset income product, we can deliver that solution and many others. But most important is our ability to fashion solutions, from the combination of these strategies to meet the unique needs of our clients, all backed by our unmatched risk analytics and technology. And that is what's truly differentiating with BlackRock, and that is what is now resonating with our clients. As Gary mentioned, we saw $2 billion of long-term net inflows in the quarter. And over the last 12 months, we have seen $126 billion of long-term net inflows across our platform. These flows are well-diversified, with $12 billion in active and $114 billion in index, including $96 billion from clients in the U.S., $30 billion from international clients. We saw $39 billion and $85 billion in equity and fixed income net inflows, respectively, and we continue to generate strong client commitments in our rapidly growing illiquid alternative business. Since quarter end, after Brexit, we continue to see accelerated flows in our iShares franchise with approximately $18 billion of net inflows thus far in July, bringing our 2016 net inflows to more than $56 billion. iShares currently has the number one share of global and European ETFs and our fixed income ETF flows year-to-date. Let me talk about our fixed income flows. The fixed income iShares continued to be a substantial growth opportunity for BlackRock, and we saw more than $67 billion in net inflows over the past 12 months. For some of you, you may remember more than five years ago, some of our skeptics were still questioning the overall ETF growth story, and downplaying the fixed income opportunity. We were outspoken about our ability to innovate and to build this market. And today with a fixed income ETF industry reaching $600 billion in total AUM, and our own franchise is north of $300 billion, we are the proven leader in this space, and are focused on the continued penetration of the $100 trillion fixed income asset class. And just as we were doing five years ago, today we\u2019re investing to develop the solutions that will meet our clients needs in the future, including infrastructure, sustainable investing, big data, machine learning, factors, and smart beta, and also critically in technology, from our Aladdin franchise to our presence in digital wealth management with FutureAdvisor. Monetary policy has driven yields to record low levels while failing to stimulate economic growth, and there is significant need for our global fiscal policy response. Infrastructure investing will be critical component of that solution, creating jobs, driving growth, providing investors with long-term opportunities for yield. We are well-positioned to participate in that activity. Following another strong quarter of capital raising, BlackRock now manages more than $8 billion in invested and committed capital across our infrastructure platform. Whether in alternatives or across our active platform to continue to deliver alpha in the new market paradigm, you have to be connected. You need scale. You have to leverage technology, and of course, you have to be smart and nimble. BlackRock\u2019s Aladdin technology connects our global investor community on a common platform. The scale of our trading and liquidity platform enables us to access market liquidity that few firms can, and we further enhance that scale through the Bank of America Global Capital Management acquisition in the quarter. Our data expertise allows us to turn large, unstructured data sets into meaningful investment insights, and our risk and quantitative analysis teams provide independent oversight to help identify both risk and opportunities. The platform that we built is also a powerful means to recruit and retain industry\u2019s top talent. Most importantly, we announced that we hired Mark Wiseman to lead our unified active equity franchise. In the quarter, performance across our active platform remains stable or improved, with 80% in fixed income, 67% in fundamental equity, 82% in scientific active equity above their benchmark for peer medium for the last three year period. We\u2019re making significant investments in big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and we saw more than $1 billion in scientific active equity inflows in the quarter. Factor-based investment strategy it helps us bridge the gap between traditional active and index, and further fill out our offerings as clients increasingly look to achieve access to broad, persistent drivers of return through low cost efficient vehicles. During the quarter, our global iShares minimum volatility fund raised more than $6 billion leading the ETF industry smart beta category, and BlackRock now manages more than $140 billion in AUM across a range of factor-based strategies. Technology has always been a core component of our value proposition, and a significant differentiator for BlackRock. As the investment landscape evolves, technology is transitioning from a competitive advantage to a competitive requirement. Those that do not invest in technology will not be able to meet their clients\u2019 long-term needs. Technology remains a key area of focus and investment for BlackRock across all aspects of our business, to enhance our investment process, to enhance our client service, to create operational efficiencies, and our unifying BlackRock Aladdin technology platform. Aladdin revenues grew 13% year-over-year, and during the quarter. We saw one of the largest clients \u2013 we\u2019ve signed one of the largest clients to date. We expect Aladdin to continue to grow as we enhance capabilities, to meet clients\u2019 current and future needs. As we expand Aladdin to serve additional clients across the financial ecosystem, we are breaking down legacy systems to connect asset managers to asset servicers through provider Aladdin, and providing wealth management organizations with institutional quality risk oversight and analytics through our Aladdin for wealth platform. We also believe that the evolving technology and regulatory landscape including the new DOL rule in the U.S., digital advice will play an integral role in increasing access and transparency for investors. And we continue to see strong client interest in our FutureAdvisor platform, as clients look to new and innovative wealth management solutions. Clients not only turn to BlackRock to manage their assets, but also to help them understand the larger term impact of global events. The BlackRock Investment Institute leads that discussion. To help clients understand the immediate results of the Brexit vote, BII hosted two client calls the morning after the vote, with more than 10,000 participants worldwide. This level of engagement and participation is a testament to BlackRock\u2019s position in the industry, not only as an asset manager, but as a thought leader, and this allows us to be a greater trusted advisor. Going forward, we will continue to see changes. We\u2019ll see changes in markets, changes in technology, changes in demographics and regulation. This is all driving the changing needs of our clients, and we will continue to adapt our business to serve those needs in that ever-changing world. We are in a difficult environment for our clients and our industry, but challenging environments have always been when BlackRock has been able to make the biggest leaps forward. Today, many of our clients are apprehensive, and they are coming to us and asking us for advice. As I\u2019ve said, our client dialogues have never been better, and we have never been in a better position to serve our clients needs. That is why I have never seen in our 28-year history, more opportunity for BlackRock than I do today. Now let\u2019s open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Laurence D. Fink: Hi, Michael. Michael Carrier : Hi, Larry, how are you doing? Laurence D. Fink: Good. Michael Carrier : Larry, just a first question, I think everyone \u2013 when you look at BlackRock, and you look at all of the products that you guys offer and you\u2019ve proven it over time, in terms of the organic growth that you\u2019re able to generate. So this quarter, it\u2019s a bit surprising, but the backdrop has been anything but normal. But when you think about some of the comments that you made, particularly on the institutional side in terms of flows, you look at all of the cash on the sidelines, yet you look at where equity valuations are, where yields are, when you are talking to clients, is there a risk for the industry that we see a lot of money remaining on the sidelines for a period of time, just given the lack of opportunities? Or do you think that there\u2019s still enough \u2013 I don\u2019t know conversations or drive to allocate some of this cash into other solutions that can still generate some attractive returns? Laurence D. Fink: Sure. Well, first and foremost, clients want to put money to work. They\u2019re pausing, that\u2019s certainly true. I think we\u2019re seeing an anomaly right now. We\u2019re seeing \u2013 if you look at our ETF flows since Brexit, I would say the majority of those inflows are probably are institutional. Because at the same time, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re looking at the data, there\u2019s still outflows in mutual funds which tells you, obviously retail are still selling, but that the divergence is quite stark, and shocking to see that type of differential. The dialogues we\u2019re having with clients are, as I said as robust as possible. Some clients are looking to put money to work. The issue is some clients who have regulatory issues for capital issue, investing in bond yields at this time, it gets it more difficult. Some of them are looking to invest in dividend stocks. And so, I believe we\u2019re going to see more unlocking of money over the course of the next 12 months. I can\u2019t predict whether it\u2019s the third quarter, but I\u2019m particularly surprised at the sheer volume of inflows in iShares in the first 14 days of the month, which is public so I could talk about it. And the dialogue we\u2019re having institutional and we\u2019ve seen good flows in, and awards in alternatives already this quarter. So it is not as \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t call it to be as systematic and easy. It is more periodic and idiosyncratic depending on the clients needs. But this is a time for us to be in front of our clients more than ever before, as they are questioning their asset allocation, where should they put money, how should they think about it? And so, Michael, I can\u2019t predict one quarter over another. But what I can say, over a long period of time, there is huge pent-up demand, and I believe we will be more involved than ever before. I can\u2019t say that about the industry though. Operator : Your next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Laurence D. Fink: All right, Craig. Craig Siegenthaler : Hey, good morning, Larry. With rates now at zero, and actually more like negative across a decent, out of the spectrum, I\u2019d imagine there\u2019s a lot of pent-up demand for alternatives, infrastructure, et cetera. What\u2019s your thought on that? When are we going to see some more of this money move, and how is BlackRock positioned for that? Laurence D. Fink: Well, I think we\u2019ve been consistent in saying we\u2019re continuing to grow our illiquid alts business. I said, just from the last question, we have been awarded one or two mandates already this quarter in the alt space. I think across the board, we\u2019re well-positioned. It really depends on what category. You mentioned infrastructure. We have a huge emphasis in this. We are continuing to hire people there. We are in dialogue with many different parts of the world related to infrastructure investing. As we find those investments, it\u2019s very easy to find the capital. So as you know, we have a $30 billion real asset platform, $15 billion in fund to funds of private equity. We continue to see growth in private credit. We\u2019re well-positioned in some of these products. Other products, we are not as well positioned as others. But importantly, I could say with absolute confidence, the positioning we have in the alt space with our clients has never been more robust. And obviously, we are not as \u2013 in some of the platforms, we\u2019re not as strong, because it was not one of our core competencies 15 years ago, and we\u2019ve been building it. We did a \u2013 we have an institutional client survey. And in that survey, we did determine that 53% of our clients are going to be reallocating more into alts and real assets. So I think that feeds what you just asked. And so, we believe we\u2019re in a very good position for it. I would argue though, some of the asset classes, the reason why they have done poorly in the alternative space is, because there\u2019s so much money chasing this, so few investments. Gary S. Shedlin: Craig, just recall that when you look at the numbers that you see, it\u2019s a little complicated, because remember we\u2019ve got commitments coming in, that don\u2019t impact on net new business for the quarter. But we have return of capital going out that does impact our net new business for the quarter. So on a \u2013 if we kind of normalize for that, in terms of the institutional business for the quarter, we did see NNB we did see NMV before return-of-capital of about $825 million, let\u2019s call it $825 million again infrastructure pep in BAA that Larry mentioned. And we also did institutionally, another $700 million of commitments in the quarter. Again infrastructure opportunistic credit, NBAA that I think was critically important. Our total today is about $10 billion of uninvested, but committed capital. As you know, we\u2019ll hit NNB as the assets go in the ground. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Laurence D. Fink: Hey, Alex. Alex Blostein : Thanks. Hey, Larry. Good morning. So I was hoping to zone in a little bit more on the active fixed income business for you guys. I guess, A, just a little bit of color around the reallocation you highlighted in the second quarter, where there was a kind of one-off event. And then, just broadly given the negative yield dynamic that you burned off earlier, was just hoping you could comment on your unconstrained bond platform? Because it sounds like that\u2019s the product that could solve some of the issues? And the uptick has been good, but perhaps a little bit slower the last couple of quarters. So maybe you can comment on that as well? Thanks. Laurence D. Fink: Rob, why don\u2019t you \u2013 ? Robert S. Kapito: Yes, so let me give you a little bit of a deeper dive on the fixed income results for the quarter. So clients continue to search for a yield in a low rate environment. And in the quarter, we saw significant equity market volatility. So fixed income has remained the critical component of most client\u2019s portfolios. We continue to have very strong performance across our fixed income franchise, with 80% of assets above the benchmark or peer median for the three year period. iShares had $10 billion of fixed income net inflows, and that was driven by strong flows into investment grade corporates, broad U.S. or EM debt and TIPs. The fixed income ETF industry recently reached by the way, $600 billion in total AUM. And that\u2019s doubled over the past four years, and our own franchise is north of $300 billion. And we see significant opportunity to increase the penetration of the $100 trillion global fixed income market. Now to drill deeper, just on July 7, to give you an idea, LQD, which is our corporate bond fund, took in $1.1 billion of net inflows. And that was a record daily inflow for a corporate bond ETF. So on the retail side, the fixed income business continues to be strong, and it\u2019s led by total return, and it\u2019s also led by our strategic municipal offering. We saw $2 billion of net inflows into retail active fixed income. And on the institutional side, the active fixed income net outflows of $7 billion were driven primarily by client reallocation activity in Asia-Pac and in the U.S. And clients continue to come in and ask for presentations on strategic income opportunities. The reason being, giving the portfolio manager more tools, more ability to find different types of fixed income securities with lower risk, but higher returns in a low interest rate environment. So we believe that area of the market is going to continue to grow, as well as from the iShares fixed income side. Operator : Your next question is from Bill Katz with Citigroup. Bill Katz : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Just to switch gears a little bit. Big picture Larry, I guess, there\u2019s been some talk coming out of DC, about some building liquidity constraints, or requirements for mutual funds. I was wondering what you could share with us, or maybe what you\u2019re hearing, and what the implications might be across the business, if any? Laurence D. Fink: Well, I don't know much more. As we said in the last quarter, we are supportive of rules that enhanced investor protection. We are highly enthusiastic with roles that give more confidence to investors that they believe at a level playing field so they could invest. And if we can see that confidence build and unlock some of this huge cash holdings, we're in a very good position. So I want to put that into context of what is being proposed. We certainly don't know the end results of how liquidity is going to be addressed, the disclosures related to liquidity, we know in the proposed document that the SEC is looking at, different buckets how you analyze and risks they are going to set a limit to, the illiquid bucket of 15%. Overall, we have been very supportive of these rules and we believe there is a need for better disclosure related to the composition of all portfolios. As you know, we have been founded on a culture of understanding and managing the risks and importantly, it is rules like the liquidity rule or even the DOL rule that I believe some of the foundational reasons why we see accelerated interests and having a dialogue with us in a risk platform or risk technology for Aladdin. So I don't know much more than that Bill but we are a constructive participant in the dialogue with the SEC and we hope that we have that transparency in all the funds and understanding so people \u2013 investors can understand what are the embedded liquidity risks in these funds and we don't know how they are going to respond to the differentiation between a mutual fund and ETF or how they look at them differently. So we don't know enough and we will wait and see when they come out with a final common period, final proposal for another common period. Operator : Your next question comes from Eric Berg with RBC Capital Markets. Laurence D. Fink: Hi, Eric. Eric Berg : Thanks so much. Good morning. Given that there has been a decline in the quarter or a decline in the retail business but the iShare business in terms of your last 12 months organic growth remains as strong as ever. Is it possible here that what we're seeing is less a slowdown in the \u2013 in investor interest and more just a continued shifting of investor interest, not a slowdown in retail investor interest but just a continued shifting of investor preference from active to the iShares? Laurence D. Fink: Well, I think that that is a trend, that is a trend, but I think it's more than that. I think it is as I said, I think some of the great growth in the fixed income ETF platform is related to the illiquidity in some of the marketplaces \u2013 if people are looking for exposures, they can go buy an ETF for that type of exposures. But we believe the marketplace \u2013 like we do agree with the notion of what BWC has suggested, that ETFs are going to continue to grow, and maybe double in size. I think the big thing Eric, maybe a bigger issue is, we're seeing a redefinement of active.  As you heard, we're making our investments \u2013 our investments are our smart beta which is a form of active, it's not \u2013 we call it tethered active but it is a form of active. We are talking about using factors as analysis and our minimum volatility ETF is a great way of getting Active \u2013 some form of active returns through a ETF platform. So I think its technology using different instruments like ETFs. Like more importantly, I think preferences are changing so the old way of investing maybe just as in categories of market capitalization is certainly going to be changing. And so I think it's more than just a preference out of active into passive.  I am a big believer that active will play a role in the future, so let's be clear about it. We believe whether it is \u2013 alternative is an active product. We are a big believer that and in some categories like in Asian equities and components and European equities and in some areas in the U.S. equity market where active returns can and shall outperform it's over index. But I think what you're seeing also is a trend that iShares are taking some share away of people buying individual stocks.  That's one thing that I think \u2013 and maybe iShares is taking away from buying individual bonds. These are things that the dynamics that are changing, we are seeing more investors talk about asset allocation instead of individual stocks, and I think probably the most \u2013 more than I want to just allude to, obviously the last four months we've seen some really accelerated outflows, we, the industry, in active equities, I would not write it off over a long cycle and I would just give you a better perspective on BlackRock.  We had eight quarters in a row of positive flows. And so, I'm not \u2013 I don't know if this is a beginning of a trend, but we all should pay attention. But I do believe it is the technology of ETFs, the simplicity of ETFs, a quick, easy way of getting exposures is now driving more demand in those products, and we believe they will continue to drive demand. And as I said, we do believe the ETF business will double in size in the next five years. Operator : Your next question comes from Robert Lee with KBW. Robert Lee : Thanks. Good morning, Larry. Laurence D. Fink: Hey, how are you? Good morning. Robert Lee : Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to maybe talk a little bit about \u2013 go back to the DOL rule and a couple of things around that. I guess the first thing is, I mean it is \u2013 even though it's just kind of announced, it is a relatively short implementation or goes effective in next April which means I guess distributors have to decide soon how they're going to deal with it and what that means for you guys. So the first thing is, is there \u2013 do you have any better sense of how not so much in terms of more iShares demand but maybe from a cost or expense perspective, how you think this may flow back into BlackRock and your peers, in particular? How does distributor continue to demand kind of payment for access in a DOL world? And then maybe related to that, you did develop the Aladdin for Wealth Platform or adopted the Aladdin platform for the Wealth market; kind of curious to any update on how you're seeing the uptake on that or potential uptake on that platform in the Wealth Management market? Laurence D. Fink: So \u2013 really good question. I don't' have much better insight than probably you do at the moment. We are having constant conversation with all our distribution partners. There are some partners who believe the DOL will be revolutionary for their business and there are some of our distribution partners who believe it's evolutionary. It does mean change for the business, and I think we're very well positioned for those changes in the business. As I said it in our first quarter results that once again, if better understanding, better outcome for the ultimate investor which leads to more investable assets out of cash, that's all good for the ecosystem of our distribution partners and really good for the asset management industry. Two, I think it's most certainly as you raise the question related to Aladdin for Wealth; most certainly I think the DOL and the responsibilities under the DOL, it's going to need a much tighter risk management oversight culture with all the clients. And we are having robust dialogues with everybody on the uptake of Aladdin for Wealth, and we'll see how that plays out. I don't have anything tangible yet to say but I will say we are in very deep dialogue, and I am very optimistic that there will be uptake for Aladdin for Wealth. And I do believe, as I said, the DOL puts much more responsibility on the firm, on the financial adviser to act in a fiduciary way. There is a big dialogue \u2013 as we know that DOL is only about retirement assets, the big dialogue is does that force an upgrading of fiduciary standards for all the business that could be debated among different people. So I don't know what it means as outcome. I think the positive side \u2013 so I'm taking this in the long run a positive for most distribution partners. I think they will have \u2013 they have to obviously have much more oversight and understanding of the client asset as a fiduciary. But I do believe that they are going to have more centralization. I think they're going to have almost more like the European model where you have CIOs who determine which mutual funds, what platform. And as you know because we talked about the European experience now for at least eight years and one of our strong positioning in Europe with that CIO model. I believe the DOL rule will move the U.S. more to a CIO model. Obviously, we know it's going to move for those that are appropriate work to a advisory model instead of a commission-based model. And for those client that have that advisory relationship it builds a deeper relationship between the client and the distribution partner, and their advisor. And I believe because our scale, our positioning, we will be a huge beneficiary of that positioning. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Chris Harris : Hey, Larry. I want to come back to the interest rate discussion for a second. We know money-market funds have been waiving fees for some time now just because rates are so low. If medium- to long-term interest rates continue to decline, might bond funds have to start doing similar things? And if they might have to, are we getting close to having to worry about this risk? Laurence D. Fink: Well, if anything, we've had it in that 25 basis point increase in the United States, so actually money market funds in many cases are in a better position today than they were a year ago. You're seeing, as you suggested, a flattening of the yield curve. I actually don't believe, I mean, we saw the 10 year go down to as low as what, 1.35%, and we're at 1.47% right now at I last looked, 1.46%. The two year note is still trading at 66 basis points, or approximately around that area. If the U.S. goes down that path, and we're reversing that increase, and indeed the Federal Reserve needs to ease, that's a whole different issue.  I don't see that as an outcome at this moment. I believe the U.S. economy is growing \u2013 not as well as we want it to be, but I think we will see a 2% economy this year, which would tell \u2013 and we still have plus or minus, a 5% unemployment rate in this country. So despite all of the headwinds and uncertainties, I don't see at this time, a Federal Reserve that turns itself into a central bank that has to aggressively ease. And so, it may delay their path towards normalizing of interest rates, but I don't see any possibility at this moment that they will be forced to going back into an easing mode. I think the actions of the Bank of England today is another good example. Marketplace anticipated an easing. They suggested in their commentary, that they are going to possibly ease in August, and looking for more data. So if the UK growth rate does fall like we at BlackRock anticipate, it doesn't mean it falls worldwide. It moves around. And I would tell you very clearly, the U.S. economy is still, the area where people want to invest worldwide. And I don't see that \u2013 I don't see the atmosphere where I have to worry about money market funds in the United States any time soon. I think we're going to live in this environment of low rate for a long time though. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Laurence D. Fink: Hi, Michael. Michael Cyprys : Hey, good morning. Just a question on the illiquid strategies, an area of growth that you guys have been flagging here. Can you talk a little bit more about the private credit space, how you're building out that part of the business, and do you feel that you have all the pieces and parts, or would you look to buy anything? And then, if you could just also touch upon some of the demand trends that you see, especially in light of this low rate environment? Laurence D. Fink: Yes, so the private credit business is really one that is very customized, and very specific to the institutional investor, that is looking to find uncorrelated investments in the marketplace that you'd say are a little outside of the box. And we put together a very, very strong team, that has backgrounds in private equity, in venture capital, in credit, and using all of the resources that we have. And you can imagine across BlackRock, there are so many resources and so many types of transactions that we see, we never really had a pocket of money to take advantage of those opportunities. So putting this group together, we have been able to source transactions from all across the globe for these institutional clients, that while they're a little outside of the box, the risk tolerance fits very perfectly. The return profile in most of these cases is double-digit returns, and they are not correlated at all with various parts of the market to basically diversify their portfolios. So the other part of this, which is quite interesting, is that they come in very large sizes. So these institutions that are looking to invest here, are north of $1 billion type mandates. The struggle for many institutions in this, is to get the money invested. We haven't had a problem in finding the opportunities, we just never really went after them. So this is an area that we continue to add resources to. We continue to use and coordinate within the firm to source assets for this, and we\u2019re very optimistic. And quite frankly, when we\u2019re sitting down with a lot of the large institutions, this is exactly what they\u2019re looking for. And I might add, one of the things that we\u2019re going to have Mark Wiseman when he comes in, is also help us to source these assets. Because at his previous job, he is one of the guys that\u2019s in the forefront of the industry that has been able to source, and find these type of investments outside of the box. So they\u2019re very customized, long-term, very large mandates that require a significant team, significant resources. And we have it, and we\u2019re very optimistic on this in the future. Operator : And we have reached our allotted time for questions, and I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Fink for any closing remarks. Laurence D. Fink: Well, I really truly want to just say thank you for joining us, and your continued interest in BlackRock. I can promise you, we will continue to evolve our business to enhance the differentiating platform of BlackRock\u2019s diverse and global platform. I could also proudly tell you, that our dialogue with our clients have never been deeper, more robust, and when those opportunities prevail, we will be a component of their future allocations. Our relentless focus on always improving the Firm will drive that future growth, and we\u2019ll continue to create that long-term value for you as our shareholders, and I believe we\u2019re in a good position to do that. With that, have a good quarter. Hopefully, it will be a little less volatile in, the remainder of the quarter, but it started off as a really good quarter for BlackRock. Thanks. Have a good one. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference, and you may now disconnect.",

My name is Carmen, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock, Incorporated Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President; Robert S. Kapito, and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference. Christopher Meade : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may of course, differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC which list some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. BlackRock assumes no duty, and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So with that, I'll turn it over to Gary. Gary Shedlin : Thanks Chris and good morning everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the third quarter of 2016. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as adjusted results. Our clients are facing significant challenges driven by increased regulation, market volatility, record low interest rates and disruptive technology and that's a result the asset management industry is changing rapidly. During these times as we've done in the past, we reexamined our strategic priorities and evolved our business model with the goal of better serving the needs of our clients and optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible for our shareholders. Financial results for the third quarter of 2016 demonstrate the diversification and stability of our global investment and technology platform and our commitment to investing for the future. We executed on each of the three components of our framework for shareholder value creation in this quarter delivering organic growth, demonstrating operating leverage and systematically returning capital to our shareholders. Third quarter revenue of $2.8 billion was 3% lower than a year ago. However on a constant currency basis, we estimate that quarterly revenue was down approximately 1% year-over-year. Operating income of $1.2 billion declined 1% while earnings per share of $5.14 increased 3% versus the prior year quarter. Non-operating results for the quarter reflected $29 million of net investment gains, primarily attributable to net gain on un-hedged or partially hedged multi-asset and fixed income seed investments. Our as adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 29.7% reflecting the impact of several nonrecurring items. We continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable projected tax run rate for the fourth quarter of 2016, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring items that could arise in the future. BlackRock generated $55 billion of long-term net inflows in the third quarter, representing an annualized organic growth rate of 5%. Flows were positive in our active and index franchises and across asset classes and regions increasing the value of our broad-based diversified business model. Third quarter base fees of $2.5 billion were up 4% year-over-year driven primarily by organic growth, positive beta and higher securities lending revenue which was positively impacted by widening asset spreads resulting from a rise in short-term interest rates. Sequentially base fees were up 2%. While we continue to deliver strong growth, base fee growth has recently lagged growth and average assets under management as client appetite and portfolio construction decisions impact our business mix. In the current environment, client mixed shift has favored index over active, fixed income and cash over equities and government funds over prime funds in the money market space. While mix change amongst and within asset classes won't impact our blended fee rate over time, we remain confident that our diverse business model is capable of generating differentiated organic growth in a variety of market environments and our scale enables us to prudently manage expense and defend our operating margin. Performance fees of $58 million declined 72% versus a year ago, driven by our single strategy hedge fund platform. Recall that performance fees in last year's third quarter benefited from a single European hedge fund that delivered exceptional full-year performance. BlackRock solutions revenue of $174 million increased 4% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Our Aladdin business, which represented 87% of BRS revenue in the quarter up from 81% a year ago, grew to 13% year-over-year, driven by new clients and several sizable clients going live on the Aladdin platform over the last year. Strong market demand for Aladdin continues from institutional asset managers as well as retail intermediaries who are seeking sophisticated risk analytics and portfolio construction tools to better serve their wealth management clients in the current regulatory environment. Other revenue was down $16 million year-over-year, primarily related to lower transition management active in the current quarter. Total expense decreased 4% year-over-year and was flat sequentially, driven primarily by lower compensation expense. Employee compensation expense was down $56 million or 6% year-over-year, reflecting lower incentive compensation, primarily driven by lower performance fees versus a year ago. G&A expense decreased $7 million or 2% from a year ago and $4 million or 1% sequentially as we continue to exercise discipline over our discretionary spend in the current environment. At present we anticipate fourth quarter G&A expense to be moderately lower than last year's normalized levels after adjusting for $23 million of quarterly deal related costs incurred a year ago. Finally, distribution and servicing costs decreased 12% year-over-year and 5% sequentially, primarily related to the acquisition of BoA Global Capital Management in April of this year. Despite an overall decline in year-over-year revenues driven by a reduction in performance fees, we have delivered 3.5% organic growth over the last 12 months and expanded our as adjusted operating margin versus a year ago, evidencing our continued commitment to strike an appropriate balance between investing for future growth and practical discretionary expense management. In line with that commitment earlier this month, we reviewed prices on 15 U.S. iShares for ETFs and several actively managed U.S. bond funds. We chose to use our scale and leadership position to invest on behalf of clients and financial advisors as they adapt to the DOL's new fiduciary rule. In isolation, these price reductions will result in an estimated $85 million annualized revenue reduction for BlackRock, representing less than 1% of our total base fees. However over the mid-to-long term, we expect this investment to be accretive to organic growth and additives to overall shareholder value. During the third quarter, we continue to return excess cash to shareholders and we purchased an additional $275 million worth of BlackRock shares BlackRock generated $70 billion of total net inflows in the third quarter, including $55 billion of long-term net inflows and $15 billion of cash management and cash management inflows. Cash management inflows demonstrate the breath of our platform and strength of our client relationships in the lead up to U.S. money market reform. Since the beginning of the year, our platform has experienced a remarkable shift from prime to government funds. BlackRock is now the second largest 2A7 money fund provider in the United States and our diverse capabilities across set accounts, collective trusts and short duration products, position as well for continued future growth. Global iShares generated $51 billion of net inflows during the quarter, representing 18% annualized organic growth. Over the last 12 months, iShares has now generated over $140 billion in net inflows represent 15% organic growth. iShares equity inflows of $26 million for the quarter were driven by flows into U.S. and emerging markets as investors once again trying to iShares precision exposures at their preferred vehicle to de-risk following the Brexit vote. Importantly, our ETF product segmentation strategy, which tailored products to different client segments, continues to perform well. As an example, largest institutional clients who value liquidity and often use derivative strategies grew $6 billion of quarterly flows into EEM, our flagship iShares emerging markets financial instrument. Longer term investors who may be retail or institutional, but are more price sensitive added nearly $3 billion into IENG our iShares core emerging markets ETFs. Quarterly iShares fixed income inflows of $23 billion reflected ongoing adoption of ETFs as a means of rapidly accessing and investing in fixed income markets worldwide. Demand was particularly achieved in investment grade corporates and emerging markets as investors continue to search for services and higher yield. Our institutional client platform saw $6 billion of long-term net inflows during the quarter, driven by active net inflows of $8 billion as clients increasingly look to partner with Blackrock to build customized solutions or generate yield to meet their investment objectives. Inflows into multi-asset and solutions oriented strategies including our LifePath target-date series and active fixed income are partially offset by outflows from active equity. In addition we had another strong fund raising quarter for illiquid alternatives raising $1 million in new commitments. Illiquid alternatives remain a key area of growth for Blackrock as our institutional clients increasingly search for additional sources of income and uncorrelated returns. Blackrock's global retail franchise saw $2 billion of long-term net outflows, primarily due to outflows from equity and multi-asset funds in another challenging quarter for the active mutual fund industry. Outflows were concentrated in European and U.S. equities and world allocations strategies. Retail fixed income remained a pocket of strength with diversified flows across our top-performing platform including strong flows into emerging markets high yield, municipals and European and Asian fixed income. At September 30, 88% of taxable fixed income assets were at or above benchmark or peer medium for the trailing five year period. In particular our flagship total return fund continues to generate best-in-class performance and is performing in the top 5% of its peers for the trailing three and five year periods. Overall our third quarter results reflect the benefits of the investments we've made to build a diversified global business model. Diversification across investment style distribution channel, product and region, enables us to deliver differentiated organic growth in a variety of market environments while our scale allows us to make strategic investments, which deliver value for our clients and shareholders. With that I'll turn it over to Larry. Laurence Fink : Thanks Gary. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining the call. BlackRock's business model was built to thrive in all market environments and clients continue to trust Blackrock in an environment characterized by macroeconomic and political uncertainties, slow global growth and persistent low rates. In the third quarter even as industry-wide investor preferences continue to migrate from equities to fixed income and cash and away from active strategies the diversity of our platform drove nearly $70 billion of total net inflows. Our $55 billion of long-term net inflows was positive across both active and index strategies and across every asset class and every region. We're seeing ongoing divergence in global monetary policy. While the U.S. signals a slow path to tightening the U.K., Japan and other central banks continue with accommodative monetary policy, keeping yields at historical low levels and fueling widening asset liability gaps for both large institutions and also individual savers. As monetary policy reaches its limits in many regions, expansionary fiscal policy particularly in the form of infrastructure investments will be necessary to ignite economic growth. The lack of clarity around the outcomes of several upcoming political events including the path forward on Brexit, elections in the U.S. and the constitutional referendum in Italy is contributing to growing tail risk and investor caution. Despite underlying uncertainty, market volatility reached lows not seen since 1995 and equity markets rose in the quarter posting record highs in the United States and the United Kingdom. Many clients are turning to BlackRock to help them understand the risk at the intersection of policy, markets and economics as government actions continue to drive our markets. Both institutional and retail clients are increasingly utilizing Aladdin risk management technology and portfolio construction tools as well as turning the BlackRock for our insights as a thought leader. In the third quarter, the BlackRock Investment Institute hosted a call on the potential impact in financial markets on the upcoming U.S. election which had more than 1,000 participants. These differentiators and combined with our global active and indexed investment platform that Blackrock is built over time, enables us to have a deeper and more meaningful conversation with our clients and more than ever before client value BlackRock's diverse global business model. As Gary mentioned BlackRock generated $55 billion of long-term net inflows in the third quarter, representing a 5% organic asset growth and 5% organic based fee growth. The composition of our flow this quarter is representative of global market condition and investor sentiment. Across client segments, inflows were led by U.S. in emerging markets equities and debt as investors view the U.S. as a relatively safe haven and emerging markets have gained momentum as commodity prices stabilize. Meanwhile we saw outflows from European equities in the political and policy uncertainties both from the continent and the United Kingdom. Institutional investors are slowly regaining confidence and the third quarter was characterized by consistent diverse client flows rather than any one concentrated activity. Our institutional business saw $8 billion of active net inflows in the quarter driven by strong fixed income and multi-asset flows, primarily from defied contributions and insurance clients. Insurance clients face complex challenges as traditional asset allocation strategies are failing to support their business models. With expertise and understand the specific needs of insurance clients BlackRock's Financial Institution Group is putting the differentiated technology advantages on our Aladdin platform to work, constructing and delivering highly customized investment solutions, which incorporate both traditional and alternative asset classes across active and index strategies. Insurance companies are also increasingly employing fixed income ETFs in a broad range of applications. A recent study from Brennan's Associates found that ETF demand from insurers is likely to increase. Of insurance in the study -- insurers in the study, 52% of these companies expect to increase their use of fixed income ETFs in the next year and BlackRock is well-positioned to work with large insurers as our investment strategies and techniques evolve. Active fixed income flows from retail investors remain strong in the quarter at $5 billion, driven by flows in the high yield, emerging market data in Asia fixed income, again reflecting investors moving out of the risk curve in search of the income as a struggle with historical low rates. At the same time, retail investors continue to pull back from active equity investments driven by a combination of challenging long-term performance track records and also accelerating regulatory changes. 2016 U.S. active equity mutual funds has experienced more than $240 billion of year-to-date outflows. It's worth year-on record with more than $110 billion of outflows in the third quarter alone, the same time we've seen strong flows from this client segment across our iShares equity ETFs which I'll speak about in a moment. Regulatory changes having a material impact on the retail ecosystem the Department of Labor Fiduciary Rule RDR and MiFID are all impacting the way wealth managers serve their clients. We are likely to see a historical shift on how assets are being managed and invested as our distribution partners are changing both their product preferences and their use of technology to adapt to these rule changes. We've been working closely with our distribution partners in the U.S. in advance of the Department of Labor rule implementation. Aladdin for Wealth, our technology and risk management system designed specifically for wealth managers will be a key differentiator for BlackRock in helping our clients adapt, as financial advisors sharpen their focus on the quality and cost efficiencies of funds. We also expect that they will use ETF more and more at the center of their portfolios. Advisors are using ETF alongside high conviction active funds and also they're using ETF as an active tool to manage their client's assets. Throughout BlackRock's history, we've anticipated a series of changes in the ecosystem and have taken strategic actions to adapt. This has included combining our active and index strategies on one platform through the BGI acquisition in 2009, continuously enhancing our Aladdin risk and investment management technology. Launching the iShares core series in 2012 which exceeded our expectations by growing at an average organic asset growth rate at 24% since inception and most recently acquiring future advisor. Each of the strategic actions represent an investment to better serve our clients and to drive growth in our business. As our ecosystem evolve further, asset managers can no longer rely on data to subsidize investment spending. BlackRock's diversified business and his history of successful execution, allows us to continue to invest when other firms may not be able to, well using our balance sheet to see new products, streamlining the organization to reallocate investments to strategic initiatives, making tactical technology or product acquisitions or leveraging our scale to re-price product for our clients, we are committed to seeking out the most efficient ways to growing our business. Earlier this month we made a strategic investment in our U.S. iShare core ETFs reducing prices to meet our client's needs for high quality long-term holdings. In doing so, we are taking steps to be the leader in the core segment by providing clients with the best quality and value of any ETF sponsor and maybe iShares a clear ETF choice for financial advisors, building portfolios under the new fiduciary standard. We are maximizing the benefit of our scale to drive the maximum value for our clients and our shareholders and we expect to see increased organic asset and revenue growth in the iShares' core series over time. We also expect this investment to drive growth across our broader range of iShares precision exposures where clients play significant value and characteristics like liquidity and tax efficiency. And finally we expect this investment to drive growth across our active business as we deepen our relationships with all our distribution partners. Our early results have been strong. Since the re-pricing action just last week, our U.S. core market share of net flows have grown by 25 points to 59% and our iShares outside the core have also been logging strong flows. iShare saw $51 billion of net inflows in the third quarter and year-to-date I'm speaking as of yesterday, close to $100 billion of inflows in 2016. Fixed income iShares continue to be a substantial growth opportunity for BlackRock and we achieved a significant milestone in the quarter by reaching $100 billion in our European fixed income ETF AUM. iShares is a world-leading ETF provider holding the number one share of U.S. European and global equity and fixed income ETF flows year-to-date. Going forward in a lower beta environment, alpha generation has the opportunity to drive greater percentage of overall investor returns. BlackRock saw a positive active net inflows $4 billion in the third quarter. Active flows were driven by our leading global fixed income platform where we have scale, product and diversity and strong long-term performance with 88% of our assets above benchmark or peer medium for the five-year period. The combination of active and index strategies will continue to play an important role in our client's portfolio and BlackRock has all the components unlike our peers as well as portfolio construction capabilities, risk technology and better portfolios. I've emphasized the importance of technology many times today. Technology is an essential component of adapting to our regulatory changes and more broadly a changing investor landscape. As advisors take on greater portfolio construction responsibilities in a fee-based account they are increasingly using BlackRock solutions sophisticated tools and risk analytics to build better portfolios. As a result we are seeing strong interest for our Aladdin for wealth our I retire platform and our future advisor offerings. Institutional client facing persistent low rates and searching for yield require a deeper look into their entire portfolio and BlackRock's technology can help them see clear and allocate more effectively. Aladdin continues to build momentum with institutional clients, and revenues grew over 13% year-over-year. We are committed to constantly innovating on our existing platform as well as thinking of new ways that we can serve our clients' needs with technology. This remains a key differentiator for BlackRock relative to any other firm in the asset management industry. In a time of significant change for the asset management industry, I believe BlackRock is better positioned than in any time in our history, and we've never had more opportunity working with the clients than we do today. We are at a pivotal point with uncertainty in politics, regulation in market likely to play out over the coming months. Our clients are apprehensive, but they are coming to BlackRock for advice, and our priorities remain helping them to meet their investment goals in all environments. We have a unique ability to use our scale, our breadth of active and index products, our global reach and our portfolio construction, our risk management expertise and technology advantages to meet our clients' needs, their evolving needs to drive their future growth and our future growth as a firm and future growth for our shareholders. Now let's open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Hi, good morning everybody. Hi good morning. So first, maybe we'll just start off with a DOL question. It's been a couple of quarters, and I guess, the distribution networks and the platforms had a chance to kind of digest the rules. And Larry, you alluded to you guys are working closely with your distribution partners on helping them adapt to the changes. So, maybe a little bit more color from the perspective of what kind of changes are you anticipating? Obviously, we saw the announcement from Merrill and Edward Jones a couple of months ago. But more specifically, I guess, with respect to number of products, fee structures and any more granularity, I think, will be very helpful. Laurence Fink : I don't know that much more than what you just said. We witnessed the changes from Merrill Lynch and Edward Jones. It is very clear though, that the fiduciary rule is teaching how our distribution partners manage their clients' accounts, as you suggested and more stated by these public announcements, it's moving more to a fee-based relationship, less commission-based relationship. We also believe it's going to move more to a model-based relationship too where you're going to see the CIO offices of the various distribution platforms coming up with asset allocation strategies. We certainly believe that in the DOL rules, it's going to mean fees are going to be very important and that's obviously one thing we can say with certainty. We don't know how that's going to play out. But we do believe, as it moves more towards managed portfolios, utilizing more of the centralization of models and corporate and asset allocation, it's going to move quite a bit of money more towards passive strategies, utilization of ETFs. We do believe it'll systematically move assets away from active, and so we're trying to get prepared, but one thing we can say we're certainty in our conversations though, it leads to greater need of risk management tools. This is one of the reasons why we have adapted Aladdin, which, historically, was an enterprise system for large institutional investment organizations. While we now -- have now adopted for Aladdin for wealth that we could go down to individual accounts and allowing the adviser and the organization to look at every relationship they have through the lens of risk management. And we believe under the DOL rules, having that oversight is going to be imperative and this is one of the reasons why we developed this technology. We're in dialogues with many, many distribution partners already related to Aladdin for Wealth. We have signed up one institution already for Aladdin For Wealth. And we're in dialog with many more utilizing the Aladdin system for the navigation of their clients' investment strategies. So we look at this as a huge opportunity for us. We're in great position to navigate. I should add, I don't think any other organization has those capabilities and so it puts us in a great position. By having that position it allows us to have more dialog, not just more dialog for passive strategies but more dialog in portfolio construction and models and active strategies. So having this opportunity to be working with these institutions, on the navigation of risk management on behalf of all their individual clients, gives us -- will give us a unique opportunity to be working with these institutions in a way that we never had been able to before. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Laurence Fink : Hi Craig. Craig Siegenthaler : Hi Larry. Good morning everyone. Good morning, Gary. So I just wanted to follow up the last DOL question. I'm wondering, have you tried to size up the potential money that could be in motion U.S. retail? And you're seeing a lot of money in motion outside of U.S. retirement, which is supposed to be the focus of the DOL rule, so really in traditional brokerage? Laurence Fink : Let me give to Rob to answer. Robert Kapito : So we have found there is such a significant amount of cash that's on the sidelines because rates are so low and equities have not returned what people have expected that the money that is potentially in motion is probably the largest. We've done studies to show that globally there's 50 plus trillion that's sitting in cash. And I don't think anybody knows how big that can be relative to the size of the markets. So depending upon changes in interest rates and changes in equity volatility, a lot of that money can come into motion. So it's not only coming into areas of retirement. It's overall. And the studies that we show range anywhere from 38% to 60% of clients' portfolios are now sitting in cash. So we think that a lot of that money will start to move once people, once we get through the election and once we get through the next decision on where interest rates are going to be. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Dan Fannon : Thanks, good morning. Robert Kapito : Good morning. Dan Fannon : I guess just to follow up on the pricing changes. Can you discuss the process of kind of the product selection and how we can think about your active product portfolio and potential pricing changes going forward to be more competitive as you highlighted in the DOL rule? Robert Kapito : So that's a very large question. So first of all, on the ETF side, this is a strategic investment that we're making in the future growth of BlackRock. So where we focused and reduced our prices were in the U.S. iShares core ETF and that was to meet specific demand by [indiscernible] one of the high-quality. They're long-term holders and a lot of them will be purchasing these either directly or through models because of what you have just mentioned with Larry in the DOL opportunity. We want to be a leader in this segment, in the core segment. We want to provide the clients with the best quality and value of any ETF sponsor and making sure that iShares is the clear ETF choice for financial advisers that are looking to build their portfolios under the new fiduciary standard. Now when we talk about that in particular, 90% of our iShares, we have not changed the price on. This is really targeted at this specific segment that is very fee-sensitive. And as Larry mentioned in his opening remarks, we know that people like the brand. And now price is becoming in that segment something that's very important to be included in the models and focused on. So we responded directly to our clients in that specific segment. When it comes to the mutual funds, we have a pretty large array of mutual funds. We have lowered the pricing in some of our bond fund platform. We have 23 funds there. We took a look and we wanted to make sure that especially in this low interest rate environment, we are being responsive to our clients and our adjustments were in 14 of those funds, eight taxable and six municipals, which is about $23 billion in assets and we want to make sure that we continue to be top quartile manger, but also top quartile as far as expenses. So, we are watching what clients need in this environment and we are responding the specific segment that they were requiring us to. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Laurence Fink : Hey, Brian Brian Bedell : Hi. How are you doing? Laurence Fink : Good. Brian Bedell : Great. Just want to circle back on DOL maybe sort of the tempo of the changes that we'll be seeing over the next couple of quarters with implementation happening largely before April. And do you sense advisors are ready to make these changes right now from mutual fund to ETF, or do you think they really still in preparation mode in terms of those education and then understanding allocation better. Maybe you can link that in with Aladdin for wealth, distraction with your distribution partners and whether you think Larry how this going to develop around sort of robo platforms? Thanks. Laurence Fink : Well, I think everybody still at wait and see attitude and yes we haven't seen they are doing incredible amount of preparation for this. I don\u2019t think anyone wants to get ahead of this. This is one who have -- they have to make serious changes to the relationship with their FAs and their clients, they don\u2019t want to be at competitive disadvantage with their FAs, one for another. So I think you are going to see a lot of [Kabuki] in which lot of people are going to be shadow dancing until they have to come up with the strategy. But I do -- behind the scenes, all are looking at many of the different possible outcomes could be a slow transition to more, what I would say managed portfolios or it's going to be sudden. I am under the view that the changes are going to be more rapid. I think most of my team believe those changes are going to be more evolutionary. And so I think there is even a debate here at BlackRock related to how these changes are going to be. But I do believe the legal responsibilities -- the legal responsibilities of each firm has under the DOL is going to probably move towards these changes. But let me be clear these are not our decisions; these are our distribution partner's decisions, each firm has to do whatever is the right strategy for them, under the new rules and new laws on behalf of the client. So and I am sure they're all going to be working on behalf of their client, I'm not trying to suggest they are focusing on their own specific needs. What we are trying to do with our scale and our platform and the ability to have a dialog using our active and passive strategy, but more importantly introducing a lot in for wealth we are helping our distribution platform to focus on what should they be doing in towards their implementation in the new DOL rule. I do believe one thing will be it's going to be constant though the need for more risk tools they are going to be imperative to making sure that there is better oversight to protecting the firm making sure they are living under the new DOL rules. I do believe you are going to see as you saw from Merlin, Edward Jones more managed accounts, but the key question that you asked Brian in the composition of the managed accounts, how little portfolio allocation be? Quite frankly we heard a whole ray of that I do believe overall cycle is going to be a much greater utilization in a passive strategies in ETF than active strategies, and I think that's where it's going. So, we believe because of our positioning Aladdin for Wealth and because of our ability to work with our distribution platforms and the utilization of beta and active strategies, we're in a very good position and that's how we're trying to position. Let me be clear. That's not our decision. We're responding to the ecosystem changes of our distribution partners. And we're trying to be additive. We have to be a partner with them. And what I can say is, at this time, we're in extensive dialogues with these institutions in terms of how they navigate it, and we believe we'll be able to play a role in their ultimate outcomes. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hi there. Laurence Fink : Good morning. Glenn Schorr : Good morning. Maybe a quick follow-up. On this front, I don't -- I agree with you. I don't think anyone has done more or has more to offer the distributors than BlackRock. But at its core, the offshoot of all this, I think is distribution is harder to come by. There's tighter rules around it and distributors lose some revenues along the way. And the likely reaction is to ask for more from their asset management partners, whether it be commissions, revenue share, marketing support payments. So I'm curious if you agree with that comment that asset managers in general will be need to pay more to access the key distribution channels? Robert Kapito : Yes, I think that's going to be pretty obvious going forward. When you have periods like this, everybody goes to their vendors, distributors and ask for some sort of big concessions. So with the DoL rule, certainly, there's more to be pressure on all of the vendors and all the expenses that people have. So for us, I don't think it means less distribution. I just think it means more efficient distribution and that pricing is going to be an issue. I expect that we, as a firm, are going to go to our vendors as well and expect some fee concessions. And then also as a company, we have to watch our own expenses. And I think you've seen that over the last couple of quarters that we're making sure that we're much more efficient. And there I feel very confident for our future, and this is because of our technology, we can be much more efficient than any other asset managers out there. So I think you're right on the mark. This is going to be a very good for the clients. And we have found in the history of BlackRock, when it's good for the clients, it's also good for us. Laurence Fink : Let me just echo that. I think it's very important. If clients believe they have a fair opportunity to be in the market to build a better financial future for themselves, if they believe the Department of Labor rules gives them that security that people are working on their behalves, and they put more money to work and keep getting, moving money out of all this cash into bank deposits into the financial markets, we will be the best-positioned firm for that. So we welcome these changes. We welcome better, a better environment to allow our clients a just and fair and being involved in the global capital markets to help their financial future. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Bill Katz with Citi. Laurence Fink : Good morning Bill. I think we lost Bill. Operator : Bill you line is open. Please go ahead with you question. Bill Katz : I was wondering if you could talk on the cash management side for a moment just in terms of now we have new rules in place, a lot of money motion coming into that. Can you talk a little bit about where you think the products ultimately land and the kind of pricing associated with that? Laurence Fink : Well, Bill, we saw leading up to the October ruling, about a $1 trillion of money moving. I think this has been underreported, but $1 trillion of money has moved from prime funds to government funds. This is an incredible amount of money by one government change. I mean this is one of the great examples where government actions can truly change an ecosystem. And so we saw this huge movement out of prime funds to government funds. We were very well positioned to accommodate our clients on that. We saw about $60 billion in our own prime funds going into government funds, but the key thing for us was we actually picked up little more than 1% market share in these events and we had $15 billion in net inflows. We look at the money market fund industry as a great business. Obviously, we are earning lower fees in government funds than we did in the prime funds. And I think that's obviously a circumstance that everybody will be facing. But I do believe as clients feel more comfortable and as they navigate with their risk committees the whole idea of what is a prime fund, I think you will see money eventually move back into prime, not the same -- not the whole $1 trillion but I think as clients understand what prime funds are and that they can pick up more return with quite a bit less risk than they ever would have had in a prime fund because prime funds rules have changed quite considerably, too. How we report our NAV, how we report our positioning -- our position. So they're far less risky than they were in the 2000 to 2007 and 2008 environment. So I do believe it's going to take some time as clients become a little bit more circumspect about the difference of the two funds. In many cases, they're going to have to go to their risk committees to get a change because the fact that there is no certainty about a dollar NAV, some clients just can't do it unless they changed their rules. We are working with many clients right now on that, helping clients understand the trade-offs, but the knee-jerk reaction was very clear. People did not have time to focus on how to work with risk committee in terms of getting these changes. But I do believe, over time, clients will do that. We are working once again, this is one of the great characteristics of BlackRock. We have worked with our clients and helping them assess those types of risks and the opportunities. But clearly, from our opinion, when you start seeing changes in central bank behavior, when you start seeing widening credit spreads, the advantage of a prime fund versus a government fund may be quite large enough, which will accelerate more people seeking the differences and getting the changes from their boards, risk committee boards, and being able to invest their liquidity in a prime fund even without the constant dollar NAV. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So first, just a follow-up on Gary's point on the price cuts and the core ETFs being long-term accretive. Maybe, is there a time line or AUM threshold that allows you to cross into that accretion level? And then more broadly speaking, could you help us think about the profitability trade-off within BlackRock, right? Because generally, most folks agree that you'll gain share in your iShares and likely fixed income business but see pressure in Active Equity. And so is there a growth ratio in the AUM in between that iShares business and the Active Equity business that we could think about that represents a DMZ or breakeven line? Because I'm sure it's not just about revenue growth. It seems more complicated than that. Thanks a lot. Laurence Fink : Sure, Brennan. So it's -- I would think it's there's a lot going on. I mean, we've literally spent the last five of the first six questions around change that's basically drive -- being driven by regulatory change and a whole host of other things in terms of the current environment. And I think that we look at the business in its totality more broadly. We're not really looking at a product-by-product analysis and a breakeven on a product-by-product analysis. It's really about the diversification and the breadth of the entire platform and how all of the products fit together at the end of the day into a set of solutions for the clients. We're constantly making decisions in the best interest of the clients and we're trying to basically bring forth the benefits of the platform, whether its breadth, its globality, or its scale to basically drive better outcomes for clients and at the end of the day, better outcomes for our shareholders. So while we are mindful when we talk about see a radically breakevens, which look you can calculate those as well, you know what the change in the fees are and can basically do the math, to see how quickly we can capture the incremental revenue. It\u2019s really much more importantly about balancing everything that the firm has offer -- our top ten manager and active top ten manager and possibly top ten manager in ops are all wrapped up with the differentiation of a laden and the technology platform, really to drive a much more comprehensive set of solutions ultimately for the clients and to leverage the scale not only on behalf of those clients but also on the behalf of our shareholders at the end of the day. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Laurence Fink : Good morning. Michael Cyprys : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to shift gears a little bit and can you just talk a little bit about seed capital how are you deploying that today versus say one to two years ago? And just given some of the limited resources that you in the industry have on seed capital just curious how are you thinking about maximizing that value and what are you prioritizing today? Laurence Fink : So our seed capital portfolio today is in excess of $1 billion. We continue to grow that as we think about our commitment to invest in the business first, that\u2019s a significant part of our store leveraging, our goal is stability of our cash flow to invest in products that we think are going to drive again better outcomes for our clients and growth in the future. I would say that we do believe that -- if you look where we are receiving money, it\u2019s basically again today significantly more on multi asset, significantly more on fixed income trying to be smarter around cash solutions that may basically change in future. Obviously, our liquid business which fits the formal co-invest that appose to what we call seed. But we are really trying to basically think two, three years down the road to trying figure out where the new blockbuster opportunities are, in a way that can really differentiate the strengths that we have obviously factors, smart-data in terms of our style advantaged products and the like we are also giving a lot of seed capital. We really want to try and leverage again back to scale and stability. You know we think that we can seed in significantly larger amounts than the potentially our competitors as a function of our very stable cash flow which is in access of $3.5 billion a year. And we think our ability to seed more frequently and in larger scale, allows us to show greater commitments of the product and reduce to time to market in a way that allows us to leverage market opportunity significantly quicker. Operator : The next question is from a line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Laurence Fink : Good morning, Michael. Michael Carrier : Good morning, thanks guys. Larry we spend a decent amount of time on DOL, I just wanted to shift over to some of the SEC proposals when we got the liquidity rule? and then also in Europe MiFID II just wanted to get your updated thoughts any I guess hurdles that you see for BlackRock and the industry, I know some EPS got exemptions on the liquidity rule, but just your thoughts on the liquidity rule and then also on where MiFID II is headed? Laurence Fink : Well this is consistent math and we consider everything else we see with some of the regulatory changes. If the regulatory changes and had clients really needs to invest where big beneficiary of it. So we have been very supportive over the rules that has this investor protection. We had circumstances earlier past few years related to liquidity and the impact of some of the mutual funds where there had be -- that would be frozen. Obviously it hurts all industry, it raises questions of uncertainty. So the SEC try to find a solution. I think it found a pretty good solution under the circumstances. I also do believe we welcome the SECs role in this. We think the SEC needs to a play a larger role and hope ensure the sanctity of the capital markets as more and more money moves to this capital markets, the need for safety and the capital markets always increase. So we work very closely with the all regulators in Europe related to MiFID and MiFID II and we are -- we work very closely -- we provided comment letter. I can\u2019t. So we work closely -- that would be a little bit probably the wrong way of putting it, but we provided our input in helping the regulatory agencies to come up with their solution. We believe MiFID II liquidity rules of the SEC, as I said earlier is going to lead for greater needs for risk management tools. And clearly, if we have rules like liquidity rule, as I said, it increases the need for risk management, which is pointing up to BlackRock's strength. We built this organization technology with all these things in mind, making sure that we focus on the protection of our clients. I don't think it changes that much in terms of investment management behaviors in terms of how we invest. We have never been on the edge of investing in illiquid products in our 40 products or use products. And so it doesn't change our behaviors at BlackRock at all. It may change some investors' behaviors. Obviously, some of who were emphasizing very illiquid buckets in their platform. But both we're MiFID II is going, where the liquidity risk rules are going with the SEC, these are just a work in progress. I believe we are going to see more and more regulatory oversight of our capital markets, ensuring that we have the proper safeguards for investors to invest. And then that's critical. I can't say enough about the need to making sure we have the proper safeguards. If we have the proper safeguards, all of the money that Rob Kapito was talking about sitting in the sidelines would be implemented. I don't believe that people are sitting there because they're just worried about the next event. A lot of people just don't feel like investing has been that fair to them. And by putting these rules in place, it allows more retail investors to feel that they are protected. They have more safety. And through that safety, they probably have a little bit more security, which probably will lead to greater investing into the capital markets. And we'll all be benefited by it. The -- but the details related to the SEC liquidity rules; obviously, it's a 1,000 page rule. It's going to take our lawyers and every lawyer a long time to make sure we understand of all the intricacies of how we're going to implement it and how we're going to manage it. It is very clear, and I brief reading it means a lot more risk management needs, making sure that you can live under these new liquidity rules day to day and abide by them. So it requires greater risk tools, which we have. Even about a year ago, we added a lot of liquidity components to the Aladdin risk models to helping our portfolio managers navigate this. And then in terms of MiFID, this is going to take time working with European regulators. This is scheduled for 2018. So we do have some time before it's implemented. And hopefully we'll have better clarity on making sure that we're living up under these new rules. So as I think I've said earlier all of this will lead for the asset management industry probably a greater need for reliance on risk tools, which will lead for some of the asset managers a greater expenses to build those tools. I think I'm losing my voice now. So I'll end it there. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks? Laurence Fink : Yes, please. I think our third quarter results once again highlights the benefits of our scale. It certainly benefits why you need diverse -- diversity of product and also I think it also speaks quite loudly why you need a global platform. And I think BlackRock has that platform of scale, diversity of products and global nature. I would say probably the biggest theme that I could think about in terms of the third quarter was we're seeing an impact on the strategic investments we made in our platform over the last few years. I think it is because of those investments we made, the investments we made from BGI acquisition, the investments we made in the Core Series in 2012, the investments we made in our infrastructure products, our ESG products, our investments now in Big Data and factors, our investment now in technology related to Aladdin, Aladdin for wealth, our investment in FutureAdvisor, I believe it all speaks loudly that we're staying ahead of the needs of our clients, trying to anticipate the needs. And I do believe the third quarter, when you think about how we handle this adversity of the markets, that we've been able to position ourselves quite well in this environment. I could certainly say again these investments we made and the investments we're going to continue to make, it's allowing us to have a deeper, broader relationship with our clients in retail and a deeper and broader relationship with the client institutionally. We need to continue to stay ahead of our clients' needs or we're not going to provide the service to our clients. So that's the paranoia that BlackRock possesses, staying in front of our clients' needs and trying to respond to our clients needs. And I think that is the key characteristic and the key differentiator that has positioned BlackRock so well in the past and why I think it's going to be a key characteristic, why we're so well positioned for our future. With that, I want to thank everybody for joining us this morning and your continued interest in BlackRock. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

Meade - General Counsel Analysts : Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Bill Katz - Citi Ken Worthington - JP Morgan Michael Cyprys - Morgan Stanley Robert Lee - KBW Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Michael Carrier - Bank of America Operator : Good morning. My name is Brent, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today\u2019s call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President; Robert S. Kapito, and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference. Christopher J. Meade: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019m Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock\u2019s actual results may of course differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC which list some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. BlackRock assumes no duty, and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Gary. Gary S. Shedlin: Thanks, Chris. Good morning and happy New Year to everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to present results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I\u2019ll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses, both GAAP and as adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on as adjusted results. The differentiation and strength of BlackRock\u2019s diverse global investment and technology platform allowed us to continue to invest for growth during 2016 despite market volatility and macro-political uncertainty during the year. We saw strong results in our iShares, institutional and technology businesses and remain committed to investing in a variety of strategic initiatives that will further enhance our client proposition and generate long-term value for shareholders. Against a challenging backdrop for the asset management industry, BlackRock once again executed on each components of our framework for shareholder value creation. BlackRock generated $202 billion of total net inflows in 2016, the strongest flows in our history including nearly $100 billion in the fourth quarter. We expanded our full year operating margin by 80 basis points to 43.7%. Finally, after investing for growth, we returned approximately $2.7 billion of capital to shareholders during the year. In the fourth quarter, BlackRock generated operating income of $1.2 billion and earnings per share of $5.14, both up 8% from a year ago. Full year operating income of $4.7 billion was flat versus a year ago while earnings per share of $19.29 was down 2%, reflecting lower non-operating income and a higher tax rate in 2016. Non-operating results for the quarter included $6 million of net investment gains. Recall that non-operating results in last year\u2019s fourth quarter included $35 million unrealized gain on a strategic private equity investment. Our as adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 28.6%, reflecting the impact of several non-recurring items compared to a rate of 30% a year ago. We continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable projected tax run rate for 2017, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of non-recurring or discrete items and potential tax reform. In an environment where growth in the asset management industry has been elusive, BlackRock\u2019s diverse global platform is thriving, delivering outcomes for our clients and differentiated organic growth for our shareholders. BlackRock\u2019s fourth quarter total net inflows of $98 billion included $88 billion of long-term net inflows, representing an annualized organic asset growth rate of 7%, $18 billion of flows into our cash management business and $7 billion of advisory outflows related to crisis era portfolio liquidation assignments. For the full year 2016, BlackRock generated record total net inflows of $202 billion including long-term net inflows of $181 billion, representing a 4% long-term organic growth rate. Fourth quarter base fees of $2.5 billion were up 1% year-over-year, driven by higher average AUM but offset by the impact of divergent beta, FX, and mix shift. For the full year, base fees were effectively flat. On a constant currency basis, base fees were up 3% versus last year\u2019s fourth and 2% for the full year 2016. Sequentially, base fees were down 2% as the negative impact of fixed income data, divergent equity beta and continued DoLlar appreciation more than offset organic fee growth in the period. While we delivered robust organic asset growth during the year, our blended fee rate has been impacted by a number of factors that we have repeatedly discussed with you, including divergent equity beta and DoLlar appreciation as well as recent client preferences for lower risk asset classes and index over active strategies. However, while these headwinds are pervasive in our industry, our broad based solutions focused investment platform is built to meet client preferences in any environment, whether risk on or risk off, and we remain confident that BlackRock can consistently grow client assets and base fees, both of which ended 2016 at record highs. Fourth quarter performance fees of a $129 million were driven by our single strategy hedge fund and long-only equity products. Full year performance fees of $295 million decreased 52% from 2015, reflecting a challenging year for the hedge fund industry. BlackRock Solutions fourth quarter revenue of $197 million was up 15% year-over-year and 13% sequentially. Full year Aladdin revenue of $594 million, which represented 83% of BlackRock Solutions revenue, was 13% year-over-year driven by a number of sizeable clients going live on the Aladdin platform in 2016. Aladdin is coming off a record year in terms of new client revenue and continues to benefit from strong market demand from both institutional asset managers as well as retail intermediaries. We\u2019ve seen particularly high levels of demand for our newest product, Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management in a current regulatory environment and are actively implementing for clients in the United States, Europe and Asia. Total expense declined 3% in 2016, reflecting lower compensation expense and continued G&A expense discipline. For the full year, compensation expense decreased $122 million or 3%, reflecting lower incentive compensation, primarily driven by lower performance fees. Recall that year-over-year comparisons of fourth quarter compensation expense are less relevant because we determine compensation on a full year basis. Fourth quarter G&A expense decreased $55 million year-over-year or 13%, reflecting lower marketing and promotional spend in the current quarter and $23 million of deal related expense associated with strategic transactions executed in the year ago quarter. Sequentially, fourth quarter G&A expense increased $43 million, primarily reflected a planned uptick in the year-end marketing and promotional spend, and higher foreign exchange remeasurement expense. Full year G&A expense of $1.3 billion was 6% below 2015 levels, despite the impact of acquisitions on our run rate, reflecting expense awareness in the volatile market environment. Assuming stable markets, we would expect a modestly higher level of G&A expense in 2017. Despite an overall decline in 2016 revenues driven by a reduction in performance fees, we delivered 4% organic asset growth over the last 12 months and expanded our as adjusted operating margin to 43.7% for the year. While we remain committed to realizing the benefits of our scale for clients and shareholders alike, we do not manage the business to a specific margin target either quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year. We do remain keenly focused on striking an appropriate balance between investing for future growth and practical discretionary expense management. During 2016, we returned approximately $2.7 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. As we enter 2017, we remain committed to a predictable and balanced approach to capital management. Consistent with this, our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $2.50 a share, representing an increase of 9% over the prior level. Since instituting our dividend in 2003, BlackRock has grown its annual dividend per share at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 21%. We repurchased approximately $1.1 billion of shares in 2016 and now have repurchased over 13 million shares during the last four years, resulting in a 13% unlevered compounded annual return for our shareholders. We remain committed to returning excess cash flow to shareholders and anticipate a similar annual level of share repurchases in 2017. However, such amounts could vary based on potential changes to the relative valuation of our stock price. In connection with this ongoing commitment, our Board has authorized an additional 6 million shares under our existing share repurchase program, giving us authorization to repurchase a total of 9 million shares including 3 million shares which are remaining under our prior program, announced in January 2015. Our 2016 financial results reflected benefits of our differentiated global business model. Record full year total net inflows of $202 billion including nearly $100 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter were diversified across asset classes and benefitted from significant flows into iShares as both institutional and retail clients use ETFs for core investments, precision exposures and financial instruments. Global iShares generated $49 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter and a record $140 billion for the year, representing full year organic growth of 13%. Fourth quarter equity iShares inflows of $51 billion were driven by demand for U.S. market exposures as equity markets rallied following the U.S. elections. Notwithstanding flat fourth quarter fixed income iShares flows, which were impacted by the significant move in long-term yields during the quarter, we continue to see an acceleration in the adoption of fixed income ETFs. Full year 2016\u2019s fixed income iShares in flows of $60 billion represented an organic growth rate of 24%. BlackRock\u2019s institutional franchise saw record long-term net inflows of $41 billion for the quarter and $51 billion for the year, positive across active and index strategies for both periods. Quarterly institutional active inflows of $6 billion were led by fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives as clients utilized BlackRock\u2019s broad range of investment strategies and customized solutions to achieve their investment goals. Institutional index inflows of $35 billion in the fourth quarter were driven by fixed income inflows of $26 billion which reflected solutions based LDI activity, primarily in Europe. We also ended 2016 with another strong fundraising quarter for illiquid alternatives, raising more than $1 billion in new commitments. Over the last four years, we\u2019ve raised more than $22 billion in commitments for our fund of funds, real estate, infrastructure, opportunistic credit, and all solutions businesses and have nearly $11 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients. Blackrock\u2019s global retail franchise saw fourth quarter outflows $2 billion and full year outflows of $11 billion, reflecting continued performance challenges in the active mutual fund industry as well as macro, political and regulatory uncertainty. Finally, BlackRock\u2019s cash business generated $18 billion and $29 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. Investments we\u2019ve made to expand the scale of our cash management offerings drove strong flows in 2016 and we\u2019re well-positioned for additional demand and market share gains in the coming year. In the summary, in a year marked by periods of market volatility, divergent beta and significant currency movements, our diversified business model once again delivered industry-leading organic growth and consistent financial results that allowed us to continue investing for the future. We are committed to continuously evolving our platform as our clients\u2019 needs change and believe our platform is well-positioned as it\u2019s ever been to meet those needs and to deliver long term value for our shareholders. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry. Laurence D. Fink: Thanks Gary. Happy New Year, everyone, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. In the year dominated by extraordinary macro and geopolitical uncertainty, BlackRock continues to earn our clients\u2019 trust by delivering strong results. BlackRock\u2019s fourth quarter and 2016 results reflect the benefits of continuously investing in our business to better serve our clients. We\u2019re building out our investment teams and resources, we\u2019re expanding our technology footprint and we\u2019re evolving our risk management capabilities as we continue to anticipate change in the world, in our economies and most importantly, in our industry. As a result, more and more investors are turning to BlackRock to design, to deliver investment solutions that will help them achieve their long term financial goals. 2016 was a turbulent year for investors, whether institutions or individual investors, one that no one fully predicted. Global political events like Brexit, the U.S. political -- U.S. presidential election and the Italian referendum have forced many of our clients and also our self to rethink our assumptions and our perceptions of the world. Even with some political surprises, the global economy began to show signs of optimism throughout 2016. The U.S. equity market surged to all-time high as expectations for fiscal stimulus, reflation, and tax and regulatory reform has sparked investor optimism and enthusiasm. The Fed\u2019s decision to raise rates in December and the signal of additional hikes in 2017 suggest that the long period of accommodative monitory policy in the U.S. may finally subside at a faster rate that many have had anticipated. However, uncertainty and the wave of populism upending the political status quo persist. And despite the rally in U.S. for domestic equities since we\u2019ve had our U.S. election, many of our investors are seeing a very different performance in their other markets. As Gary suggested, we see negative fixed income markets. We see underperforming international equities and a very strong DoLlar, which means for the DoLlar based investors with broad global asset allocation such as pension funds, the fourth quarter was more challenging than the market perception. We don\u2019t know exactly how the next two years will unfold but we do know that in a challenging and changing environment, investors will look to BlackRock more than ever before. And our responsibility that we feel for our clients has never been greater. Throughout our history, BlackRock has always been focused on thinking ahead of our clients and repositioning our firm in advance of those perceived changes. Our results this year in a difficult environment for asset managers reflect the benefits of our deeper relationships that we\u2019ve built with our clients worldwide in areas where we\u2019ve invested in our business over time. As Gary said, BlackRock saw total net inflows of $202 billion for the full year of 2016, including nearly a $100 billion in our fourth quarter. We generated record annual institutional and iShares flow of $51 billion institutionally and $140 billion in iShares. We actually grew net assets in 15 countries greater than $1 billion. We had more than 53 products in retail and iShares that generated more than $1 billion in net inflows. I think those two statistics alone identify the breadth of our platform. In 2016, the BlackRock Investment Institute reached more clients, regulators and policy makers than ever before, providing a forum for deep, timely and relevant dialog on all macro issues. The institute hosted calls after Brexit and the U.S. election, each time reaching nearly 5,000 external participants. This type of engagement has created tremendous value for our clients and built a deeper and more direct relationship with our clients. We acquired BGI and iShares franchise more than six years ago when iShares had $385 billion in AUM. Since then, we invested in the future of ETFs, building the market, expanding its presence, building a fixed income presence, a global presence, building products in anticipation of change of demand, whether its factors or smart beta and launched innovative news. We\u2019ve grown our iShares AUM now to $1.3 trillion as more clients than ever before are using ETFs for transparent, liquid and efficient exposures, and we will continue and very aggressively in the growth and evolution of this market. iShares generated $49 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter and a record $140 billion in inflows for the full year, earning the number one market share of global U.S., European equities and fixed income ETF flows for 2016. ETFs are being used by a diversified, growing set of institutional and retail clients. We are experiencing -- as I\u2019ve said in many of these conferences that we\u2019re seeing more and more investors using ETFs actively, not just for a passive exposure but using them actively to try to get exposures where they think those exposures will outperform. We believe that will continue to be a great, great growth area for these products. And importantly, the expansion -- the diversification of the ETF ecosystem is creating a deeper, more dynamic market for ETF trading; it is also enhancing liquidity for all investors worldwide. In 2016, we made a strategic investment in our U.S. core franchise to deliver the highest quality product at the best value to our clients at a time when they needed it most. We received very positive feedback from our clients on this move and iShares gathered $29 billion of flows in our global core products in this quarter alone. We also continue to invest in fixed income ETFs. BlackRock has long seen the value in fixed income ETFs and has invested for years in building this market, even as many of our industry -- many of our industry question this opportunity. 2016, the fixed income ETF industry reached a milestone, crossing $600 billion in assets with BlackRock\u2019s managing a large component of that. During heightened market movements after the U.S. election, trading volumes in the U.S. fixed income ETFs surged to the highest level of the year. Fixed income ETFs or iShares once again performed under stress in line with what our clients expected when they bought iShares, offering investors substantial on exchange liquidity. Fixed income ETFs remain a strategic priority and a significant growth opportunity for BlackRock and our clients. Smart beta ETFs are another area of strategic investment for Black Rock where we are the number one player in AUM, growing at a 37% organic growth rate in 2016. We all know that in 2016 we saw a retail investor shipping away from traditional active funds, with the U.S. active equity mutual fund industry experiencing $280 billion of outflows, representing the industry\u2019s worst year on record. And we at BlackRock experienced some of the same headwinds across our traditional active mutual funds. But because the way we\u2019re positioned, because how we\u2019re trying to help our clients by having both passive and active, we\u2019re working with the clients as they navigate the need between active and passive. I believe investors are going to continue to rethink their approach to active benefit; they may now move more towards factor-based strategies; they may have asset allocation or portfolio construction, but I do believe, we\u2019re going to continue to see a drive using ETFs for active returns. We\u2019ve been purposely investing in our platform to provide our clients with a full spectrum of offerings and to enhance alpha generating active strategies. We ended this quarter with 88% of our taxable fixed income, 91% of our scientific active equity, and 65% of our fundamental active equity assets above benchmark, or peer median for the five-year period. We\u2019re confident that our top performing franchise like Asian Equities and our unconstrained fixed income, which are proven to thrive in a rising rate environment, are well-positioned for 2017. Factor-based investing helps bridge the gap between active and index, and it\u2019s been an area of significant focus for BlackRock and our clients in 2016. BlackRock manages over a $150 billion in factor-based strategies including smart beta ETFs and our factor-based AUM grew at an organic growth rate in 2016 of 17%. We have a responsibility to provide our clients with the ability to focus on environmental and social issues, while simultaneously generating strong financial returns. We launched BlackRock\u2019s sustainable investing platform a year ago and have since built a range of equity and fixed income strategies that target positive environmental and social impact. We have frequently advocated for the benefits of infrastructure investing. And within the U.S. alone, markets are anticipating up to $1 trillion of domestic infrastructure investments over the next few years. And we all know, we desperately need those investments. BlackRock has built infrastructure and broader real estate platforms, both organically and inorganically over time, and we currently manage $29 billion in real asset AUM. We invested in our global cash management business in anticipation of regulatory reform and a rising rate environment. BlackRock is now positioned as a skilled player with the broadest range of solutions. At a time when we anticipated an uptick in demand, we saw $18 billion of flows in our fourth quarter alone, and now we have a cash management business that\u2019s over $400 billion. Over the past year, we have spoken to the increasing depth and quality of the solution orientation and solution oriented conversations that BlackRock is having with our institutional clients in face of this global uncertainty. Even as these clients pause to assess the changing investment landscape, growth in 2016 was driven particularly by our financial institution business, as insurance clients looked to BlackRock for highly customized portfolio. Our institutional business saw a record fourth quarter and full year net inflows, cross both active and passive. We have the right pieces on our platform but the key to designing and delivering a robust solution that targets specific outcomes for our clients is technology, which has always been at BlackRock\u2019s core. We see strong and growing demand for BlackRock\u2019s technology offerings. More and more asset managers, asset owners, banks, wealth managers, insurance companies are valuing the differentiating ability of our Aladdin platform and other technology offerings at BlackRock to help them achieve their goals. We\u2019re constantly enhancing our existing technology as well as coming up with new ways to use Aladdin to serve our clients. In 2016, we launched our Aladdin Risk for Wealth platform which empowers wealth managers\u2019 home offices to better understand risk. We also introduced Aladdin Portfolio Builder which provides financial advisors with highly intuitive portfolio construction tools. We continue to see robust client interest in FutureAdvisor and iRetire offerings. We also recently announced a minority investment and partnership with iCapital, the leading technology enabled illiquid alternatives distribution platform for retail investors. In addition to technology, our people enable us to differentiate ourselves for our clients. Every year together with our Board of Directors, we take a fresh look at our organization which includes developing talent and positioning our leaders in role that can broaden their experiences and maximize their potential for BlackRock and our clients. 2016, we unified our active equity platform. We unified our beta platform and we globalized our fixed income platform, all of which will help us benefit from the potential -- full potential of our global investment scale. At the same time, they create more tailored client experience in each geography where we operate. We strengthened our regional management of our clients and marketing activities in line with our commitment to be global with a local identity and a local footprint. It is the quality and dedication of our teams across the globe that positions us well for 2017. There are reasons that we have forged such trusting and trusted relationships with our clients and why our clients turn to BlackRock to solve the biggest financial challenges. I\u2019m really proud of the depth of the talent of the firm and leadership we have today. We\u2019ve never had a more talented group of men and women than we have today, and we\u2019ve the finest leadership in the history of the firm today. BlackRock has been adept at repositioning our investment platform and technology capabilities in advance of change. I promise you, we\u2019ll continue to be in front of those needs and we\u2019ll continue to change with the needs of our clients. As paradigm shift, we\u2019ll have an even greater responsibility to help our clients navigate the markets and plan for their retirements. We\u2019ve a responsibility to continue to invest in broadening and deepening our investment platform. We have a responsibility to be a thought and opinion leader worldwide, globally and locally to every one of our clients. And throughout BlackRock\u2019s history, we have demonstrated the ability to invest in our business for growth like no other firm while expanding our margins, raising our dividend rates and prudently returning capital to our shareholders. As we enter 2017, we will continue to make investments in BlackRock\u2019s future to grow our technology footprint, to expand our investment capabilities and to further enhance our talent level, all to meet our daily responsibility to every client whether that client has awarded us a $1,000 or if that client awarded us $10 billion, we have a responsibility to every client. And we are building a firm to meet those responsibilities every day. With that, let me open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks, good morning. I just wanted to see if you could provide an update on U.S. retail product demand trends including iShares as brokers modernize their business models for implementation of the U.S. DOL rule? Laurence D. Fink: Yes. We\u2019re being very responsive to potential changes that the DOL announced, recognize that different distribution firm have decided to go in various different ways to respond to the DOL changes. So, you\u2019re going to see from some of them a shift from brokerage to advisory accounts; you\u2019re going to see some of the index funds grow, particularly the ETFs. So, there is going to be an increased focus on the performance there and of course the cost. And also, what we\u2019re responding to is a growth in portfolio construction services and the need for greater sophistication and scalable technologies where we are responding with tools like Aladdin wealth. So, many of this is going to be model driven. We\u2019re responding by making sure that we are priced correctly in the products that we\u2019re offering, so that we will be included in the models at the appropriate price, that we\u2019re also providing the technology for those institutions that need model driven solutions, and we\u2019re also utilizing a lot of the analytics we have to help those firms. So, it\u2019s products; it\u2019s appropriate pricing; it\u2019s technology; and it\u2019s portfolio solutions. And depending upon the distribution center, we\u2019re focusing on the appropriate ones for each one of those. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citi. Please go ahead. Bill Katz : Good morning, everyone. Thank you very much for taking the question. I ask this quite a bit, but I\u2019m going to ask it again anyway. I guess if I look at the quarter, tremendous flows, little bit of a fee give-up, some of it mix, some of it macro, very good margins underneath that; appreciate your guidance on M&A obviously and G&A. As you look at the 2017, how do you think about that interplay between fee rates and margins assuming the markets are relatively consistent and not a lot of volatility in currency, which I know is asking [ph] a lot but just trying to get an understanding of the volume versus margin dynamic for the Company, looking ahead. Laurence D. Fink: Let me go over some of the headwind issues that we all faced and we can get into the specifics. I think we have to understand the context of 2016. First and foremost, the last quarter of 2015, obviously the equity markets fell; we had equity markets down 12% of one time in the first quarter. And so, we had huge headwinds in the first half of the year. The other big headwind that we had all year and actually accelerated in the fourth quarter was the strength of the DoLlar. And so, those are two of the big macro issues that we had to face. One of the great statistics that I think about going forward into next year, our average assets in 2016 were up 2%, our spot close is up 11%, and that just gives you a color of some of the issues that we had. And I think that\u2019s a big macro context of thinking about how you should think about our business. Obviously I am going to have Gary go into the specificity of the fee rates, but I would just say from the top of the house, I think you said it pretty well because of the margin. I think scale is a driver that is so important how we look at it. When we look at lowering fees for market share opportunities for delivering the needs to our clients and having higher margins, this is how we think about doing this, working and focusing on the clients\u2019 needs, doing what we think is best, building market share but also driving margin. But, let me have Gary go into the specificity of your question. Gary S. Shedlin: Good morning, Bill and thanks for asking the question. So, look, let\u2019s deal with them separately. I think in terms of fee rate, there is really four primary reasons that you\u2019ve seen a decline in our fee rate, whether year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter or sequentially. First obviously is FX. We saw DoLlar appreciation, primarily versus the euro and the pound, roughly 4% on the euro, 16% against the pound during the year and that obviously relative to the stock of our business increases the relative weighting of our DoLlar denominated FX, which tends to have lower fees then our non-U.S. DoLlar denominated product. In many cases, you\u2019re seeing a little bit of the same phenomenon in terms of equity beta. We\u2019ve talked about divergent equity beta but this year in particular you saw various higher fee international markets, whether it be Europe, Asia X or Japan. Underperforming domestic U.S. markets; and as with the FX that also increases the relative weighting of our lower fee DoLlar denominated assets under management.  We saw mix shift. When we talked about mix shift, we really talk about that as a client preference issue. So, during 2016, we saw clients favoring index over active, we saw clients favoring fixed income over equity and multi-asset, and even within our cash business, we saw a huge preference for government over prime funds. And in each of those instances, you\u2019re seeing changes in fee rates from what was traditionally higher fee product to at least in this year, lower fee product. And then finally, we actually took some of our own action in terms of price reductions with certain iShares core and fixed income that was later in the year, but again with that what I would call investment, we\u2019ve been very clear that we think that would be accretive to shareholder value over time and I think as you heard, we\u2019ve had strong progress today in terms of our core performance so far. So, in each of these cases, all of these items are going to impact fee rates over time, but I think the key issue is, those set of circumstances, whether they are market driven or client driven, will also change over time. And I think the key issue for BlackRock is that we have a broad-based enough platform to be able to meet client preferences in any market and to basically deliver solutions base and outcomes to them that basically makes sense. So, that\u2019s the fee rate piece of it. In terms of margins, I think what I would say as we think about margins, I\u2019ll give the standard statement that we don\u2019t manage to a margin target, I think you\u2019ve all heard that long enough but I think that in a year where we obviously saw a difference, i.e. 4% asset growth versus less organic base fee growth, I think we were able to demonstrate that we can basically mange the business in that environment and in fact notwithstanding an overall decline in our revenues which was fundamentally driven by performance fees, we were still able to deliver not only 80 basis points of margin improvement but record flows during the year. So, again that interplay between revenue growth and margin, I think we\u2019re pretty well-established in terms of our ability to operate in most environments. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Ken Worthington : So, to continue with the fee rate discussion, what has been the reaction to your announced lowering of fees on active products announced last quarter? And maybe, given the reaction, what are your thoughts about broadening or expanding that investment to other asset classes and other products? Laurence D. Fink: So, the response actually has been good. And without lowering the fees, we might not be included in some of the models that a lot of the clients are now using and distribution centers are using. But what\u2019s important to us is not only performance as one of the levers that we look to go out and use to get clients to buy our products but also our competitive position and where we stand in price and most of our mutual funds have boards that we also have to respond to as well. So, since we made the changes, four of our funds have been upgraded by Morningstar, three of the government funds and one of the high yield funds, and they\u2019ve all now become middle [ph] rated. And so that\u2019s important to us, so that they are included in a lot of what our distribution forces can sell and how they\u2019re evaluated. So, beyond performance, we also want to strive to be in at least the top quartile of expenses. And of course in a very low rate environment that also helps to drive performance. So, the response has been very good by those that evaluate us, the response has been good by the distribution centers, and the response has been shown in creating and getting more assets. So, over time, we\u2019re going to be responsive to the competitive environment to make sure that we\u2019re included in the sales of these and we expect that sales will continue. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Michael Cyprys : Just getting back to G&A, it looks like it\u2019s down about 8% year-on-year, if you back out the one-time deal costs from a year ago. So, just can you talk to what\u2019s driving that reduction in G&A, how much of that relates to tech projects rolling off versus say more sustainable cost reduction? And then just as you think about G&A over the next couple of years, what level do you think is sustainable to or required to your sustainable 5% organic growth? Gary S. Shedlin: So, this year, I think obviously the G&A delta was as we talked about, there was some non-recurring items that basically were tied to our M&A activity last year, which rolled off. And frankly, this year, the big -- I would say the big delta as you think about G&A, obviously the biggest manageable component of that is our marketing budget. And I think that one is one that we tried to manage appropriately in a year where we\u2019re seeing lots of clients delay their investment allocation decisions with a lot of volatility. We\u2019ll be obviously looking at that pretty carefully in the context of the current environment as we get into this year. We also, as you probably noticed, just also hired a new Chief Marketing Officer, Frank Cooper who will be taking his own look at our marketing and our spending strategies that we\u2019ll clearly be taking a careful look at. There is also some other items that I think you have to be vary worry [ph] of where FX gets in the way [ph] and also G&A impacts training, I think it has recruiting, it has a bunch of things that are obviously tied to broader growth objectives as we grow the Company. We kept our headcount pretty flat last year and that was even after our first quarter reduction that we talked about. I think Larry communicated that we needed to be in growth mode during the year and we were. So, I think frankly, the big drivers of G&A spend going forward will clearly be our ability to right size our marketing budget in the context of the current environment and will be tied obviously to our desire to grow headcount as we see opportunities for growth going forward. The final item is obviously leveraging our scale. So, there is technology, there is real estate, some of -- is more step function as opposed to overall growth. And I think that will be important to keep in mind. I think those are really the big issues. I think that this year was clearly in the context of the environment, a lower year for us, and we would expect numbers to me modestly higher from the next year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Please go ahead. Robert Lee : I was curious with the capital management and your dividend increase, and maybe the signal from that, and maybe year ago you increased the dividend 5% and as you mentioned, it was coming off of a tougher fourth quarter 2015 and a rough start to 2016, this year it\u2019s 9%, pick back up, just getting a sense of assuming we should read that to be the year certainly has an improved outlook for your earnings, your earnings profile over the coming year and next several years. I just want to get some color on that. Gary S. Shedlin: I will jump in and then Larry can add on his views. Look, our predictable and balanced approach to capital management really has not changed. I think we remain first committed to investing in our business; we then try to target a dividend payout ratio of around 40% to 50% on a full year basis, that\u2019s a target, that\u2019s not a policy; and then, we effectively look to return any additional cash to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases. The total payout ratio is really an output of how we see opportunities for the next year; it\u2019s not an input to our budgeting or financial planning process. And over the last few years, I think you\u2019ve probably seen that our share repurchases broadly have been fairly constant, in terms of DoLlar amounts. Obviously as the share price has gone up, the number of shares that we\u2019re purchasing is going down slightly. And we\u2019ve been fairly consistent in trying to increase our dividend. So, this year, the dividend is obviously up 9% to $2.50 a share. We\u2019ve obviously reloaded our share repurchase authorization and expect that next year\u2019s share repurchases from a DoLlar perspective would be broadly consistent with what we did in 2015. And we think frankly that combination has been very effective for shareholders. The dividend has now gone up at a compounded annual rate of about 11% over the last five years. We\u2019ve got 13 million shares repurchased; I think we mentioned about a 13% unlevered return, and I think that\u2019s obviously good. And our share count is down roughly about 4% since we began this, and that\u2019s after issuing shares for deferred compensation while at the same time reinvesting in the business and effectively delevering as EBITDA has grown relative to our constant amount of long-term debt. So, I think it\u2019s a balance and I think we felt as we -- given the stability and diversification of our model and our ability to deliver more consistent and predictable results that we just support that dividend going into this year. Laurence D. Fink: Robert, I think you framed the macro setting well. We went into last year with a pretty harsh market in the fourth quarter 2015 and first quarter 2016. We now are seeing more conservative dividend. As I said, our average assets are up 11% this year from a spot rate -- I mean spot rate assets are up 11% from average asset, up 2 during the year. And we\u2019re following the same type of formula that as Gary suggested in terms of our dividend policy. I would say -- in absolute though, we wanted to show the enthusiasm to our shareholders of announcing a 9% dividend increase. Gary S. Shedlin: And I will just end with this, which as I know all you guys have incredibly sophisticated earnings model, so I certainly would look to project your earnings per share based off the dividend that we basically declare each year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous. Please go ahead. Patrick Davitt : On the comment you just made about institutional delay, is that backward looking or ongoing? And within that same, you obviously saw a big uptick in institutional index flows. Do you get the sense that that\u2019s just institution kind of meeting equity exposure, rolling into index with the intention of maybe reallocating that to more active strategy at same point? Laurence D. Fink: No, I don\u2019t think there has been any -- as I said, we are seeing more institutions using index and the allocation to these various exposures as the active strategy. And I think this is one of the key characteristics of the market, is not taking into the full context. In terms of institutions, I think into the fourth -- we said in the third quarter, institutions are pausing. They put some money to work in the fourth quarter; they put a lot of money to work at BlackRock in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re having deeper dialog with more institutions today than we ever had. The dialogs we\u2019re having with some very large insurance companies, pension funds worldwide are very encouraging whether they act in the first quarter, the second quarter of 2017, we\u2019ll see. But I do believe clients are reassessing their liabilities in the form of pension funds, clients are really looking at what their liability rates and the terms of insurance companies, they\u2019re looking at their asset allocations accordingly now and how they\u2019re going to do it, for insurance companies rise of interest rates, steepening of the yield curve is very positive and many insurance companies, I think we talked about early last year were short their liabilities, they were anticipating higher rates, and now with higher rates, some of them are putting some money to work. So, I don\u2019t want to -- I think it\u2019d be unfair to say that we\u2019re going to expect these types of flows institutionally at BlackRock quarter-by-quarter-by-quarter but we do feel very good about our positioning and working with our global institutions. In terms of the asset allocation, we are having dialogs with some clients right now; we\u2019re talking more about alternatives. Rob Kapito has had two conversations with two large states in the last week about a bigger allocation in alternatives. So, I don\u2019t want to suggest there\u2019s one macro trend and one way of looking at asset allocation but I can say we\u2019re involved in a lot of very deep conversations. And I do believe the market is still misunderstanding how people are using passive strategies. They\u2019re not just using it because they want to be indexed; they\u2019re using passive strategies that are very liquid that they can navigate around markets to take active exposures. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Larry, last quarter, you talked -- we talked about the pace of Depart of Labor fiduciary rule implementation and advisor behavior. I think you mentioned that you did think it was going to be fairly rapid shift towards passive from active products within the retail channels. Has your view changed on that, post the Trump win, in terms of again I guess what are you hearing from your wholesalers on advisor behavior and then allocation and implementation right into the deadline? And maybe just longer term, what\u2019s your view on how you think the Department of Labor\u2019s fiduciary rule might change with any kind of administrative changes? Laurence D. Fink: Well, A, I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to change. Obviously, there is a lot of talk about it\u2019ll be modified, some conversations about it, that\u2019ll be totally eliminated. We believe the DoL rule has some very great components to it. I mean, as you know what we\u2019ve spoken for years-and-years-and-years that we have done a very bad job in our country in helping people navigate to the outcome of retirement. And having better outcome oriented strategies whether we have a DoL or not is imperative or we\u2019re going to have more and more people angry that they\u2019re close to retirement with adequate pools of money to retire. That anger then does not go away. So, we believe the DoL rule has quite a bit of merit but I know as much as you do in terms of how that would change, if it\u2019s going to change. Does it get totally eliminated? We\u2019ll see. What we see in terms of behaviors, and this is the important thing. And Rob said it very well; we have not seen much change in behaviors from the large distribution platforms. As Rob suggested, they are moving from a brokerage relationship to advisor relationship. They are moving ahead with doing more model based structuring. In fact, we won a biggest -- we were a part of a big award in terms of how models are going to be created in terms of are they going to be using our products or not. So, in terms of behaviors, most firms are moving forward that some component, if not all of the components of DoL will be moving forward. We are very active in helping whether the DoL rule happens or not, more and more of the distribution houses are saying, we need better technology to help us navigate our clients\u2019 relationships and their portfolios. And that is why Aladdin for Wealth is growing very rapidly and has a potential for even more substantial growth in the future. So, in terms of our relationships with most of our advisors, we are seeing very little in terms of behavior changes. Now, I am not here to tell you, on April 1st this year everything is going to change. Could it be elongated? Sure. But I do believe in most cases, most large advisory firms believe there is a -- this is a good thing for their clients and a good thing for them. And I believe we will see some form of DoL in the future but I know as good as you what this -- what specifically does that mean. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Carrier : Hi. How are you doing? I guess the question, another one on the institutional side. And I hear what you\u2019re saying in terms of you saw a lot of money moving in index but there is demand for alternatives. Just I guess, there has been a lot of cash that\u2019s been on sidelines for a while now. I mean, just trying to get a sense, and I know it\u2019s one quarter but based on those discussions, are you starting to see more interest to put that money to work, and could this be a trend that we\u2019re going to see follow-through over the next few years as institutions have more confidence, I mean if rates are rising and things are starting to move forward? Laurence D. Fink: I think I said this earlier today on television, I think if you reflect back to the end of 2016, for those who have panicked the first quarter of 2016 and stayed underinvested or out of the market entirely, they\u2019ve been hurt. If you think back to those investors who ran away from the market in 2008, 2009, they\u2019ve been really hurt. We are working with all our clients to try to help them be more invested. So, let\u2019s be clear, we believe it\u2019s a mistake the amount of cash is sitting on the sidelines worldwide. The problem is clients say, I just missed the last 10% or 15%, maybe I should stay in the sidelines longer. Our job is to be helping our clients worldwide and helping them think about markets, thinking about exposures and helping them build an asset base to meet their liabilities. I don\u2019t believe -- as you said, one quarter versus another is going to really determine whether we are seeing a renewed interest in putting the money to work; certainly in the fourth quarter we did. Our dialogs that we\u2019re having worldwide indicate that we may see more money put to work. But I don\u2019t want to forecast that. I\u2019m always disappointed of how much money is sitting in the sideline. And I believe at the end of every year, we talk about this that we need to have more of our clients, more of our investors to focus on the outcome investing and not whether the market\u2019s rich or cheap, because that gets caught up and getting in out of the market and therefore missing big market movements, and this is a big issue. I believe this is one of the reasons why we\u2019re having deeper dialog with our clients because we are talking about outcomes, we\u2019re not talking about a specific product; we\u2019re not talking active or passive. We\u2019re allowing our clients to make those decisions, whether they should have a bigger allocation and passive or active. We\u2019re making our clients determine whether they should be in high yield or unconstrained bond plan. We\u2019re allowing our clients to work on how to navigate; we\u2019ll give them input about what we think. But I do believe the fourth quarter of 2016 positioned us well because of how we\u2019re constantly, repeatingly talking about solution-based relationship. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks? Laurence D. Fink: Let me just add on to what I just said. So, we believe that 2016 results again highlighted our benefits of BlackRock\u2019s differentiated investment position, our technology positioning, our risk management platform and positioning, and the impact of our investments we made over the last five years are the biggest growth products at BlackRock. And so, when I reflect on our 2016, it is about those investments we made 2, 3, 4 years ago that is really now creating the volume of growth that we have. It is the scale of our operation, the global footprint of our operation that has given us broader, deeper conversations with more clients throughout the world and we\u2019ll continue to drive deeper and broader conversations with our client in 2017. Our stable financial results allow us to continue to pursue that long-term view. Investing in these future growth areas is when you adapt to stay ahead of our clients, and that\u2019s key. Staying ahead of our clients\u2019 needs is imperative. Not responding to the question; if we\u2019re responding to the question at the moment and we are not prepared, that question will be answered somewhere else. So, I believe it is that philosophy that is carrying BlackRock, that is differentiating BlackRock, and I think it is that positioning that is going to build momentum into 2017. I want to thank everybody for joining us this morning and having continued interest in BlackRock. And let\u2019s have a good year. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated First Quarter 2017 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today\u2019s call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary Shedlin; President; Robert S. Kapito, and General Counsel, Christopher Meade. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference. Christopher Meade : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019m Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock\u2019s actual results may of course differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC which list some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. BlackRock assumes no duty, and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Gary. Gary Shedlin : Thanks, Chris and good morning everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to present results for the first quarter of 2017. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I\u2019ll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. BlackRock\u2019s competitive position has allowed us to continuously invest from a position of strength and to adapt and change our business model, always with a goal of being prepared to deliver outcomes for clients by leveraging a comprehensive set of technology and risk management capabilities. This strategy has fostered deeper client relationships and led to a differentiated and more consistent level of organic growth. BlackRock\u2019s first quarter results reflected $80 billion of long-term net inflows, representing an annualized organic asset growth rate of 7% and an annualized organic base fee growth rate of 5%, highlighting the value of these investments and the success in our broad-based global technology and investment platform. Flows were positive across product type, client type, and region. First-quarter revenue of $2.8 billion was 8% higher than a year ago, and despite costs associated with the repositioning of our active equity business, operating income of $1.2 billion rose 10%. Earnings per share of $5.25 were up 24% compared to a year ago driven also by higher nonoperating results and a lower effective tax rate in the current quarter. Non-operating results for the quarter reflected $42 million of net investment gains, an increase from the first quarter of 2016 due to higher marks in the current quarter. First-quarter net interest expense included $14 million of call premium expense associated with the current quarter\u2019s successful refinancing of our $700 million, 6.25% notes, which were called prior to their September 2017 maturity. Our issuance of $700 million of ten-year notes yielding 3.25% will result in a reduction of $21 million of annual interest expense going forward.  Our as-adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was 23.8%, compared to 29.6% a year ago, and included an $81 million discrete tax benefit associated with the adoption of new accounting guidance related to stock-based compensation awards that vested during the quarter. We continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2017, so the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of additional discrete items and tax law changes that could arise during the year. First quarter base fees rose 7% year-over-year, driven primarily by the positive impact of market appreciation and organic growth on our average assets under management. On a constant currency basis, we estimate that base fees were approximately 9% year-over-year. Sequentially, base fees were up 2%. Growth in both year-over-year and sequential base fees was partially offset by the impact of a lower day count in the first quarter of 2017. Performance fees of $70 million increased $36 million from the first quarter of 2016, reflecting better hedge fund and long-only performance, but declined $59 million from the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to seasonally higher fees from funds with a performance measurement period that ended in the fourth quarter. Aladdin revenue of $158 million, was up 12% year-over-year driven by new clients and several sizable implementations going live on the Aladdin platform over the last year. Internally, we recently realigned financial markets advisory for our FMA business with client solutions and the BlackRock Investment Institute to offer clients a more cohesive and comprehensive advisory service. To better align our external reporting in light of this change, Aladdin revenue, previously reported within the Blackrock Solutions and advisory line item on our income statement will now be presented as technology and risk management revenue on our P&L. Advisory revenue associated with our FMA business will now be combined with other revenue and included as part of an advisory and other revenue line item. Technology is changing how the world invests and how we interact with clients. We continued to see strong market demand for institutional Aladdin, Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management, FutureAdvisor, and other technology solutions as clients seek sophisticated risk analytics and portfolio construction tools. This new presentation, which is reflected in our first quarter income statement, is intended to sharpen the focus on our technology and risk management businesses at BlackRock. Total expense increased 6% year-over-year and 1% sequentially driven by higher compensation and volume related expense, lower G&A expense, and $22 million of certain one-time expense associated with the recently announced strategic repositioning of our active equity platform. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up $78 million or 8% year-over-year, reflecting higher incentive compensation, driven primarily by higher performance fees and higher operating income, and approximately $20 million of severance and accelerated compensation expense associated with the repositioning of the Active Equity platform. Sequentially, compensation and benefit expense was up 4%, reflecting these repositioning costs, higher seasonal payroll taxes, and an increase in stock-based compensation expense related to new 2017 grants, partially offset by lower incentive compensation resulting from seasonally lower performance fees and operating income in the current quarter. G&A expense was down 5% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower discretionary, marketing, and promotional spend. Sequentially, G&A expense decreased $54 million from the fourth quarter or 15% primarily reflecting the seasonal impact of lower marketing and promotional expense in the first quarter and reduced foreign exchange remeasurement expense. Aggregate G&A expense in the first quarter also benefited from a delay in the timing of certain expense items, including marketing and promotional expense, which we anticipate will be incurred throughout the remainder of 2017. Assuming stable markets, we continue to expect a modestly higher level of full year G&A spend in 2017 as compared to 2016. Our first quarter as adjusted operating margin of 42.6% was up 100 basis points year-over-year, reflecting a continued focus on striking an appropriate balance between investing for future growth and practical discretionary expense management. We remain committed to leveraging the benefits of our scale for both clients and shareholders.  We also remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first reinvesting in our business and then returning excess cash to shareholders. In line with that commitment, we previously announced a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend to $2.50 per share of common stock and also repurchased an additional $275 million worth of shares in the first quarter. We stand by previous guidance as it relates to share repurchases for the remainder of the year.  First-quarter long-term net inflows of $80 billion were positive across client types and diversified across asset classes and regions. Long-term net inflows benefited from significant flows into iShares as both institutional and retail clients increased their use of ETFs as the building blocks for their portfolios and in combinations to drive active returns. Global iShares generated record quarterly net inflows of $64 billion; representing 20% annualized organic growth, driven in part by an accelerating global shift to fee-based advisory in the wealth channel and by rapid adoption of iShares ETFs as financial instruments by professional money managers. iShares captured the number one share of first quarter industry [indiscernible] globally in the US, Europe, and in equity and fixed income with our US iShares franchise crossing over $1 trillion in assets under management for the first time. IShares equity and net inflows of $45 billion reflected demand for core ETFs across both developed and emerging market exposures and strong inflows into higher fee precision exposures and smart beta ETFs. Fixed income iShares net inflows of $20 million were led by flows into investment-grade corporate and emerging market bond funds. Our institutional business generated $11 billion of long-term net inflows in the first quarter driven primarily by index inflows. Institutional active net outflows of $1 billion reflected net outflows in equity and fixed income, partially offset by inflows into multi-asset and alternatives. multi-asset flows were driven by our LifePath target-date series, which saw $5 billion of net inflows in the quarter, the strongest flow quarter in recent history. Excluding return of client capital, institutional alternatives generated over $2 billion of net inflows, reflecting deployment of committed capital in infrastructure and private equity and hedge fund solutions. Momentum in alternatives is continuing evidenced by yet another strong fund raising quarter for illiquids as we raise more than $2 billion in new commitments. Illiquid alternatives remain a key growth area for BlackRock as further demonstrated by our recent announcement of the acquisition of the First Reserve Infrastructure funds. We expect this acquisition to close later this quarter bringing total invested and committed infrastructure capital to approximately $14 billion. Retail net inflows of $5 billion were led by inflows into fixed income and index equity products, partially offset by outflows from world allocation strategies. Fixed income net inflows of $5 million were diversified across our top performing platform and included $2 million of inflows into unconstrained strategies as well as strong flows into emerging markets and municipals. In addition, our multi-asset income strategy raised $1 billion during the first quarter as investors continued to target specific income oriented outcomes. Our first quarter financial and business results reflect the benefits of the investments we made to evolve our global distribution, investment and technology platforms ahead of evolving client needs and industry trends. Diversification, whether investment style, distribution channel, product for region and scale create a truly advantage competitive position that will enable us to continue making strategic investments with the goal of delivering long-term value for clients and shareholders alike. With that I will turn it over to Larry. Laurence Fink : Thanks Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. BlackRock\u2019s first-quarter results are a reflection of the purposeful investments we have made over our first 29 years to create the broadest investment platform in the asset management industry, and complemented by a global distribution network and industry-leading technology. Our full range of investment strategies with strength in index, factors, smart beta, quantitative and fundamental actives and alternatives uniquely position BlackRock to develop a more holistic relationship and connect deeper with our clients. Our strong results this quarter are not a result of what we did over the last three months, but really a result of our long-term strategy. We have always kept our focus on the long-term working to understand the evolution of the asset management ecosystem and to anticipate changes in our client\u2019s needs so that we can adapt ahead of change and better meet their needs. For this reason clients today rely on BlackRock not only for investment solutions, but also for our insights and guidance on how to navigate the global investment landscape. Over the past year, global events have had a significant impact in markets and investor sentiment. Following the presidential election, US equity markets surged to an all-time high driven by expectations for fiscal stimulus and regulatory reform, and reflation expectations have been steadily increasing, although, there is still uncertainty about healthcare, uncertainty about tax and trade reform, when they will be ultimately be implemented in the United States and investor confidence has partially changed. There are significant issues related to tax reform, infrastructure spending, and so we need to see how this all evolves. We are still optimistic, but we have to see how these all evolve.  Strong first-quarter equity returns have been driven by a synchronized recovery in global economic growth with the sharpest recovery seen internationally. However, it is unclear how social and political agendas will play out, particularly in Europe ahead of several elections, which is creating even more market anxiety. Furthermore, if the dollar remained strong following a period of significant appreciation we could see further headwinds for dollar-based investors with global portfolios. Despite recent action by the Federal Reserve, the impact to sustain low rates in our clients\u2019 portfolios will continue. Many clients today are struggling to meet their liability needs and will likely to continue and will likely remain a challenge. As I talk about in my recent Chairman\u2019s letter to our shareholders in our annual report, at the heart of BlackRock is the culture that embraces change. We as an organization, we anticipate, we prepare, and we transform change into opportunities.  As the landscape for asset managers evolve, a challenging narrative has emerged across the industry, one of managers having to play defense to protect themselves from market headwinds, structural changes and fee pressure. The reason much of the asset management industry is in defensive is that many managers have not evolved and they are playing catch-up. We built BlackRock differently. Evolution is a part and a critical part of our culture. Throughout our history we have focused on identifying critical trends. We anticipated how those trends will impact our clients\u2019 needs and then we pivot our business accordingly. As a result, we built [Indiscernible] equipped with investment strategies and technology, one that is agile. We seek to adapt ahead of change, not in response to it. However, we also recognize that sometimes we make a misstep and addressing those quickly is just as important. BlackRock has a full range of investment strategies for market cap weighted index exposures at one end to liquid alternatives at the other and everything in between. We have created technology capable of bringing those building blocks together to design and deliver outcomes for our clients, and we have built unmatched scale that strategically positions us to create value for our clients and our shareholders. Now is the time more than ever for BlackRock to play offense. Our scalable investment and technology platform is our greatest durable competitive advantage and going forward we will continue to identify opportunities to use our advantage market position to create better financial futures for clients and drive long-term growth for shareholders. We are using our scale to lower prices for clients and drive growth and market share increases for BlackRock in our US iShares core ETFs. We are using our scale to create more efficient relationships with our service providers, and earlier this year we announced our plans to move $1 trillion of custodial assets. We are using our scale to build industry leading technology to optimize investment performance and outcomes for our clients. We are using our scale to enhance our talent profile by tapping into a diverse network and we are using our scale to make tactical, fill-in acquisitions that further enhances our platform, our technology capabilities and our geographic reach. This approach is widening our competitive advantage and driving our ability to generate consistently strong organic growth. And we are going to continue to press our competitive advantage going forward always with the best interests of our clients and our shareholders. In the first quarter BlackRock generated $80 billion of long-term net inflows representing a 7% annualized organic growth. Flows were positive across product types, client types, and all our regions. Rugged ETF flows are a tangible example of the fundamental change we see in the ecosystem of wealth management and capital markets.  Simple building blocks like iShares core has a strategy holding for long-term investors. Fixed income ETFs alongside bonds for institutions, large asset owners taking greater control of portfolio risk profiles with factor based ETFs, and more and more investors are using a combination of ETFs to generate active returns. The investment landscape is changing and BlackRock is investing in iShares to lead industry growth and evolution. IShares saw record first quarter inflows of $64 billion as clients saw ETFs in their portfolio, both for index exposures and as building block to deliver alpha. Last October, we anticipated key changes impacting our retail and institutional clients that would change the way large pools of assets will be managed. We made a deliberate strategic investment in our US iShares core ETFs, positioning this business to offer the highest quality product at the best value for our clients. This strategy is working, posting organic revenue and asset growth that exceeded our expectations. Since this strategic repricing we have seen acceleration in growth in our iShares US core ETFs with $52 billion of net inflows representing a 50% annualized organic growth. We have experienced a sizable up tick in our core market share, and we have recaptured more than 50% of the revenue impact through organic growth alone. Several years ago we anticipated growing interest from our clients in factors and smart beta. Those strategies remain a significant area of focus for BlackRock and BlackRock is positioned to win. We saw $2 billion in net inflows into BlackRock\u2019s smart, Beta ETF in the first quarter contributing to the total factor base net inflows of $3 billion in our first quarter. The combination of our technology platform, our distribution connectivity, our commitment to risk management and our broad investment platform will enable us to be a leader in this space. We believe in active management more than ever before especially in less efficient markets where returns are less correlated. But we will believe going forward clients will be looking for different ways and different things from active equity and assets will need to be generating in the new ways. In October, we refined and expanded our active fixed income platform. 90% of our U.S. fixed income mutual fund platform now offers top quartile performance and top quartile pricing. Our constraint product range is also well positioned for rising rate environment and we are beginning to see momentum with over $2 billion of net inflows in the quarter. As active equity management is being reshaped by massive advancements in technology and data science and clients are focusing more on outcomes, we recently reevaluated our active equity platform so that we are in a position to efficiently and consistently deliver investment performance to our clients. We spent our product offerings into a range of strategies that expand different levels of alpha-generation and value with the appropriate manufacturing cost for BlackRock and we are harnessing the power of people and technology as we lean into supporting both our fundamental and our quantitative equity managers with the sheered data science and technology capabilities. We believe that levering our global scale and technology we can drive better outcomes for our clients and future growth for BlackRock. To the end of the quarter 65% of our fundamental active equities at 85% of our scientific active equity assets were above the benchmark medium for the three year period. The investments that we made in iShares shares and our active fixed income and an active equities are about leveraging our breadth, our scale and our technology to reach the benefits of competitive advantages to drive growth and we will continue to find ways to lever those unique strikes. As we look for other opportunities overall for our clients alternatives remain a key area focus as our clients increasingly are searching for additional sources of income and hopefully uncorrelated returns. We saw another strong fund raising quarter with $2 billion of commitments and we now have more than $12 billion un-invested committed capital to invest going forward across our $100 billion core alternative platform. We continue to advocate for infrastructure investing and supportive policy to unlock private capital which offer multiple benefits including providing new sources of return for investors, creating jobs, improving productivity and increasing capacity for long term economic growth. Today we manage $30 billion in real assets and we expect this to continue area of growth for BlackRock. As we look to enhance BlackRock global credit platform last month we brought [indiscernible] to lead BlackRock's credit business along [Indiscernible]. We believe that the combination of BlackRock long established presence and expertise in fixed income and our growing alternative platform positions us to be a leading provider in both liquid and in-liquid credit which provides attractive risk adjusted opportunities for our clients for seeking differentiated source of income. Well, technology has always been a key differentiator for BlackRock it is more essential to our business than ever before. We believe technology can transform our industry with enhanced technology and risk management helping investors achieve better outcomes and we at BlackRock are leading that transformation. Our goal is to be the most sophisticated user of data and technology in the financial services industry. We seek to transform and integrate the way the assets and wealth managers are creating client outcomes through portfolio construction asset allocation, risk management and digital distribution. Our Aladdin technology is being used by more clients than ever before well with revenues growing 12% year-over-year and demand from Aladdin\u2019s multi-asset capabilities by institutions globally specially in Europe and Latin America remain strong. We also continue to see momentum in retail demand for Aladdin as interest continues to increase for Aladdin risk for wealth management which provides intermediaries with institutional quality portfolio construction modeling and risk management technology. We are currently implementing a handful of clients in this technology in the United States, in Europe and in Asia. Aladdin remains the only integrated investment risk management system on the market. And we believe this differentiation will continue to drive the attractive value proposition and premium price points. In line with the commitment to technology we recently nominated Chuck Robins to our board of directors. Chuck has helped global corporations navigate world being reshaped by technology advancements. We have consistently and consciously developed our board with the eye towards the future and Chuck brings a deep understanding of technology promise to our board at a critical time for BlackRock. Building a record total net inflows of $202 billion in 2016, we began 2017 by continuing to invest in our business to capture the opportunities ahead of us to drive continued growth, and to aggressively leverage the benefit of our scale. We are transforming the change around us into the opportunities for the future. Finding new methods to generate sustainable alpha, using technology and innovative ways building no our platform to server clients evolving needs, creating continued opportunities for our employees and delivering consisted returns for our shareholders. Now let's open up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instruction] Your first question comes from Ken Worthington with JP Morgan. Ken Worthington : Hi, good morning. Larry in a Bloomberg interview you stated that Aladdin -- you see Aladdin pushing about $5 billion of revenue in the next five years. Maybe can you talk about what Aladdin would look like as a $5 billion revenue business and maybe what might be the greatest risk that could prevent BlackRock from reaching these targets? Laurence Fink : I said that was an aspiration, let\u2019s be clear. And it was technology not just Aladdin. So we believe what we are doing in with our FutureAdvisor platform, with our iRetire platform, and of course in Aladdin for wealth management, Aladdin for institutional clients, Aladdin provider for the custodial banking industry. We believe we have great growth potentials worldwide. As I said in my prepared remarks we are seeing Aladdin interest in LatAm, in Europe. We have wealth management -- Aladdin for wealth management integration going on right now in Asia, and so it's continuing to drive our platform, but I am \u2013 where I am most pleased and I think has been the evolution of Aladdin beyond what it\u2019s core competency was a few years back by allowing \u2013 by having the ability to work with our wealth management clients and helping them having the analytical capacity to analyze the risk of every single client they have. And so especially in a world that is moving with MiFID II with a world that is moving more towards advisory-less brokerage, I believe the need for greater oversight, greater understanding is going to be necessary, and the Aladdin platform is one of the options that many people have to drive that technology knowledge. So and then, we will continue to do acquisitions, we have few areas that we are looking at right now to further add opportunities that we have in technology. But let me just say importantly what technology is for BlackRock. It's the core of our culture. So it\u2019s and what I do believe what our clients are finding when they have the Aladdin platform and when you have the singularity of one technology platform throughout an organization, it's driving our clients\u2019 culture, and I do believe this is going to continue to drive a component of the growth that we see for Aladdin, so we are quite excited. At times, we are pretty overwhelmed with the opportunities but Mr. Goldstein and team have done a very good job in terms of driving those opportunities. Operator : Your next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks. Good morning Larry. So if you look at BlackRock\u2019s strong AUM growth over the last three years and contrast it to the slower revenue and EPS growth trends, and I -- we know large component that delta is driven by one time market factors like FX and divergent beta, but when you focus just on the fee rate, can you provide us a rough estimate of the impact from the market driven factors and then also the client driven factors when you think about negative mix shift towards core series and fee cuts, and I am just really looking for kind of ballpark figures here? Gary Shedlin : Hey Craig, it's Gary. Good morning. So maybe I will take crack at that for you. I think if we can start, recall from investor day which was I guess about nine months ago, we showed the chart on investor day that detailed how despite growth of about $1.3 billion on our base fees, and I think it was from 2012 to 2015, so that chart is a little outdated now, despite that growth our fee rate had actually declined by little over 1 basis point. I think it was about 1.3 basis points. Organic growth drove about 30% of the revenue growth over that period of time, and actually expanded our fee rate by about 1 basis point. That, I would basically refer you to as mixed shift and that is a phenomenon where our organic base fee growth is actually growing faster than our organic asset growth which frankly with the exception of last year, it has done pretty continuously. While beta and FX and drove about 70% of the revenue growth, which again our elements outside of our direct control had actually caused a 2 basis points decline in the fee rate over that time period, and that is really what we talk about as being divergent beta, and FX actually increases our revenue but it actually decreases our fee rate, and if you think about it, pretty simply the S&P has significantly outperformed global and emerging markets, and we have seen significant dollar strengthening by somewhere between 20% and 25% versus the pound in the Europe. And what does that do to us, that actually causes our dollar denominated assets to increase, which have lower fees versus products in Europe and Asia and especially in the emerging markets. Now bear in mind, over that time period, there really were no meaningful fee cuts to speak of, but obviously we did launch the core in the fall of 2012. Last year, just to true-up that chart, the fee rate declined about 1 basis point despite another year of positive organic fee growth in a tough market and I think we have talked a lot about that where the trends were generally the same. But if you look back whether it was, we really generated organic base fee growth of 6% in 2013, in 2014, and 2015; and while it dipped 1% last year we generated 5% organic base fee growth in the first quarter and that's even with the fee cuts that we have announced both in fixed income and iShares. So I think the bottom line really is divergent beta and FX in many cases, which is re-pricing in some respects $5 trillion of assets everyday, but I also think that we are as Larry mentioned we really feel that we are as well positioned as we have ever been to grow not only assets but also base fees in a variety of markets and really differentiate ourselves in terms of organic growth through a variety of market cycles. Operator : Your next question comes from Bill Katz with Citi. Bill Katz : Okay. Good morning and thank you so much for taking the question this morning. Just coming back to the dynamics of fee rates for a moment I think in that same article that reiterated likelihood that fee rates will continue to work lower in the industry which I think is pretty widely understood now. So my questions is when you start thinking about the conversations you are having with the retail distributors at the point of, around point of sale economics what's happening with that dialog because the way I see is that that's sort of like a fixed rate somewhere 5-10 basis points and as I imagine fee rate continues to work lower than economic margin are under a lot of strain in my view and is technology the answer how do you sort of explain to that plays out? Laurence Fink : I mean, look Bill I think fee rates going down, I think as a reality of what's happening some of that is mix shift some of that is changing regulation in terms of distribution. Some of that will ultimately, will all accrue to the benefits of the end client. I think ultimately this comes down to our ability to generate sustainable alpha I think if we can generate sustainable alpha in a way that in some ways kind of captures three to four time the fee overtime I think will be fine. If we are in a period of significantly lower returns and lower sustainable alpha then obviously I think the fee rates are going to have to come down accordingly. Gary Shedlin : So let me just add to that. One of the things that is happening is that the financial advisers are looking for lower cost products. So first there was shift and they need to go to a firm that has a wide range of products both active and passive and then secondly they need to look where they can find best value at the best price. Both of those really bode well for BlackRock and that is why Larry used the words in his brief deliberate and strategic investments that we are making. So we are making those investments in those core types of products that we know the financial advisers will need to be able to do the appropriate asset allocation they need at the best value and the best price. So that shift is actually moving in our direction. Laurence Fink : Let me just put it into a different context to, I think this is missing in the narrative. There is a greater believe that long term return are structurally lower than they were 10 and 20 years ago. So if you have an expected long term return of let\u2019s say 6% which many people think there might be high when you look at balance portfolio? Fees take up a lot of that return. And as long as we believe the world is going to be in a low return environment our clients are under a lot of pressure. And clients are looking for different ways of seeking those outcomes. And this is why I actually believe why more clients are coming to us now because they have the structural problem. Their liability or their actuarial needs are greater than they can earn with our asset base and so they are looking at them or they are looking to have less expensive product but they are looking for a much more holistic solution and I think the era where a manager sold a product a sole product that is what's being threatened today. And as Rob just said we are in a great position with our clients to try to help them with these really difficult issues we have had a couple of state funds announced that they are lowering their actuarial rates that's very hard to do if a state fund lowers their actuarial rate that means they have to go to their union and say pay more that means they have to go to state and say contribute more. And so, this is one of the real issues that I think is being lost it's being so when you talk about or when we talk about fee pressure fee pressure comes from the real issue of lower expected returns and I think this is one of the big issues around hedge funds and why we are constantly reading about some hedge funds closing some hedge funds are lowering their fees because the fee structures are just too large versus the returns on a risk adjusted basis that they are achieving so this is a broad based issue. It's not just in the wealth management area. It's across spectrum of clients. I know I am belaboring this point but I think it's a very important point but this is the environment we all live in. and I think this is the environment that really positions BlackRock in a very differentiated way. So we understand this problem we are dealing with this issue and we are taking advantage of it. I believe it that. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Michael Carrier : Hi there. How are you doing? Yes, I guess many of questions, just on you mentioned in the past and more recently some investments on like the tech side, artificial intelligence new machine learning and just wanted to get a sense like when we think about that opportunity you are looking at it more like from a product, from the active teams using those as tools being able to help clients out is it a cost initiative. Just wanted to get some granularity on where do you see kind of the opportunities around some of these investments? Laurence Fink : Let's be clear. Technology creates efficiency across everything so we look at technology not just for portfolio construction, portfolio management we are using it for clients connectivity we are using it for efficiencies within our platform. The technology advancements we made in Aladdin related to dealing with the custodial banks saves us large sums of money. So I want to talk about technology is changing every component of our firm. And I think this is one of the reasons why our margins have been consistently strong by the utilization of technology across all the spectrums. You ask specifically related to technology, related to investing because the advancement in technology, because utilization is centered technology, because the internet playing a role in everything and anything we do there is information that we could not search for four, five years ago, whether it is communication by employees about their firms and consumer sentiments about product and so by having the ability to deep dive on data interpreting that data through different algorithms and models hopefully we will be creating excess alpha so it creates product, creates product returns and so that's where we look at the greatest amount of advancements. We are also looking at computers and can computers be learning and adapting in markets. But that's something for the future. But importantly, technology today for data analysis, technology for very quick analysis of that data is going to be really the key component of driving I believe returns in active investing in the future. And I do believe because technology has created the efficiencies it creates more efficiencies across and we can pass on those efficiencies also to our clients and I think this is one thing that's being missed here we are, we talked about some of the fee cuts and yet we have an increase of 100 basis points in margins. So we look at technology as a great efficiency provider for investing for custodial assets, for communicating with our custodial clients, for communicating with our employees, for communicating with our clients. So it is the key element that is going to transform BlackRock and I would say every other financial services company. So technology is what is driving the scale at BlackRock and its driving hopefully better outcomes for and to our clients. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Michael Cyprys : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So Larry you spoke about building blocks to deliver outcomes and greater use of ETS to generate value. I guess just few thoughts here. One is how far do you see that trend going and I guess the second how do you think about the impact that this has on the value chain for the industry. In other words if this shift toward asset allocation continues and the move towards building blocks and assembling, how do you see the value shifting here and your ability to charge for manufacturing versus the ability to charge for distribution, your ability to charge for assembling and also the value of distribution here. Where is it most sensible and how do you think about evolving your positioning from here? Robert Kapito : So it's Rob here. So fees are really just one aspect of the value proposition. And quite frankly after many years in the business I can't think of a better product to use for asset allocation than ETS. So one is it's going to be a toll where we are going to use it for precision type investments where you can action one specific area of the market in your portfolio, two is that you can actually make better judgments in the active equity space by using what we would call smart data ETS so that would be a bit of a derivative to it but focused on certain factors that you would want to have. Three is that, it's an obvious part of a multi-asset solution which is a growing area of the market where you would have just you need in order to get the returns that Larry is talking about in the low interest rate environment you need to focus on specific sectors of the market and ETS allow you to do that at the right value. And the third thing which I really like is in the fixed income area where the exposure to just one particular fixed income bond is not going to give you the type of return. It's just too much risk for the cost of that. So by using an ETS in that \u2013 in the asset allocation model in your fixed income portion you also are diversifying your risk substantially at a much lower cost. Also the world is moving more towards portfolio construction capabilities. This is going to be in what we are calling models that we are going to be offering. They offer much higher levels of risk management and here is where we can utilize our technology as a differentiator because we can actually deliver a multi-asset solution which has the right risk requirements for that particular clients. And we are building technology around that so you have heard us mention Aladdin portfolio builder were we are giving financial advisers the ability to take a multi-asset portfolio and put it together using our products, using other people's products to come up with the ultimate solution. We are using it in a product that we call iRetire where we are trying to help get in the middle of solving probably the largest problem facing our country and other today which is the lack of savings for retirements, getting those \u2013 getting that cash and sitting on the sidelines working for people those people that are going to retire and being able to illustrate to financial advisers and their clients better capabilities to achieve those result and then also expanding into model portfolios to the financial advisers and to our clients to use to solve their problems. So we have the technology on the outside and then on the inside we have precision instruments through the ETS business that can help our clients achieve their financial objectives. Operator : Your next question is from Robert Lee with KBW. Robert Lee : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Good morning. I just want to maybe talk about the announcement of re-positioning of the equities business in the U.S. and it gets more specifically the changes you announced if I believe, mainly to the U.S. business you didn't \u2013 I don't think made same kind of changes outside the U.S. Can you maybe talk a little bit about why you didn't think some of that re-position was maybe necessary outside the U.S. how that business or market maybe differs or different somewhat you are experiencing here and then maybe compare the two? Gary Shedlin : Hey Rob, it\u2019s Gary. I will just give a little bit of a quick overview and then Larry and Rob can jump in as they feel I mean I think ultimately we are looking at those efficiencies and development and maturity of markets and when we think here about the re-positioning it was \u2013 it really follows much more on the line of how we approached our product segmentation work with iShares a number of years ago at the end of the 2012. And in that case it was really trying to align who the particular buyers of a product were with the right fees and in this case it was really trying to align our ability to generate sustainable alpha in certain products with the fee potential and so if you think about segmenting the products between kind of core alpha and high conviction in some respect I think it's somewhat of an acknowledgment that in many parts of the U.S. large cap market in particular ability to really generate sustainable alpha and still charge premium fees in terms of very broad based portfolios that really tinker around indexes I don't want investors like index having per say but your ability to take risk and generate incremental return needs to be much more closely aligned with the fee potential and so it was reallocating in that we really try to align fee with the ability to generate a certain level of sustainable alpha. Outside of the U.S. market in lesser developed market less efficient markets more disperse and less correlation I think we still feel very strongly in places like Europe and Asia and certain emerging markets that frankly give ability to generate sustainable alpha can support higher fees and I think our performance has certainly show that overtime. Laurence Fink : So let me jump in there. So this is not just a U.S. announcement that we made we are talking about our platform Rob and our platform is going forward believing that both human and technology is better than one or the other. So, in the platform that the portfolio managers are going to be using, going forward they are going to have the ability to tap in to both the data that we are getting from our technology, from our scientific activity equity groups and the fundamental groups because we believe that those people talking together using the data, using the signals that we are getting and the block and tackle fundamental approach together are better than either individually. So it is a platform change that we made it did have because of the reasons Gary cited more immediate attention on the U.S. but it's a platform change that we are making globally in our active investment business. Operator : Your next question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Daniel Fannon : Good morning guys. Just a quick question on kind of Aladdin and the technology business as more clients adapt the platform at what point does the platform become too big or there has been articles out there about potentially introducing systemic risk into the system if \u201ceverybody is on your platform\u201d that they are using the same technology that you guys are talking. Laurence Fink : Well that's pretty complex question. So and I don't think there is a risk of it being too big. So let me try to deconstruct your question. Aladdin is more than just a risk management platform. It's an enterprise platform. So, there are many companies that provide enterprise platform for different companies whether it's Oracle or SAP or cloud computing so an enterprise system and that's what Aladdin really is because it's front middle and back office platform and a component of it is risk management. I think you are referring to the risk management component of it. It's a service model. We provide with different models each individual client can put their own algorithms on to Aladdin that are customized for them. So they can interpret the model. So it's not a platform that is monolithic with one model. And so the notion that the fact that many people use it that it becomes systemic is just not a point of understanding what the platform really is. I think by the client interest the opportunities we have the opportunities are as large as ever. And it is because of its enterprise solution and as we now have Aladdin provider working with the custodial banks ultimately it's going to simplify our trading, trade entry compliance working alongside with the custodial bank to create so much more efficiencies for the users across the Aladdin system. So if we could provide for Aladdin, for other clients this enterprise system that creates these efficiencies that make them in a better position we are all better off from it. So it's once again Aladdin is a service model it's not BlackRock's models. And so I think we are happy to give you a demo on Aladdin what it is and what it isn't. Operator : Our final question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous. Patrick Davitt : Hey good morning. Thanks for taking the question. On the active re-positioning and the charges taken there as well as the move of the custody asset, I am curious if all of these moves are really about helping pass those savings on to the client and absorb the fee cuts we are talking about or should we start to see some visible improvement to your operating results because of these moves? Gary Shedlin : Well, Patrick it\u2019s Gary. I\u2019m hoping, you will see both I mean, as Rob said, part of the reposition, the active portfolio was basically changed to use scale to bring better outcomes to clients obviously in terms of better sustainable alpha at a more efficient price point for them. But the intent at the end of the day is to generate incremental growth for BlackRock shareholders by having a better value proposition in terms of price and performance that we think ultimately will drive better organic growth. In terms of some of the things you mentioned around just leveraging service providers in many cases, in certain instances our clients pay those fees in which case that will be a direct benefit to them and in certain cases as if in our ETF which is a unitary price structure BlackRock itself pays those fees. So our shareholders will clearly benefit so I think that in all cases we\u2019re going to basically try to use our scale to drive growth that growth is ultimately better for both clients as well as shareholders and I think as you look at margin expansion over whether it\u2019s just the last year-over-year or 100 basis points or frankly even since we closed the BGI deal at the end of 2009 and margins are probably up 400 to 500 plus basis points since then. And I think there is no question that we\u2019re using our scale to generate better outcomes for both clients and shareholders. If it\u2019s good for the client at the end of the day we strongly believe it\u2019s going to be good for the BlackRock shareholder. Operator : Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks. Laurence Fink : Yes, thank you for all joining us this morning and for your continued interest in our firm. Our first quarter results once again highlights the investments we made to enhance a differentiation at BlackRock\u2019s diverse global platform. We continue to take a long term view and stay ahead of, and navigating near term developments in the financial and economic landscape on behalf of our clients and importantly on behalf of our shareholders for that. Have a good quarter. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s teleconference, you may now disconnect.",

My name is Jamie and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today\u2019s call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President; Robert S. Kapito, and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference. Christopher Meade : Thank you. This is Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock\u2019s actual results may of course differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC which list some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So with that, I will turn it over to Gary. Gary Shedlin : Thanks, Chris and good morning everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to present results for the second quarter of 2017. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I will review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results. BlackRock\u2019s globally integrated technology and investment platform continues to position us as the solutions provider of choice to both retail and institutional clients. The breadth and scale of our capabilities allows us to continuously and efficiently reinvest in our investment, distribution, technology and risk management franchises in order to provide increase by its both clients and shareholders over time. As a result of that commitment to reinvest, net inflows for the last 12 months totaled $336 billion as organic growth accelerated in the second quarter. Total quarterly flows exceeded $100 billion and were positive across client types, asset classes and investment styles highlighting the uniqueness of our diversified investment platform, which includes cash, market cap weighted index products, a spectrum of active offerings from smart beta and factors to high conviction alpha strategies, and illiquid alternatives. Second quarter long-term net inflows of $94 billion were a record for BlackRock and represented an annualized organic asset growth rate of 7%. Annualized organic base fee growth was 8% for the quarter and 5% for the last 12 months despite the pricing changes we have previously announced over the last 9 months. Record quarterly revenue of $3 billion was 6% up over a year ago. Operating income of $1.2 billion was also 6% higher than a year ago and earnings per share of $5.24 increased 10%. Non-operating results for the quarter reflected $26 million of net investment gains, an increase from the second quarter of 2016 due to higher marks in the current quarter and the impact of our debt refinancing last quarter. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was 30.5%. We continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable projected tax run-rate for the remainder of 2017 though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of additional discrete items and tax law changes that could arise during the year. Second quarter base fees rose 7% year-over-year driven primarily by the positive impact of organic growth and market appreciation on average AUM partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange movements and certain previously announced pricing changes not reflected in last year\u2019s second quarter. While the dollar has recently given up gains versus major currencies, the impact of dollar appreciation over the last year still reduced our quarterly year-over-year base fee growth by about 1%. Sequentially, base fees were up 6% and benefited from higher securities lending revenue in the second quarter, which increased 11% driven by seasonality and higher on loan balances. Last month at the Morgan Stanley Conference, I spoke about several exogenous factors, including divergent beta and FX that have negatively impacted our blended fee rate over the last several years and masked the benefit we have achieved from executing our differentiated growth strategy. As some of these headwinds lessened during the second quarter with emerging markets outperforming U.S. markets and the U.S. dollar weakening, our blended fee rate has stabilized and the impact of our accelerating organic base fee growth should become more apparent. Performance fees of $48 million decreased $26 million from the prior year due to weaker relative performance and long-only equity funds with annual locks in the second quarter. Technology and risk management revenue of $164 million increased 12% year-over-year driven by several clients going live on the Aladdin platform and new client wins. Market demand remains strong for our full range of products, including institutional Aladdin, Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management, provider Aladdin, iRetire and FutureAdvisor. Clients continue to seek sophisticated risk analytics, portfolio construction, and scalable distribution tools and our first three Aladdin risk for wealth management clients went live on the platform earlier in the quarter. In line with our strategic focus on technology to enhance value and deliver innovative solutions to clients, we announced the acquisition of Cachematrix, a leading provider of financial technology that simplifies the cash management process for corporate treasury clients and the minority investment in scalable capital, one of the fastest growing digital investment managers in Europe. Together with our minority investment in iCapital, we believe BlackRock can significantly enhance the growth profile of these businesses, while simultaneously benefiting from their unique capabilities. The strong organic growth we are experiencing today is a result of the investments we have made in our business over time and we continue to invest aggressively to create more opportunity for the future. Expense increased 6% year-over-year and 3% sequentially driven primarily by higher volume related expense as a result of higher average AUM and higher G&A expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up $24 million or 2% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher headcount. Sequentially, compensation expense was down 2% reflecting lower seasonal employer payroll taxes in the current quarter and $20 million of one-time expense associated with the repositioning of our active equity platform in the prior quarter. The accelerating shift to passive is impacting growth in our volume related expense and direct fund expense was up $29 million or 15% year-over-year primarily reflecting significant growth in our iShares franchise. G&A expense was up $34 million or 11% year-over-year reflecting increased levels of spend to drive growth, including investments in technology and data and higher discretionary marketing and promotional spend. Year-over-year comparisons were also impacted by the timing of certain accruals and additional expense related to the sale of our UK defined contribution platform. Sequentially, G&A expense increased $49 million from the first quarter or 16% reflecting similar increases in technology, data and marketing spend, but also higher foreign exchange remeasurement expense in the current quarter. Assuming stable markets and giving the timing and levels of our spend in the first half of 2017, we would anticipate planned G&A expense for the second half of 2017 to be in the range of $750 million. Our first quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 43.9% was flat year-over-year and up 130 basis points sequentially. As we have stated in the past, we do not manage the business to a specific margin target, but remain committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible by leveraging the benefits of our scale for both clients and shareholders. We are also committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first reinvesting in our business and then returning excess cash to shareholders. In line with that commitment in the second quarter, we closed the acquisition of First Reserve\u2019s Infrastructure Equity Funds. Larry will talk more about additional investments in innovation across the broader ecosystem to support future growth. We also repurchased an additional $275 million worth of shares in the second quarter and stand by previous guidance as it relates to share repurchases for the remainder of the year. Second quarter long-term net inflows of $94 billion were positive across client types and diversified across asset classes and investment styles. Long-term net inflows were driven by iShares, which crossed $1.5 trillion of global AUM in the quarter and continue to benefit from the accelerating global shift to fee based advisory in the wealth channel and the rapid adoption of iShares ETFs as asset allocation tools and financial instruments by professional money managers. Global iShares generated record quarterly net inflows of $74 billion representing 21% annualized organic growth with strength across our core and non-core exposures. In the nine months since we announced pricing changes to the core in October of last year, we have already recaptured over 75% of our investment through organic growth alone. iShares equity net inflows of $52 billion reflected demand for core ETFs cross both developed and the emerging market exposures and strong inflows into higher fee precision exposures and smart beta ETFs. Fixed income iShares net inflows of $21 billion were led by flows into investment grade corporate, emerging market bond and treasury funds. Our institutional business generated $13 billion with long-term net inflows across both active and index strategies. Institutional active net inflows of $5 billion were driven by strong multi-asset and alternative inflows, partially offset by equity and fixed income outflows. Multi-asset flows were driven by our LifePath target date series which is our record net inflows of $9 billion. We also saw strength in fiduciary mandates and factors each with approximately $1 billion of net inflows, alternatives generated nearly $2 billion of net inflows driven primarily by our global infrastructure franchise. Institutional index net inflows of $9 billion reflected strong flows the $17 billion into fixed income, partially offset by index equity outflows of $9 billion as several large clients made strategic asset allocation decisions during the quarter. Retail net inflows of $7 billion were positive in the U.S. and internationally led by fixed income and index equity products partially offset by outflows from multi-asset. Fixed income net inflows of $7 billion were diversified across our top performing platform and included $1 billion of inflows into unconstrained strategies as well as strong flows into municipals and total return strategies. While total multi-asset flows were once again impacted by outflows from world allocation strategies. Our multi-asset income strategy nevertheless raised another $2 billion during the quarter as investors continued to target income oriented outcomes. BlackRock\u2019s second quarter results reflect the benefits of our ongoing commitment to continuously invest for the future, our diversification, scale and globally integrated investment in technology platform enables us to generate differentiated and more consistent organic growth in AUM and based fees resulting in long-term value creation for both clients and shareholders. With that I will turn it over to Larry. Laurence Fink : Thanks Gary. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call. BlackRock\u2019s second quarter results reflect the trust our clients continue to place in our global investment and technology platform BlackRock\u2019s ability to partner with clients across our broad range of investment strategies and technology solutions and as a thought leader drove $104 billion of total net inflows in the quarter with a record $94 billion in long-term strategies which were positive across all client types, product types and investment styles. While significant cash remains on the sidelines, investors have begun to put more other assets to work and global equity markets continue to rise in the quarter underscoring a generally healthier global economy and proving that so far markets have been resilient the political shocks. Through the second quarter the S&P was up 8% year to-date reaching all-time highs and many international markets have even outperformed. At the same time while markets have started to anticipate a normalization, a policy in the environment of sustained expansion, negative yields remain a reality in some countries and expectations for a continued low yield environment persists. And while amounts of cash is still are un-invested and the ongoing risk of both economic and political disruption on the horizons, investors continue to face challenges in meeting their clients future need. Both institutional and retail clients are looking to BlackRock for investment strategies and for Aladdin risk management and portfolio construction technology. They are also turning to BlackRock for our insights to help them understand how to navigate the investment landscape. Insurance companies are one example of clients that continued to face significant challenges in this low yield environment. Last month\u2019s leveraging BlackRock\u2019s extensive experience with the needs of insurance clients and risk modeling capabilities we launched an insurance industry risk study, we took the investment portfolios of the entire U.S. insurance industry at the individual security line item level, uploading them onto Aladdin and then cut the data in a variety of ways, the fee was taking what kinds of risk and how are they are being rewarded for that type of risk. And we brought together a group of insurance companies CEOs to talk about the results, to answer questions like what is the current opportunities set in their own individual portfolio and how should they be positioned in the event of a stressed economy or another crisis. We also showed the CEOs how their investment positions reflected versus their peers. And so as the incredible peer analysis for the CEOs, our goal was to provide them with more information to look to BlackRock to help them making strategic decisions that would ultimately drive their stakeholder returns. This is just one example BlackRock is increasingly using our technology, our scale and innovative ways to enhance the value that we can provide to our clients. As the wealth management landscape evolves globally, our intermediary partners are accelerating their movement, their changes towards a fee-based advisory and fee-based accounts and are expected to grow by upward of $8 trillion in the U.S. over the next several years. As a result our wealth partners are placing more emphasis than ever before on portfolios not just a product, not just an individual bond or not just an individual stock. There also focused on both performance and the value that the underlying investors provide to investors and increasingly our partners are looking for access to high quality portfolio construction and digital technologies to help execute repeatable processes. In this environment BlackRock is able to provide more value to wealth management clients than ever before and in the U.S. through technology like Aladdin risk for wealth management which I will talk about in a few minutes. The reinvention of our sales model and tech enabled an advisor engagement had allowed us to partner with 25% more financial advisors this year than we did at the same point last year at no additional cost. The combination of BlackRock\u2019s differentiated technology offerings and our broad based investment platforms position us as a most sophisticated portfolio construction partner in the industry for both institutions and wealth managers. Looking at flows for the quarter BlackRock saw $8 billion of active net flows driven by multi-asset fixed income and alternatives which contributed to strong organic base fee growth in the quarter. BlackRock is seeing increasingly strong fund raising momentum in the liquid alternatives with $9 billion in flows and commitments year-to-date with particularly strengthened infrastructure funds as the investments we have made in our platform over time are resonating with our clients. Our acquisition of First Reserve infrastructure equity funds which closed in the quarter adds a talented team with specific expertise in energy infrastructure investing and $3 billion of assets to our platform. We now have over $16 billion of total investment and commitment infrastructure capital to manage on behalf of our clients. We also launched the UK first alternative solution fund earlier this month. The fund offers pension searching for yield, a long-term outcome oriented strategy in a single portfolio, which again leverages BlackRock\u2019s specialist teams across credit, real estate and infrastructure. We now managed $98 billion of assets across our core alternative platform and have an additional $15 billion of committed capital to invest going forward. BlackRock saw $86 billion of net inflows into iShares and index funds in the second quarter. Global iShares momentum continued with a record $74 billion of net inflows for a total of $138 billion of net inflows year-to-date. As growth continues following our strategic investment to lower prices for clients, we generated $35 billion of inflows in iShares\u2019 core funds in the quarter. Importantly non-core iShares exposures generated over $38 billion of flows contributing to a higher organic base fee growth for the firm. The rapid growth we are seeing in iShares is increasingly due to the fact that ETFs are no longer used only as a passive allocation, but by active investors that generate alpha in their portfolios. ETF provide those investors targeting exposures without the idiosyncratic risk of any one single stock or one any single bond. Accelerating growth is also coming from the investments we are making more broadly to innovate across the entire ETF ecosystem. This is more than just a product innovation, it\u2019s innovation and distribution, it\u2019s innovation and portfolio construction, technology and ETF and portfolio construction education and in building new markets for new users, all of which foster further adaptation of ETFs worldwide. As we deepen our partnership with clients and continue to strengthen our brand through both investment and technology offerings, global iShares market share of year-to-date flows has expanded to more than 40%. Fixed income ETFs are a great example of the area where broad ecosystem innovation is driving growth. After several years of BlackRock working with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners on the mechanics of fixed income ETFs, accounting guidelines will now treat them as bonds instead of equities they will treat it as they look through treatment to the underlying assets making it much more efficient for insurers to own fixed income ETFs or their portfolios. Another example is the new segment for ETS we recently announced changes in our iShares ETF MBB, the industry flagship mortgage-backed security ETF, to drive accelerated growth. We are evolving MBB or our mortgage backed bond ETF to become the leading financial instruments and I want to underline risk management tool for institutions to access fully funded exposures to physical mortgage pools. By lowering the price to make the fund competitive with direct investments in mortgage securities, institutions will have a more efficient a more liquid option for hedging their mortgage-backed exposures and their direct mortgage origination. We also launched BlackRock\u2019s first self-index ETFs, two smart beta fixed-income ETFs. These new indexes are based on unique intellectual property and leveraging the best of BlackRock\u2019s analytics and modeling capabilities to achieve superior investment outcomes for clients. This illustrates one of the ways we are using our scale and technology to reduce manufacturing costs and pass along greater savings to our clients. Technology is transforming the asset management industry as that pace of technology innovation is accelerating. I have talked about BlackRock\u2019s aspirational target of 30% of our revenues being enabled by technology 5 years from now that is the vision for how I believe technology will help drive revenues and create efficiencies across BlackRock. Some of that vision will be driven by growth in Aladdin and our technology offerings, but much of it will come from using technology to drive investment performance and build better distribution capabilities ultimately delivering growth in base fees and performance fees. And in addition, I am using this target as a mechanism to get all 13,000 of BlackRock\u2019s employees to understand how technology and the utilization of technology is going to change, BlackRock is going to change our client\u2019s needs and will change the entire ecosystem in what we do. Technology will impact all aspects of our business, the way we generate alpha, the way we build portfolios, the way we manage risk, the way we distribute solutions, the way we engage with service providers, the way we operate and even the way we source talent. Aladdin\u2019s portfolio and risk management technology continues to be in demand by institutional clients looking to invest and operate smarter and with more efficiencies. We now have nearly 200 institutional clients using Aladdin. Our investment teams are combining big data and machine learning with traditional fundamental human analysis to generate better sustainable alpha for our clients. As portfolios become increasingly complex and interconnected, we are leveraging our analytical and risk management technology to create more sophisticated and more scalable portfolio construction. Asset allocation and risk management tools for wealth management. Our first three Aladdin risk for wealth management clients are now live and they are benefiting from the Aladdin technology. We are also providing our wealth management partners with integrated digital distribution platform, so they can reach and interact with their end investors in a more scalable, in a more repeatable way. Building on our acquisitions of FutureAdvisor, our investment in iCapital, we continue to expand our digital distribution capabilities with an acquisition of Cachematrix, and a minority investment in scalable capital. Both platforms will allow us to provide our clients with scalable technology-enabled solutions. In addition to driving growth, we are using Aladdin to drive operating efficiencies. The investments we made in our trading technology and operations have dramatically reduced the cost of our trades. We have reduced our trades by 80% over the last 5 years. This has been a huge reduction in those basic costs and is totally driven by technology. Going forward, technology-enabled scale will be increasingly important for every aspect of an asset managers business, our client service, our asset generation and operational excellence. This year, we will be spending $1 billion on technology and data and have over 3,500 employees working on technology and data-related roles. We recently signed a 20-year lease for a new global headquarters at Hudson Yards in New York, which will be the state-of-the-art hub that is technologically advanced, environmentally sustainable and operationally resilient. Our new headquarters will epitomize our tech-centric culture and create a world-class experience for our people and our clients. As I have said many times but I made it as much as ever today, I have never seen more opportunities for BlackRock than I do today. The record growth we are seeing is a direct result of the investments we made to build our platform over time, continuing to invest in high growth areas of our business and moving into the adjacent areas to enhance the solutions we can offer to our clients both remain a critical priorities in order to drive future growth and provide increased value to both our clients and to our shareholders. With that, let me open up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Laurence Fink : Hi, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Hello, there. So, I want to get a little follow-up on the Aladdin for wealth. So, we have been watching you invest in this. We turned three on this quarter. I am assuming there is not much in the way of revenue yet and it\u2019s more expense upfront. So maybe as we roll forward say over the next year or so what are we supposed to think about in terms of I am sure there is a lot of training going on behind the scenes, what kind of uptake should we expect and when do you think we will see it show up in both revenues and flows, because retail still 10% of AUM, but I like you have a lot of high hopes for this investment? Gary Shedlin : So Glenn, it\u2019s Gary. Good morning. I think we are obviously working very hard on an active pipeline for Aladdin risk for wealth management. I think part of \u2013 but first of all it\u2019s generating revenue today. Obviously, there are long implementations as there are for any Aladdin implementation which could be as long as 12 months to 18 months where we bear more significant cost upfront as we have talked about before. But I think really the clients that we had are \u2013 we are all still learning together about all of the amazing things that we can do with these clients both from the top-down, in terms of some of the risk and compliance opportunities and then more importantly some of the other bottoms-up more specific financial advisor opportunities regarding portfolio construction and asset allocation that move from advisor on. So I think it\u2019s hard for us to basically specify any given level of revenue other than to say that we think it\u2019s going to accelerate significantly over the next couple of years both as we continue to adopt new opportunities with the existing clients and basically work through the pipeline of new opportunities going forward. Laurence Fink : Glenn, I would very similar to institutional implementations, Aladdin for wealth management is actually even more complex, because we are in that dealing with let\u2019s say dozens of portfolio managers, ultimately Aladdin for wealth management is going to be delta to house level at the CIO level and then ultimately it will be implemented maybe depending on each firm at the individual financial advisor level. And this will allow us to have on opportunity to be at our financial advisor\u2019s desktops. So the actual implementation probably it is a little longer, because of the significance of the scale of it, but let\u2019s be clear this may become one of the great opportunities for BlackRock. We are going to continue to be driving more and more of the opportunities for Aladdin for wealth management. I see this being our transformation for our position in retail globally. And what I believe this does, it allows BlackRock to be even more important than the overall ecosystem of \u2013 in wealth management. It gives us, the Aladdin system will provide portfolio construction tools, it provides risk management, it is not a tools to sell only BlackRock products, it is a tool that enhance the wealth managers value proposition. They will be able to use other products on another firms, but we believe by having that placement in the desktop that placement and we have seen this in other areas, it gives us that that opportunity to have deeper, better dialogues. And so we look at this as one more fundamental long-term strategies for positioning. And as Gary suggested, there are revenues now, but the revenues are very [indiscernible] to how the institutional side are there are very modest and the margins are subdued during this process of implementation. And once utilized depending on how well they are utilized by the amount of financial advisors then we would expect increased utilization and through increased utilization will revenues from the platform. Operator : Our next question is from line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Laurence Fink : Hi Ken. Ken Worthington : Hi, good morning. The SGA conducted a review on the mutual fund industry with some conclusions on the competitiveness of the market and on pricing, what sort of reactions have you seen from that review and how might this parallel your minority stake in scalable capital? Gary Shedlin : Well, I think that we as all \u2013 hey Ken, it\u2019s Gary, as always you I think we obviously support a better ecosystem for investors. We think that to the extent that there is a better ecosystem that supports more transparency for investors and they feel more comfortable, they will obviously put more money to work. So I think we are obviously broadly supportive of a lot of what\u2019s in the study. We are just debriefing, in fact we are going to be going through it in more detail. But I think that everything there feels constructive. We are supportive of basically trying to inform how we do business in a more transparent manner with investors and we will be making and obviously continuing to work with the regulators to make additional comments to affect we try and optimize that going forward. But I think we feel that we are incredibly well positioned from the study to drive our business. I think the U.S. in many respects in terms of the most of the changes that\u2019s occurred here in terms of the migration to fee based planning which we think is obviously where Europe is going to go positions us incredibly well to learn and to basically effectuate that opportunity. And I think our desire to basically grow that is exactly why we looked for an opportunity like scalable capital to do it in a matter that will help us evolve with the marketplace. Laurence Fink : Along the question with scalable capital or any digital advise it\u2019s a portal that is offering low fee products such as ETFs is going to be of greater value, we did not. We bought scalable capital on a macro base we believe in that as Gary said the U.S. experience will be similar in Europe. And so once again we are trying to take a couple steps ahead of our clients. And we are I think paying a good attention to the ecosystem changes that the regulators are evolving themselves in terms of making this a better environment for more investors. One thing I would say the key issue for Europe is over 72% of all savings is in cash in Europe. One of the great reasons why PE ratios are lower in Europe than the United States is most savers are only in cash and bank deposits. If through regulatory changes, through digital advise, through low cost alternatives, if we could provide Europeans with a better alternative that they look towards for investing overall a long horizon by being positioned there with digital technology with our iShares brand in Europe, I think we are as well positioned as any firm in the whole continent. Operator : Your next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Laurence Fink : Hi, Craig. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks. Good morning everyone. To the data shows the ETFs aren\u2019t jut stealing share from mutual funds or active managers, but also from other sources like single security investors including in short retail investors, so the industry is stealing wallet share financial assets and total retail flows have actually accelerated in 2017 despite the DLO world, do you have any data or thought taking share behind this trend to help us think about how much of iShares\u2019 growth is actually coming from outside of the asset management industry? Gary Shedlin : Well, I think you cited it quite well and I cited it in my prepared talks. We are seeing regulatory changes change the ETFs environment. We do believe we see accelerated flows, because the method to because of the movement towards the fiduciary role in the United States. We are seeing more active investors using ETFs to express their exposures which I talked about. I think that is accelerating having the insurance commissioners changing capital, having a look through treatment for fixed income ETFs is very important because insurance industry did not use ETFs because the differential in capital charges just because of the CUSIP number and now you have a look through treatment and so we believe the environment for ETFs is continuing to evolve. We believe it\u2019s continuing to grow and much of it also has to do with the ecosystem innovation. I think what we are doing in the mortgage backed area is going to have even a large opportunity for ETF growth as we can now use ETFs as a vehicle to hedge mortgage production. So I think what\u2019s going on is \u2013 and then I\u2019ll let Rob Kapito to speak up, I do believe you are seeing more utilization of ETFs from institutions and retail as a foreign exposure. In the active side, we are seeing more utilization across the board in more products and I think that\u2019s what we are starting to see that acceleration. Before Rob speaks, I just want to say one important point, index and ETF still only represent 10% of the entire equity market global capitalization. And here we are talking about a great amount of flows with $160 odd trillion global equity market capitalization we have much more opportunities for ETFs to grow not just in equities, but in fixed income. And I believe this is just the beginning. It reminds me of when Rob and I were young driving the mortgage-backed securities market in the late 70s, early 80s or for me in the late 70s, Rob. Rob, any comments? Robert Kapito : Yes. First of all, I am younger than you, but second of all, Craig, I think it\u2019s not just stealing market share, what\u2019s obvious, where that\u2019s coming from, whether it be mutual funds or whether it become futures or others. What\u2019s exciting is new areas that are being created with the awareness of ETFs that not only can that be used for hedging vehicles, they can be used as Larry mentioned in the insurance area now with mortgage-backed securities which as you know are very expensive to buy because of prepayments and because of custodial costs. So, there is new and newer uses for ETFs every single day and that\u2019s why what we are trying to do is respond and be in front of our clients and we have to go out and discuss with them ways that they can use ETFs that they have not been able to use them before. So, I would say it\u2019s not only stealing market share, it\u2019s creating new market share which is really the big opportunity for all of us. Gary Shedlin : One last thing I would say that\u2019s really important, historically, many institutions used derivative swaps or futures for hedging purposes and that was very obscure and nontransparent. What we are now seeing whether it\u2019s a bank, a trading desk or a bank balance sheet, an insurance company, a mortgage originator, we are now starting to see more and more utilization of ETFs, which is transparent. So, we look at this as a net positive. And when people talk about this or not taken into the context, how large derivative swap in futures have been and now \u2013 which was totally nontransparent and now all this activity is moving much more on to a transparent platform, which obviously is one of the reason why you are seeing the growth. And the other thing I would just say and Rob talked about it we are seeing more and more investors instead of buying individual stocks or individual bonds are using ETFs to get their exposures. Christopher Meade : Their next question? Operator : Your next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Gary Shedlin : Good morning. Brennan Hawken : So just wanted to follow-up on Gary\u2019s comments about the fee rate, so I know that you walked through the fact that it\u2019s stable which is certainly attributed to the reversals from the divergent beta and FX as you highlighted. I am just kind of curious whether or not is it too much to expect that some of the reversal of those trends that have hindered your fee rate over the last few years could actually turn into tailwinds which might allow for the fee rate to expand or is stability the best way we should think about it? And I know that sometimes averages can cause the numbers on a quarterly basis to not necessarily reflect the whole story. So, when we think about the exit rate coming out of the quarter here, how should we think about the fee rate here tactically more in the near-term too? Thanks. Gary Shedlin : Thanks, Brennan. Good question. So, again, I just want to take a step back again just back to the Morgan Stanley Conference, so we talked there about the fact that the blended fee rate over the last several years has obviously been impacted by a variety of factors that we don\u2019t control. We have talked about them as exogenous factors. We have obviously pointed to both the Virgin equity beta, dollar appreciation, but importantly also shifting client preferences towards lower risk asset classes and index strategies, especially last year where obviously we saw probably \u2013 we saw a large dispersion between our asset growth rate and our base fee growth rate and that actually has also has an impact by virtue of mix in terms of our fee rate. And I think all of those factors have really masked the benefit we have achieved from executing you know a pretty good differentiated growth strategy. The fee rate declined about 1.4 basis points from the second quarter of last year and that was a continuation of some of the things we have talked about, the impact of international market underperformance, dollar appreciation throughout last year, impact importantly of recent price cuts or what we would rather call an investment in our iShares franchise that were not reflected in last year\u2019s prior second quarter and importantly a slower rate of organic base fee growth relative to asset growth in the second half of last year. Sequentially, the fee rate has stabilized as those headwinds as you mentioned associated with divergent beta and FX have abated and should those trends continue, the impact of our accelerating organic base fee growth rate which has been about 6% year-to-date so far clearly should be more apparent over time. In my opinion know, if we can sustain organic based fee growth in excess of 5%, frankly, we have done that in 2012, \u201813, \u201814, \u201815 and year-to-date this year, last year was really the first year in the last five that we didn\u2019t do that. I am not really sure why the fee rate itself is garnering that much attention other than I understand that it\u2019s the basis of a lot of the modeling that everybody is doing, but I think right now we are feeling incredibly comfortable with the level of organic base fee growth rate that we are seeing and are paying a little less attention to the overall fee rate as long as we can generate that revenue momentum. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Gary Shedlin : Good morning, Dan. Dan Fannon : Can you discuss the reaction from both clients and your distribution partners from the repositioning of the equity platform earlier this year and in particular maybe talk about some of the flows at the product level and if there is outflows that you anticipate that may still come as a result of those changes? Laurence Fink : So, look we continue to believe in active management. And as clients focus more on outcomes, both the active and the index are going to play a role in portfolios to drive returns. So, we announced changes to our active equity platform in March. These changes were not effective until mid to late June. So, it\u2019s a little early to tell and see any material progress from the re-org of both flows or financial advice, but as anticipated we saw some accelerated outflows from the funds impacted by the changes, which contributed to some of the active equity outflows in the second quarter. But other of our fundamental active equity funds that were in part of the changes to the platform actually saw a slight improvement in outflows and additionally, we had a few large client redemptions from our scientific active equity. But a portion of these outflows were recaptured on our platform as certain clients moved into index strategies. So, our focus is going to be on generating strong performance, which we believe differentiates our ability to work with our clients to achieve their desired long-term outcomes to drive improvements in both the scientific and fundamental active equity funds since last year and there I have already seen some excellent performance in the quantitative side, 92% of our active \u2013 quantitative active equity and 78% of our fundamental active equity assets are above their benchmark and peer mediums for the 3-year period. And then the creation of our advantage series which is offering clients the ability to outperform and have the lowest fees, all of those are showing results and all of this I believe is part of our announcement of Monarch and the upside that we have to come. So we are very encouraged the portfolio managers are energized to be able share information across multiple platforms. We have heard very positive views from our clients because everyone is focused on figuring out how to utilize the big data that\u2019s out there to their advantage to create performance. So the rollout of it has been something that we have gotten very, very good client feedback from and I am very optimistic about it going forward. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Thanks. Hi, good morning everybody. So Larry I want to go back to the comment you made around $1 billion you guys are spending currently on tech and data with over 3,000 people, obviously it\u2019s been and continues to be very important growth area for you guys, but how much I guess do you guys expect that to grow over the next years and which area specifically you targeted more either on the data side or the technology side. And I guess you have just taken a step back, bigger picture, how should we think about overall margins in the tech and risk business as you guys continue to invest and scale this up over the next couple of years? Laurence Fink : Let me let Gary answer that and I will give some color. Gary Shedlin : So good morning Alex, so just to give a little bit of color on the people and the investment, the 3,500 rough cut people in technology and data related roles includes expected technology roles such as programmers and quant modelers, but also less obvious ones that leverage technology and data in a significant way like our iShares analytics and electronic trading teams. So as Larry basically mentioned we are thinking technology much more holistically not as a specific definition, but embracing technology to drive our overall \u2013 our overall business. We are spending about $1 billion this year to support that technology and data initiative which includes a number of things, but also includes compensation and related expenses associated with obviously those people as well as hardware, software and market data costs for the firm more broadly. I think in terms of margins, more broadly know as you know we are not really big on talking about individual margins of vertical businesses and so as we really think about incremental margins on specific products or businesses that\u2019s not an overwhelming or relevant number that we think about day-to-day. But for example to think about driving growth in iShares, as an example we are investing beyond simple product innovation, we are investing in the entire ETF ecosystem, we are investing in distribution or investing in portfolio construction, technology, we are investing in capital markets, ETF and portfolio construction. Education, we are talking about building new markets for new users. And I think there is no question the accelerating growth that we are seeing in iShares is a direct result of those investments more broadly. We are really trying to take a much more portfolio oriented approach to investing in technology and notwithstanding some of things that we are doing that go also through our P&L. You are also seeing us making a number of strategic acquisitions or other investments, sometimes they are controlled like Cachematrix and sometimes they really do get to see that the table and try to learn and help our partners evolve like scalable capital and high capital. I think the important thing is that whichever direction we are going to go, we are going to continue use our scale which we think is a huge driver of our ability to efficiently spend on technology in ways that others can\u2019t really to drive that growth and increased market share for both shareholders and our clients. Laurence Fink : Alex, I would argue in every industry in the world today technology will be changing how we operate, how our clients operate and if we are not aggressively trying to be providing technology to interface with our clients better, technology to create more efficiencies as we operate and technology as we think about how to get better insights we will be \u2013 we will not provide the information and the ideas to our clients. And I believe we need to be driving this faster. And I do believe as I said for quarter and quarter and quarter I believe through this relentless investments we are able to secure deeper, broader relationships with more clients worldwide. I think Aladdin for wealth management is going to allow us to have a much better position going forward with all our distribution partners and helping them to think about the risk for their own clients so they do a better job with their clients. And the key for all of us worldwide if our clients have better outcomes as I talked about Europe and the amount of cash if we can provide better outcomes and better risk information so people look to investing more for the long-term, we will all be better off. And I believe this is an important responsibility and role for BlackRock to use technology to enhance financial literacy [Technical Difficulty] financial literacy to our financial advisors and ultimately financial \u2013 and allowing that technology allow our financial advisors provide better literacy to their clients. And this is something that is we are very aggressive on and I do believe the relentless pace that we have related towards technology puts us in a differentiated position than any other asset manager and we will continue to try to drive technology to make us different. Operator : Your next question is from William Katz with Citigroup. Laurence Fink : Hey Bill. William Katz : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. And this is actually feeds on what you guys are sort of talking about, as you think about the margin, I was trying to look back to your last Analyst Day, it seemed like the formula was some revenue growth, some operating leverage and you get some sort of mid-teens earnings growth on top of that with low capital management, is there a shift here just to more of a top line focus and maybe a little bit more flattening the margin opportunity on a go forward basis and within that, the $750 million [ph] mentioned to sort of second half of planned G&A, could you talk about, is that sort of like the new run rate as you look ahead given the relentless drive to grow the business? Thank you. Gary Shedlin : Thanks Bill. Good morning to you. So look, as we have said in the past week we really don\u2019t manage the business to a specific margin target. And in my view, my personal view quarterly comparisons here are less relevant and you really should look at our performance over a more appropriate period of time especially in the context of the organic growth that we are generating today. Our commitment has not changed. Our commitment has always been to optimize organic growth in the most efficient way possible especially by leveraging our scale for both clients and shareholders. And I think if you look back over the work that we have done since BGI, in particular the operating margin is up well over 500 basis points and we have invested significantly back into the business. We are currently generating record organic growth, especially in terms of base fees. As I mentioned over the last 12 months $335 million plus of net new business, that\u2019s 7% organic AUM growth and importantly 5% organic base fee growth. It was a significant time where people were asking us when we were going to get to those levels. And well, I think it\u2019s still early to call it\u2019s sustainable for a significant period of time. This level of growth is clearly a direct result of the investments that we have made over time. No one likes higher margins than I do or well, maybe the guy sitting next to me actually does, but I also know that our level of organic growth determines our multiple and continuing to invest to support these record levels of organic growth is a critical priority for us and one that will be maintained going forward. While there is obviously an upward bias to our margin as we continue to grow in a constructive environment, I think as Larry indicated in his in his remarks, we intend to continue playing offense by aggressively investing to create more opportunities for future growth. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks? Laurence Fink : I just want to thank everybody for joining us this morning, for your interest in BlackRock. Our second quarter results once again highlights our long-term investments we made to enhance and differentiate BlackRock, it is differentiated because our global investment platform is differentiated because of our global technology platform. We will continue to invest in both our technology and investment capabilities and use our scale to deliver better outcomes for our clients and shareholders. And we are going to use that scale to provide better financial literacy and better long-term results on behalf of our clients which will enable them to invest in more financial assets, we and the whole industry will be better off. We believe we have a good start in doing that and we believe we have deeper, stronger relationship with more clients worldwide than we ever had before, which I believe will lead to future growth for the firm and for our shareholders. Everyone have a very good quarter. And we will talk to you soon. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Operator : Good morning. My name is Jamie and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today\u2019s call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference. Christopher Meade : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019m Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock\u2019s actual results may of course differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC which list some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So with that, I will turn it over to Gary. Gary Shedlin : Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to present results for the third quarter of 2017. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I will review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results. The breadth and scale of BlackRock\u2019s globally integrated investment and technology platform continue to drive strong business and financial results. The impact of the investments we have made over time and continue to make today are driving better alpha-generation, fostering stronger client partnerships and allowing us to more efficiently operate our business. Total quarterly net inflows of $96 billion included long-term net inflows of $76 billion, representing 6% annualized organic asset growth and were positive across client type, investment style and region. BlackRock has now generated over 5% long-term organic asset growth for five consecutive quarters. More importantly, we\u2019ve achieved a long-term organic base fee growth rate of 5% for the last 12 months. Bear in mind, these long-term growth rates don\u2019t include the impact of our cash business, which has generated almost 10% growth over the last year. Record quarterly revenue of $3.2 billion increased 14% year-over-year. Operating income of $1.4 billion and earnings per share of $5.92, both increased 15% versus a year ago. Non-operating results for the quarter reflected $29 million of net investment gains. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 30.6%. Assuming no current year impact from potential future change in tax laws, we continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable projected tax run rate for the fourth quarter of 2017, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of discrete items that could arise in the future. Third quarter base fees rose 10% year-over-year, driven primarily by market appreciation and strong organic base fee growth, partially offset by certain previously announced pricing changes not reflected in last year\u2019s third quarter. Performance fees of $191 million increased $133 million from the prior year and $143 million sequentially, reflecting strong overall performance, more broad-based hedge fund platform and the impact of a single European hedge fund that delivered exceptional full-year performance and locks annually in the third quarter. Technology and risk management revenue of $175 million increased 15% year-over-year, driven by several clients going live on the institutional Aladdin and Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management platforms. Demand remains strong across our full range of technology and risk management capabilities with both retail intermediaries and institutional clients increasingly focused on using technology to improve portfolio construction capabilities, optimize risk management and operate more efficiently. We continue to invest in technology and data initiatives across the firm to generate better alpha, more effectively service existing clients and leverage our global distribution capabilities. Whether investing through the income statement, the inorganic opportunities like FutureAdvisor or Cachematrix are using our balance sheet to make minority investments in fast-growing businesses like Scalable Capital or iCapital. Our goal is to drive profitable growth in both base fees and technology revenue. Total expense increased 13% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher volume-related expense and higher G&A expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up 13% year-over-year and 9% sequentially, primarily reflecting higher incentive compensation, driven by higher performance fees and higher operating income. Direct fund expense was up $34 million, or 17% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher average AUM and significant growth in our iShares franchise. G&A expense was up $51 million, or 60% year-over-year in line with previous guidance, reflecting higher technology and data spend. Current quarter G&A expense also reflected higher professional service fees, FX remeasurement expense and increased contingent consideration fair value adjustments versus a year ago. Our third quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 45% was up 20 basis points year-over-year and up 110 basis points sequentially. While we do not manage the business to a specific margin target, we are very margin-aware and remain committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible. We continue to execute our consistent capital management strategy during the quarter, repurchasing an additional $275 million in common shares and stand by our previous guidance as it relates to share repurchases for the remainder of the year. Third quarter long-term net inflows of $76 billion, representing 6% annualized organic asset growth were positive across client type, investment style and region. Global iShares generated quarterly net inflows of $52 billion, representing 14% annualized organic growth with strength across both core and non-core exposures. In the one year since we repriced the core funds last October, BlackRock has recaptured more than 100% of the annual revenue impact of our investment, primarily through accelerated organic growth and expanded our total U.S. market share of net flows by over 600 basis points. iShares equity net inflows of $33 billion reflected demand for core ETFs across both developed and emerging market exposures and strong inflows into higher fee precision exposures and smart beta funds. Fixed income iShares net inflows of $18 billion reflected continued adoption of fixed income ETFs by a broader set of clients with flows led by treasuries and investment-grade corporate bonds. Retail net inflows of $7 billion were positive in the U.S. and internationally. Fixed income net inflows of $5 billion, once again showcase the strength of our top-performing active platform and include $1 billion into unconstrained strategies, as well as strong flows into municipals, emerging market debt and total return strategies. Multi-asset flows were driven by $1 billion of flows into our multi-asset income fund. Our institutional business generated $16 billion of long-term net inflows in the quarter, positive across index and active. Institutional index net inflows of $16 billion reflected $37 billion into fixed income, driven by significant client demand for LDI strategies, partially offset by equity outflows of $20 billion, as several large clients made strategic asset allocation changes during the quarter. Modest institutional active net inflows were driven by strong multi-asset inflows, reflecting continued demand for our LifePath target-date series and factor strategies, partially offset by active equity outflows. Finally, BlackRock\u2019s cash management business saw $20 billion of net inflows during the quarter, reflecting several large client wins and reached its highest ever level of AUM. BlackRock\u2019s third quarter results reflect the benefits of our ongoing commitment to invest on behalf of our clients and continued execution of our framework for shareholder value creation, differentiated organic growth, operating leverage and consistent capital return. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry. Laurence Fink : Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. BlackRock generated strong results in the third quarter as our differentiated global investment and technology platform increasingly resonates with our clients, driving deeper partnerships than ever before. Over the past year, the market environment has improved considerably. We\u2019ve seen greater political stability in Europe. China is continuing to show economic strength, and after a long period of stagnation, we\u2019re seeing consistent growth in Japan. Overall, the world has become much more resilient. However, large cash balances remain on the sidelines, and many global institutions are invested in assets with return profiles that are not expected to meet their liabilities over time, which is creating significant demand for asset allocation and investment strategies across multiple asset classes. In these times of greater economic certainty, there is also a greater need for people to be invested. In more than any time in history, clients are reaching out to BlackRock for advice and for solutions. We built customized solutions from our investment platform that spans indexed to illiquid alternatives. Our technology and risk management capabilities enable us and our clients to construct better portfolios, generate alpha more consistently, manage risks smarter and scale operations more efficiently. Combined with insights of a BlackRock Investment Institute, we are able to form stronger and more differentiated partnerships with our clients, and all of this is showing up in our flows. As Gary said, BlackRock saw third quarter total net inflows of $96 billion. These flows came from both institutional and retail clients across all major regions and investment styles. We\u2019ve now seen a total of $264 billion of flows so far this year, compared to $202 billion for all of 2016. As we deepen our relationships with clients and partners, we recognize and embrace the growing responsibility we have on a daily basis. It is an enormous responsibility and we take this seriously and we also attempt every day to achieve the responsibilities with our goals. Gary talked about our shareholder value creation framework and organic growth as a primary driver of that framework. Our strategy for growth is centered on being a fiduciary to our clients. This means, investing to be a leader in the areas of high client demand and growth like ETFs, like liquid \u2013 illiquid alternatives. It also means investing to generate differentiated alpha for clients and to enhance our competitive advantages in Aladdin and most importantly technology and to grow our scale. With regulation, technology and market forces transforming the ecosystem for asset and wealth management globally, BlackRock is at the forefront of change in the industry and our focus remains on the long-term for our clients worldwide. In the U.S., there are two major shifts converging in wealth management. First, in one of the largest asset movements, fee-based advisory assets are expected to double by 2020 in the shift from brokerage to fee-based accounts. The second digital technologies are disrupting traditional wealth advisory practices, which create competition for client assets and provides leverage for fast-growing advisory practices. These trends have several major implications for our entire industry. Value for cost is critical to advisers and asset allocation decisions. Advisers are increasingly focused on managing risk and constructing portfolios. Chief Investment Officers are taking more control over asset allocation decisions. So there\u2019s a heightened focus on repeatable systematized practices that can be scaled. Against this backdrop, wealth managers are concentrating their business with fewer asset managers. Demand is increasingly for a strategic partnerships beyond anyone specific investment product. They\u2019re looking for partnerships with BlackRock that we can have ability to bring tremendous value to our relationships to our clients. BlackRock has the building blocks. BlackRock has the technology, and BlackRock has the expertise to glide clients on how to effectively use our scale. Our U.S. wealth advisory sales teams have adopted digital processes to scale and deepen financial adviser engagements. We increased engagements by 23% relative to same time last year, in part by leveraging technology. We\u2019ve held more than 15,000 virtual meetings this year from none two years ago, which has especially been productive for us to reach more advisers in our fast-growing independent channel. Our focus on investment and wealth management technology is aligned with our investment in the ETF ecosystem, which is increasingly driving our flows. We are creating new opportunities globally for clients to use ETF for asset allocation and alpha-generation. We\u2019re developing new products, we\u2019re spending time on ETF education across the industry and BlackRock is at the forefront of the innovation in the ETF distribution side. The investments we have made in iShares are showing real-time results. For both the third quarter and year-to-date, iShares captured the number one share of flows in the United States, in Europe and globally. Usage is increasingly across client types from wealth clients seeking low-cost exposures and fee-based advisory models to ensure asset managers, banks, pensions, sovereign wealth funds using ETFs alongside, individual stocks, alongside bonds, future swaps as a necessary component of their portfolios. We\u2019re similarly seeing growth across all our key product segments. We\u2019ve seen $58 billion of flows into fixed income ETFs over the past year and continue to see growth in our core, in our financial instruments, in our factors and our smart beta and ESG. In alpha-seeking strategies, we\u2019re focused on generating consistent performance for our clients. We believe that revitalization of our active equity platform this year will drive better client outcomes and future growth for BlackRock. We\u2019re seeing early signs of progress with 81% of fundamental and 90% of scientific active equity assets are above our benchmarks or peer mediums now for three years. Growth we\u2019re seeing across our platform is a direct result of the investments we made over time to position ourselves ahead of our client needs. We invested to build our infrastructure business beginning with a lift out of a small renewable team in 2011. Today, as a result of both organic growth and acquisitions, our global infrastructure team of nearly 150 professionals manages $16 billion of invested and committed assets across a diverse set of equity and debt infrastructure strategies. Last year, we invested $75 million into our iShares Core shares to drive growth at a time when we anticipated these significant changes in our ecosystem. With industry flows at record highs, we have recaptured more than 100% of the revenue impact of our investment and grew our share of flow from 25% in 2016 prior to our repositioning last October to 41% market share over the past year. Technology is increasingly significant growth driver for our business. Importantly, technology that enhances distribution and alpha-generation is driving increased flows our base fees and performance fees. We\u2019re also growing our direct technology and risk management revenues, which increased by 15% year-over-year. One example that tech investment is Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management. After the idea was born of an internal employee innovation competition, we quickly built it into a business to drive value for our clients. Less than two years later, Aladdin Risk for Wealth has nearly 75 dedicated employees and five clients have gone live on our platform. Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management and other digital offerings and partnerships like iRetire, FutureAdvisor, iCapital, Scalable Capital are reaching tens of thousands of financial advisers who manage assets on behalf of millions of end investors. As our digital offerings enable financial adviser to have a more productive conversation with our clients, they\u2019re driving more growth in our iShares and other BlackRock investment strategies. We invested in our cash management business, both organically and through acquisition to strengthen our platforms, to leverage our scale and drive incremental growth. We\u2019ve grown assets by 70% over the last five years without significantly increasing our expense base. In the third quarter, we saw $20 billion of net inflows into cash management strategy and now manage more than $400 billion in cash. Our long-term strategy of anticipating change and investing for growth is clearly working. Areas that we focused on today like factors, ESG, illiquid alternatives and digital wealth management are some of the areas that will definitely be driving growth for our future. It is critical that we continue to invest in these opportunities, while being mindful of the impact of our bottom line. This will continue to position BlackRock as a right partner for our clients and a leader in the growth areas of the future. No firm in our industry is better positioned to take advantage of the scale to invest in the futures of our clients. This is and will be our biggest competitive advantage in building strong relationships with our clients and driving growth in our business. If we continue to execute on our strategic priorities, BlackRock will remain positioned to deliver a differentiated growth and a differentiated financial results, and that\u2019s why we continue to believe in our future. With that, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Laurence Fink : Hi, Craig. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks. Hey, Larry. Good morning, everyone. Laurence Fink : Good morning. Craig Siegenthaler : So my first \u2013 well, actually, my question is on Aladdin. When you think about future revenue growth in Aladdin on a dollar basis, how should we think about the mix of revenue growth between the legacy operating system Provider Aladdin for custody banks and in the retail advisor offering including FutureAdvisor and Aladdin Risk for Wealth? Because I\u2019m just really trying to evaluate the medium-term opportunity between these various offerings? Laurence Fink : We see \u2013 well, that\u2019s a great question. I don\u2019t know all the answers to that question, because some of this is just being introduced today. But we expect significant growth opportunities for Aladdin. I feel very confident, we\u2019re going to continue to have double-digit growth. In our core business, we are seeing great interest from institutional clients worldwide. It is still our biggest driver in that revenue column. What is very interesting also, we\u2019re seeing opportunities from existing Aladdin clients specifically in fixed income. We\u2019re now \u2013 are now taking on Aladdin for equity. So we are now becoming even larger component with those clients that have already experienced the Aladdin environment. They\u2019ve seen the success in terms of their own operation and they\u2019re now expanding it into other asset categories. We now are seeing more interest from, what I would say, our core pension and insurance clients and from global asset managers throughout the world. So the foundational business is continuing to drive much of the success for Aladdin and we expect that to continue and grow as I \u2013 we said double-digit. Provider Aladdin, we\u2019re in the testing phase right now, where we\u2019re \u2013 Aladdin provider has been put on to the custodial banks. We are working very closely with them on that. And hopefully, we believe that\u2019s not going to be a \u2013 obviously, it\u2019s a revenue driver as the custodian banks put it on. But let me also be clear on it, it creates greater efficiencies for us. By having Provider Aladdin, a seamless block chain, which is a private block chain between us and our custodial relationships. It really creates a more seamless processing and it should reduce many, many errors. Let\u2019s assume, we have never \u2013 we won\u2019t have any more errors, we do have some. If this is successful, we expect to expand that beyond BlackRock and then use the Aladdin environment all our clients to have that same type of platform to utilize it and then it would grow significantly. Aladdin for Wealth Management, it has a big future opportunity. As I \u2013 we said, we have now won five clients. We\u2019re now implementing those five clients. The demand is significant. What we are so pleased, we have demand from Asia, we have demand from Europe and North America. So Aladdin for Wealth Management is a very well positioned for carrying that growth that we see. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Laurence Fink : Hey, Brennan. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So I have a question on MiFID. We\u2019re here not far away from the deadline in Europe. There is a clear direction of travel, it seems for the market in funding research directly on the P&L as opposed to RPAs. What do you think though looking forward that might happen here in the U.S.? Are we going to see institutional investors begin to request similar treatment from their asset managers here, and how do you see that playing out? Thanks very much. Laurence Fink : Well, first and foremost is the fiduciary. We\u2019re going to do whatever is going to be the best for our clients for the long run. And there\u2019s not obviously the immediate pressure related to MiFID II or of the likes of it in the United States than we have immediacy in Europe. So we\u2019re talking to our clients. We\u2019re working with this. I would say one thing very clearly though, I\u2019m very \u2013 I think, the outcome of having us be having more responsibility of our own research is a fantastic thing. I do believe, by having more proprietary research will allow us to have more, what I would call, incremental and differentiated ideas. And so we look at this as an opportunity. We look at this as an opportunity to differentiate us. I do believe, our scale gives us unique opportunities in this too. So we will \u2013 we are working this \u2013 working on this, we\u2019re studying this. We look at this as not just an added expense of any magnitude. We\u2019re looking at this as a opportunity and we\u2019re treating it as an opportunity and we\u2019re having dialogues with our clients. I would say, in the ecosystem, if I was nervous about MiFID II and I\u2019ve talked to regulators about this, we are worried about what the impact will be with some of the small-cap companies that that will \u2013 are having trouble, which we\u2019re hearing from many companies already and getting people to follow them. We had a conversation with a regulator yesterday about this. I\u2019m also worried about can \u2013 are we going to see the proper research for new companies? I\u2019m not talking about the big giant IPOs that we are accustomed to, but the small IPOs that are quite small. So I think, we have to see how MiFID II works out in the European environment for us to have the strong \u2013 a real strong opinion globally. But I think the trend will be, as you clearly framed your question, is probably a movement more towards that fiduciary standard worldwide, and we\u2019ll see how this plays out. We would like to think that over time, we have the whole ecosystem regulators, the asset management side, the sell-side, we have a better understanding how this plays out. The key \u2013 the most important point when you have these big giant regulatory issues, we need to make sure that we understand all the unanticipated changes and impacts on markets. And so, I would \u2013 we are constructive on this, but there could be some negative outcomes if it\u2019s not properly monitored and organized. The last thing, I would just say, related to what MiFID II will be. With greater transparency, first, that\u2019s great for investors. Investors, one of my biggest worries, which I repeatedly said in these calls is, my worry about retirement worldwide. I just finished a world tour, the amount of cash that individuals are holding in bank accounts in Japan, it\u2019s $5 trillion in banking, that\u2019s with negative returns. In Europe, it\u2019s huge amounts of money sitting in bank accounts. If we\u2019re going to move some of this money into long-term investing, because much of the savings is towards retirement. We probably would have had even more dynamic economies worldwide. So clearly, more transparency ultimately should be good for the industry, but we have the industry as a transition to go through. And the last thing, I would say, with greater transparency, it will move more assets towards ETFs. And this is one of the big systems that I talked about in my prepared speech that I do believe, these big changes are going to move more money to manage portfolios to fee-based relationships that are going to drive more ETF flows. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Laurence Fink : Hi, Alex. Alexander Blostein : Hi, guys, good morning. I was hoping you could spend a minute on the competitive dynamics in Europe. So over the last year or so, it seems like BlackRock\u2019s retail fund flows and frankly, the market share as well had improved in the region on the active side, and that\u2019s outside of the kind of the strong position you guys have in iShares. So can you just give us a sense of what\u2019s behind the improvement and I guess your views on BlackRock\u2019s competitive position in the region into 2018, given MiFID, Brexit, FCA regulatory scrutiny, et cetera? Laurence Fink : So it\u2019s a very important region for us obviously, and the improvement in flows is a direct relationship to the improvement in performance. In Europe, we have some of the strongest performance, and I think you\u2019ve seen that especially in our long/short European fund. As performance gets better, we see a lot of demand. Europe has been an important part of our roll out. We have significant resources there and investments there, and they are also participating in the growth of the ETF business in a big way, where not only do we have our ETFs, but we also have a lot of technology that we\u2019re bringing to the European markets. So it\u2019s a very big growth area for us. We have, as you know, almost a third of our people out in Europe that we\u2019re going to continue to grow. And the other part of it is that, we believe that we need to be local in each of the countries in Europe. So we have our local sales force and we also have portfolio management, so that we can be a global company, but be local in all parts of Europe, and we\u2019re like everyone else waiting to see how the Brexit unfolds and then we\u2019re going to respond appropriately to that. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup. Laurence Fink : Hi, Bill. William Katz : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate the abbreviated comments this morning as well. Couple of two-part question, if I could. First was, one of your major competitors in Europe recently embraced shifting to a sliding fee on the management fee in their global equity portfolio. I was wondering if you could talk about your reaction to that and the implications of that, particularly given what your view is greater transparency? And then somewhat unrelated maybe for Gary. I heard term margin-aware, and that seems like a new point term, and I\u2019d like to understand what that exactly means as you think about the growth versus margin dynamic? Thanks. Laurence Fink : Well, I\u2019ll ask Gary to answer both of those questions. Gary Shedlin : Yes. Thank you, Larry. So, Bill, as it relates to, I think, you\u2019re referring to the fulcrum fee pricing model. I think that our view would be on this that, as the industry continues to evolve due to a variety of issues not the least of which are both regulatory and change in client trends, there are a number of active managers thinking about new ways to evolve fee structure. So we\u2019ve seen a bunch of announcements of attentions to introduce a new performance-based model. I think, we saw one change more recently in the United States, including the fulcrum free, which is actually been in use in the U.S. for some time, but many of those details have yet to be rolled out or implemented. I think, we continuously monitor price instructions \u2013 structures. We currently utilize both flat fee structures, as well as performance-based fee structures across our product range. We\u2019re mindful of that. That was a big driver of our decision to restructure, reposition some of our active equity businesses and launch of the low-cost advantage, suite earlier in the year. And as the landscape continues to evolve, we\u2019ll continue to explore variety of structures, including fulcrum fees and other \u2013 and frankly, other innovative structures to determine whether they\u2019re appropriate for our products and most importantly for clients. Your second question, in terms of just the tonality of margin, I don\u2019t really think there\u2019s any change candidly. But I think, we\u2019ve been very clear historically that we don\u2019t manage the business to a margin and we\u2019re trying to optimize organic growth in the most efficient way possible. And I just wanted people to understand that not managing, the margin doesn\u2019t actually make people understand that we\u2019re not focused on margin. And so, obviously, trying to make sure that we can do deliver the highest growth rates with the highest margins is something we\u2019re always focused on. And so I want to make sure people know that we are very margin-aware even though we may not be managing the business to a specific margin target at any point in time. Laurence Fink : I would just echo that, we\u2019re very margin-aware. And if we see great opportunities for growth, we will interpret that and manage that accordingly. But of course, leaders of companies have to be margin-aware. We have to trade off future growth opportunities with margin, we all know that. And so I think that\u2019s what Gary really is trying to say. And it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve always said that we are \u2013 we believe that we execute our strategies properly that we could see expansion in margins. And we see great growth opportunities so that we will look at that as a trade-off. As Gary said, that has not changed, so I\u2019ll leave it at that. Operator : Your next question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Laurence Fink : Hey, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Hello, there, how are you? Laurence Fink : Good. Glenn Schorr : So I heard your comments loud and clear on the recoupment of more than the investment that you\u2019ve made in the Core Series price investment. So I guess, I\u2019m looking for an update on how you can protect that kind of pricing competition outside the core, and then maybe how you evaluate it on an ongoing basis? Laurence Fink : So, Glenn, I think we\u2019ve \u2013 historically, as we\u2019ve thought about pricing strategies in iShares, we\u2019ve talked a lot about both client and product segmentation. And I think, in every instance what we\u2019re trying to do is to effectively evaluate the value proposition to an individual client from buying the product. In the core, we clearly have seen a group of clients who are significantly more focused on price than they\u2019re necessarily aftermarket liquidity, bid-ask spread or tracking error. And so for that segment of the world, we are obviously focusing a product significantly more focused on price. There\u2019s another segment of the marketplace that frankly is not necessarily long-term buy and hold, they\u2019re much more interested in tracking error. They\u2019re much more interested in making sure there\u2019s enough liquidity if they decide to get out in significant volume. And for that segment of the population, they\u2019re less focused on price and more on the other elements of the value proposition that the ETF brings to the table. And so that segmentation, we talk about core, we talk about precision instruments, we talk about financial instruments. We\u2019re trying to make sure that in every instance, we\u2019re understanding the value proposition that the clients are looking for and making sure that we price the product accordingly. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Laurence Fink : Hello, Mike. Michael Cyprys : Hi, good morning. I just wanted to circle back on some of the comments you\u2019re making around investing in the business. I think, you mentioned that today\u2019s organic growth as a result, assuming investments that you\u2019ve made over the past couple of years. I guess, the question is, how much are you investing in the business today? And how does that compare with what you\u2019ve invested over the past couple of years? And just given the changes that are occurring within the industry, do you feel a need to accelerate or pick up the pace of investments versus what you\u2019ve done historically? Laurence Fink : Well, I think the pace of the amount of investing that we\u2019re doing is clearly accelerating as the business is getting bigger, and our financial resources are becoming more significant and the complexity of the business is changing. So I think, every year we go through a process of identifying a number of strategic initiatives, which we talk to you about all the time whether it\u2019s ETFs more broadly; smart beta and factors; infrastructure; illiquid alternatives, including infrastructure; as Larry mentioned, retail; technology; institutional technology more broadly and regional expansion. I mean, these are just a number of things that we\u2019re doing not the least of which is planning for a new headquarters six years out and other things that are just kind of more business as usual. So I think, there\u2019s no question that we are continuing to invest. Obviously, to the extent, you have markets that cooperate with you, it makes some of those decisions a little bit easier. But I think as we\u2019ve shown in prior years, we\u2019re trying to be very consistent with our investment spend notwithstanding what markets are doing in any point in time, because we do stay focused on the long-term. And to the extent that basically, we find ourselves trying to balance the tradeoff between growth and margin. We aggressively look to reallocate our resources in a way that allows us to do both at any point in time. Laurence Fink : I would just add, because I think this is a really important component of who we are and where we\u2019re going. I think, we have a unique competitive advantage, because of those investments it\u2019s clear to me that we got \u2013 we need to continue to invest to be competitively in front of our \u2013 the needs of our clients and our competitors. And I do believe as we position our technology, especially the investment technology to reach more clients, Aladdin for Wealth Management to be on more desktops for \u2013 with more of the financial advisors, investing in alpha signals in our scientific businesses, I believe it\u2019s critical for us to stay in front of these big giant trends. And I \u2013 as I said in my prepared remarks, if we have not \u2013 if we did not make those investments a few years back, we would not be in a position of really working with our clients and picking up considerable market share with our clients institutionally and in retail, and we look at this in a very competitive way. We believe our scale is a real advantage. And as Gary said, as our scale has increased, it gives us even a greater competitive advantage. And we do believe data, technology, risk management is going to continue to drive hopefully better financial literacy that gets back to my, once again, my whole concept of financial literacy for better outcome investing. The organization that can provide that seamless information to get some of that money that\u2019s essentially been trapped in short-term strategies into proper long-term investing, it would have a remarkable impact on the results for our clients and remarkable impact to the society and a remarkable impact on the companies that provide that. So I look at this is essential. And so we will continue to be investing to be that one key leader for those events and those opportunities. Operator : Your next question is from Robert Lee with KBW. Laurence Fink : Hey, Rob. Robert Lee : Good morning. Hey, good morning, guys. Sometimes, it seems that there are so many opportunities ahead of you that maybe the \u2013 your \u2013 one of your biggest challenges is maximizing them. And how do you organize yourself to maximize them just given there are so many things going on? And I know in the past, you\u2019ve done things like combined solutions with the institutional sales force or things of that nature. So can you maybe just update us if there\u2019s any \u2013 do you feel like you have the kind of for the moment at least the right structure with any kind of organizational changes you think you\u2019re thinking about, or could be necessary to kind of really maximize the opportunities you see? Laurence Fink : Well, as you know, it\u2019s been \u2013 it\u2019s not planned, but it appears almost every year, we are making some leadership changes. We did that already earlier this year in terms of really enhancing some of our regional coverage, enhancing our alpha business and enhancing and really enhancing our global equity platforms. The demands on opportunities that we see are greater than our ability to achieve them. So you\u2019re correct in asserting that we see more opportunities or let me restate potential opportunities. The key is for us is to focus on the opportunities that we think we can maximize with our platform, with our clients. I would say clearly over the last number of years, I would say clearly for more than 10 years, we\u2019ve been more right on those strategies and not. This is why I personally spend so much time on strategy and positioning our firm. This is another reason why I spend so much time visiting clients. I would clearly say loud and clear 80% of our strategies have been led by what we\u2019re hearing from our clients, which is that they can have some type of technology solution. They want to have a better understanding of ESG, they want to have better understanding of how they could integrate more infrastructure as a platform. How they can navigate the defined contribution plan in some form of bypass. So it is a big task in trying to making sure that we\u2019re focused on the right strategy. And what I would say, what Gary Shedlin and Rob Goldstein and really navigating the moment by moment types of issues around there, we\u2019re \u2013 they\u2019re constantly focused on eliminating some organizational inefficiencies. So I don\u2019t want to say, we\u2019re perfect. And I don\u2019t want to say, we don\u2019t constantly have to refresh ourselves, because we do. We have to refresh ourselves to stay in front of the environment that we\u2019re operating, stay in front of our clients, and there are always inefficiencies. So I\u2019m not trying to suggest we are solving all the problems. But if have \u2013 we have teams that are focusing on eliminating organizational inefficiencies. We\u2019re making decisions by listening to the end clients. And we also believe what is necessary Rob Kapito mentioned this early, we have to be closer to our clients and this is why are \u2013 the regionalization effort is so very important. So we can listen to our clients better. And then I would say, one of the great successes in picking our strategies has been the advent of the BlackRock Investor Institute. By bringing all the thoughts together hopefully to have better alpha outcomes, but also bringing all that information flow into a \u2013 into one platform to redistribute, it really gives us great insight. And it\u2019s that insight that helps us navigate the strategies that we are going to concentrate in. And I believe it\u2019s through that insight that has allowed us to have a better batting average in picking the right strategies to invest in the future. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Laurence Fink : Hi, Mike. Michael Carrier : Hi. Maybe just a two-part question on the technology side. So you guys are spending a lot of time on the retail or the wealth management front. And your relative size there versus institutional seems like there\u2019s a great opportunity. I just wanted to see if you could either size that or where you are and maybe the penetration of that opportunity? And then as that kind of relates to efficiencies in the business like how you see that playing out as that continues to scale up. Are you kind of make progress on that opportunity, how that will play through efficiencies and through the operating leverage given the model? Laurence Fink : Well, let me just say very clearly, as I said in my prepared remarks and Gary did too. MiFID II and some fiduciary standard rule really changes the whole ballgame, not just for where assets are going to move, but risk supervision is critical under our fiduciary standard rule. As I said the CIO office is going to have a lot more responsibility in the various platforms. And so that drives a lot of interest in Aladdin for Wealth Management. So we continue to believe that will continue to drive more opportunities. The \u2013 in terms of efficiencies, obviously, we\u2019ve learned a lot from the beginnings of our institutional Aladdin business. So that unquestionably as we gain more clients, we are a more efficient platform. As \u2013 but Aladdin for Wealth Management is a considerably different platform. I mean Aladdin for Wealth Management, we could have 10,000 users. And it\u2019s a very different platform and this is why I don\u2019t want to say Aladdin \u2013 the Institutional Aladdin business is going to create so many efficiencies for us and margin expansion as we use Aladdin for Wealth Management. We believe if we could penetrate more and we see great opportunities for penetration, unquestionably over time there\u2019s more efficiencies. But let me \u2013 let\u2019s also be clearly, much of the success around Aladdin for Wealth Management will drive more close to BlackRock. Both going to \u2013 it\u2019s going to evolve. Let\u2019s be clear, because I get tired of that question, Mike with a question that I was asked before related to technology. Our ecosystem is evolving. I think, it\u2019s evolving very rapidly now. I think, this low return environment is forcing clients more than ever before to focus on fees, to focus on relationships, to focus on how they want solutions to be provided. So you have it incredibly evolving ecosystem worldwide. At the same time, we\u2019re seeing a huge expansion of the global capital markets. And less so we are seeing the utilization of more technology and how technology is disrupting traditional things and changing the system even more rapidly. So the most important thing for us is to stay in front of it, to be helpful to all our clients and obviously, we\u2019re helpful for all our clients. We\u2019re going to win more share with more share. We\u2019re going to drive better efficiencies. So efficiencies are important, so I\u2019m not trying to dispute anything about, and we focus on efficiencies. And I can tell you, Rob Goldstein and Gary Shedlin focus on that relentlessly, but it\u2019s more important that we stay in front of change as an organization. If we\u2019re a firm that stays in front of change on behalf of our clients, our clients will award us more share of wallet. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks? Laurence Fink : I think, I said almost everything, but I have \u2013 first of all, I want to thank everybody for joining us this morning and your continued interest at BlackRock. I think, our third quarter directly is linked to the comments that we\u2019ve had related to the investments made over time and how those investments have translated that into improved margins, improved revenues, improved AUM, improved operating income, and most importantly, better and more improved relationships with our clients. Hopefully, this is well recognized by all of our investors, and we will continue to leverage our differentiating scale. We\u2019re going to continue to invest in investments in technology. As I said, to deliver that value to our clients, to stay in front of our clients and that\u2019s my commitment to all of you as our shareholders that we will \u2013 our objective is to stay in front of our client needs, so we could be more valuable to our clients. With that, everyone have a good quarter. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Shinger and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today\u2019s call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference. Christopher Meade : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019m Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock\u2019s actual results may of course differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC which list some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Gary. Gary Shedlin : Thanks, Chris. Good morning and Happy New Year to everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to present results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I\u2019ll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as adjusted results this morning. 2017 was a record year for BlackRock, and we once again executed on each component of our framework for shareholder value creation. BlackRock generated $367 billion of total net inflows in 2017, including 103 billion of total flows in the fourth quarter, representing 7% organic asset growth and the strongest flows in our history. Full year net inflows were positive across client type, asset class, major region, and investment style. More importantly, our 2017 net asset flows represented long-term organic base fee growth of 7%, evidencing the breadth and diversification of our global investment platform. We continue to invest in our business, while simultaneously expanding our full year operating margin by 40 basis points; and after first investing for growth, we returned approximately $2.8 billion of capital to our shareholders during the year. Full year revenue of $12.5 billion was up 12% versus 2016, and operating income of $5.3 billion increased 13%. We saw accelerated momentum in the fourth quarter with revenue and operating income increasing 20% and 21% respectively versus the year ago quarter. 2017 as adjusted earnings per share of $22.60 was up 17% versus 2016 and excluded the impact of a $1.3 billion net tax benefit related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The $1.3 billion net benefit was comprised of a $1.8 billion non-cash tax benefit related to the revaluation of US deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by a $477 million repatriation tax expense, which is payable over eight years. Our current analysis suggests a projected tax run rate of approximately 23% for 2018, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of non-recurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on or changes to our analysis of recent tax reform legislation. Fourth quarter base fees of $2.9 billion were up 16% year-over-year, driven by market appreciation and organic growth. Full year base fees were up 10% versus 2016, reflecting similar growth dynamics, but partially offset by the impact of historical pricing investments in our iShares business. Fourth quarter performance fees of $285 million reflected strong alpha generation from our diversified hedge fund platform and long-only equity products. Full year performance fees of 594 million were up substantially compared to 2016. Quarterly technology and risk management revenue grew 15% year-over-year, driving 14% full year growth versus 2016 led by continued momentum in institutional Aladdin and Aladdin Risk for wealth management. We accelerated the expansion of our technology portfolio during 2017 with the acquisition of Cachematrix and minority investments in iCapital and Scalable Capital. Our investments in technology and data will enhance our ability to generate alpha and more efficiently serve clients, resulting in growth in both base fees and technology revenue. Total expense increased 11% in 2017, driven primarily by higher compensation, volume related and G&A expense. For the full year, compensation expense increased $388 million or 10%, primarily reflecting higher incentive compensation driven by higher performance fees and higher operating income. Our full-year comp to revenue ratio of 33.9% declined 60 basis points versus 2016, driven by the changing composition of our employee base and increased technology investment. Recall that year-over-year comparisons of fourth quarter compensation expense are less relevant because we determine compensation on a full year basis. Direct fund expense was up $138 million or 18% in 2017, primarily reflecting higher average AUM as a result of significant growth in our iShares franchise. G&A expense increased 12% in 2017, reflecting higher core technology and data spend and the impact of various one-off items, including professional fees related to deal activity, Brexit, MiFID II, and tax reform as well as FX re-measurement expense, increased contingent payments, and purchase price fair value adjustments.  We continually focus on managing our entire discretionary expense base. While we would expect 2018 G&A expense to increase in stable markets, we would also expect compensation as a percent of revenue to decline as a function of historical investment and increased scale in our business, resulting in continued upward bias in our operating margin. BlackRock\u2019s record 2017 financial performance reflects these historical investments and the strength of our globally integrated asset management and technology business.  During 2017, our differentiated platform delivered 7% long-term organic base fee growth, 9% organic asset growth in our cash platform, and 14% growth in our technology and risk management revenue, while also expanding our operating margin to 44.1%. We do not manage the business to a specific margin target, but we are always margin aware and remain committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible. Beyond the P&L, investing cash flow to grow the business is another critical component of our growth strategy. During 2017, we continued to lay the foundation for future growth by increasing our seed and co-investment portfolio by approximately $500 million, and beyond the technology related acquisitions previously noted, announcing the acquisition of Citibanamex Asset Management furthering our goal to be a full solutions provider in Mexico, and closing the acquisition of First Reserve\u2019s energy infrastructure funds, continuing the build out of our leading illiquid alternatives platform.  We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders, and during 2017 returned approximately $2.8 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We repurchased another $1.1 billion of shares in 2017 and now have repurchased almost 16 million shares over the last five years, representing a 20% unlevered annualized return for our shareholders. Consistent with our predictable and balanced approach to capital management, our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $2.88 per share, representing an increase of 15% over the prior level.  In addition, subject to market conditions, including the relative valuation of our stock price, we would anticipate share repurchases aggregating $1.2 billion during 2018. Over the next few months, as we finalize the impact of tax reform on BlackRock and clarify the potential for future investment opportunities, especially our ability to more aggressively seed and co-invest in new products, we plan to reassess our capital management plans for the balance of 2018. Fourth quarter long-term net inflows of $81 billion reflected 6% annualized organic asset growth and marked our sixth consecutive quarter with organic AUM growth in excess of 5%. Record full year total inflows of $367 billion benefited from significant flows into iShares as both institutional and retail clients use ETFs for core investments, precision exposures, and financial instruments.  Global iShares generated a record $245 billion of new business for the year, representing full-year organic growth of 19%, with flows split nearly evenly between core and higher fee non-core exposures. Since BlackRock launched the iShares core funds five years ago, we've seen over $275 billion of net inflows, including $122 billion of net inflows in 2017 alone. Three of the industry's top five ETFs in terms of net new assets globally this year were iShares\u2019 core ETFs, IVV or S&P 500 fund, IEFA for developed international market exposure, and IEMG our core emerging markets fund. Full year retail net inflows of $30 billion were placed by our broad range of fixed income products, our multi-asset income fund and the indexed equity. BlackRock\u2019s institutional franchise generated a record $55 billion in net flows for the year, positive across alpha seeking and indexed strategies. 2017 was another strong fundraising year for illiquid alternatives, as we raised more than $11 billion in new commitments. BlackRock now has approximately $17 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of illiquid strategies. Finally, BlackRock\u2019s cash management platform saw $38 billion of net inflows or 9% organic growth for the year, reflecting continued market share gains and several large wins. The strong growth in cash management also reflects successful identification and integration of acquisitions to strengthen our platform and leverage our scale. In summary, 2017 was a very strong year for BlackRock. Our diversified business model once again delivered industry leading organic growth and consistent financial results. We are committed to continuously evolving, investing in and disrupting our platform to benefit clients. We believe our platform is as well positioned as it's ever been to meet those needs and to deliver long term value for shareholders. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry. Laurence Fink : Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining the call. The strength of BlackRock\u2019s 2017 results reflects long-term strategic advantages we've created by constantly investing in our business ahead of our clients\u2019 changing needs. BlackRock generated $367 billion of total net inflows during the year, an increase of over 80% versus our previous record of $202 billion last year. These flows reflect the trust we have earned from clients to help solve their most difficult investment challenges and they are the strongest flows we've ever generated in a one year period.  They were driven by our ability to deliver complete investment solutions, industry leading technology and thought leadership through an evolving investment landscape. Equity markets reached an all-time high in 2017, driven by a synchronized economic growth around the world and continued easy monetary policy. Europe is experiencing its fastest economic expansion since 2011, aided by greater political certainty. After 30 years of stagnation, Japan is once again seeing positive growth.  In the US, strong corporate earnings, increased consumer demand and the reason tax reform have continued to drive strong equity markets. And as the leadership in China continues to gradually address historical leverage levels and pivot towards higher growth areas, Chinese GDP once again expanded at a rate approaching 7%. Yet, we are seeing a paradox of high returns and yet we still see high anxiety. As past prices have instilled more caution in investors, the industry has seen a continued focus on downside risk, putting a premium on lower risk bonds, anchoring interest rates at historical low levels and driving many investors to over allocate to cash and to other safe havens. However, in these times of greater certainty and economic growth, there's an even greater need to focus on investing in the long run. As an example, an individual with $1000 in 1950 would have around $20,000 today if they saved in a US bank account versus $1 million if they invested in the S&P in 1950. Just as we believe in the importance and benefits of clients investing for the long term to create better financial futures, we also believe in investing in BlackRock with the same future prospective. We enter 2018, BlackRock\u2019s 30th year with more than $6 trillion in assets under management.  From our roots in 1988 as a fixed income manager, we've invested over time to expand the breadth, the globality of our businesses to stay ahead of our clients' needs and we're seeing the benefits of those investments in our results today. In 2017, 13 countries and 68 different products generated more than $1 billion of net inflows. BlackRock\u2019s technology is now used by clients in 50 countries and more people than ever before are looking to BlackRock as a thought leader as evidenced by over 8000 media mentions received through the Black Rock Investment Institute in 2017.  While past investments have shaped the BlackRock of today, we remain steadfast in our approach to investing in BlackRock\u2019s future and we've just finished two days of meetings with BlackRock\u2019s Board of Directors where we reviewed our strategy tactically and our long-term strategies for the future. Our consistent investment in iShares and the broader ETF ecosystem has propelled BlackRock iShares franchise to more than $1.7 trillion of assets across 800 different funds.  Record iShares inflows of 245 billion in 2017, including $55 billion in our fourth quarter earned iShares the number one share of global, US and European flows for the year as well the number one share in equity and fixed income and in core exposures and also in smart beta. Growth has been driven by our commitment to provide clients with a differentiating offering, capital markets and technical product expertise, a diverse set of products ranging from the established industry benchmarks to innovative exposures, investment thought leadership and importantly distribution technology.  Growth has also been driven by increasing adaptation by clients using ETFs in different ways as ETFs have made investing more accessible to both institutions and individuals. And over the past two years, $368 billion of inflows in iShares have matched the entirety of the ETF business we acquired from BGI in 2009. And as we think about providing even more clients with the ability to use ETFs to deliver efficient model portfolios.  We've invested in a number of digital wealth technologies to better serve our distribution partners in a changing wealth landscape. FutureAdvisor, our digital wealth offering in the US, Scalable Capital, our strategic investment in Europe, both strengthen our relationships with intermediary partners, allowing them to effectively scale their businesses with a systematic investment process and ultimately expand the ETF market and iShares\u2019 reach. Beyond digital wealth, technology is enabling more productive engagements with more financial advisors than ever before. Driving accelerated asset and base fee growth across our platform, Blackrock is using better data and technology to scale our own wealth advisory sales teams and equipping them with a better insight about our clients, about their portfolios and giving a much better texture about markets.  In 2017, in the US for example, we extended our reach to do our business with 25% more advisors and conducted nearly 1 million advisory engagements without meaningful, increasing our cost base in this distribution channel. We continue to invest in technology both organically and inorganically. Our Aladdin technology, which we have invested in the -- since the foundation of BlackRock has played a major role in allowing us to scale our own business efficiently over time.  It is a key reason that BlackRock has been able to grow from 8 people and managing about $1 billion in assets when we founded the firm to nearly 14,000 employees entrusted with $6.3 trillion today. Aladdin and our other technologies and risk management offerings generated $677 million of revenues in 2017, representing a 14% year-over-year growth and we now have over 200 Aladdin clients, including more than a half dozen of Aladdin risk for wealth management.  The importance of technology continues to increase across our platform and is intersecting with every major strategic theme we are focused on, including retirement. We see tremendous opportunities to leverage our technology such as iRetire for example to address the ongoing global retirement challenge. Technology is impacting businesses like cash management as well and in 2017, we acquired Cachematrix, a technology portal that enhances banks' abilities to address our corporate clients\u2019 cash management needs. Cachematrix allows BlackRock to provide a scalable technology solution to our bank clients while also expanding the reach of our cash management strategies. BlackRock saw 38 billion of net inflows into cash management strategies in 2017 and we now manage $450 billion in cash assets as the investments we made to grow and scale this business over the last few years are bearing wonderful results.  For clients looking for greater alpha potential, BlackRock is leveraging the powerful combination of our human insights and technology to deliver consistent, durable alpha. 70% and 83% of our fundamental and systematic active equity assets respectively have performed above benchmark or peer mediums for one year and those numbers are 72% and 87% for a three year period of time. On the distribution side, we reaffirmed our belief in the long term growth potential of the Mexican market through our recent announcement to acquire Citibanamex Asset Management business. The combined firm brought BlackRock\u2019s access to Mexico's wealth management, providing clients' access to BlackRock\u2019s international products and to build a partnership to create more innovative, multi asset solutions. We also focus on other high growth geographies like China where significant regulatory changes are opening up new opportunities for the future. Last month, BlackRock obtained our private fund management registration, which enables us to manufacture and privately distribute onshore funds in China to qualified institutions and high net worth individuals in China.  With more assets under management on behalf of more diverse client base than ever before, the responsibility BlackRock feels to our clients has never been greater. We have a responsibility to meet the clients\u2019 demands for investment strategies that will create a positive environmental and social impact, while generating strong financial returns.  We recently hired Brian Deese, a former senior advisor to President Obama on client energy to lead our sustainable investment business where we see a significant long-term opportunity for BlackRock worldwide. As a fiduciary, we have a responsibility to engage with companies in which we invest to ensure long-term value creation for clients. We have the industry's largest investment stewardship team and rebuilding this team even further as we recognize the growing importance and value of a strong stewardship.  Our team engaged with more than 1600 companies in 2017 on a range of issues and voted on more than 17,000 shareholder meetings worldwide on more than 162,000 proposals, I get that out, that\u2019s a lot of proposals. It is a dedication of our employees across the globe that drove our 2017 results and positions us well for 2018. Since BlackRock\u2019s foundings, we have been encouraged -- everyone to act like owners that all employees work hard to instill the principles of our firm\u2019s culture. It's important that we continue to institutionalize that culture, especially as we prepare for the future for BlackRock. Rob and I have never worked harder, nor enjoyed our jobs more than ever before and we have no intentions of being here -- we have every intention of being here all the time and no intentions of leaving.  But, it is also a reality that we won\u2019t be here forever and BlackRock\u2019s future is critical in linking and retaining what I consider the best management team in the industry. We have a robust leadership plan that we regularly review with our board, including ongoing development initiatives for our senior team. We recently implemented a key strategic part of that plan by issuing a one-time long-term equity incentive grant to a small group of senior leaders.  These equity awards will vest over an extended timeframe of five to seven years and are focused on ensuring the interests of the next generational leaders, individuals who we believe will play critical roles in BlackRock\u2019s future that are aligned with both clients and shareholders much as mine and Rob have been over the last 30 years. As we enter 2018, all of us at BlackRock are humbled by the trust our clients have placed on us. We will continue to make investments in BlackRock\u2019s future, to grow investment and technology capabilities, to expand our geographic footprint and to further enhance our talent so that we can ensure we meet our daily responsibility to our clients and deliver the returns to our shareholders that we all expect. With that, let's open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ken Worthington from JP Morgan. Ken Worthington : I'm curious to hear your thoughts about how access to ETF distribution is evolving globally and how this evolution may impact BlackRock? So, two examples. Ameritrade has changed access on its -- to its ETFs on its commission-free platform, and some ETF providers got kicked off and others got brought on. And then, Vanguard has gotten kicked off in a number of large platforms because they don't pay the platform fees, so does access to ETF distribution play out differently for ETFs than access for mutual fund distributions, distribution sorry. How does this shape the competitive landscape for ETFs? And then I guess lastly, does this drive consolidation in ETFs? Laurence Fink : Let me have Rob start off with that answer. Robert Kapito : So, I don't think it drives consolidation. This is a growing market and with the interest in it, there's a lot more players that want to be involved in the distribution. There are a lot of people that want to get in the game. Sometimes, you get in the game by different offerings you would have at different price levels. So, I think this is just the normal process of a fund \u2013 of a product growing and figuring out better rappers and better ways to distribute that product.  So we're not worried about it. We participate in it. We watch it very closely. It's just part of the normal growth, I believe of any product on a distribution platform. And also, the distribution platforms are changing themselves and becoming a lot more competitive, and when you add this along with a lot of the regulatory issues that are looking at transparency and cost, this is all going to be very, very fluid. Laurence Fink : Let me just add one other thing, Ken. We have -- as you know, we do not go to the last mile and work with any individual client. Our business model is to work with distribution platforms and helping them navigate their clients. So I would state that these changes that you're seeing in some of the distribution platforms plays very well into the BlackRock business model. We work with all the distribution platforms globally.  The access that we are experiencing in Europe as they\u2019ve consolidated managers for years, both in the mutual fund side and the ETF side and in the United States, the access that we're presenting and it is evident by the -- where some of the different distribution platforms are using models, they're utilizing many of BlackRock\u2019s models in terms of the creation of ETFs and a creation of a portfolio of ETFs. So, if I had to make a bias, the trends of using fewer investment managers is not a new phenomenon. I don't even think it\u2019s a new phenomenon for ETFs, but that trend has been existing for years, and because of our business model, that plays quite well with our business model working with all distribution platforms and we don't compete with our distribution partners. Operator : Your next question comes from Patrick Davitt from Autonomous. Patrick Davitt : I think since you merged the scientific and active equity businesses, could you maybe give us an update on the progress of those two working together and maybe any anecdotes or examples of how it has led to improved performance for any specific strategies on either side? Robert Kapito : So we are combining our efforts, so that we can offer a spectrum of equity investments to our clients. But clearly, when you take a look at what scientific active equity offers, it is a lot of signals that are very short-term oriented, and if you look at fundamentals, there is a lot of work that's on long-term signals. It just makes sense to us to combine the two because they both are related to each other.  So when we combine those two with the BlackRock Investment Institute that we have that looks at both micro and macro issues in the marketplace, we think that we are going to get much better value and performance from our portfolio managers, who will have much better information both about the short term and the long term. And actually, we\u2019re seeing the results of that already in the performance of both sides of the portfolio. When we combined those two, keep in mind we're also combining the research both in the quantitative method and the fundamental method. And this has also worked very well for us in light of the MiFID II requirements where I\u2019m not sure people are aware, but we have over 400 analysts internally that develop our own research. So we're putting together the quantitative, the fundamental tools, we're putting together the research, the portfolio managers all have access, and what's happening is we're getting much better wholesome alpha from both of the teams. So, so far, I would say it's been a very good success. Laurence Fink : I would just add one last thing. We did have $1 billion of outflows, which were forecasted when we did the restructuring. We actually saw more inflows, we actually forecasted actually a little more outflows, and I would say very clearly the trend for 2018, we will have positive inflows on our active fundamental and scientific equities in 2018. Operator : Your next question is from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : I guess I wanted to ask you around the tax reform. So, obviously over the next few weeks, we\u2019ll get updates from other companies as well, but I guess bigger picture, when it comes to the asset management business, how much of the tax benefit you expect the industry to retain versus how much is going to get competed away? And then when it comes to BlackRock specifically, how are you guys thinking internally about reinvesting some of these benefits, particularly when it comes to additional fee reductions? Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we are experiencing technical difficulties, if you could please hold the line. Thank you for your patience. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the operator. We are experiencing technical difficulties, if you could just remain on the line. Thank you for your patience. You may resume. Laurence Fink : Alex, why don\u2019t you begin your question again if you\u2019re on? Alex Blostein : Sure. Yeah. I\u2019m on. Sorry about that. So the question was just around the tax reform. I guess we\u2019ll get updates from the rest of the industry and obviously the asset managers as a whole are reasonably well positioned to get the benefit, given relatively high tax rates, but how much of that do you think is going to get competed away and then specifically when it comes to BlackRock, how are you guys thinking internally in terms of reinvesting some of the tax savings and how much of that do you think will have to come in the form of lower fee rates? Thanks. Gary Shedlin : So Alex, Happy New Year. It\u2019s Gary. Maybe, I'll take that and Larry and Rob can jump in. I think, we're going to speak for BlackRock. We'll let the industry speak for themselves more broadly. But I think, from the very top, we've obviously always been committed to investing our business first and returning excess cash flow to shareholders. And as you know, last year, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders in a combination of dividends and share repurchases. So, we've never been capital constrained at all and our capital management policies have not changed.  We're committed to a 40% to 50% dividend payout ratio and obviously overtime, paying out the balance of excess cash in the form of buybacks. So while the reduction in our tax rate that we've talked about will clearly increase our after tax cash flow and obviously earnings per share, it does not impact the basic metrics that you all watch each and every day and we hold ourselves accountable for which is basically delivering revenue, expense, operating income and margin. And decisions that we make around how much we're going to invest into our P&L and any obviously associated pricing investments that we may make going forward are really completely independent of our tax rate.  We are still 100% committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible. That being said, clearly, an increase in incremental cash flow from tax reform could impact likely favorably our capital management decisions and that reflects both potentially dividends and buybacks. And our plan is to, I mean, given the tax reform is basically three weeks old, our plan is to effectively reassess our latest capital management recommendations, probably around mid-year. Once we kind of finalize the impact that tax reform is going to have on BlackRock and there's going to be lots of additional guidance that's going to be forthcoming as well as making sure that we are looking at all of the balance sheet, if you will, opportunities that we have, over the next several months, including more aggressively seeding and co-investing in new products. Laurence Fink : I would like to bring up one point, Alex, because you connected tax reform with fee reductions and I don't see any correlation or connections. We will consistently review every one of our products if we do believe a product can grow -- return better returns for us over a long term and we believe the need to lower fees, we will be doing that, unrelated to tax reform. And tax reform is obviously a below the line result anyway and fee cuts are above the line, but we systematically review our products and fees and we will continue to systematically look at fees to provide the best value to our clients, but it's totally unrelated to tax reform. Operator : Your next question comes from Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Dan Fannon : Maybe Larry, just to follow-up on a comment you just made briefly about 2018 and active equity inflows, can you talk about, I guess, the backlog or kind of the institutional framework on how it looks today and maybe the consultant discussions of how those have evolved. I assume that's part of the bullish outlook. Robert Kapito : So the first quarter of the year, a lot of institutions look at changing their portfolios and diversifying. Obviously, there is a lot of interest in the equity markets right now, because of 2017 and a lot of forecasts for 2018. So we are involved in those discussions and of course it really helps to come off a good year in performance in 2017 to be included in those. And those discussions are really across the board in various types of equities and they include more procession type, whether it be smart beta or multi-asset solutions, which we\u2019re very, very well positioned for.  So, there are a lot of discussions. I do think you're going to see a lot of interest from the institutions to potentially replace some of their alternatives that will go into equities and also to take some of the cash positions they have and put them in to equity. So quite frankly, we're very optimistic on that and we will be included. Laurence Fink : Let me just say one last thing. Arch, we have seen success over the many years now in our performance, in our model based equities. We're in more dialogs. The atmosphere is very strong, so the much better backdrop. And we feel very good about the environment. So the conversations we're having when you mention consultants, are looking at our products more. And I see -- so I think the environment is very right for us to have better dialog with more clients, where the results should be that we could see more positive inflows. So I'll leave it at that. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Let me ask something on, let me go to technology I guess. Can we get a sense from your view on sizing the potential impact of organic growth, particularly in iShares from your technology investments broadly and you mentioned obviously Aladdin Wealth, but also some of the new, the Cachematrix and the effort -- the capital effort in Europe as well and just get a sense of, first of all, I guess, are we seeing traction on those right now in terms of inflows from those products and services? And then secondly, as you build that out over time and clearly you have a competitive advantage in this, how do you see this enhancing the organic growth over the next, say, two to three years. Laurence Fink : Well, on iShares specifically, because you phrased there with iShares and you expanded, iShares specifically, I think what is changing the momentum for us in a positive way or enhancing the momentum is we're delivering a better service through technology to more RIAs. Historically, we were weak in the delivery of information and services to the RIA channel. As I said in my prepared remarks, we\u2019re using technology to provide better services alongside our humans to connect with our financial advisors, both the traditional ones and the RIA ones.  And as I said in my prepared remarks, we are working with 25% more advisors today than we did a year ago with very little added in cost and so we're doing -- using technology to aid the conversation, to enrich the conversation, to fulfill more information and then follow-up with human connectivity. So that\u2019s probably the most, the best example where we are bringing in more flows. The other area where we are bringing in more flows is working with more of the distribution platforms on providing model based products and customizing it and in those cases, much of the product flow in these model based products would be flowing into our iShares basis. In terms of technology overall, we have a very robust pipeline for Aladdin, for wealth management. We see increased inquiry in the institutional side.  As I said, 50 different countries now, broader and broader penetration and we would expect a continuation of the growth rates of 14- ish percent going forward in our technology platform. We're very encouraged and we're very encouraged about bringing this all together. So, it's not one thing. It's by having Scalable Capital in Europe, by having FutureAdvisor. These are all connecting and creating more dialog, deeper penetration.  So I don't want to suggest it's one thing, but it's a multitude of all the things that we've been investing in, working in, investing in that is creating a better, deeper or consistent dialog with more financial advisors. You mentioned Cachematrix. That's not a delivery system for ETFs, but it is a very strong delivery system for us to connect with banks and the bank channels for them to drive more cash and money market types of products into the BlackRock platform and that's one of the reasons why we had accelerated growth in our cash management platform in 2017. And we expect a furthering of opportunities in our cash management business. Operator : Your next question is from Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse. Craig Siegenthaler : I just wanted to jump into another topic with, you talked about the ETFs, they\u2019re increasingly being used by investors for asset allocation decisions and also generating alpha. What other major investor groups are using ETFs in this manner? And I always think about the US RIA channel as sort of a big one, but outside of this group, what other investor groups and maybe even institutional channels are doing this? Laurence Fink : Rob, well, I\u2019m going to let Rob comment too. I would say, every institution we talk to has asked questions related, how they could use ETFs in their portfolio, whether that\u2019s internally managed entirely by an institution or they have accommodations internally driven asset management and external managers, but I would say from pension funds, the sovereign wealth funds to insurance companies are all now utilizing more ETFs for strategic asset allocation purposes. And Rob, do you want to call up? Robert Kapito : It's really broad based, Craig. Right now, we're seeing, it starts out from trading desks on Wall Street that are using ETFs to hedge their positions. It's going to fixed income investors that are using ETFs side by side with their bond portfolios. It's emerging markets investors, both institutional and retail that are looking to have more diversified instant access into the emerging markets area. Its portfolio solutions provider that are using it as part of a multi-asset class solution.  It's the RIA channel, as you mentioned, who are also trying to customize solutions and quite frankly, it's a lot of asset managers that are using iShares as a technology to have more operating efficiency in their portfolios and not have as many line items. You also have the insurance companies who have thousands and thousands of line items of portfolios that are looking to be much more efficient and also have portfolios that have more liquidity.  And now with all of the regulatory issues and where there has been fee pressure, you have a whole new group of people that are using them to substitute in the active space, because it's obviously much, much cheaper. So it's really, quite frankly, very, very broad based with the tail at the end of the year and start of the beginning of the year, coming more in fixed income than it is in equities and more in emerging markets, because people are starting to allocate some of their monies outside of the US for 2018 that happens to be a strategy across many of the distribution change. So, we're really participating all across the board. And lastly, I would say is people who are innovating now in the smart beta area because we have over 100 funds that are ETFs for smart beta. So, this is a market that really is still in the early stages and every day, we have another client that comes in and finds another use for it. So, I'm just very optimistic on using this as a tool to help clients make better portfolios. Operator : Your next question comes from Bill Katz from Citi. Bill Katz : I just had a two part question, somewhat unrelated. The first part is, I just wondered if you could help us sort of ring fence what the core G&A expense number was for the fourth quarter? And I know, Gary, you had made some sort of broad comments around margins and comp ratios, et cetera. But how are you thinking about sort of the pace of growth on that line, when you sort of normalize off the fourth quarter? And then could you just go back and clarify, I apologize. When you were saying, you said that the equities can increase and you felt like it could come from the alternative allocation, maybe you can just flush that out a little bit. [indiscernible] major shift we might see in \u201818. Laurence Fink : Do you want to take the first part? Robert Kapito : Yeah. I\u2019ll take the first. There are a lot of clients that we have that have a large allocation to alternative whether they are hedge funds and private equity who have been somewhat disappointed in the returns that they had in 2017, relative to the returns they could have had, had they had exposure in the equity markets directly. So, there are some clients that are looking to move that increased allocation to alternatives directly into the equity market for 2018 as they have become more bullish and that's in light of all of the things that you know about, whether it be tax rates, earnings, global growth, et cetera, et cetera that they may have. They may be able to have a bigger return in the outright equity market than they do in some of the more alternative spaces. Gary Shedlin : So, Bill, to your first part of your question on G&A, so, yes higher year-over-year G&A and frankly also sequential G&A was driven by a number of, what we would consider, manageable core decisions that we\u2019re obviously very conscious, like technology, data, M&P, obviously, some occupancy as our headcount is growing. And the higher annual G&A expense, which was up about 12% clearly reflected, a, as we've talked about, a specific goal of ours of continuing to invest in core technology and data.  The annual, the year-over-year, the sequential, all three frankly also reflect the impact of a number of one-off items. We tried to highlight some of those, professional fees were higher related to a bunch of things. We had M&A activity during the year. We had Brexit planning. We have MiFID II planning. We have a bunch of stuff that was done in the fourth quarter in anticipation of tax reform as well as a number of other things that just kind of hit FX re-measurement expense.  We also saw some increased contingent payments associated with some prior deals. And as we've talked about before, we need to mark-to-market ongoing contingent payments. And so in some respects, as those expenses go up, those are good things because it means that those contingent payments are more in the money because of the fact that those deals are doing that way. That being said, our level of G&A spend has basically remained pretty much constant over the last five years and that's notwithstanding the fact that we've built and leveraged our scale.  We've obviously done a number of deals as well over that period of time. I think, the important thing that we're trying to convey here is that, you can't just look at G&A without looking at the overall discretionary expense base and there is obviously an interplay between our G&A expense and our compensation expense. As we're investing more in data and technology, we continue to change the composition of our employee base and you're actually seeing comp to revenue come down. So while we will continue to focus on managing the entire expense base, as we stated, we would expect 2018 G&A to creep up a little bit, but we would also expect comp to revenue to decline and we don't think any of that will basically impact the unstable markets, the upward bias in our overall margin. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Michael Cyprys : Just wanted to ask on a question on aging populations and people living along or just curious how you're thinking about the impact this could have on asset flows for the industry and does money stay invested for longer, creating a sticky asset base. Just curious your impact there. And then somewhat related to that would be, what opportunities do you see to innovate by linking asset management with insurance and technology around, as I'm thinking about your iRetire technology, what role could there be for insurance here and helping with people -- aging populations and people living longer? Laurence Fink : I think that\u2019s one of the big issues that\u2019s going to confront every major developed country and it\u2019s going to even impact a lot of developing countries, even like China. In the conversations that I have with different clients and regulators and politicians worldwide, this is a big question. Unquestionably, I do believe longevity is under appreciated and I believe we have not adequately conveyed what it means to be a long term investor, because I think people are living longer and are in a state of retirement longer.  So the need to invest in longer duration assets has never been greater. I think this is one of the causes why the yield curve is so flat when you look at the [indiscernible]. Obviously, that's an inflation reflection too, but the demand for long dated assets remains really strong and you look at that at credit spreads and one of the examples why equity markets remains to be very robust. Worldwide, demand for long dated financial assets remains to be strong.  So one, it means continuation of \u2013 I think, this is one of the foundations why financial markets have a good fundamental foundation to it and we're seeing different -- in our LifePath products, we've extended the life of some of the LifePaths, we've extended ownership of equities longer on some of our LifePath products. But, as I said, the demand from institutional clients or long dated assets remains to be quite robust. The big issue that we all are trying to address is how do we help more and more people when they're in the de-accumulation phase? What type of advice?  How can individuals really have great financial literacy and financial assistance during the de-accumulation phase of retirement? I think this is one of the big issues of some of this anxiety that I spoke about in my prepared remarks. I also believe, there are so many people in the world who are sitting at 50 years old and are unprepared because under investment in their retirement and the over dependency of cash and bonds. It's how that\u2019s playing. We just finished a two day board meeting.  We talk about long-term strategy and where we need to be working on. You brought up one important point that we are working on and that is how do we transform retirement in the world. That is one of BlackRock\u2019s long term strategies and that intersects with technology, that intersects with what our business in the United Sates, our business in Europe, our future business in China. So I don't have the answers yet, but we have many teams at BlackRock focusing on issues around retirement, around the longevity component of retirement, around de-accumulation and I think these are some of the most important questions that have to be raised and hopefully we can design products and meet those types of needs. I think as an industry, we're not there yet. I would also say, in society, we're not there yet. There is not enough debate here in the United States. There is not enough debate in Europe or anywhere else about how do we navigate the concept of longevity and retirement and the component of how does one have enough financial literacy to properly prepare for retirement and properly prepare for the moment when they're in the phase of de-accumulation. Operator : Your last question comes from Glenn Schorr from Evercore. Kaimon Chung : Hi. This is Kaimon Chung in for Glenn Schorr. Just wanted to get your perspective on the electronification of fixed income, I saw a recent headline that BlackRock and one of your biggest competitors plan to go fully electronic in bond trading which would be up from the 30% of bond volumes that you trade today. So what are you specifically doing in that area and how fast do you think you can get there? Robert Kapito : So, we\u2019re higher than the 30% that you're talking about. Most sponsors now are traded electronically. We have to be in this business. We\u2019re one of the largest traders of fixed income instruments. So we are involved and invested in various methods to trade electronically. We have people focused day-to-day on technology, in trading. So, we're very involved. I think it's going to be higher and higher every single year, but we're also involved in making sure that the markets operate in a very effective and efficient way. So we have a very large trading staff. Every one of them is involved in the electronic trading business and we'll be continuing going forward and this is really an important part of also our Aladdin, where we are helping others who don't have that electronic execution capabilities to have it through our technology. Laurence Fink : I would say one other point. We have looked at technology as a major component of how we have our trading platform. If you look at the scale of our platform today versus our scale of five years ago, one of the \u2013 and why our margins have increased as a firm systematically is the technologies that we utilize in the operations or platform. And the trading platform that we have today is mostly driven through technology.  And that's one of the great advantages and that's one of the great advantages that we have related to Aladdin and why so many clients are looking to employ Aladdin, because the need of having greater efficiencies in the operations of trading is becoming more and more important and for those organizations that are not prepared electronically, they have too higher costs. And as fees are coming down and if you don't have those efficiencies, you're going to be left behind. And I would also say one of the most important things about electronic trading and utilization of Aladdin, it brings down operational errors. So, it is a major component of what we do and we're very proud of the trading platform that we created and the efficiencies it has created for us on behalf of our clients. Let me just close and thank everybody for joining this morning. Our end of the year call \u2013 our 2017 results are directly linked to the investments we've made over time and importantly I do believe the results that you're seeing in terms of our flows is a direct result of the trust that clients have placed on BlackRock.  We will continue to leverage our differentiating scale and invest in our technology, and invest in the value proposition for our client and importantly create a great value proposition for our shareholders. I'd like to thank everyone with this call and wish everybody a Happy New Year and hopefully our year continues as robust as it has in the first 12 days of the year. Have a good one.

My name is Jamie and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated First Quarter 2018 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today\u2019s call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference. Christopher Meade : Good morning, everyone. I am Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock\u2019s actual results may of course differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So with that, I will turn it over to Gary. Gary Shedlin : Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to present results for the first quarter of 2018. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I will review our financial performance and business results while our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as adjusted financial information, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results. In addition as we have previously discussed, our first quarter 2018 financials reflect a recent adoption of FASB\u2019s new revenue recognition accounting standard which became effective on January 1. The only significant change relates to the presentation of certain distribution costs, which were previously netted against revenues and are now presented as an expense on a gross basis. For 2017, the new standard resulted in a net gross up of approximately $1.1 billion to BlackRock revenue, a corresponding process to expand and no material impact to as adjusted operating income or as adjusted operating margin. In order to simplify historical comparisons of current and future results, we adopted the new standard on a full retrospective basis and filed an 8-K in late March with recapped quarterly results for 2016 and 2017. All year-over-year and sequential financial comparisons referenced on this call will relate current quarter results to these recast financials. After a strong start to the year driven by optimism related to U.S. tax reform and global economic growth, markets reversed in February and March at escalating trade tensions, inflationary concerns and a flattened yield curve cause investors to pull back. Despite this increased market volatility, BlackRock\u2019s first quarter results once again demonstrate the value of the investments we have made to assemble the industry\u2019s leading global investment and technology platform. The diversification and breadth of our business positions us to serve clients in a variety of market environments helping to drive consistent and differentiated organic growth. Paced by a strong January, BlackRock generated $55 billion of long-term net inflows in the first quarter representing 4% annualized organic asset growth and 5% annualized long-term organic base fee growth as quarterly organic asset growth reflected strong higher fee global retail flows. First quarter revenue of $3.6 billion increased 16% year-over-year, while operating income of $1.4 billion rose 20%. Earnings per share of $6.70, was up 28% compared to a year ago driven by higher operating results and a lower effective tax rate in the current quarter. Non-operating results for the quarter reflected $10 million of net investment gains. Recall that net interest expense in the first quarter of 2017 included $14 million of call premium expense associated with a debt refinancing. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 20% and included a $56 million discrete tax benefit related to stock-based compensation awards that vested during the quarter. We now estimate that 24% is a reasonable projected tax rate for the remainder of 2018. However, the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring of discrete items and the issuance of additional guidance on or changes to our analysis of recently enacted tax reform legislation. First quarter base fees of $2.9 billion were up 17% year-over-year driven primarily by market appreciation and organic base fee growth of 7% over the last 12 months. Sequentially base fees were up 2% reflecting a lower day count compared to the fourth quarter. Continued momentum in institutional Aladdin and expansion of our digital wealth and distribution technologies including Aladdin Risk for Wealth and Cachematrix resulted in 19% year-over-year growth in quarterly technology and risk management revenue. Demand remained strong for our full range of technology and risk management solutions which contributed again to both technology revenue and base fees. Today\u2019s growth is a result of the investments we have made over time and we continued to invest in our business to create more opportunity for the future. Total expense increased 13% year-over-year driven by higher compensation, G&A and volume related expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up $101 million or 10% year-over-year driven primarily by higher headcount and increased incentive compensation associated with higher operating income, partially offset by approximately $20 million of severance and accelerated compensation expense associated with the repositioning of our active equity platform during the prior year period. Sequentially, compensation and benefit expense was down 2% due to lower incentive compensation primarily resulting from seasonally lower performance fees, partially offset by higher seasonal payroll taxes and an increase in stock based compensation expense related to new 2018 grants. G&A expense was up $87 million year-over-year reflecting higher levels of planned investment across a variety of categories including costs associated with MiFID II, but was also impacted by higher acquisition related fair value adjustments, product launch costs and FX re-measurement expense versus a year ago. Sequentially, G&A expense decreased $67 million in the fourth quarter reflecting in part seasonally lower marketing and promotional expense and reduced professional fees. Beginning this quarter, we are providing additional detail on both G&A and distribution and servicing costs which can be found on Page 8 of our earnings release. Direct fund expenses was up $55 million or 27% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher average AUM as a result of significant growth in our iShares franchise. Our first quarter as adjusted operating margin of 44.1% was up 150 basis points versus the year ago quarter which included expense associated with our active equity platform repositioning. We continued to be margin aware and remain committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible. We also remain committed to returning excess cash flow to our shareholders. We previously announced a 15% increase in our quarterly dividend to $2.88 per share of common stock and also repurchased an additional $335 million worth of common shares in the first quarter. As we finalize the impact of tax reform on BlackRock, we intend to review our capital management plans for the balance of 2018 with our Board of Directors in the coming months. Quarterly long-term net inflows of $55 billion were positive in both index and active strategies including approximately $1 billion of active equity net inflows during the quarter. We achieved 5% or greater long-term organic base fee growth for the fifth consecutive quarter despite the challenging market environment. Global iShares generated quarterly net inflows of $35 billion driven by strong flows into core ETFs. During recent periods of elevated market volatility, iShares ETF once again offered price transparency and secondary market liquidity to investors, demonstrated by the highest weekly exchange volume ever in the U.S., trading approximately $285 billion on exchange during a single week in February. Retail net inflows of $17 billion representing 11% annualized organic growth continued to trend positively and have now increased for five consecutive quarters. Inflows were positive in the U.S. and internationally and were paid by $10 billion of flows into our top performing active fixed income platform or 93% of our U.S. active fixed income mutual fund assets of top quartile performance over the trailing 5-year period. Equity inflows of $4 billion were driven by flows into active Asian and European equities while multi-asset flows were driven by $3 billion of flows into our multi-asset income fund. Institutional net inflows of $3 billion resulted from significant inflow and outflow activity during the quarter as various clients de-risked, rebalanced or saw liquidity in the current environment. Index flows of $10 billion driven by continued demand for LDI solutions more than offset active net outflows of $7 billion, which were impacted by a single multi-asset redemption related to client M&A activity and fixed income outflows linked to profit taking and cash repatriation planning. Despite overall flat organic asset growth, institutional clients drove 5% annualized organic base fee growth in the quarter driven in part by momentum in higher fee alternative products. Core alternatives, net inflows of nearly $2 billion reflected inflows into hedge funds, private equity solutions and infrastructure offerings. Illiquid alternative fundraising momentum continued into 2018 with an additional $2 billion in commitments raised during the first quarter. Finally, despite typical seasonal outflows in the cash industry during the first quarter, the strength of BlackRock\u2019s cash management platform drove $3 billion of net inflows as we continue to invest in our cash business and leverage scale for clients. Overall, our first quarter results reflect the benefits and the investments we have made to build a differentiated global business model, which can perform in various market environments. Our goal remains to exceed clients\u2019 needs by optimizing investments in talent and technology and delivering consistent and differentiated organic growth over time. With that, I will turn it over to Larry. Laurence Fink : Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining the call. Driven by a strong January, BlackRock generated $55 billion of long-term net inflows in the first quarter representing a 4% annualized organic growth rate and a 5% annualized organic base fee growth in a volatile market environment. These results reflect our ability to deepen partnerships and manage holistic relationships with a more diverse and global set of clients than at any time in our history. Meeting with clients recently in Europe, in Asia and here in the United States, I believe we are positioned with clients has never been stronger. The quality of our discussions our people are having is more robust than ever. BlackRock\u2019s technology and risk analytics and the diversity of our investment platform positions us to have a broader a deeper more robust conversations with our clients about their long-term needs. Following a period of historically low volatility in 2017, the record high equity markets in the first month of 2018, investors experienced the spike in equity market volatility in February and March rising concerns over a trade war and headlines in the technology sector have tempered investment sentiment causing many clients to pause or pullback as it become more uncertain about the future. In addition, the yield curve has hit its flattest level since October 2007 as it spread between 10 and 2-year treasuries has shrunk to just 50 basis points. While the prospects of rising rate tends to push investors away from long-dated fixed income, the flat curve is creating strong relative risk return opportunities in short duration funds and cash management strategies, which we saw clients take advantage of in the first quarter. While global economic growth prospects and expectations for corporate earnings remains strong in the quarter, the ongoing impact of U.S. tax reform and increased M&A activity influenced client behaviors and we saw a number of large inflows and a large amount of outflows as clients rebalanced and saw its liquidity to either fund future capital allocation or be more aggressive in share repurchases. Even with these various cross-currents retail and institutional clients turn to BlackRock over the quarter for both active and index strategies. Clients expressed demand across a diverse range of active and index fixed income strategies, including unconstrained short duration total return and emerging market debt funds. We also saw strong utilization of equity ETFs as simple and efficient tools for both taking on and deemphasizing market exposures. Finally, increasing demand for risk on assets and performance drove flows into active equities and alternative strategies. For long-term strategy at BlackRock has been to create a diverse and integrated global investment in technology platform, one that serves clients in all market environments. We harness this platform to construct and manage risk aware holistic portfolios that help clients to achieve long-term outcomes. We also provide institutions and intermediary partners with risk management and portfolio construction technology to better operate on their own businesses. As I discussed in my letter to shareholders in our annual report, this focus on client needs forms the foundation of our long-term strategy, it will continue to drive future growth at BlackRock for our clients and our shareholders. Our strategy is simple, we will continue investing in our business to establish a clear market leadership in areas of the greatest growth in client demand and we will leverage those full capabilities of our platform to enhance the value for our clients. In iShares, we have steadily invested over time and are the market leader today. We have generated over $900 billion of net inflows or a 22% annualized organic asset growth since we acquired the business in 2009. And in the first quarter, we once again captured the number one share year-to-date globally in the U.S. and European net inflows as well as a number one share of flows in the equity and smart beta categories. Demand is growing from clients who would utilize ETFs for efficient liquid market exposure through the secondary market. February\u2019s volatile global equity markets drove heightened ETF trading volume and iShares performed as our clients have come to expect. During the week from February 5 through February 9 when the U.S. stock market had suffered its steepest declines in more than 2 years, U.S. listed ETFs traded more than $1 trillion on exchanges. With iShares creating a record $285 billion yet creates and redeem activity of iShares funds over that same period of time was very low at less than $3 billion, demonstrating the benefits of a robust secondary market to create additional liquidity in distressed markets. Our iShares core products generated $32 billion in net inflows in the quarter as we continued to see increased adoption by ETFs by individuals. They increasingly are using ETFs at the core of their portfolios alongside cost efficient and high performing active. Institutions are engaging with BlackRock to create solutions that use ETFs in innovative ways to drive absolute return and positive outcomes. For example, this quarter we worked with a client seeking in term and liquid exposures to hedge fund beta. While they completed due diligence for their long-term hedge fund allocation, we designed an optimized basket of low cost iShares that closely replicated a hedge funds index, while maximizing liquidity and minimizing tracking year. This is a great example of how we harness our scale, our technology and our portfolio construction expertise to create unique solutions that will meet our client\u2019s needs. BlackRock\u2019s top performing fixed income platform generated $27 billion of net inflows in the quarter. Capturing client demand in a rising rate environment, inflows were driven by a diverse range of strategies including unconstrained, total return, short duration strategies and our emerging market debt funds. We are also seeing early signs of progress since our active equity platform was revitalized a year ago when we segmented our product offerings across the risk return and value spectrum in the even more effectively harnessing the power of data science and technology to efficiently and consistently deliver investment performance. At the end of the quarter, 66% of our fundamental active funds and 84% of both systematic active equity products or above benchmark or peer mediums for the 1-year period. Illiquid alternatives also remained a strategic growth priority for BlackRock as clients search for diverse solutions, diverse sources of return. We raised $2 billion of new commitments in the quarter for a total of $18 billion of dry powder to invest on behalf of our clients as we continue to build out our platform. We currently are managing $49 billion across our illiquid alternative platform and including our illiquid strategies, our core alternative platform now has $102 billion in assets. Finally, our cash management platform is strongly positioned for future growth. We have invested organically and inorganically to build scale and enhance our distribution reach of our cash management platform. Today, we managed nearly $460 billion in cash. We generated $3 billion in net inflows in the first quarter despite seasonal outflows for the cash industry and we are very well-positioned for additional organic growth opportunities laid into the prospects of a rising rate environment as corporations are repatriating their cash related to the U.S. tax reform. Last month, we have crossed 10 years since the start of the financial crisis. Over this time, we have seen many developments in the regulatory environments that have impacted our clients\u2019 operations and increased their need for technology solutions to help manage risk. Since our founding 30 years ago, we have always focused on using technology to better understand risk in client\u2019s portfolios. Aladdin risk analytics capabilities are what enabled us to be a trusted advisor of our clients during the financial crisis. And as we look ahead, we will remain steadfast in maintaining a high standard for risk management and continuing to use technology to enhance our own and our clients business. The movement to our fee-based advice in wealth management globally has continued to be strong even with some greater uncertainty around the fiduciary rule in the U.S. We continue to view this as an important trend and will require wealth managers to put greater focus on the overall portfolio not just products. We will be more focused on risk management and most importantly there will be more focus on a repeatable scalable investment process. This fee-based trend in recent market volatility has increased demand for our capabilities such as Aladdin Risk for Wealth, our newly launched advisory center in the U.S., FutureAdvisor and iRetire, which helped advisors construct better portfolios and scaling there of their own businesses. Demand remains strong for institutional Aladdin business, especially in Europe where many of these of our clients are upgrading their technology infrastructure to support growth in a changing regulatory environment. We saw 19% year-over-year growth in our technology and risk management revenues in the first quarter and continue to expect double-digit growth going forward. In early 2018, we also established the BlackRock lab for artificial intelligence in Palo Alto. To advance how BlackRock uses artificial intelligence and associated disciplines, machine learning, data science, natural language processing to improve outcomes and to drive progress for our investors, for our clients and for the overall firm. Another area where technology and analytics are becoming increasingly important is in sustainable investing or ESG related strategies. More and more clients, not only in Europe, but increasingly in the United States are seeking to understand their exposures to various environmental, social and governance related risk in their investments. From BlackRock\u2019s perspective, business relevant sustainable issues can contribute to a company\u2019s long-term financial performance. For this reason, we are increasingly integrating these considerations into our technology and risk platform for our investment research, for portfolio construction and the stewardship process that we do. In addition, BlackRock now manages over $430 billion in sustainable investment strategies and we see demand growing from institutions and retail clients alike in line with our strategic focus on technology and being a market leader in areas of greatest client demand. Last month we appointed three new Directors with combined expertise in technology, financial services and fast growing markets to join our Board of Directors Peggy Johnson, Bill Ford and Mark Wilson will bring a deep institutional industry knowledge with fresh perspectives on key areas of future growth for BlackRock. The value BlackRock is delivering to clients and the growth we are generating for shareholders is driven by our talented employees living our principles and believing in our purpose every day. It\u2019s our culture anchored in our principles that ensure we never forget who we are, who we serve even as the markets, our industry and even our firm experiences constant and sub times dramatic changes. Rob and I are focused on instilling this culture for a next generation with all of our 14,000 employees around the globe because that is what will position BlackRock to thrive and generate continued growth going forward in our next 30 years. We begin 2018 by maintaining our steadfast focus on the client\u2019s needs. We continue to invest in and execute on our strategy for long-term growth leveraging the benefits of our technology and scale, reinvigorating our focus on institutionalizing our culture for our future. With that let\u2019s open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Laurence Fink : Hi Craig. Craig Siegenthaler : Hi , good morning Larry. Gary, thanks for taking my question here. So over the last 2 years equity ETF flows have benefited from the implementation of the DOL [ph] role which is now vacated and also very strong equity market backdrop which triggered re-risking, I am just wondering how do you look for equity ETF flows to trend here, is there some deceleration as we have this evolving backdrop and also what\u2019s the risk now to equity ETF outflows if we have a large pullback in the equity markets just given that the business is now more mature? Robert Kapito : So we are going to be subject to the same cycles Craig that everyone else\u2019s in our active equity flows. But today, we are in a much better position because we have performance and our products are priced properly should be the best value in their class. So as we see cycles move towards active equities when active equity managers can outperform the benchmark including their fees, you will expect to see some flows out of the index product into the active equity product and we should be the beneficiary of that. With the changes in the DOL rules a lot of the financial advisors have been using index like an ETF products to create model portfolios and build those model portfolios with the least expensive products. But as the cycle started to change they will start to incorporate more active products in that both active fixed income and active equities and we should be the beneficiary of that now more than we have been in the past. Laurence Fink : Craig I would also add, we have witnessed a big shift from the big financial advisory firms more towards advice. I think that shift is moving more rapidly whether we are guided by a fiduciary rule or not next week, the SEC will be reviewing this. So we will hear from the SEC. But I do believe that changes that we have witnessed by the large platforms has changed how they sell products, I think it\u2019s much more portfolio based. I believe it\u2019s \u2013 we will continue to be more portfolio baseless product base, more solutions based, but I would also say they are in confusion as you suggested in U.S., but in Europe it\u2019s moved. Europe has definitely moved especially with MiFID II much more towards advice and through a portfolio of solution. So I think this trend towards advice is global, it is not slowing down. And I do believe and I will reconfirm it the secular growth in ETFs will continue to be very strong we have said and we have not changed our opinions over the next 3 years to 5 years ETFs will double in size. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Laurence Fink : Hi Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thanks very much. It can\u2019t help, but try to ask you guys if the move up in LIBOR and LIBOR OIS, curious if you think it\u2019s indicative of any future credit prompts just to move up in rates and rate expectations and some technical issues and then importantly how does that impact your fixed income platform flows activity levels things like that? Gary Shedlin : So volatility in fixed income market was actually really good for us as you know Glenn. We are one of the largest players in the fixed income space and creating some more interest in higher rates is going to pull a significant amount of money out of the cash into products that have been fairly stable for quite a long period of time. So you know that there is a very big imbalance right now because of volatility where we estimate there is over $50 trillion of cash that\u2019s sitting in bank accounts earning less than 1%, some places negative. So as rates go up especially in the short end that is going to attract a lot of this cash into the fixed income markets of which we can manage that money rather directly into the normal fixed income products or into ETF fixed income products which seem to be getting a lot of the new flows from rises in rates. Laurence Fink : I am going to also add Glenn, we did witness outflows in high yield as an industry, as a firm and so your statement related to LIBOR, there I think it\u2019s a reflection on some fears of the credit markets are \u2013 have over I think the credit spreads have tightened way too much and are going to witness some possible widening of yes more of a directional of the equity markets more than anything else. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a systemic change, but I do believe the rise in LIBOR is an indicator of some poor positioning by some professionals, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything of any significance at this time. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Katz with Citi. Laurence Fink : Hey Bill. Bill Katz : Okay. Thank you very much. Good morning everyone and thank you for taking the question. Just coming back to expenses, so thank you very much for the added disclosure, that is helpful. As we look at the 383, particularly in the G&A line, $32 million how should we think about that going forward, Gary you mentioned a few things in there that sort of affected the year-to-year change, but I know you are spending a bit, I heard that the income through the commentary as well, is this a good base to run-off of or are there more seasonal pressures here that maybe changed up to basically get to the second half of the year? Gary Shedlin : Good morning, Bill. Thanks for your questions. I think we tried to answer that question last quarter, we will continue to try and answer it again. I think that we need to continually focus on looking at the entirety of our discretionary expense base. There is definitely an interplay between our G&A line and compensation and as we continue to invest more across the platform some of those items will hit the G&A line like data, like technology, like occupancy, obviously MiFID II costs hit there as well. But we are also as we do that we are able to change the composition of our employee base. So, I think as we said before as we would expect G&A expense to increase in stable markets, we are also looking for compensation as a percent of revenue to decline primarily as a functional historical investment and scale in our business. So, the result when you look at the two of them again assuming that we have got fairly stable markets is continued upward bios in our margin and we intend to continue playing offense in this environment. We went into 2018 planning to basically invest as much in the business as we have in years. And I think for the moment really nothing is changing our view there. That being said, I think we have tried to call out and you will see obviously on some of the disclosures there, I mean, most of that was basically in our cue, we are moving it up a little bit. We have added a few lines. We have been calling out what we have called some more episodic, let\u2019s call it non-core G&A lines that make that line item bump around a lot and we think hopefully with the incremental disclosure you will have better insight as to what the recurring investment through that category is. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Michael Cyprys : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask about the BlackRock lab for artificial intelligence, just curious how you are thinking about the key objectives for this lab how you are betting it within the overall organization and what sort of metrics you are focused on in measuring the success of this lab and maybe you can share with us any sort of stats on the headcount and how you see that growing over the next couple of years? Laurence Fink : So, this is really quite important to us and it dovetails with the first area that we have built to assist portfolio managers, which is the BlackRock Investment Institute and this was getting all of our portfolio teams together with some of the best econometrics and people to talk about how we can structure portfolios better. Once we have that together and that\u2019s a pretty significant group of people that meet 4 times a year and produce weekly commentaries and this is really for internal use. With the success of that, we wanted to take this further, because we believe that utilizing artificial intelligence and people, so man and machine is going to create a better result of man or machine. And so what we are doing is we are staffing up and we hired a number of technology-oriented people, we have hired someone from NASA, we have hired someone from the technology area out-west. And what we are doing is we are putting together a group to start to use the technology that we have already built to see how we can find some significance in that forward performance. So, this is the beginning of what everyone has been writing about. It\u2019s more than just fin-tech. This is using data to try to pull it in first which is not easy to do. Yes, there is the technology to pull in the data of which most data has only been around for the last 5 years getting access to the data, pulling it in, analyzing it, seeing if there is any significance to it and then testing that in the portfolios of our performance. So, this is a real important effort that\u2019s going on and we are investing quite a lot into this and it will dovetail into our investment institute, the internal research that we do, the portfolio manager\u2019s capability and eventually all be able to be the throughput through Aladdin and our other technology. Robert Kapito : Let me add one more thing Michael. As I have said in many quarterly updates and I just discussed that in my Chairman\u2019s letter that is going to be released, I guess, Friday, Monday, I have it already. Technology continues to be one of our most important focuses as a firm. And this is a focus not just for the investment areas of focus across the entire firm. Clearly, using technology to give us better insights for investment performance is key, but we have historically have used technology to improve our operational scale, I think this is one of the reasons why our margins have improved over the last 5 years. We are using technology to enhance our connectivity with our clients in creating better distribution technology. And obviously we have historically viewed technology to enhance our risk analytics. So our scale and our global reach is allowing us to continue to invest and invest significantly for the future on behalf of our shareholders and our client. But there is I think our labs is just another step in this investment. The key for us to continue to drive our scale, our connectivity to our clients and better investment performance is pretty better operational efficiencies. So if you find this question about how many people we are going to be hiring and overall that\u2019s significant whether the number is as we \u2013 that is our expectation that these investments as they have in the past is going to create more operational efficiencies over the longer. And I believe that\u2019s how we continue to drive our business, are driving by creating better operating efficiencies, by creating more scale, especially as we expand globally and the needs for better risk analytics as we are investing more and more globally worldwide. So this is just a component, it\u2019s pretty special as Rob suggested. And we believe we are going to get better, deeper insight on AI specifically with this one investment, but it is part of the whole strategy of investing related to technology. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Laurence Fink : Hi Brian. Brian Bedell : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe to shift back to the financial advisor sales effort that you guys have been obviously really printing up to the last few years and especially with Aladdin for Wealth, could you just mention the potential for a renewed sort of advisors revisiting active strategies, maybe if you can talk about that a little bit more and how you are positioning your ETF franchise versus your active franchise with advisors. And also on smart beta, obviously we have been more in a beta rally with the ETF flows over the last year or so, do you see a greater demand for smart beta products versus the beta with the certain new volatility regime in the markets? Laurence Fink : So working backwards, we are seeing a huge demand for our smart beta product. And you know that in 2017 we saw about 15% organic growth in smart beta and we are really differentiating ourselves in that particular area. At the end of the first quarter, we managed about $190 billion in factor based products including 108 of smart beta ETFs which were the number one player. iShares now has a global lineup of 147 smart beta ETFs, so we have created that as we are seeing the demand. We did see factor based inflows of about $3 billion this quarter, representing so far 6% annualized organic growth rates. So we believe the fact that strategies are going to continue to grow and we are investing in people and technology in the states. We have a pretty good set of unique advantages in factors, a rich history of innovation and thought leadership. As we created the first smart beta equity yield fund in 1979, we have the full spectrum of strategies from smart beta whether it be multifactor, single factor min valve to enhance to long only factors which enable us to actually create solutions. The construction capabilities I believe that we have help our clients to construct what we call a factor aware model, that technology and analytics that we have powered by Aladdin really help our team isolate and monitor factors in our investment process and to perform the necessary risk and analysis for clients and lastly, our people which we have included Andrew Ang, who heads our factor-based strategies group and they bring significant portfolio construction experience and model-based investment skills for the clients. Now, when it comes to ETFs and financial advisors, financial advisors are being asked to do more, it\u2019s not a stock picking or bond picking environment. What they need to do is they need to have the tools to be able to understand the risk behind the individual portfolios that they have, they need help in modeling portfolios. And a lot of this is going to be coming through technology. So, we have spent many, many years now building technology for large institutional clients and have had most recently the ability to use that technology to bring it to the financial advisor, where they could look at individual portfolios and understand the risk that they have in the returns and match it to the liabilities or the outcome that a client needs and not only individual, but they could do it in aggregate for all of the portfolios that they are overseeing. That gives them not only the ability to have better information, but it also gives them the ability to be much more efficient and they can handle many, many more clients. So, by working to understand what they need for their clients, they need to grow their business. We are seeing a huge demand for that capability. And of course when you are modeling and the changes in compensation have taken place for financial advisors, they need to create portfolios based upon the lowest priced products that they could have, and that describes some of the movement between the alpha seeking strategies and the passive and ETF business. And part of the ETF business is driven by this need to have products to express precision ways to get returns in a portfolio that they have. So, it all dovetails in if you have now the analytics, the technology, the modeling capability, the portfolio construction experience and then the products to put in. And if you think about what Larry described in his opening session, it was developing these tools specifically for that and that\u2019s been our mission and I think that\u2019s what\u2019s driving more financial advisors who want to work with BlackRock, because we can provide the full service that they need for their business going forward and achieve the desired result for their client. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Laurence Fink : Hi, Michael. Michael Carrier : Hi, Larry. Thanks a lot. So just a question on the institutional channel and just two parts you mentioned lot of the inflows and outflows kind of the lumpy things in the quarter, has that mostly died down or do you expect more and the more important question is you highlighted the alternative platform. And specifically on the illiquids, I think you guys are around $50 billion, it\u2019s definitely scale relative to some of the players in the industry, but some are at 150, 200 plus have relationships with most of the LPs out there. So, if you all fund-raising backdrops create, just wanted to get an update on your guys\u2019 strategy, maybe ambitions for the illiquid alts and where you think that can be over the next couple of years? Laurence Fink : I think you are correct in saying we had a good quarter. We expect illiquid alts could be one of the more significant delta or net drivers for us in the next few years. We have spent since 2012 a long foundation in building our infrastructure business is up to $18 billion now we are out fund-raising now for another global alternative energy fund. We are in the process of raising long-term private capital fund. And so I think we are going to have a lot to talk about over the next few quarters related to the opportunities and the position that BlackRock has across our illiquid platform. I would also though suggest I think we are in very good position in our illiquid alts area too. So, we look at this as a important growth area for the firm. We believe this will be a continuing waiver in our net organic base fee column. And we purposely have been investing in these areas now for the last 5 years and I do believe we are just beginning to see the net positive flows into these strategies. Gary Shedlin : Michael, I would just remind people that a couple of things on the illiquid alts business. First of all, when we talk about the so-called committed, but un-invested capital that there is about an $18 billion incremental pipeline for that $50 billion number that you mentioned, which frankly is across the board both in terms of private equity solutions and private credit, which is a big focus for us. Larry mentioned both real estate infrastructure and obviously by virtue of the fact that we are a solutions oriented firm we actually have a fairly significant effort and time together solutions of alternatives, which has got another couple billion of commitments that are outstanding. Secondly and that not creates as you know for us, because we call it committed capital and not net new business, it\u2019s because we don\u2019t earn fees on the committed capital, so if that committed capital basically gets put into the ground that becomes a future bank of net new business for us going forward. And then secondarily just because the performance fee line gets a lot of attention now and then remember, we also don\u2019t account for our performance fees in illiquids the same way as some of those pure-plays do. We are basically waiting until the end of the cycle of those funds once the capital is returned and no longer subject to claw-back and we are not marking to market that across the board. We do try to provide some incremental disclosure for you in some of our annual filings on that, so you have an idea of what the built-in bank there is. But I think as we think about it, we are very bullish on the future growth prospects of that sector. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Chris Harris : Thanks. Hey, guys. Wondering if you can give us an update on the actives business outside the U.S. really just helping you guys could maybe give us a little bit incremental color on where you see the biggest opportunities and what you are most optimistic about outside the U.S.? Laurence Fink : So, the area that we are seeing the most interest right now is in Asian equity franchise. A lot of people are looking for exposure there and lucky for us we have some very large products that have excellent performance. Those where we saw some of the inflows this quarter and expect that to continue as we are hearing more and more people are trying to figure out how to get exposure into those areas. The second area is the European equity and European equity hedge fund that we have, both have significant demand primarily because of their long-term track record and performance and you find the cycle here of what we are saying. When you have good products at the right price with good performance, people find out and want to invest but the two I think growth areas for us outside of the U.S. have been European equities, primarily in the large cap side and Asian equities really across the stack. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Laurence Fink : Hi, Pat. Patrick Davitt : Hey, good morning. So, we are starting to see UK pension mandate consolidation enough if you press or accelerate and we would expect the upcoming consult and anti-competition review to push that along. As one of the largest pension managers there, I imagine you could be a consolidator through this theme. So, could you speak to how that\u2019s playing out from a flow and fee perspective and how you see BlackRock positioned as a net winner or a loser as it plays out? Laurence Fink : Well, right now, I would say considering the things that we are working on we will be a beneficiary of money that\u2019s going to be in motion, because of the changes in regulation and the movement of money out of some of the pension plans. So that\u2019s on the good side. On the negative side of that, there is nobody that wants to pay increased fees, I can assure you that. So this is where the scale and size and efficiency that a manager have is going to put them added advantage. And that\u2019s really what the key advantage is for us to be able to go in and take a large size at fee levels that are within the context of what they are willing to pay. So I think we will be a beneficiary, but it\u2019s going to be a lot of work and the revenue opportunities are not going to be as large as one might think. Laurence Fink : I will just add one more point to that before going to my closing remarks. The consultant community because you suggested has been a heavy winner in some of the OCIO businesses. I think that\u2019s where the opportunities will be for us and as Rob suggested those are the lower fee businesses. But I do believe there we can be a consolidator and we don\u2019t have any apparent conflicts that are being investigated in the UK pension community. With that, let me just thank you all for joining us this morning and having continued interest in BlackRock. BlackRock\u2019s first quarter results reflect the value that our diverse investment platform, investments we made, our risk management capabilities, our technology what we provide to our clients as they are trying to invest to achieve their long-term goals. We have continuously evolved our platform to deliver the outcomes for our clients through a changing market backdrop and today we are better positioned. We are having deeper dialogues. We are having more consistent meetings with our clients than ever before. In these higher volatility moments this is when BlackRock over 30 years have differentiated ourselves. The anomaly of low volatility in 2017 is now over, we are back to more volatile world, different inputs, different issues and this is where BlackRock is \u2013 has historically done quite well and I believe we are well-positioned for that. We are focused on delivering growth and scale advantages to both our clients and our shareholders in 2018. And I think the first quarter was a good start to that and I expect a continuation of that throughout 2018. So have a good quarter. And we will talk to everybody sometimes in July.

Kapito - President Analysts : Bill Katz - Citigroup Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs Ken Worthington - JP Morgan Dan Fannon - Jefferies Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research Michael Cyprys - Morgan Stanley Kaimon Chung - Evercore ISI Robert Lee - KBW Brennan Hawken - UBS Operator : Good morning. My name is Jamie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference. Christopher J. Meade: Good morning, everyone. I am Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock\u2019s actual results may of course differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So with that, I will turn it over to Gary. Gary S. Shedlin: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for this second quarter of 2018. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial information, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results. As a reminder, all year-over-year financial comparisons referenced on this call will relate current quarter results to recast financials reflecting the adoption FASB\u2019s revenue recognition accounting standard, which became effective on January 1st. After strong start to 2018, markets reversed mid-first quarter as escalating trade tensions, inflationary concerns and a flattening yield curve caused investors to pull back. Market uncertainty continued throughout the second quarter, reflecting ongoing global trade tensions, a slowdown in emerging markets, increased volatility and widening credit spreads. In the face of an uncertain and evolving investment landscape, clients have paused, deferring their investment decisions until they have greater clarity on the future. Last month, at our 2018 Investor Day, we described how BlackRock's strategic differentiators, our globally integrated investment management and technology business with a comprehensive array of products and portfolio construction capabilities and unparalleled distribution reach position us to outperform, especially in times like these. Client needs for investment advice, Aladdin and digital tools are greater than ever before and we are having richer dialogues with them than at any time in our history. Our globally diversified business model enables us to stay committed to and continually invest in our long-term strategic growth plans to ensure we are well-positioned to serve clients in any market environment. BlackRock generated $20 billion of total net inflows in the second quarter. Net inflows were positive across active, index and cash evidencing the breadth of our investment capabilities including market cap-weighted indices, factors, alpha seeking strategies and illiquid alternatives. Despite the current slowdown in industry flows, BlackRock has generated over $275 billion in total flows over the last 12 months, representing 5% total organic asset growth.  Second quarter revenue of $3.6 billion increased 11% year-over-year, while operating income of $1.4 billion rose 16%. Earnings per share of $6.66 was up 28% compared to a year ago, driven by higher operating results and a lower effective tax rate in the current quarter. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 24%. We now estimate that 23% is a reasonable projected tax run-rate for the remainder of 2018. However, the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of non-recurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on or changes to our analysis of last year's tax reform legislation. Second quarter base fees of $2.9 billion were up 10% year-over-year, driven primarily by market appreciation and total organic base fee growth of 5% over the last 12 months. Sequentially, base fees were flat despite lower average AUM levels as a result of seasonally higher securities lending revenue and a higher day count in the second quarter. Performance fees of $91 million increased $43 million year-over-year due to improved relative performance and loan only equity funds and our broad-based direct and solutions oriented hedge fund platform. Continued momentum in institutional Aladdin and expansion of our digital wealth and distribution technologies resulted in 25% year-over-year growth in quarterly technology services revenue. Current quarter results were bolstered by the timing of several significant client go-lives. Overall, demand remains strong for our full range of technology solutions, which contributes to gains in both technology services revenue and base fees. Advisory and other revenue of $78 million reflected a strong quarter for financial markets advisory services. Our commitment to investing for future growth remains steadfast, even in more challenging markets. Total expense increased 8% year-over-year, driven by higher compensation, G&A, and volume-related expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up $85 million or 9% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher headcount and increased incentive compensation associated with higher operating income. Sequentially, compensation and benefit expense was down 3%, reflecting seasonally lower employer payroll taxes. G&A expense was up $48 million year-over-year, reflecting higher levels of planned investment across a variety of categories led by continued investment in technology and portfolio services. Direct fund expense was up $43 million or 19% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher average AUM as a result of significant growth in our iShares franchise. Our second quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 45.2% was up a 130 basis points year-over-year. We remain margin-aware, especially in the current environment but continue to play offense in order to optimize organic growth in the most efficient way possible. We also remain committed to returning excess cash flow to shareholders. As we announced at Investor Day, we expect to see Board approval this week to increase our quarterly dividend from $2.88 per share to $3.13 per share. On an annualized basis, this represents an increase in our dividend of $1 per share to $12.52 per share or a 25% increase from our 2017 dividend of $10 per share. We also repurchased an additional $300 million worth of common shares during the second quarter. Quarterly net inflows of $20 billion were positive in both active and index strategies as well as in our cash management business. Global iShares generated quarterly net inflows of $18 billion, driven by continued strong demand from long-term investors in our core franchise. Flows into higher fee non-core iShares have slowed during the year as market uncertainty has impacted investors\u2019 tactical risk allocation decisions. Retail net inflows of $5 billion were paced by flows into active fixed income, our multi-asset income fund and our event-driven liquid alternative fund. Equity net outflows were primarily associated with products investing in non-U.S. equities and natural resources. Institutional net outflows of $9 billion resulted from both significant inflow and outflow activity during the quarter as various clients derisked, rebalanced or sought liquidity in the current environment. Despite net outflows, institutional clients drove positive annualized organic base fee growth in the quarter, driven in part by mix shift associated with higher fee active products. Institutional index net outflows of $13 billion reflected significant derisking activity in the passive equity book, partially offset by continued demand for LDI fixed income solutions. Institutional active net inflows of $5 billion were driven by multi-asset net inflows of $8 billion, led by continued demand for our target date offerings. Fixed income net outflows of $3 billion reflected continued cash repatriation activity and client losses associated with insurance-related M&A transactions. Illiquid alternative fund raising momentum continued with an additional $2 billion in commitments raised during the second quarter. We also announced the acquisition of Tennenbaum Capital Partners scheduled to close in the third quarter, augmenting our position as a leading, global credit asset manager, and advancing our goal of providing clients with a diverse range of alternate investment products and solutions to meet their evolving needs. Finally, despite a difficult quarter for the cash management industry driven by both seasonal and repatriated quarterly tax payments, BlackRock\u2019s cash management business saw net inflows of $6 billion as our product breadth, scale and technology-first distribution strategy is resonating with clients and leading to differentiated business performance. We have managed our business through market volatility and uncertainty at various times over the past few years. During each instance, we remained intensely focused on strategically positioning ourselves for long-term growth. Our strong and resilient platform enables us to continue investing prudently in our fastest growing opportunities and extending our value proposition in those areas where we are already market leaders. With that, I will turn it over to Larry. Laurence D. Fink: Thank you, Gary. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining the call. After a strong close to 2017 and equity markets reaching all-time highs in January, volatility has remained elevated in the second quarter as clients recalibrated their risk. Political uncertainty has ramped up again. Governments are changing hands in Italy and Mexico, and further questions around other elections and policy decisions continue to challenge investors\u2019 confidence. Most significantly, some of the strongest foundational components of international investing are being tested as trade frictions escalate to new levels. Strong earnings and the U.S. economic growth unfortunately are being offset by heightened uncertainty due to rising protectionism and potential barriers to the open markets and free trades that have been for years supported global economic growth and the expansion of international markets. These circumstances are impacting markets, exchange rates, and global capital flows. Additionally, companies are using excess capital to make acquisitions and more aggressively repurchasing shares at levels not seen since 2007, and the pool of investable equities is shrinking. Over time, the supply and demand dynamic should be positive for the markets but the current market environment has not rewarded such corporate behavior as it has in the past. If you strip out a handful of outperforming tech stocks, the lack of breadth in the equity markets is troubling. We are at a pivotal point. Clients are struggling to better understand increased risk and uncertainty, and market dynamics are shifting, causing those clients to pause as they think about the future. Short term rates have now surpassed 2%, a level not seen in almost 10 years. These rising rates and a flattening curve have made cash not a safe place but now also a more profitable place for investors to stand by and wait. While investors\u2019 caution has impacted industry flows, BlackRock continues to benefit from the value of our diverse global investment and technology platform. Revenues increased 11%, operating income increased 16%, and our earnings per share increased 28% year-over-year. We generated $20 billion of total net inflows, positive across active index and cash in the second quarter. We have seen markets and uncertainty like this before. As clients globally grapple with this uncertainty, they\u2019re reaching out to BlackRock with more frequency, with more momentum. The dialogues with the clients to date have never been stronger. We believe that the long-term trends at BlackRock is strategically positioned to address -- remain intact. The investments we have made to strengthen our index, our active and alternative platforms, and our investments in portfolio construction, asset allocation and distribution technologies position us to deepen relationships and partnerships with both institutional and wealth clients. We remain focus on investing in BlackRock\u2019s future to stay ahead of our clients\u2019 needs and capture the most impactful long-term industry opportunities. This means constantly improving our investment platform and technology, becoming more global and more local in the markets where we operate and taking advantage of our scale to serve our clients better and deliver more value to our shareholders. As institutional clients around the world react to market movements and uncertainties, activity has been elevated year-to-date with growth flows up substantially relative to the same period last year. However, while clients have shifted assets within investment strategies, they have been hesitant to put new assets to work and net flows have been more muted as a result. Similar to last quarter, the ongoing impact of U.S. tax reform also influenced institutional client behavior in the second quarter. A number of U.S. based clients saw liquidity from index equity allocations to fund share repurchases and M&A. Pension clients are looking to outsource our investment responsibilities in an increasingly complex investment landscape, which is driving momentum in our outsourced CIO business, both in the United States and internationally. We\u2019re also seeing strong momentum in LDI discussions as a combination of rising rates and resilient equity markets levels create incentives for clients to immunize their portfolios. Our commitment to delivering a differentiated long-term retirement solution to corporate clients is also generating results. We continue to see interest in our asset allocation and customized target date capabilities. LifePath, our target date service -- series has generated $8 billion in net inflows in the quarter, representing 17% annualized organic growth. This quarter, adoption of ETFs at the core of the investors\u2019 portfolios drove $18 billion in net inflows into iShares. And BlackRock once again captured the number one share of global ETF flows year-to-date. Because buy and hold clients positioning their portfolio for the long-term, they tend to be less sensitive to interquarter volatility than liquidity-driven users of ETFs. We have strategically invested to provide high-quality index exposures with a range of value propositions for our clients. We are confident in the long-term secular growth opportunities for ETFs, and we believe that the global ETF market can reach between $10 and trillion $12 trillion in assets by the end of 2023. Growth will be driven by core and non-core products. Institutions are increasingly using ETFs as alpha generation tools and replacement for futures and swaps both in equities and fixed income exposures. And world clients globally are using ETFs in fee-based ecosystems. Wealth managers are increasingly using models in their fee-based advisory businesses. And the nature of BlackRock's relationships with wealth managers and advisors is becoming more and more similar to the deep holistic engagements we have with our institutional clients. Our ability to provide clients with digital tools and whole portfolio solutions drove $5 billion of retail net inflows in the second quarter. This represents our sixth consecutive inflow quarter and growing momentum with financial advisors who are leveraging BlackRock's technology to manage risk and construct portfolios using both ETFs and our active mutual funds. Inflows were driven by our strong demand and our top performing active fixed income strategies where we generated $2 billion of net flows, each at our municipal bonds and our unconstrained strategies. Our unconstrained fixed income franchise in the U.S. and globally are particularly well-positioned for a rising rate environment. We achieved the number one position in gathering active fixed income flows for the quarter in the United States wealth space where we are delivering strong performance at good value with 88% of our assets are top performing and lowest priced quartile. The strength of BlackRock's fixed income platform reflects the team's use of Aladdin technology, sophisticated risk analytics, and scenario testing tools across diverse offerings of products from short duration to unconstrained. Performance across fixed income strategies remained strong at the end of the quarter, 78% of our tax flow fixed income assets were above benchmark or peer median for one year period. Our active equities, 59% of our fundamental and 86% of our systematic active equity assets were above benchmark or peer medians for one year period. Strong performance is the foundation for delivering client outcomes and driving net inflows. In alternatives, we\u2019re seeing more momentum in fund raisings than any point in BlackRock's history. Over the last few years, we've invested both organically and inorganically to build a comprehensive and differentiated alternative platform supported by robust sourcing capabilities, investment expertise and skilled distribution. We\u2019re beginning to see the benefits of these investments through strong performance across our platform, especially in infrastructure and private credit which are key focus areas for BlackRock and position us well in leading illiquid alternative space. We raised $2 billion in flows and $2 billion in additional commitments in our illiquid alternative business in the second quarter. During the quarter, we closed our European middle market private debt strategy with over $1 billion in commitments, which represents significant progress in establishing a leading global private credit platform and further expanding our capabilities in Europe. We also announced the first close of our third global energy and power infrastructure fund last week with $1.5 billion in commitments from a diverse global set of clients. The strong first close reinforces our position as the leading energy and power investment platform in the industry. And we continue to make progress in our long-term private capital strategy. We are seeing tremendous client interest for a structure that aligns with their long-term goals. Cash management is another area where we are gaining share. And we now manage $457 billion in cash assets. The cash strategy is earning between approximately 2 and 2.5%, levels not seen in the past decade. Clients are using cash as not only as a safe asset but one that provides attractive returns, especially in this market environment. BlackRock generated $6 billion in net inflows and cash strategies in the quarter, driven by the benefits of our global scale and tech-enabled distribution. This highlights one of the true benefits and differentiators of BlackRock\u2019s diverse business model. Technology is also a strategic differentiator and one of our largest priorities at BlackRock. Asset managers, wealth managers and custodial banks globally are rethinking their business models and looking for ways to operate more efficiently. Insurers and banks are facing regulatory consolidation in involving regulatory requirements. These changes are driving increased demand for BlackRock\u2019s broad-based technology services, and digital tools like Institutional Aladdin, Aladdin Wealth, Provider Aladdin and Cachematrix. For institutions, Aladdin is an enterprise investment management system, powering the entire investment process on a single platform, from portfolio analytics and construction to trade execution, to compliance to investment operations. It is also a powerful solution for custodians who service those assets through Provider Aladdin, as well as wealth for managers through Aladdin Wealth, bringing sophisticated institutional tools to the broad, wealth management community. Aladdin continues to benefit from those trends favoring global scale, multi-asset solutions and operating efficiency and simplicity. Our technology services revenues grew 25% year-over-year, reflecting an outsized number of institutional clients going live on the Aladdin platform in the quarter. We continue to expect double-digit growth in the low to mid teens range going forward. We are focused on near-term opportunities to partner with clients on their technology needs and investing in longer term opportunities in artificial intelligence and data science to enhance the way we and our clients invest, the way we distribute and how we operate. I want to by saying we\u2019ve seen these markets like this before that have caused investors to pause. But we believe that we are better prepared today to meet client needs than ever before. This is reflective in the depth, the quality of the dialogue we are having with clients across the globe. Indeed, we believe that in markets like these, clients put an even greater premium on the differentiating value proposition that BlackRock can offer them. With that, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup. Bill Katz : Good morning, everyone. Thank you very much for taking the question this morning. So, Larry, I\u2019d like to sort of circle back to your technology discussion. It seems like a very nice ramp quarter-on-quarter, year-on-year. When you think about your guidance of low to mid teens from here, is the second quarter -- and you said -- I think you said, there were few things that sort of turned on during the quarter. Is this a good start point for that assumption or is there sort of further momentum into the second half of the year to which we then sort of build to that low to mid teens growth rate into \u201819? Laurence D. Fink: Well, we tend to use that as a baseline. I am going to let Gary answer with the more specifics. But, as I said in my prepared remarks, we -- some of the wins we had a year ago and two years ago, depending on how long these conversions took, went live. And I am very pleased to say two very large institutional clients went live and so the ramp rate is higher. The dialogues we are having for Aladdin and all technology solutions is growing, but I think it\u2019s fair that we haven\u2019t adjusted yet our run rate. And I will let Gary go into that a little more. Gary S. Shedlin: Well, I think Larry, I think you answered it. I think it\u2019s -- the question of obviously what\u2019s there becomes the rate going forward but the sequential and the year-over-year increases obviously then change as a function of timing. So, as Larry said, the growth this quarter of 25% year-over-year did reflect an outsized number of significant institutional clients going live on the platform and the platform will continue to benefit. The other smaller item obviously that will come into play is we closed our Cachematrix deal in July of 2017, which we obviously benefited from the timing of that revenue related to other periods. So, that revenue will now be in both periods\u2019 time as we think about year-over-year changes. Laurence D. Fink: I would just add one more thing related to this. The demand for Aladdin services and all technology services is growing across the board. And in my conversations worldwide, I\u2019m hearing more and more clients are looking to add Aladdin services. But I think for run rate as Gary and I both said that it\u2019s a good level as a benchmark. Gary S. Shedlin: We\u2019ll continue to say this, probably answered a couple questions. But as we -- I think we\u2019ve always said, we don\u2019t believe quarter-to-quarter comparisons are the best way to think of our business. We think we tend to look at longer periods of time. And if you look at 12 months versus 12 months on a LTM basis for Aladdin, it\u2019s up closer to 18%, which is much more in line with our focus going forward. Laurence D. Fink: Yes. But the momentum is strong. Gary S. Shedlin: Absolutely. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Craig Siegenthaler : So, it looks like the slowdown in European flows is more of an industry issue than anything BlackRock specific. Can you just give us your thoughts on the softness? And maybe any perspective on this -- if this is a shorter term issue or a longer term problem? Laurence D. Fink: Well, some of it has been outflows from U.S. based investors that had their money overseas and they were investing in European products. So, when we had tax reform and they repatriated the money, you\u2019re seeing that in the flows. Two, there still remains to be in some of the sovereign wealth funds, some de-risking that occurred in the second quarter. And you\u2019re seeing some clients taking profits because of the value of the dollar, the dollar appreciated quite well in the second quarter. So, you\u2019re seeing many different diversion trends. But, I would say -- I don\u2019t have enough information to tell you, if it\u2019s a one quarter event. But I just came back from Europe spending quite a bit of time there. The opportunities in Europe, the broad conversation we\u2019re having with some of the very large European and Middle Eastern clients is strong as ever. In some cases, some of them have pause because of the tension related to trade. But, I would say, over a long period of time, the growth trends are intact. And I would say we\u2019re seeing outcomes of repatriation of cash, strong dollar and just global uncertainty. But, let\u2019s be clear, the dialogues are deeper than ever. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with the Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Just going back to the Aladdin discussion for a second, I was wondering if you guys could give us an update on the progress Aladdin for wealth is making. Again, any metrics you guys can put around them will be helpful. Whether it\u2019s client assets that are already in the platform and I guess any sense what sort of AUM contribution you guys have had, maybe over the last 12 months from Aladdin for wealth? Robert S. Kapito: So, this is a great new platform for us, because what we\u2019re doing is giving wealth managers the ability to analyze their portfolios, utilizing all of the technology that we have built in Aladdin, so that they can suggest better risk and better returns, and instead of 100 portfolios, 500 portfolios. So, this is becoming a very, very big business. There are over 7,000 individual advisors that are now using this. And as we're building this out, their requests for more and more technology is quite significant and we're building that in. So, this is going to be something that I think will help and that they will be utilizing their models, some people will be utilizing our models. We will be comparing the products they have in their clients' portfolios to better products that they might have in their portfolios, suggesting that they might not only use our products but other people's products to better the portfolios. So, this is a way to take what we're doing for our institutional clients and get deeper into solutions for the individual investor, but it's a business-to-business where we're utilizing this to help our distributors create better solutions for their clients. So, we're excited about this. We have several firms that have already signed on to this. It's going to take us a while to implement this. And also it takes us a while to get people to actually use it, even though it is implemented. So, we're very excited about this, very excited about the future of it. And again, following up on Larry's comments, it gives us the ability to have more holistic conversations with the wider group of clients and in this case, the retail clients or wealth management clients, which we're seeing a lot of flow from especially this quarter. Laurence D. Fink: Alex, let me just add one more thing. I think Rob said it very clearly, Aladdin Wealth takes maybe as long as one to two years like of conversion to get our retail wealth management clients to utilize them and to affect it. But one thing that we are hearing very loud, the advisors are looking for better client understanding and portfolio understanding; they're looking for better transparency; they\u2019re looking for better tools to navigate the clients' money with better consistency; they're using, as Rob said, more models and having Aladdin Wealth allow them to navigate this. And so, if anything, we are seeing greater demand for these types of products because it simplifies the process, it creates a better environment for investing a better environment for compliance and compliance review, and importantly, it allows the advisors and the firm to better understand all of their clients risks in comparing the risks associated with all the portfolios and making sure that those portfolios are meeting the needs of each and everyone's client portfolios. This plays into our strength. This gives us a great opportunity to be more connected with our distribution partners. And we're providing what I would say, the most-clear thing, a differentiating value proposition. So, it's not just about a product, it is providing them with a better enterprise solution to deal with their client issues more effectively with greater transparency. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JP Morgan. Ken Worthington : Hi. Good morning. It seems like we're seeing a greater use of commission-free platforms for the distribution of ETFs. So, Schwab has built its ETF platform from scratch using this approach, more recently we\u2019ve seen expanded use of commission-free ETF trading by both Ameritrade and Vanguard. So, I guess, maybe Larry, what do you think of these move to commission-free trading and ETS? And is this sort of the next evolution in ETF competition? Robert S. Kapito: Sure. This is -- I think it\u2019s actually positive for us and that the more people that are aware of ETFs, the better; the more people that have access to the ETFs, the better. So, we are the manufacturer here. And if there is a cheaper way that these groups want to distribute ETFs, quite frankly, it benefits us. So, I think for the distributors, it\u2019s a competitive process that they\u2019re going to have to step up to the plate like we do, because price and value is certainly one of the aspects of ETFs. But for us with the largest market share, the more people are distributing and buying ETFs, the better. Operator : Your next question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Laurence D. Fink: Hey, Dan. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. Can you discuss the multi-asset flows in a bit more detail? You talked about LifePath, I think seeing around $8 billion. I guess, can you just discuss momentum in that business more broadly and how to think about kind of the growth in that business or that segment going forward? Gary S. Shedlin: Sure, Dan. So, I think there is no question that there are really two or three big drivers of multi-asset flows in the quarter. And one thing I want to just say right at the outset is I think we\u2019ve said before and I think you know very well, it\u2019s important not to conflate the multi-asset line items that you see on our financial reconciliation tables to the broader theme of outcome-oriented investing and solutions. But the multi-asset line item did see 8 billion of flows in the quarter. As you mentioned, continued demand for target data offerings including one significant custom target date solution for a large client. In addition, strong flows into MAI or multi-asset income fund and factor based strategies of about $1 billion each. That being said, we do continue to see outflows from our global allocation fund. That was about $3 billion in the second quarter. And I think as we\u2019ve mentioned before that that is relevant, not as it relates necessarily to the flow itself but we do note that obviously global allo has a higher fee than LifePath does and that obviously creates some drag on fee rate and overall revenue growth. But otherwise, we\u2019re continuing to invest and believe very strongly in multi-asset category in and of itself and broader portfolio construction that pulls together lots of different parts of the BlackRock organization into client models and solutions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Patrick Davitt : Good morning. How are you? You saw some pretty punchy losses in longer dated core bond products in the second quarter. Could you speak to what you\u2019re seeing in terms of client conversations in terms of movement within the bond category, and if you\u2019re seeing maybe a pipeline of running from the hills from a longer dated stuff at this point? Laurence D. Fink: I don\u2019t think it was that bigger of outflows. I think it was -- I'm getting the number right now, but at least, $2 billion or less. We saw $26 billion of fixed income of flows. I think in long duration, it\u2019s a function of investors\u2019 belief over the long run that inflation is going to increase, maybe reserves are going to continue to be tightening, and there is greater value in the short end at this momentum than a long end. I think, when you look at the fixed income universe, it\u2019s many different opportunities. And there are many times when you see clients moving out of long end into short end or short end into long end. I don\u2019t believe there is any real dramatic change. I think, we did see emerging outflows and that\u2019s intermediate type of level of outflows. But, I don\u2019t think there was anything extraordinary in fixed income at all in the second quarter. If anything, if the trends continue, inflows -- in the short duration, inflows and unconstrained, and I think that continues to be the trend. And we continue -- now this is more intermediate again, we continue to see some very strong gains in municipals and that\u2019s around the 10-year maturity, so -- 7 to 10-year. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any big trend. Rob? Robert S. Kapito: So, Patrick, the only trend is what Larry mentioned in his opening remarks is that today, you can get as good a yield in a combination of risk-free assets and risk assets, as you can get in just risk assets. So, therefore, the flows that we\u2019ve seen which are appropriate considering where interest rates are and where the risk-free rate has gone that people would come out of high yield and emerging markets because they are not getting compensated enough relative to risk-free rates. So, it wouldn\u2019t be longer term and shorter term, it would just be riskier assets versus risk-free assets. And there, we saw the flows. And when that changes, we see the flows the other way. So we\u2019re not worried about it. It\u2019s really market-oriented and it\u2019s those people that are investing for the short term versus the long term. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Michael Cyprys : Great. So, thanks for taking the question. Just curious if we see true tariff wars emerge, what do you think the impact could on asset flows, where do you think we could see money fall out of in terms of asset classes, geographies and where do you think it flows into? Laurence D. Fink: Well, it\u2019ll flow more into dollar-based assets, generally we would see strengthening of the dollar. So, we would probably see some more dollar flows in the short run. In the long run, it may be negative. It really depends on if we had a real tariff war, does that disrupt the accelerated GDP growth that the U.S. is experiencing from tax reform. Does it create more uncertainties? But, if it doesn\u2019t, if we don\u2019t have at all outright tariff war that\u2019s increased from this point now, I would say equity markets are cheaper today than they were in January where we\u2019ve had great corporate earnings, record M&A, record amount of stock purchases. So, the amount of underlying equities has shrunk, and PEs have reduced. Now PEs are reduced from the year-to-date level from -- because of the global uncertainty. So, if there is more positive clarification that doesn\u2019t lead to tariff wars, then the markets would probably reassert itself quite strongly. And if there is a tariff war, some of it\u2019s priced into the market, some of it\u2019s not. I would say, Michael that there\u2019s some asymmetry here. I think there\u2019s probably a little more upside right now than downside. But, let\u2019s be clear. If it\u2019s a trade, leads to a reduction in future GDP, then the market will have a setback. But as I said, PEs have fallen from the beginning of the year. So, the market is trying to digest all this as we speak. So, I\u2019m pretty calm about it. But one thing I\u2019ll say, and I said this in my prepared remarks, I have never witnessed more client conversations around this uncertainty, and the opportunities we have with some of the clients today are as large as ever. We\u2019re having deeper conversation, broader conversations on clients on relooking at their risk on how to design their portfolios in these different types of scenarios. And probably the most important thing I could say is more and more clients are coming to BlackRock. Operator : Your next question is from line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Kaimon Chung : Hi. This is Kaimon Chung in for Glenn Schorr. I think your margin improvement in not too greatest environment, great to see. And I heard you\u2019re margin-aware and playing offensive for growth comments. But do you think you held back on any of the spending during the quarter and in particular G&A is up 20% year-over-year? Laurence D. Fink: No. Kaimon Chung : No? Laurence D. Fink: No. I\u2019m going to let Gary get into the details. We have not adjusted our spending related to investing in our future. We are going to continue to invest in our future to stay in front of our clients\u2019 needs. I think what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the margin expansion is, our investments in the past from technology is created better efficiencies, and we\u2019re able to do more with less. Gary? Gary S. Shedlin: So, thanks, Larry. So, I would just echo a couple things. One is I agree with Larry. We really are spending right now what we planned on spending when we went into the beginning of this year. We\u2019re obviously trying to be more thoughtful as to spending in the places we get the greatest impact in the current market. So, there\u2019s obviously always reallocation and rethinking as to what we want do with that spend. But, I think there\u2019s no question that our heads are up, our eyes are forward, and we\u2019re continuing to play offense in the market and continuing to invest in all of the strategic initiatives that we\u2019ve talked at length with you about and discussed again at Investor Day. So, illiquids, factors portfolio construction, technology across the board, as Larry said in terms of alpha generation, digital distribution, our own operating platform, continuing to think smartly about investing in regions, especially in the current environment where maybe even more important than ever to be local in key markets. And so, I think that\u2019s exactly right. On the other hand, again, as I echoed when we talked about our technology, growth from a year-over-year perspective. Quarterly margins are obviously -- we are -- even in positive markets, we would basically ask you to look at the trends overall. I think the trend over the last 12 months has been closer to around 80 basis points of margin improvement rather than what we saw this quarter. And so, spend will change on a quarter-to-quarter basis. And again, I think, looking at longer term trends is much more indicative of our operating leverage than necessarily on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Laurence D. Fink: As we constantly say, we're margin-aware. Gary S. Shedlin: Especially in this environment. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Robert Lee : Hey. Good morning, everyone. I guess, my -- well, question maybe will have A and B. But, while we always talk about kind of organic growth from a flow perspective, I guess, what really matters is really the flow contribution to the bottom line. So, I guess with that in mind, can you maybe give a little bit of sense on how -- I mean, I know you don't want to focus too much on just one quarter, but if we kind a look at the mix, I think you kind of hinted that at a little bit. But how would you characterize kind of the bottom line contribution of flows this quarter and maybe how that compares to where it\u2019s been last several quarters. Gary S. Shedlin: Yes. Rob, thanks. Good question. So, obviously, as we saw investors pause amidst uncertainty in flows, specifically -- when we looked at what caused some of those slowdown in flows this quarter, we did see a slowdown in our organic based fee growth for the quarter. I would say that that slowdown was primarily driven by a client shift and sentiment on equities. We did see strength in alternatives. We did see strength in fixed income. Though there was a shift to shorter duration fixed income, and that does come with a bit of a lower fee, more broadly. If we look at equities, as Larry mentioned, we saw strong growth in core iShares but less momentum in higher fee non-core exposures versus what we\u2019ve seen historically and in particular outflows in EEM, which is our flagship liquid emerging markets offering as well as in Europe, Japan and some non-U.S. developed markets in equities on a base-fee growth. If we think about those funds, clearly are relatively higher fee than the core. I think we additionally saw some slower active equity flows, particularly in Europe and Asia, which frankly is an area of strength for us from a performance standpoint. And as we\u2019ve mentioned in the past in our discussions, divergent beta and FX, those carry higher fee rates. But again, I think we feel really confident that the broader platform is going to do what it's going to do. As Larry mentioned, we're having stronger and deeper conversation with our clients. And as this uncertainty passes, we're pretty convinced that we're right where we need to be when the client activity kicks back in. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just had one, hopefully throw little bit of greater color on the sec lending side, strong this quarter, highlighted some seasonality. But, it was up year-over-year as well. And we're hearing that regulatory changes in Europe have sort of softened to some of the traditional seasonality. So, maybe could you give a little bit of color on what you're seeing there? And is it volume versus spread dynamic? How should we think about that here this quarter? Laurence D. Fink: It\u2019s actually both. When we have record amount of M&A there, it produces more volume, or stocks are on special. In addition, when you have higher rates, it\u2019s partially rates. And also, I do believe because of our position, because of the stable nature of our platform, and our investible assets or the assets that can be lent, we are able to command premium rates also because of the nature of the stability of these type of assets we have. And we made this as a major component of the value proposition that we provide to our iShares investors and to our index investors and we\u2019re able to generate better returns for them. And in many cases because of the strength and the power of BlackRock sec lending business, we\u2019re able to provide products after fees positive to the index. Gary S. Shedlin: So Brennan, specifically to your question on a sequential basis where we saw sec lending up about 18%, I would say that it is definitely both a price and volume as Larry mentioned. I mean, the book was up but frankly, sequentially spreads were up more, and that helped drive it. And I think part of that was increasing rates. So, we saw asset spreads going up. And part of it obviously is just increased demand for specials, which I think is partly seasonal that you see in Europe but also just the fact that the M&A environment is up significantly is helping our business. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks? Laurence D. Fink: Well, let me thank everybody for joining us this morning. As I said in my prepared remarks earlier, we have seen markets like this before, we\u2019ve seen customers and clients pause but I think we\u2019re better prepared today to meet the clients\u2019 needs than ever before and the opportunities in front of us have not been greater. Our second quarter results reflect the value that our diverse investment and technology platform provide for clients as they invest to achieve their long-term goals. We are confident that continued differentiation that BlackRock provides will enable us to deliver the growth that our shareholders ask of us and the scale opportunities over the long run to help both our clients and our shareholders. And I believe that is intact and the opportunities in front of us are as great as ever. Have a good quarter, everyone. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

Kapito - President Analysts : Dan Fannon - Jefferies Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Michael Cyprys - Morgan Stanley Ken Worthington - JP Morgan Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch William Katz - Citi Operator : Good morning. My name is Jamie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference. Christopher J. Meade: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I am Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock\u2019s actual results may of course differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So with that, I will turn it over to Gary. Gary S. Shedlin: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the third quarter of 2018. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I will review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial information, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results. As a reminder, all year-over-year financial comparisons referenced on this call will relate current quarter results to recast financials reflecting the adoption of FASB's revenue recognition accounting standard, which became effective on January 1. During our second quarter earnings call, we noted that clients were deferring investment decisions in the face of an uncertain and evolving investment landscape. While we saw a modest pickup in industry flows during the third quarter, primarily attributable to ETFs, we also saw accelerated de-risking by many clients in an environment marked by continued trade tensions, a further slowdown in emerging markets, and a steepening yield curve. Against this backdrop, more clients are looking to BlackRock for investment guidance and technology solutions than ever before. Despite current headwinds impacting the asset management industry, our globally diversified business model enables us to stay committed to and continually invest in our highest growth businesses such as iShares, multi-asset solutions, illiquid alternatives, and Aladdin. These investments will enable us to deliver differentiated organic growth for the future. BlackRock generated $11 billion of long-term net inflows in the third quarter, despite over $30 billion of institutional index equity outflows. Quarterly net inflows were positive across our iShares and active fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives platforms. Third quarter revenue of $3.6 billion increased 2% year-over-year, while operating income of $1.4 billion rose by 1%. Earnings per share of $7.52 were up 27% compared to a year-ago, driven primarily by higher nonoperating income and a lower effective tax rate in the current quarter. Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected $63 million of net investment income driven in large part by gains related to the sale of our minority interest in DSP Group, and the revaluation of a strategic minority investment. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 16% and included $90 million of discrete benefits primarily related to changes in our organizational tax structure. We continue to estimate that 23% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2018. However, the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on or changes to our analysis of last year's tax reform legislation. Third quarter base fees of $2.9 billion were up 4% year-over-year, driven primarily by market appreciation and organic base fee growth, offset by previously announced pricing investments in iShares. Sequentially, base fees were down 2% compared to the second quarter reflecting seasonally lower securities lending revenue, the negative impact of foreign exchange movement and our recent iShares pricing investments, partially offset by a higher day count in the third quarter. Our overall fee rate declined by about 0.6 basis point sequentially as base fee growth lagged overall growth in average AUM, primarily reflecting seasonally lower securities lending revenue and the impact of divergent beta as emerging markets and commodities continue to underperform developed markets. While the S&P 500, which generally tracks products with lower fee rates was up approximately 10% over the 6 months ended September 30, higher fee emerging markets exposures were down 10% on a dollar basis over that same time period. As a consequence of beta divergence intensifying toward the end of the quarter, our fourth quarter base fee entry rate will be lower than overall third quarter base fees. Performance fees of $151 million decreased $40 million year-over-year, reflecting lower fees from liquid alternative and long-only funds in a challenging environment for the hedge fund industry. Sequentially, performance fees increased as a result of a single European hedge fund that once again delivered exceptional full-year performance and locks annually in the third quarter. Continued momentum in institutional Aladdin and expansion of our digital wealth and distribution technologies resulted in 18% year-over-year growth in quarterly technology services revenue. While overall demand remains strong for our full range of technology solutions, 2018 has thus far been a particularly strong year for Aladdin, reflecting an outsized number of new clients sourced during the prior year and successfully implemented during the last 9 months. We continue to target low to mid teens growth for our technology business over the long term. Total expense increased 3% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher G&A and volume related expense. Quarterly G&A expense of $413 million reflected higher technology spend and included $13 million of deal-related expense related to strategic transactions completed during the quarter and $29 million of contingent consideration fair value adjustments related to prior acquisitions. At present, we would anticipate fourth quarter G&A to include normal, seasonally higher levels of marketing and promotional spend. Direct fund expense was up $18 million or 8% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher average AUM as a result of significant growth in our iShares franchise. Our third quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 44.2% was down 90 basis points year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower performance fees and the $42 million of transaction-related expenses in the current quarter. We remain margin aware especially in the current environment, but will continue to thoughtfully invest in our higher growth businesses to ensure we meet the needs of clients in this rapidly changing ecosystem. In line with that commitment, we closed several strategic transactions during the quarter that added a net $28 billion to our AUM and will accelerate our growth. We closed the acquisitions of Citibanamex Asset Management, furthering our goal to be a full solutions provider in Mexico and Tennenbaum Capital Partners, enhancing our private credit capabilities. In addition, we completed the transfer of our UK Defined Contribution Administration business to Aegon and the sale of our minority interest in DSP. We also repurchased $500 million worth of common shares during the third quarter, $200 million greater than our planned quarterly run rate as we saw attractive relative valuation opportunities in our stock during this time. Quarterly long-term net inflows of $11 billion were led by flows into strategic focus areas, including iShares, multi-asset strategies, and illiquid alternatives offset by outflows from lower fee, institutional index equity products. Global iShares generated quarterly net inflows of $34 billion, driven by continued strong demand from long-term investors in our core franchise. iShares flows beyond the quarter rebounded after a challenging second quarter, delivering net inflows of $13 billion driven by fixed income. Flows were well diversified across long duration treasuries, corporate bond, high yield and emerging market debt ETFs. Fidelity's decision to reduce overall barriers to investing and triple the number of commission free iShares available on their direct and adviser platforms resulted in the strongest August iShares inflows in the 5-year history of our strategic relationship. We believe that actions by direct platforms to reduce transaction costs will accelerate ETF industry growth, especially as more iShares are now available commission free than ever before. Retail net inflows of $2 billion reflected strength in active fixed income led by municipals, unconstrained and high yield strategies, and event driven liquid alternative funds, partially offset by outflows from non-U.S equities. In the United States, our active strategies continue to see positive organic growth and gain market share even as the domestic retail industry continues to see outflows. Institutional net outflows of $25 billion resulted primarily from over $30 billion of index equity outflows as clients continued to de-risk, rebalance or seek liquidity in the current environment. Despite overall institutional net outflows, we saw continued demand for multi-asset solutions OCIO, LDI, fixed income and illiquid alternatives. Momentum in our illiquid alternatives franchise continues. The third quarter represented our most successful fundraising quarter ever as BlackRock generated approximately $2 billion in net client flows and raised an additional $4 billion in commitments across the platform highlighted by the $1.5 billion first close of global energy and power infrastructure fund 3. BlackRock's illiquid alternatives franchise now has approximately $22 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of strategies, representing almost $160 million in incremental base fees and the opportunity for significant performance fees over time. Finally, BlackRock's cash management business experienced net outflows of $15 billion, driven by the planned redemption of a single escrow mandate. Excluding this redemption, our cash platforms saw a $9 billion of net inflows and continues to leverage scale and cash matrix technology to better serve clients. We are now the second largest money market managers globally and have steadily increased market share by more than 250 basis points over the last 3 years. BlackRock scaled global investment and technology platform was purposely built to weather the cyclical and secular headwinds impacting today's asset management business. We've shown an ability to grow and maintain margin in difficult markets before. Our diverse platform is as well-positioned as it's ever been to meet the evolving needs of client and we remain focused on playing offense by striking an appropriate balance between organically investing for future growth and practical discretionary expense management. With that, I will turn it over to Larry. Laurence D. Fink: Good morning, everyone, and thanks, Gary, and thank you for joining the call. BlackRock's third quarter results demonstrates to resilience of our differentiated platform as we once again delivered organic growth even in the face of industry headwinds. And we\u2019ve been through these tough markets -- tough market environments before and BlackRock has consistently delivered growth, though asset management -- flow through asset management flows and technology revenues, while exercising expense discipline and investing for our future. We built our platform around a holistic client centric approach and today we are delivering a broader spectrum of investment strategies in technology capabilities to more clients than at any time in our history. However, as Gary mentioned, many of the challenges facing our clients continued in the third quarter have accelerated with recent marketing volatility. Divergence monetary policy and macro and geopolitical uncertainty continues to impact investor sentiment and our financial markets, leading many clients to reduce risk in their portfolios. After a decade-long rise of multilateralism, protectionist agendas are pushing forward around the world. Concerns over trade tensions and particularly are weighing on investor sentiments. Meanwhile a strong U.S economy is adding to investor concerns about overheating and the potential for greater than previously anticipated fed -- Federal Reserve rate hikes. Political instability in certain markets is increasing. In Italy, for example, the government significantly widened its budget deficit for 2019 driving Italian bond yields to their highest levels since 2014. And in Brazil the Presidential election is intensifying political polarization. These developments are all heightening worldwide investors concerns. As a result, financial markets performance continues to diverge in 2018. While our U.S equities reached record highs in the third quarter driven by strong corporate earnings growth, European markets are trading below where they were a year-ago and emerging markets and commodities remain under pressure. Investors worldwide are taking a defensive posture highlighted by the market volatility we saw last week. Short-term government bond funds are seeing their highest inflows since 2010. Cash balances have grown to $80 trillion globally even as companies execute record amount of share repurchases and M&A accelerates globally. Asset management industry flows overall has slowed considerably. At the same time in this environment even more clients are turning to BlackRock for investment and technology solutions to navigate their portfolios. Throughout the quarter and in recent weeks, we announced a number of significant partnerships with a large -- with large long-term clients, all of which highlights BlackRock's differentiating value proposition. We generated $11 billion of long-term net inflows in the third quarter, despite more than $30 billion of non-ETF index equity outflows, much of which are connected with clients who are de-risking. And as Gary said, our technology services grew by 18% year-over-year. BlackRock's platform is strategically positioned to capture long-term growth in key areas of our business. We remain focused on further strengthening investment performance, enhancing our presence in local markets around the world, expanding our digital capabilities and using scale and technology to better serve clients and deliver shareholder value. One of our most differentiating areas of growth is our iShares ETF platform. We expect the ETF platform could double to more than $12 trillion in the next 5 years, driven by long-term secular trends. In the third quarter, iShares generated $34 billion in net inflows and BlackRock once again captured the number one share of global ETF flows for the quarter and year-to-date. iShares core products generated $20 billion in net inflows in the quarter. Long-term investors who are less reactive to the current market environment continue to invest in core broad market exposures often through model portfolios. In addition, we saw flows of $11 billion in the fixed-income as wealth managers and institutional investors are adopting fixed-income ETS. Fixed-income is one of the areas within iShares where broad ecosystem innovation is driving strong growth. This category have seen in excess of 20% annual organic growth in each of the last four years and we expect strong secular growth to continue. Fixed-income ETF provide investors with liquid vehicles for core and tactical bond allocations and reduce complexities in management of these bond portfolios. Demand has risen as investors gain more confidence in their benefits and simplicity, and as clients search for liquidity in global bond markets in an environment where increased bank capital requirements have diminished supply. This quarter BlackRock in partnership with the CBOE launched the first iShares high-yield corporate bond index future. We also partnered with the Intercontinental Exchange to establish an industry-wide open architecture primary market platform for ETFs that will -- will improve the trading ecosystem to help support continued growth. In addition to ETFs, clients are choosing BlackRock's other active index fixed-income strategies as they look for solutions across the risk spectrum. We continue to see strong performance across our active fixed-income platform were 84% of our fundamental fixed-income assets are above benchmarks or peer medians for the 5-year period. We generated $2 billion of inflows in active fixed-income mutual funds in the quarter led by our municipal bonds and our flagship unconstrained SIO product. We also generated $7 billion of institutional fixed-income inflows led by liability driven investment strategies in the U.S. With rising interest rates, U.S equity markets hitting all-time high and U.S pension funding ratios improving, client demand to de-risk and immunize portfolios is increasing. The long-term opportunity for our LDI platform is strong and we have more closely integrated LDI with our global fixed-income platform, so we could provide clients with a broader fixed-income and cash flow solution. Our active equity platform has made progress as we bring our fundamental and systematic teams closer together to better leverage the power of increased connectivity and data science. 80% of our Fundamental Active Equity's, up 11% from last year and 92% of our Systematic Active Equity assets were above benchmark for peer median for the 5-year period. In alternatives, the investments we\u2019ve made to position BlackRock as an industry leading manager for our clients are showing up in our results. Through a combination of organic and inorganic growth, our group alternative platform is now $109 billion including $57 billion in illiquid alternatives. BlackRock generated $2 billion in core alternative flows and raised an additional $4 billion in commitments in the third quarter. We are well-positioned to grow this business through strong investment performance and scaled asset raising and sourcing. Across our illiquid platform, we\u2019ve raised $16 billion in gross commitments over the last 12 months and our market share of illiquid alternative industry fund raising has more than doubled in the last two years. We expect continual growth in investments in illiquid alternatives and expect this to be an ever-growing contributor to our financial results over time. BlackRock continues to be both positioning ourselves as a leader and to drive change in anticipation of industry transformation and client future needs. Our strategy is focused first and foremost on our clients and their evolving needs from iShares to factors to illiquid alternatives and our long-term aspirations include being a first mover and a leader in technology, a leader in retirement and ultimately a leader in the Chinese asset management business. As the asset and wealth management landscape evolve, clients are increasingly looking for strategic partners for a broad range of solutions. In U.S wealth, BlackRock has recently been designated a strategic partner by Edward Jones, reflecting the expansion of our long-term relationship. 17,000 Edward Jones advisors now have access to BlackRock's platform of investment strategies, our educational content and how we practice our management. Additionally, as Gary mentioned, we expanded our strategic partnership with Fidelity in August. They added a 170 commission free iShares ETFs to their platform for a total of 240 ETFs in an effort to increase accessibility to investing for more and more clients. BlackRock has also been recently selected as a strategic partner to Scottish Widows and Lloyd Banks for a $40 billion dollar index mandate and to collaborate on solutions across alternatives, our risk management platform and technology. More than ever before, our clients are looking for asset management partners who can understand and provide investment solutions on their entire portfolio. This concept is becoming the new definition of active management. Earlier this year, we launched the Client Portfolio Solutions group, which brings together BlackRock's full platform including our most comprehensive range of market cap weighted, factor based, alpha seeking and illiquid alternative strategies with research, technology and portfolio construction expertise to deliver a holistic solution to our clients. Sustainable investing for ESG is another area where an increase in demand from clients globally coupled with BlackRock's investment and technology expertise is driving large-scale momentum. Earlier this month, along with the governments of France and Germany and several nongovernmental organizations, we announced the formation of the client -- the climate finance partnership. The group will explore the development of investment strategies that would be managed by BlackRock and invest in climate infrastructure in the emerging market world. Last week we also announced our partnership with Wespath on an investment strategy designed for the transition to a low carbon economy. BlackRock will manage the strategy for Wespath and offer to other BlackRock clients who seek to achieve both sustainable investing in financial objectives. Potentially the greatest client need of our time, however, is the global retirement challenge. It is likely to dramatically reshape our industry and our firm. BlackRock has committed to helping drive the solution in this crisis and has made this challenge a strategic priority. Last month we announced the establishment of the new retirement solutions group, which will explore lack of access to retirement plans, the need for guaranteed income and innovation, innovative solutions to improve retirement investing. BlackRock's Aladdin technology enables us to solve clients most complex needs and also to address industry transformation. Today insurers and banks are facing consolidation in evolving regulatory requirements, creating the need for more holistic flexible technology driven solutions. Asset and wealth managers are rethinking their business models and looking for ways to operate more efficiently and rigorously managing risk in more volatile market environments at times with this type of volatilities where we see more interest in our Aladdin business. These trends are driving increased demand for BlackRock's broad-based technology services and digital tools, like institutional Aladdin or Aladdin for Wealth and Cachematrix technology services grew by 18% year-over-year and we expect these trends to continue to drive low to mid teens growth on an annual basis going forward. The impact of technology is extending beyond our direct technology business. For example, we're transformating [ph] our cash management business, one of BlackRock's oldest businesses, by integrating technology into our business model. We're delivering training technology powered by Cachematrix to onboard cash clients who are looking for more than a simple cash product. Cash management in BlackRock is now a technology business. Whether it would be index or active or ESG strategies or factors or alternatives and with technology, BlackRock is positioned to deliver solutions for clients. We're leading the evolution of the industry and are better prepared today to meet our clients' needs than ever before. This is reflected in the depth and the quality of the dialogue we are having with clients across the globe. Indeed, we believe that especially in markets like these while clients maybe slow in putting money to work, they\u2019re putting an even greater premium on the differentiating value proposition that BlackRock can offer. With that, let's open it up to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. Laurence D. Fink: Hi, Dan. Dan Fannon : I guess, Larry, could you elaborate on your broader comments about de-risking? It seems based on your commentary that we -- it should likely continue here in the short-term and we're seeing it through your index products. So I guess are there other kind of asset classes we -- that you're seeing that in? And then also, is there a capture rate where you're seeing flows going into other categories that are obviously less risky? Laurence D. Fink: I will let Rob talk about it and then I will add to it after him. Robert S. Kapito: So I think, Larry, mentioned increased trade tensions, emerging markets volatility, and certainly the fear of continued interest rate rises across the globe. So what happens, especially during that type of volatility period is clients de-risk. So depending upon the next couple weeks and some of the political issues as well and the volatility that's out there, clients may continue to de-risk. Certainly, we've seen the hedge funds de-risk from a period of time where I think across the board most of them are already down 2% 4%, so getting below that is difficult for many hedge funds, so they\u2019ve just risked -- de-risked. And we also, depending upon the guidelines of the clients and what we think about the markets, we encourage either de-risking or risking depending upon what their objectives are. The goal for us is even in that de-risking, to capture those assets because whatever they're selling and going into, we have that product. So whether clients move from equity to fixed, we can accomplish that. Whether they\u2019re going from value to growth, long duration to short duration, out of emerging markets into emerged markets, our goal is to offer a holistic solution so that they can de-risk and then be ready to put the risk on with us as well. And that also moves from product to product, whether they do it in iShares, and typically they'll do that in the non-core iShares that have the most liquidity. Clients in the core iShares do that less because they\u2019re more buy-and-hold. So, we see that more in the active products, and I think that really describes a lot of the flows this quarter. Laurence D. Fink: Let me just add a little more. I think the market movements post third quarter was, as Rob said, more hedge funds de-risking. We did not see any accelerated outflows in the first few weeks. I think, Dan, when you think about some of these big large strategic partnerships we announced, none of that was asset flows this quarter. All of this is going to be huge asset flows probably in 2019. And this is why we are spending so much time trying to develop these deeper relationships. We are not going to be able to predict or strive for any one quarter, but I do -- we're very excited about the opportunities of building these deeper relationships that over time are going to really push us towards a much higher growth rate. That being said, if the markets remain to be uncertain, if political risk remains large, you will continue to see clients pause. We\u2019ve seen this in the past. Generally, in the fourth quarter, we see clients adding risk that is typically what happens especially November, December. We -- and so, I\u2019m not here to tell you, I know how this will all play out, but we are continuing to see large interest from our clients in our technology businesses, we're continuing to see large interest from our clients in our alternative space and let me also talk about the breadth of our active business for a second. We had positive active flows in fixed, in multi-asset, and in alts. The only area where we had outflows that were significant was in the low-fee index products, and that I think, Rob Kapito has talked about this for years, that's where we see how people navigate money. They go in and out of index funds in large-scale as an indicator of their market beliefs. So -- and I would also say unlike most organizations in the industry we had positive flows in U.S wealth in our retail side. So I don't know the outcome of this quarter or political uncertainty, but all I could say is we're -- we have very strong conversations going on right now with really important clients and we will see how that plays out. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Laurence D. Fink: Good morning, Craig. Craig Siegenthaler : Hey, good morning, Larry. So it was nice to see another quarter here of larger buybacks. Can you remind us how much capacity via excess capital and debt capacity BlackRock has now? And how we should forecast capital management over the next few quarters just given your very systematic approach over the last few years? Laurence D. Fink: Gary? Gary S. Shedlin: Good morning, Craig. So our capital management policies have not changed. I think it's -- we remain committed to obviously first investing in our business, and then returning excess cash flow to shareholders, that that will continue. Obviously, it's not necessarily tied to any 12-month period of time. We look at cash over a broader period of time than that, because we try not to be that specific. But we are committed to a 40% to 50% dividend payout ratio, and then paying the incremental back. As we\u2019ve said many times, our total payout ratio is really an output as opposed to an input of our planning, and we will take into account all the various opportunities for investment in the business whether through our P&L, through our seed capital, through taxable inorganic opportunities. We\u2019ve been pretty clear that our run rate going into the year was about $1.2 billion, [ph] or $300 million a quarter. We did slightly more than that earlier in the year. We saw opportunities to accelerate that this past quarter where we did $500 million, and we will continue to plan assuming our run rate is current and then looking at opportunities to more aggressively allocate liquidity to the stock price where we think it's a good investment for our shareholders. As it relates to how much liquidity we have, obviously as you know, we\u2019ve never been capital constrained either from a cash flow or P&L investment point of view. We have about $5 billion of long-term debt on our balance sheet. We are levered at less than 1x, so we obviously have significant liquidity capacity if we so choose to use it for a variety of strategic opportunities. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Laurence D. Fink: Hi, Michael. Michael Cyprys : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just on the commission free ETFs, which you defined as an opportunity to lead to growth in ETFs. Just curious if there's any color you could share in terms of the number of platforms that you\u2019re on today with commission free ETFs and how much more penetration we could see? And how you see the duration profile of the iShares changing, if at all, with more commission free ETFs? In other words, do we see more flows, but maybe more volatility within the flows as it becomes more commission free? Just curious how you\u2019re thinking about that? Laurence D. Fink: So the whole commission free situation was actually a very large benefit to BlackRock. And I don't know if that story really got out that well. Because especially at Fidelity, what was not -- what was hidden I think in the communication was they actually added over 170 new ETFs to their platform commission free. So if that's the case, we obviously have many more on a very strong platform and it attracts many more investors because there's no trading costs. So I don't know if it's going to really change the profile. I would imagine since most of the people on those platforms are more equity than fixed income long-term investors, it may push them towards more equities. We haven't really been able to see a true trend yet, except that there are more buyers and that\u2019s been positive to us. So our growth on that platform continues. Obviously, that will be the same on other platforms that begin to offer commission free ETFs. So this was a very big positive to us to continue. As you know, we have the number one market share globally of ETS. So we really have more people on it. It will give us more opportunity to distribute. But I haven't seen a trend yet, Michael, to tell you that there will be more of any one particular one. What I'm hoping for is that we get to see some of the smart beta, which we have over 100 different smart betas. We have a lot of the ESG ETFs coming onto the platform. So I think there's a big opportunity there and I hope that we're finding out that a lot of investors are interested in ESG. So hopefully they will express that through our iShares. But on the particular Fidelity platform, they\u2019ve been great partners who had the best August we ever had since the pricing moved, even in what was considered a very tough market. So very optimistic as new buyers can enter the market commission free. Robert S. Kapito: Let me add one more -- two more things. I believe more and more the market for ETFs will be commission free. I think it's incredibly important. So for the retail investor commissions, the trading commissions can be larger than the commissions or the fees of the asset manager. So when you\u2019re trying to save for retirement and you're only investing, let's say, a $1000 at a time, the commissions were eating up quite a better of return. And so we actually believe commission free ETFs is going to lead to better outcomes for retirement. It's going to lead more investors to invest in ETFs for retirement and I believe this is a really important trend for all the ETF industry, but I also believe it's a very important trend for the advancement of pools of money for retirement. So we look at this as it's not just important for the ETF industry, we believe it's important contributor to the strategies of the wealth management platforms as they try to help clients navigate the whole cumbersome component of retirement. And we believe a commission free environment for ETFs is going to lead to far better outcomes of investing for retirement. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Worthington with JP Morgan. Laurence D. Fink: Hi, Ken. Ken Worthington : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. This sort of follows up on Michael's question. So price has been a key differentiator in core ETFs, the majority of your ETFs are non-core. What are the longer-term success factors in non-core? So, you\u2019ve mentioned liquidity as a factor, maybe a key factor in the past, does liquidity remain a key driver for the non-core ETF sales, or does that become less differentiated as the ETF market grows? To Michael's question, you mentioned commission free trading and distribution relationships are important. You alluded to product development in ESG, but what is most important for non-core ETF growth over time? And what is that say about the pricing that you think you could get for non-core? Will it hold up or does it sort of eventually mirror the core side? Thank you. Robert S. Kapito: So I think the two most important things are brand and liquidity. So this is what those people that are more active and they participate under non-core want in purchasing their ETFs. And I think that what hasn't been talked about is this last move in volatility. We haven't seen any stories of any issues in the liquidity of ETFs. All of a sudden that is off the front page. They actually work. So the large and liquid with brand has actually provided more liquidity in the marketplace. The more situations we have like that, the more large investors will come in and have confidence in the market. So I think we saw that. So in essence, I would say brand is still very important. Liquidity and that\u2019s due to the scale and size of the products that we actually have are the most important going forward. And I do think that's going to translate as more and more people get focused on either the smart beta in which they are using this to really focus on one of the factors in the market that they think will drive it going forward. And the second thing will be the ESG, where as large plans have the responsibility now to be asked by their boards to express that in their portfolios, I think they\u2019re going to want to express it in ETFs that have that brand that also have the liquidity in it. Laurence D. Fink: Let me add a little more to that, Ken. I think retail has always been more a buy-and-hold strategy. I think retail continues to be focused on more core oriented strategies for their, I would say, their large component of their investment strategies. But as ETFs expand whether it is ESG that Rob was talking about or factor based or emerging markets in other areas, we still believe that as Rob said, brand liquidity are major component. And I don't believe those two components lead to each other. So we are not seeing any indication, any issues related to a worsening of prices related to the non-core. But core is being -- growth is being driven by essentially by retail individuals that continues to be a major component of it. And those core products just don't have liquidity, that\u2019s some of the non-core strategies have. They don\u2019t have -- and some of the non-core strategies now have options against it and they have a much more derivative-based market around that too. And so they\u2019re almost two different ecosystems both serving their clients and this is what's great about it, in their specific needs. Some clients have it a long-term need to invest for retirement and that\u2019s a buy-and-hold. And that\u2019s why we so much -- why we adopted that core strategy and we have a large component of our institutional clients worldwide are using it for asset allocation. They\u2019re using it for exposures and brand and liquidity is very important and remain to be important. Robert S. Kapito: I don\u2019t think you will see pricing pressure as much because of the demand and it's only the large illiquid and ones with the brand that can offer the futures, the options, and the derivative. So I think this is as Larry said, a separate market. And I think because of that we can command a higher price. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Laurence D. Fink: Hello. Alex Blostein : Thanks. Hi. Good morning, everybody. So wanted to build the discussion on Larry's points around the strategic partnership with wealth managers. You hit on the Fidelity and the kind of the commission free model, but looking at the wirehouses and other brokerage firm networks, can you spend a little bit on how these partnerships are structured? What\u2019s sort of the spectrum of products this creates for you guys both in a technology and the asset management side of things? And I guess, looking out into 2018 maybe a little more color, Larry, from you why you think these will yield stronger flows for you? Laurence D. Fink: Well, I mean, our first indication from Fidelity, we\u2019re seeing stronger flows immediately after one month. So we did begin to see that and we continue to believe that will continue to yield more flows. In terms of the wires, I mean, one of the great success story so far that\u2019s just been implemented and one just was launched in its existence is Aladdin for wealth. So UBS and Morgan Stanley both use Aladdin for wealth. We have other organizations that we are working on. We have -- actually other organizations worldwide are adapting Aladdin for wealth. And so, it is through technology that is advancing our positioning with our wires. It is trying to work with them on ETF strategies, but I actually believe the relationships that we have with the wires now are more comprehensive, more holistic than anytime ever and we believe like we just said -- as I said, this last week was when we went live with Morgan Stanley. We believe through those processes we're going to start seeing maybe in the fourth quarter in 2019, increased flows through our holistic relationships with our wires of all our strategic partners. The other area where you're seeing especially from the wires, which is starting to become a bigger driver of their business, and one of the reasons while we believe over the next 5 years ETFs will double in size is how more and more wires as they move more towards away from brokerage and more to a consultive relationship or advice, they're using more models. And in the models are heavily populated by different BlackRock and iShares products. And so we believe over time we're getting ourselves better positioned that have deeper more holistic relationships. And we continue to believe that is what's going to be driving our future growth. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Laurence D. Fink: Hey, Brian. Brian Bedell : Hey, good morning. Maybe switching gears little bit on pension plan rebalancing. Larry, maybe just your view of how that might increase to the rebalancing from equities to fixed income might increase. What kind of maybe yield thresholds do you think that will be a catalyst for that? And obviously you guys are positioned to capture that on the fixed income side. Do you see that from your perspective coming mostly in LDI, or do you think your active fixed income products can take the large share of that? And then, maybe just a little bit more color on the Lloyds arrangement with the $40 billion. Is that just a part that\u2019s coming more quickly? And I think you are in a strategic partnership with them for a potential of up to \u20a4100 million. Laurence D. Fink: So on year-end rebalancing, but before the market setback, I would have said there would be a lot of rebalancing out of equities into more fixed income. Now with the markets resetting itself, I think that rebalancing out of equities is going to be diminished quite a bit. Obviously, we still have a full quarter to see. Higher rates is good for more and more pension funds. They reset their liabilities, and higher interest rates is a reset. Keep in mind, it's based off the tenure, not the short end. So the tenure has only moved, I don't know, on the year, 30 basis points. So it's not a significant move. But net, net, net, you are going to see more and more pension funds using as you raise LDI. We are seeing more and more clients looking to use BlackRock services on LDI. It's one of our growth areas in the last quarter and continues to be an opportunity for us. I don't know how significant that will be. We will see where markets are and rates are over the course of the balance of this year, but we do believe the trend will be over the long-term for pension funds to reduce their exposures in their defined benefit plans. As you know, more and more money is now moving in the defined contribution. So it is -- we do have that dynamics. Just real quickly on Lloyds, we don\u2019t describe what the client is doing. The client came out with a press release. I don't believe I could talk about more than what the client released in their press release. We have a strong, deep relationship with them. At the moment, we won a \u20a430 billion mandate for index products. We also agreed on a partnership in terms of alternatives, where we believe we are going to see systematic quarter-by-quarter flows in our alternative platform. We are looking at -- they are looking at utilization of our Aladdin platform and other forms of technology. So it's a comprehensive relationship. It is deep and related to the other pool of assets, we will see. I mean, it -- we will see about that outcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Laurence D. Fink: Hi, Michael. Michael Carrier : Good morning. Hey, Gary, just one for you on the expenses. You mentioned the $42 million in the transaction cost in the quarter, and then that the typical seasonality that we see in G&A. I guess just want to level set that, should we be expecting the $42 million to come out and then build off of that in terms of the seasonality? And then, just given the seasonality, how does the -- maybe the diverging beta or the headwinds that you guys are seeing on the revenue side kind of factor into that? Gary S. Shedlin: So the $42 million, there is a component of that. And again, we\u2019ve tried to give you a little bit more visibility through some better disclosure, both in the press release and the Q. But there's a portion of that, that is more professional fee-related, as I mentioned, about $13 million tied to closing a number of transactions that clearly will come out. The contingent purchase price adjustments is going to be a part of our P&L for some period of time. We have about 250 plus million dollars of contingent purchase price liability on our balance sheet. We will have to fair value that every quarter. The bad news is when it goes up, it creates some noise in our G&A line. The good news is when it goes up, it means the deals we\u2019ve done are doing better. The most significant component this quarter was tied to the first reserve transaction where the expectations for our ability to raise assets in the coming quarters has gone up, which is why we\u2019re providing that. So we will do as best we can to call that out for you, so that you can see some of that volatility in what we would consider kind of more non-recurring quarter G&A expense. In terms of expectations for the fourth quarter, I think you\u2019ve got it right on. I think the intent was to try and call out for you that component that kind of is a little less recurring and to just highlight what has been the case for the last couple of years is that our marketing spend tends to go up in the fourth quarter, and you obviously know what that was during the third quarter. I think your broader question as it relates to the business model today in light of a more challenged revenue environment. Look, I think, for us, we\u2019ve purposely built a very diverse business with both index, active, alternatives and cash to move away from any specific product, but really to focus on delivering, as Larry mentioned, a holistic client centric solution to our clients. And we\u2019ve seen difficult markets before, but we think that are unique and scaled model enables us to kind of grow organically through those markets and to be able to manage our expenses appropriately, display whether they're cyclical or secular headwinds. And our view at the moment is really to continue to invest through the cycle. We see unique opportunities. Frankly, we\u2019ve done the best in these types of markets because others frankly with less diversified models are forced to pull back. And candidly, it's a lot easier to cut cost than to invest for growth, and that\u2019s really the hard part, but we think we\u2019ve got a model advantage and so our intent is to continue to invest through the cycle on behalf of our clients and our shareholders. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup. Laurence D. Fink: Hey, Bill. William Katz : Okay, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for squeezing me in. So, a lot of it has been answered, right, but maybe just sort of drilling into the margin discussions a bit further today. When I look at your distribution fees versus the distribution expenses, there seems to be a deeper reduction in the distribution fees than on the expenses. How much has just either divergent data or sort of mix non-US versus U.S versus maybe some of these wealth management victories you\u2019ve been getting and some elevated maybe point of sale economics against the manufacturing complex? Gary S. Shedlin: You know, we\u2019ve seen on the distribution fees, obviously, as we\u2019ve moved away from kind of 12b-1 fees over time, and that\u2019s been going on for a long time for us now, Bill. And I think, obviously, we are moving into a more fee-based environment with all of our distribution partners trying to basically do the best they can for their clients. We\u2019ve migrated away from traditional loan products to products that don\u2019t have that. So we\u2019ve seen a decline in our distribution revenue. By virtue of FASB, we\u2019ve kind of grossed up everything. I don\u2019t think there's that much of a breakdown beyond that, other than just demand for different classes of funds are changing and driving traditional 12b-1 fees down, but beyond that, I don\u2019t think that there's anything more to it than that from our perspective. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we\u2019ve reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks? Laurence D. Fink: Yes. Thank you everyone for joining our call this morning and your continued interest in BlackRock. Our third quarter results reflect the value of our diverse investment platform and technology capabilities provide for our clients as they navigate through this very active investment landscape. We\u2019ve built and evolved our business by staying ahead of our clients' needs and industry transformation, and we\u2019re confident that our continued differentiation, our holistic client approach will enable us to deliver growth and scale advantages over the long-term to our clients and to our shareholders. And I do believe the third quarter really did show how building these strategic relations over the long run will produce future growth tomorrow. Everyone have a good fourth quarter, and we will be talking to you soon. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good Morning. My name is Jamie and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings teleconference. Our host for today\u2019s call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Lawrence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel Christopher J. Meade. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question and answer period. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference. Christopher Meade : Good morning everyone. I\u2019m Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock\u2019s actual results may of course differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC. The results of BlackRock could differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Gary. Gary Shedlin : Thanks Chris. Good morning and happy new year to everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to present results for the fourth quarter and full year 2018. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I\u2019ll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results.  As a reminder for one last time, all year-over-year financial comparisons referenced on this call will relate current quarter and full-year results to recast financials reflecting the adoption of FASB\u2019s revenue recognition accounting standard, which became effective on January 1, 2018.  In 2018, BlackRock delivered positive organic asset and base fee growth, increased year-over-year revenue, and expanded our operating margin while also maintaining an investment mindset and returning significant cash to shareholders. Our performance was sustained by the investments we have continuously made to leverage our scale and optimize our strategic positioning. We generated $123 billion of long-term net inflows during the year, representing 2% organic asset and 2% organic base fee growth, and achieved these results despite $92 billion of low fee institutional indexed equity outflows associated with client de-risking and a volatile equity market.  The stability of our operating model allowed us to continue to invest in high growth opportunities such as retirement, illiquid alternatives, ETFs, and factors. We also continued to extend our leadership in technology and lead the industry shift from product selection to portfolio construction, all while simultaneously expanding our full-year operating margin by 20 basis points to 44.3%. After investing for growth, we returned approximately $3.6 billion of cash to our shareholders during the year, an increase of over 30% from 2017. The strength of BlackRock\u2019s diversified global investment and technology platform enabled us to continue to execute against our framework for long-term growth despite meaningful headwinds for the asset management industry. Global equity indices declined more than any year since the financial crisis, and almost every asset class but cash posted negative returns. U.S. and European ETF both declined 38% in 2018 and global active mutual funds saw outflows accelerate to record levels by year-end.  As BlackRock has historically demonstrated, environments like this create opportunities for growth as long as we have the discipline to realize them. Executing on this vision, however, requires that we move decisively to focus more limited resources where the impact will be greatest and make difficult decisions to reallocate in challenging markets. We view our ability to continue playing offense as critical to positioning us to deliver differentiated organic growth for the future. With that in mind, we recently undertook a restructuring to free up investment capacity for our most important growth opportunities by modifying the size and shape of our workforce. This resulted in a fourth quarter restructuring charge of $60 million primarily comprised of severance and accelerated amortization of previously granted deferred compensation awards for approximately 500 impacted employees or 3% of our global workforce. This charge appears as a single-line expense item on our 2018 GAAP income statement and has been excluded from our as-adjusted results. For the fourth quarter, BlackRock generated revenue of $3.4 billion and operating income of $1.3 billion, down 9% and 12% respectively from a year ago. Nonetheless, full year revenue of $14.2 billion was up 4% versus 2017 and operating income of $5.5 billion increased 5%. Earnings per share of $26.93 was up 20% versus 2017, reflecting the impact of a lower effective tax rate in 2018.  Non-operating expense for the quarter totaled $72 million, reflecting lower marks on unhedged seed capital investments. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 21%. We currently estimate that 24% is a reasonable projected tax rate for 2019, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of non-recurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on tax legislation. Fourth quarter base fees of $2.8 billion were down 4% year over year despite positive organic base fee growth over the period and the impact of recent acquisitions, reflecting the negative effects of beta and FX and lower borrowing demand for securities lending in the current quarter. Full-year base fees were up 6% for 2018 but we entered 2019 with an annualized base fee run rate approximately 6% lower than last year as a result of significant global equity market declines, which reduced BlackRock\u2019s AUM by approximately $500 billion [ph] in the fourth quarter alone. Fourth quarter performance fees of $100 million declined 65% year over year, reflecting lower fees from liquid alternatives and long-only products in a very challenging year for the hedge fund industry. Underperformance during the fourth quarter will also impact performance fees for 2019 as certain quarterly and annual locking funds are below high watermarks entering the year. While we\u2019re seeing significant growth in our illiquid alternatives business, performance fees from these products are generally not booked until capital is returned to clients and represent a source of meaningful longer term future growth. Quarterly technology services revenue grew 15% year over year, driving record full-year technology services revenue of $785 million as an outsized number of new institutional Aladdin clients went live in 2018, and we expanded our range of digital wealth and distribution technologies. We continue to target low to mid-teens growth in technology services revenue over the longer term.  Total expense increased 4% in 2018 driven primarily by higher G&A expense, volume-related expense, and compensation. Fourth quarter G&A expense was up 9% sequentially primarily due to planned seasonally higher levels of marketing and promotional spend. Similar to the third quarter, the current quarter also included $31 million of contingent consideration fair value adjustments. This was primarily related to improved expectations of achieving specified performance targets on prior acquisitions and lowered quarterly as-adjusted operating margin by approximately 100 basis points.  G&A expense increased 13% in 2018, reflecting higher planned levels of technology, data, and marketing spend. Approximately 50% of the year-over-year increase in G&A expense was comprised of non-core items such as deal, tax, Brexit-related professional fees, contingent consideration fair value adjustments, product launch costs, and FX re-measurement expense. While we continually focus on managing our entire discretionary expense base, we would currently expect 2019 G&A expense to be essentially flat to our core level of spend in 2018. Direct fund expense was up $103 million or 12% in 2018, primarily reflecting higher average AUM as a result of growth in our iShares franchise. For the full year, compensation expense increased $68 million or 2%, primarily reflecting higher headcount and higher operating income offset by lower levels of performance fees. Our full-year comp-to-revenue ratio of 34.4% declined 110 basis points versus 2017. The decline was primarily associated with lower performance fees, the impact of ongoing technology investments, and successful implementation of our iHub strategy. Recall that year-over-year comparisons of fourth quarter compensation expense are less relevant because we determine compensation on a full-year basis. We see significant opportunities to better serve clients in this environment and BlackRock remains committed to investing in key growth areas. As evidenced by our recent restructuring, we are always margin aware and remain committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible.  Away from the P&L, we also prudently used our balance sheet to position the business for continued success. During 2018, we allocated $1.2 billion of new seed or co-investment capital to our products, resulting in a net increase to our total portfolio of approximately $500 million. We closed the strategic acquisitions of Citibanamex Asset Management, furthering our goal to be a full solutions provider in Mexico, and Tennenbaum Capital Partners, enhancing our private credit capabilities. In addition, we continued to expand our technology portfolio with minority investments in Acorns, the country\u2019s fastest-growing micro-investing app, and Envestnet, a leading provider of intelligent systems for wealth management and financial wellness. We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through our combination of dividends and share repurchases. We repurchased approximately $1.7 billion worth of shares in 2018, including $525 million in the fourth quarter as we sought to take advantage of attractive relative valuation opportunities in the current market environment. Since inception of our current capital management strategy in 2013, we have now repurchased almost $7 billion of BlackRock stock, reducing our outstanding total shares by 7%.  At present, based on our capital spending plans for the year and subject to market conditions, including the relative valuation of our stock price, we would anticipate share repurchases aggregating at least $1.2 billion during 2019. In addition, consistent with our predictable and balanced approach to capital management, our board of directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $3.30 per share, representing an increase of 5% over the current level. BlackRock is having deeper and more strategic conversations with a greater number of clients than ever before, even as many clients are deferring investment decisions and de-risking in the face of an uncertain market landscape. Fourth quarter long-term net inflows of $44 billion representing 3% annualized organic AUM and base fee growth were led by flows into strategic focus areas, including iShares, multi-asset strategies, and illiquid alternatives partially offset by continued outflows from lower fee institutional indexed equities. Global iShares generated $168 billion of net inflows for the year, representing 10% organic growth for 2018. Importantly, we saw momentum into year-end as seasonal tax planning, growth in fee-based wealth management, and demand for efficient exposure supported by significant market liquidity generated back-to-back record net inflow months in November and December. Fourth quarter iShares net inflows of $81 billion represented our highest flow quarter on record and an annualized organic growth rate of 18%. Forty-nine iShares ETFs had over $1 billion in net inflows in 2018, and we once again captured the number one industry share of global, U.S., European, equity and fixed income ETF flows for the year. Strength in the iShares core continued in 2018 with $106 billion of net inflows, almost twice that of the next largest player, representing approximately 45% share of industry for ETF flows. Equally important, during the fourth quarter about 60% of iShares net flows were in higher fee ETFs, including financial instruments and precision exposures outside the core.  BlackRock generated full-year retail net inflows of $21 billion in a challenging year for the mutual fund industry, which experienced historic outflows in December. BlackRock\u2019s inflows were led by our broad active fixed income range, our multi-asset income fund, and liquid alternatives. Retail outflows in the fourth quarter were driven by active fixed income, reflecting industry pressures in the unconstrained and high yield categories where we have significant market share. Unconstrained products were impacted by the volatile rate environment as investors shifted into short duration mutual funds and ETFs. High yield and emerging market debt funds experienced outflows driven by risk-off sentiment and credit.  BlackRock\u2019s institutional franchise generated 2% organic base fee growth for the year, reflecting strength in illiquid alternatives, multi-asset solutions, and liability driven investment strategies despite almost $100 billion of low fee indexed equity outflows and elevated active fixed income outflows, which reflected several large client redemptions associated with client M&A, cash repatriation, and manager consolidation. In a record year for our illiquid alternatives business, BlackRock now has approximately $23 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of illiquid strategies, representing almost $170 million in incremental base fees and the opportunity for significant performance fees over time. Finally, BlackRock\u2019s cash management platform continues to increase share by leveraging scale and delivering transformative distribution and risk management technology through both Cachematrix and Aladdin. While full year 2018 net inflows were impacted by two large planned redemptions totaling almost $40 billion, bas fees grew 9%.  In summary, our diversified business model once again delivered differentiated organic growth, record technology services revenue, operating leverage, and significant capital return in 2018. We are committed to continuously evolving, investing in and disrupting our platform to benefit client needs. We believe BlackRock\u2019s platform is as well positioned as ever to meet client needs and deliver long-term value for shareholders. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry. Larry Fink : Thank you, Gary. Good morning everyone and happy new year. BlackRock\u2019s performance in 2018 reflects the deeper partnerships we are building with clients through our solution-based approach. We have consistently and strategically invested to create the most diverse global asset management and technology services firm in the world, and we\u2019re having more comprehensive conversations with more clients today than any time in our history. Our ability to deliver investment strategies from ETFs to alternatives to our industry-leading portfolio construction and risk management technology, and our historic deep capital markets expertise through the BlackRock Investment Institute is what differentiates BlackRock and helps us with our clients worldwide. The diversity of our platform is reflected in our results. We generated $124 billion of net inflows in 2018 despite, as Gary discussed, over $90 billion of low fee institutional indexed equity outflows as some of our clients, many of whom are global, de-risked against a difficult market backdrop. Seven different countries and 59 different products each generated more than a billion dollars of net inflows. Our Aladdin and Digital Wealth technologies are accessible to clients now in more than 50 different countries, including thousands of wealth advisors who serve millions of end investors. 2018 was marked by heightened uncertainty about the future. Political, economic and social outlooks globally remain clouded and unclear, which resulted in extreme periods of volatility in the financial markets. For only the second time in nearly 30 years, annual market returns were negative in both global bonds and in equities. Throughout the year and particularly in the fourth quarter, U.S. rate policy, tightening financial conditions, and a deepened concern regarding economic growth and corporate profitability dragged down equity performance throughout all the world indexes. The impact of a weak growth backdrop on European markets was exacerbated by concerns over the Italy budget deficits, the outlook for Brexit, the rising populism in France, and governmental changes and populism in Spain.  For most of the year, the emerging market was impacted by a stronger dollar, by trade tensions, a developing anxiety with slower growth in China, and other country-specific risks continue to put asset prices and currencies under pressure. Sentiment shifted from cautious to negative, which impacted investor behaviors amongst institutions and individuals, and 2019 began with many clients de-risking and sitting on cash, waiting for greater market certainty.  A year ago, rising market volatility and filing correlations suggested an environment where the investment industry\u2019s traditional active equity strategies were primed to deliver alpha. Not only did that not happen in 2018 but once again the industry under-performed in their equity returns, and what we witnessed, especially in the fourth quarter, industry outflows hit a record level especially as taxable investors took the opportunities to harvest losses. What we are seeing more than ever before, and we believe this trend is going to continue and this trend will continue to benefit BlackRock, we are seeing clients are fundamentally questioning the composition of their portfolios. The industry is shifting form an approach of picking products or stocks to one of building portfolios. As a result, both clients\u2019 needs and our industry are changing rapidly. This all along has been BlackRock\u2019s approach - a focus on client outcomes and building better portfolios to help clients achieve better outcomes. Our strength in this area driven by our diverse investment platform and our portfolio construction technology will lead to future organic growth for BlackRock. We\u2019re seeing an acceleration of barbelling in client portfolios with index and ETFs and factors on one hand, and illiquid alternatives on the other hand. The demand has never been greater for technology to manage risk and build more resilient portfolios. BlackRock always has been willing to aggressively embrace change. We have strategically invested in our business over time to build strength in ETFs, in our alternative business, and our world-leading technology business, and the benefits of these investments are clear. In the fourth quarter, we saw record flows in iShares, record flows in the commitment of our illiquid alternatives, and record levels of technology services revenues. BlackRock generated $10 billion of net inflows in our core alternative business in 2018, more than a tenfold increase from the year before. Flows reflected strong fundraising and the successful deployment of capital. We now manage more than $80 billion in committed and invested capital for our clients across platforms of infrastructure, credit, real estate, and private equity strategies.  Our institutional client rebalancing survey suggests that in 2019, institutions including pensions and insurance companies in particular are anticipating allocating more assets to illiquid strategies. As demand increases, BlackRock is well positioned to generate differentiated growth in this strategic high growth asset class by leveraging the benefits of our technology, our global reach, and our scale. At the other end of the barbell, ETFs are playing an even greater role in client portfolios, and BlackRock is leading the industry. Fourth quarter was the strongest in iShares history with $81 billion of net inflows, driven by records in November and December. We continue to see growth in January, with about $13 billion of flows. More and more clients are choosing ETFs as a preferred investment vehicle because of their superior structure relative to the mutual fund industry, including liquidity and, most importantly, tax efficiency. Clients who faced large tax bills while their equity mutual funds delivered negative active returns experienced this firsthand and shifted to ETFs in the fourth quarter. Institutional clients are using ETFs express risk-on, risk-off views, tactical asset allocation decisions, and our distribution partners also are recognizing iShares as a technology to white label as part of their broader solutions. We believe white labeling iShares, as we are doing this with RBC in Canada, will lead to much greater opportunities with more distribution partners going forward worldwide.  Growth in iShares will continue to be driven by long term secular tailwinds. The trends towards efficient, transparent, low-cost vehicles is accelerating the adoption of iShares\u2019 core funds, as Gary mentioned. Three of the industry\u2019s top four ETFs in terms of net new assets this year were iShares core ETFs : our IVV, our S&P fund; IEFA, a fund for developed international market exposures, and IEMG, our core emerging market fund. But this movement to greater efficiencies, transparency and simplicity in portfolios extends well beyond core. We extended our lead in fixed income ETFs with inflows into shorter duration strategies towards year end as clients took a more defensive posture. iShares\u2019 factor ETFs also had record inflows this year with client demand for minimum volatility funds increasing in the fourth quarter, making us a leader in the factor ETF and in the factor investing more broadly. Our sustainable strategies are seeing new demand from investors from around the world. Fixed income factors and sustainable iShares saw a record of $68 billion of net inflows in 2018, representing organic growth of 16%. I believe we are at the early stages of growth in each of those categories.  We estimate ESG ETF assets globally will grow by $400 billion in the next decade, and we are investing in our product range, our portfolio tools, and data disclosures to lead in that category. We generated $3 billion of net inflows into our sustainable iShares funds globally in 2018, more than double our results from 2017. During the fourth quarter, BlackRock launched the iShares sustainable core to enable investors to combine purpose and performance as the core of their portfolios.  We are also making iShares more accessible, especially in the wealth management landscape. We announced last week the strategic alliance with RBC Global Asset Management to offer Canadian investors 150 ETFs under the RBC iShares brand. This alliance enhances BlackRock\u2019s ability to serve Canadian wealth management through RBC\u2019s distribution strength and innovation in index, factors, and active ETFs.  One of the main drivers of ETF flows among wealth clients has been the adoption of managed portfolios. We expect this to continue but we actually expect this to be growing and providing greater force, and also providing much more global scale. Managed portfolios provide advisors with asset allocation solutions across the risk spectrum, populated with transparent low cost, tax efficient funds which help them scale their practice while meeting their clients\u2019 goals. This is increasing the need for strategic asset management partnerships that can offer a range of investment, portfolio construction, and technology solutions. As I\u2019ve said repeatedly over the many quarters, no organization can provide that to the wealth management sector of having investment, portfolio construction, and technology solutions all together, and it is that uniqueness that gives us the opportunity to build our relationship with more and more wealth management organizations. BlackRock is the most comprehensive partner for wealth managers looking to build better, more resilient portfolios for investors. We have the building blocks, the portfolio construction expertise and the digital capabilities, including Aladdin Wealth and Advisor Center. We launched Aladdin Wealth at Morgan Stanley in the fourth quarter, reaching 16,000 financial advisors. We also announced a strategic partnership with Envestnet, connecting BlackRock to more than 93,000 independent financial advisors on their platform. BlackRock\u2019s differentiated ability to provide wealth management with sophisticated technology drove retail inflows of $21 billion for the year, in contrast to the broad large-scale outflows that the mutual fund industry saw.  Our focus on technology is benefiting us in other areas of our business, like cash management. With cash becoming a more attractive asset class as rates rise, BlackRock\u2019s cash management strategies are becoming an increasing important part of our clients\u2019 portfolios. Our technology-first distribution strategy is resonating and we saw a 9% increase year over year in growth in our base fees. BlackRock\u2019s cash platform is differentiated by our scale, our integrated Cachematrix technology, our risk management, and our unique ability to create tailored liquidity solutions.  Aladdin and Wealth Technology not only is driving accelerated flows for our investment products but also consistent technology services revenues for the firm. Nineteen percent annual growth was driven by a strong year of institutional Aladdin implementations. Industry consolidated and regulatory requirements, among other trends, are driving more demand for more holistic, flexible technology solutions, and BlackRock\u2019s technology platform is very well positioned to capitalize on the growing needs by more institutions seeking this type of technology. We recently announced an exciting collaboration with Microsoft to address the growing retirement challenges in the U.S. We are combining Microsoft\u2019s technology strengths with BlackRock\u2019s investment capabilities to jointly explore next-generation retirement solutions. Our goal is simplifying the saving process and enabling people to make better investment decisions that lead to secure financial futures, and there will be much more to talk about in the future. We believe we will be able to grow considerably in our retirement solution business going forward with this partnership that we have with Microsoft and the new types of digital solutions that we\u2019re going to be able to provide. Everything we are doing reflects our focus on the long term. This focus helps keep us ahead of the changes in the market, staying in front of the needs of our clients and making sure that we\u2019re staying in front of our industry. It helps us prepare to solve our clients\u2019 most pressing investment challenges and it guides our investments in our own business so that we are efficiently providing the full breadth of BlackRock\u2019s capabilities and our scale for our clients, for our employees, and for our shareholders.  It is this focus on the long term that drives us to reshape our organization and make difficult but necessary decisions that position us for the best possible path forward. As Gary mentioned, our restructuring effort resulted in a number of valued colleagues and friends leaving the firm, and we greatly appreciate the contributions they made to BlackRock.  BlackRock\u2019s focus remains on the long term and how we can best serve our clients over time. We see tremendous opportunities for our firm and industry that will require us to aggressively embrace change and continue to evolve as an organization. We\u2019re looking at every aspect of how we operate and how we manage the organization. We are moving people into new roles to fully leverage their talents. We are leveraging our technology in new ways and we are making sure that our scale, which is a key competitive advantage, remains a benefit and gives us that unique ability to work with our clients.  BlackRock\u2019s differentiated platform showed resilience. We generated net inflows and increased revenues and increased operating income while investing for our future growth, which is essential in creating long-term value for our clients and long-term value for our shareholders. We will continue to strategically invest in BlackRock. We will target those areas where we see the highest future growth potential. The ecosystem that we operate in is shifting from product selection to a whole portfolio approach, the digitization of asset management, and achieving scale in high growth markets around the world so that we can better deliver outcomes for our clients, opportunities for our employees, and strong consistent returns for our shareholders.  With that, let me open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Larry Fink : Hi Alex, good morning. Alex Blostein : Hi Larry, good morning everybody. First question around just the strength in the iShares business, and particularly I was hoping to kind of zone in on the events of late December. You guys have seen considerable strength there in light of--despite, actually I should say, de-risking and substantial outflows from mutual funds. Any additional color you could provide there would be helpful, just to think about how the customer base reacted in the utilization of the product in what I would imagine would have been more of a risk-off scenario. Larry Fink : Sure, I\u2019ll let Rob start it off and I may conclude that answer. Rob Kapito : So we saw, obviously as you heard Larry say, strong iShares flows in the fourth quarter, but this year the activity was very high because of people that wanted to take risk off, do more tax efficient trades, and what they looked to do is to move out of their current products into a more defensive product, and it made a lot of sense. They moved primarily into short-duration product and, more importantly, they moved into precision products that are of course higher fee, like EEM and HYG. This was done in larger volume than I think anyone would have expected. 81 billion inflows is the highest flow quarter in iShares history, and it was broad - $61 billion went into equities even as the equity market fell dramatically, which should answer questions about how ETFs will perform in a volatile and bear market, we had no instances of any issues or anybody had any issues with liquidity; $19 billion in fixed income, and $2 billion in multi-asset and alternative ETFs. So this was an important way for our clients to get defensive very quickly, to utilize the tax efficiency which is a very important feature of this wrapper versus a mutual fund, and to quickly use the liquidity in the market when, as you know, in the equity markets there was a lot of issue with liquidity, especially in late December. So they performed as we would have expected and as we predicted. The use of them was some of the best features of iShares, and we were the beneficiary of that volatility, and even though we may have had outflows in other areas, the benefit of having such a diversified portfolio is that we were able to capture the outflows back in inflows in different areas and different products, and as Gary mentioned a lot of those went to actually the higher fee ETFs that we have. Larry Fink : Let me add a little bit more, Alex. I truly believe it\u2019s becoming more recognized, the superior nature of the ETF structure versus a mutual fund. We\u2019ve heard many instances in which--many mutual funds who had negative NAV at the end of the year, but they also had capital gains taxes that they were identifying to their clients, and their clients in many cases just got quite aggravated by paying taxes with a negative NAV. Obviously with an ETF, you control your tax basis, and I think this is becoming a bigger and bigger issue. Navigating for the long term your tax position for taxable individuals and institutions is very important. We also believe the movement in the wealth management space away from stocks and products, navigating more towards models and portfolio construction, we are seeing elevated and continually elevated flows into ETFs. We think that trend is beginning. It wasn\u2019t something that was short in nature. We believe that will continue throughout 2019 and maybe \u201920, and this is one of the reasons why we continue to believe the ETF industry is going to continue to grow very largely, and I think the big surprise in the fourth quarter, as you suggest, was in a very volatile negative marketplace, you\u2019re seeing portfolio reallocations being done out of mutual funds because we had elevated mutual fund outflows as an industry and into ETFs.  I also believe people are starting to think about ETFs more as a technology, not just a product. If you think about what makes companies really good, a lot of people ride on convenience. The convenience of ETFs versus other instruments far outweighs the other instruments, and I do believe the key towards ETFs and the convenience is now becoming an accelerant. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Larry Fink : Hi Craig. Craig Siegenthaler : Hey, good morning, Larry. I wanted to see if you could share any additional color on the large redemptions in Asia, and also the institutional equity index in just the fourth quarter, because it looks like they both could be related, and I wanted to see if it included maybe one or two very large client outflows. Also just kind of as a little follow-up here, if you can share any fee rate color on the outflows in Asia or institutional equity index, that would be helpful too. Larry Fink : Sure, I\u2019ll let Gary begin with that and I\u2019ll follow up. Gary Shedlin : Good morning, Craig. We clearly have been seeing accelerated activity in redemptions in our institutional index equity book. I think a couple things are important there. One is to remember that this is really a scaled offering for some of our largest institutional clients, and while institutional index equity represents roughly a quarter of our assets under management, it only accounts for 6% of our base fees. When you strip out the impact of securities lending, the average effective fee rate on that book is around three basis points. As you correctly identify, we had fourth quarter outflows there. I would say that they were almost entirely driven by on a net basis by one large institutional client in A-Pac, and when you look at this on a full-year basis, I think there were some broader trends, really primarily linked to de-risking, asset allocation and cash needs by official institutions, primarily outside of the U.S. as well as DV plans in the U.S. Given the outflows in many cases are really from our more significant scale clients, the average fee rates on those outflows are in fact generally lower than the overall three basis point fee rate that I quoted on the general book. But again, keeping it into broader perspective, we look at the institutional business as a broad-based business. We saw continued demand from clients for our higher fee products - illiquid alternatives, multi-asset solutions, OCIO, LDI strategies to name a few, and in fact notwithstanding those low fee institutional outflows for the year which made the net flows go negative for the year, we actually generated 2% organic base fee growth in the institutional business overall. Operator : Your next question comes from Robert Lee with KBW. Robert Lee : Thanks. Good morning, and happy new year. Larry Fink : Happy new year. Robert Lee : Thank you. Larry, I\u2019m curious - I mean, maybe you hinted at this a little bit, but as you survey and think about the kind of changing landscape out there in terms of distribution and products and how you access clients, and maybe the Microsoft partnership is an example of this, but do you think it\u2019s imperative or a need that you have direct access to the end retail investor at some point, as opposed to obviously institutions? Is that part of how you\u2019re thinking about this Microsoft partnership, is that you may be able to develop some solutions that can get you directly to the end investor instead of through intermediaries? Larry Fink : Our business model is not changing at all. Where we believe our retirement solution business, especially with Microsoft, is going to go is working with our institutional clients through their DC plans and providing technology to assist our DC plan clients to provide the technology for them to better serve their employees. It is not for us to go direct; it is providing technology to help the companies have deeper, better connections with their employees, and one thing that we have seen, there has been a separation between the employer and the employee as defined contributions have become the dominant form of retirement. Historically when you had a defined benefit plan, there was an emotional, legal connection between the employer and employee, and in an era now of 3%-ish unemployment, whatever the level is - 3.7%, more and more companies are trying to find better connectivity with their employees to have better retention. But also, I believe going forward corporations are going to have greater responsibility and needs in terms of working with their employees to have their employees to have more confidence in their retirement plans.  We are developing the technology and, I should say, the pipes to tech-enable our clients, not for us to go direct ourselves but to have deeper connections, and we believe having that type of pipe and technology is going to be a way that we can enhance our value chain. It certainly is going to build more opportunities to build deeper relationships and ultimately more flows. It also can connect what we\u2019re doing with Aladdin for wealth, where I believe it\u2019s going to be transformational for BlackRock over the next 10 years. That is going to allow us to have deeper connection with the financial advisor. We have already heard examples where those wealth advisors who are using Aladdin for wealth, they have been able to secure bigger assignments from their clients because they\u2019re providing their clients with better transparency of their portfolio, better risk analytics for their portfolio.  Our job is to enable our distribution platforms. Our job is to enable our institutional clients with better pipes and technology, and that\u2019s how we believe we could generate robust opportunities which will entail better flows, but most importantly deeper and better connected relationships that will sustain ourselves over many years to come. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citi. Larry Fink : Hey Bill, happy new year. Brian Wu : Hi, good morning. This is Brian Wu on for Bill Katz. Thank you for taking my question. Regarding the cost saving initiatives, could you provide some color on areas of potential reallocation or reinvestment of those savings, in what geographies, business lines or areas of technology you would likely focus on? Thank you. Rob Kapito : Sure, I\u2019ll take that. I think the goal of this restructuring, as it was a couple years ago when we last took a similar approach, is in a market where we\u2019ve seen beta take over $500 billion off of our assets and obviously a significant amount of revenue off of our entry rate for the year, we continue to believe that the model that we have here really affords us the opportunity to continue to play offense. We see some amazing opportunities for growth. Our desire is to really take advantage of a marketplace where a number of participants in the industry are being forced to cut back more than they would like, and so we are doing everything we can to be as disciplined and as smart as possible to continue our growth standpoint. That obviously takes some challenges. We\u2019ve got to basically move decisively to make sure we\u2019re focusing those more limited resources where the impact will be greatest, and that\u2019s why we took the recent steps to modify the size and shape of the organization.  Recall that we\u2019re global, so I think really everything that we\u2019re talking about and the areas that we\u2019re focused on are all entirely global, so it\u2019s less really about a geographic targeting, and in fact some of the areas that we\u2019ve identified for growth are in fact geographic in nature, like A-Pac and China in particular; but the key areas for us that we\u2019re focused on making sure we continue to invest in are ETFs, multi-asset solutions, illiquids, and technology. When we talk about technology, that\u2019s broad-based technology, that\u2019s technology in terms of Aladdin and Aladdin Wealth. In particular, it\u2019s technology to continue to help drive better investment decisions, it\u2019s technology to leverage our distribution capabilities, and obviously to continue to invest in the infrastructure and the operational efficiency of the firm. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JP Morgan. Ken Worthington : Hi, good morning. Just on the active franchise, so active equity sales seemed to hold up really well this quarter. I think you even had retail active equity inflows despite what we all saw was a terrible fund flow quarter for the industry. You\u2019ve clearly made various changes to the active equity product both in terms of distribution and pricing, so at least on the equity side, what do you think is resonating or why did both the institutional and retail active equity businesses hold up so well?  Then on the other side, active fixed income, we saw that sort of same challenging market environment in credit that we saw in equities, and retail and institutional investors stepped up the active fixed income outflows and I think you mentioned high yield and unconstrained on the retail side. But given the same challenging environment for both credit and equities, why did equities hold up so much better than fixed income on the active side? Larry Fink : I\u2019m going to let Gary answer most of the question, but let me--I think what we did in our U.S. domestic equity platform resonated. We actually had good returns in many of our U.S. equity platform and that certainly created a stability that we didn\u2019t see in 2017, just the relative nature and the results of that change. We did see outflows, though, in some of our European products where we actually had core return, so I don\u2019t want to--. We are seeing evidence of our portfolio team changes having an impact where we made changes. We still have more work to do. On the fixed income side, I think we saw elevated outflows predominantly because of the huge rally in fixed income rates in December, when we saw rates go from as high as, on the 10-year, 3.20 to the 2.60 range and I think many people were just taking profits. We saw some people get out of some fixed income active funds to go into our low duration ETFs, and so we saw asset allocation, some cannibalization. As Rob suggested, though, we actually picked up share in the fixed income side through our ETF platform, so I don\u2019t think there was one single trend that we could give specifics, other than we are starting to see positive response by the client base related to our restructuring of our U.S. equity team that Mark Wiseman did, and we had positive returns Rob or Gary, do you want to fill it in more? Gary Shedlin : Yes, I think--well look, on the active equities side, when you look at both fundamental and systematic, I think on the institutional side we definitely saw some lower levels of outflows for the quarter. On the retail side, I think we\u2019ve seen some benefit from our advantage series, which was part of our restructuring of our equity business about 18 months ago, which was a recognition of trying to migrate to a lower fee, more quantitative model. I think that\u2019s actually benefited us and has done very well. We\u2019ve recently launched that feature as well. I think on the retail side more generally, though, on equities, keep in mind that there is some seasonal impact of capital gains reinvestment that we see in the quarter, that always helps the fourth quarter a little bit. On the fixed income side, I think on the retail side we talked about some industry-wide outflows in both unconstrained and high yield, migration to the shorter duration product as well as just risk-off sentiment in high yield that basically impacted the entire industry, and obviously we have very significant market share in both of those products. Larry Fink : But I\u2019m pleased to say in high yield, we actually had really good performance, so I think it was, as Gary just said, was a risk-off situation but as long as we continue to drive good performance, when there\u2019s risk on again, we\u2019ll benefit. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Larry Fink : Good morning, Mike. Mike Carrier : Morning. Gary, one question for you just on the expense side. Maybe just a few clarifications - just on the G&A, given that throughout 2018 there was some items in that line, when you\u2019re talking about keeping that kind of flat in this environment for 2019, just wanted to try to get a sense of what base you\u2019re thinking that comes off of. Then just from an environmental standpoint, I think in 2018 you mentioned if the environment continues as you kind of expect and the comp ratio would trend lower, so when we think about the comp ratio in 2019 and beyond, given some of the restructuring plus some of the investments that you guys are making, just wanted to get an update there on how you\u2019re thinking about navigating that. Gary Shedlin : Sure, so on the G&A side, the way I would think about it is we referenced the fact that our G&A went up year-over-year about $200 million. I would say that in our view, about half of that are what we could consider non-budgetable-slash-manageable items, so we have FX re-measurement, we have the purchase price contingencies that are obviously more one-time in nature and have revenue hopefully associated with that going forward. We tend to have some product launch costs tied to booking costs on closed-end funds that may launch in any given year, and then last year in particular we had a number--we had some elevated professional fees as it related to some M&A deals, obviously Brexit preparations as well as tax planning across the organization. About 50% of that increase effectively of that $200 million, I would attribute to those non-core items, so hopefully that gives you a sense when we talk about--looking at last year, you know, my sense is that $100 million, to the extent we don\u2019t have to see that again this year, is something that we would expect to decline year-over-year. So if you\u2019re looking at it more on a full-year basis of stated last year to what we would hopefully expect this year on a more core basis, my guess is it\u2019s down in the 3% to 4% type of area.  On the compensation, you asked a good question on compensation. We did see a decline year over year of roughly 110 basis points in comp to revenue, and as we\u2019ve mentioned, obviously that\u2019s driven in part by a continued strategy to embrace technology more broadly and to leverage our iHubs. When I talk about iHubs, we now have one in India, we have Budapest, and as you know, we\u2019re planning on getting more ramped up in Atlanta. So as we continue to leverage that, that change the shape of the organization and obviously hopefully scale benefits do the same, which tends to drive our comp to revenue down. This year, we did have lower performance fees. Lower performance fees tend on the margin to have higher comp associated with them because teams get paid and then the rest of the employees get the benefit of that, so I would say that in stable markets and over the long term, we would clearly expect our compensation as a percent of revenue to decline as a function of continued investment and increased scale in our business.  We\u2019ve talked about that resulting in an upward bias, however in the near term I think we could see some lumpiness in that trend. Obviously beta has declined fairly significantly - we talked about going into the year with a 6% lower run rate than last year. We\u2019re obviously going to have to make sure that we protect our most important assets, which are our human capital, and we\u2019ve been making some recent growth initiatives in things like obviously acquisitions around TCP or Tennenbaum and trying to get our long term LTPC in place, which is going to require us to basically make some one-time investments of deferred comp that could run off over the next few years. I think with that being said, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any change in our long term trend, but we could see a little bit of lumpiness in the near term. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks? Larry Fink : Thank you, Operator. Thanks again for everyone joining us this morning and your continued interest in BlackRock. I believe our 2018 results are directly linked to the investments we made over time. Results are deeply connected to our deep partnerships we have developed and built with our clients globally through our solution-based approach, and we are going to continue to leverage our differentiated scale. We\u2019re going to continue to invest in the investment and technology capabilities, and I believe it is those investments - those investments in technology, those investments in working with our clients worldwide, is going to continue to deliver value to our clients but just as importantly, value and opportunities for our shareholders.  Have a good start of the year. It started off okay, and let\u2019s hope everyone has a very good 2018. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Sigie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated First Quarter 2019 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today\u2019s call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference. Chris Meade : Good morning, everyone. I am Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that during the course of this call we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock\u2019s actual results may of course differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So, with that, I will turn it over to Gary. Gary Shedlin : Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to present results for the first quarter of 2019. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I will review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. BlackRock generated $65 billion of total net inflows in the first quarter or 4% annualized organic asset growth, reflecting our differentiated solutions-based approach to addressing client needs. Our first quarter results reflect the benefits of our integrated business model and the investments we have made to diversify our investment platform, enhance our risk management and technology capabilities, and build local expertise at global scale. First quarter revenue of $3.3 billion was 7% lower than a year ago, reflecting the impact of fourth quarter equity market declines on our 2019 base fee entry rate. Operating income of $1.2 billion was down 11% compared to a year ago, while earnings per share of $6.61 was down 1%, as lower operating income and a higher effective tax rate were partially offset by higher non-operating income and a lower share count in the current quarter. Non-operating results for the quarter reflected $135 million of net investment income, driven by higher marks on our unhedged seed capital investments and the revaluation of certain strategic minority investments. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 22% and included a $22 million discrete tax benefit related to stock-based compensation awards that vested during the quarter. We continue to estimate that 24% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2019 though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of non-recurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on tax legislation. First quarter base fees of $2.8 billion were down 5% year-over-year, primarily due to the negative impact of non-U.S. equity markets and foreign exchange on average AUM and an associated mix change favoring lower fee fixed income assets compared to a year ago. On a constant currency basis base fees were down 3% year-over-year. Sequentially, base fees were up 1% or 3% after adjusting for the impact of a lower day count in the first quarter, driven by market appreciation, organic base fee growth and higher securities lending revenue. On an equivalent day count basis, BlackRock\u2019s fee rate increased from 18 basis points in the fourth quarter to 18.2 basis points for the first quarter of 2019. Performance fees of $26 million decreased meaningfully from a year ago, reflecting lower revenue from liquid alternatives and long only equity products. As noted on our fourth quarter earnings call, investment underperformance entering the first quarter resulted in certain quarterly locking funds falling below high watermarks. We saw improved performance in many of these funds during the last three months, which better positions us for the remainder of the year. Continued momentum in institutional Aladdin resulted in 11% year-over-year growth in quarterly technology services revenue, and 17% year-over-year growth on a trailing 12-month basis. As Larry will discuss in more detail, overall demand remains strong for our full range of technology solutions. Advisory and other revenue of $49 million was down $22 million year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower earnings attributable to an equity method investment. On a sequential basis, the decline reflected lower fees from advisory and transition management assignments. Total expense decreased 4% year-over-year, primarily due to lower compensation and volume related expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was down $54 million or 5% year-over-year, reflecting lower incentive compensation driven in part by lower operating income. Sequentially, compensation and benefit expense was up 5%, primarily reflecting higher seasonal payroll taxes, and an increase in issuance and mark-to-market of deferred compensation, partially offset by lower incentive compensation driven in part by lower performance fees. Direct fund expense was down $19 million or 7% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the negative impact of equity and foreign exchange markets on average index AUM. G&A expense was up 1% year-over-year, reflecting higher technology expense, partially offset by the impact of product launch cost in the first quarter of 2018. Sequentially, G&A expense decreased $61 million, reflecting seasonally lower marketing and promotional expense, lower professional services expense and $31 million of contingent consideration fair value adjustments related to prior acquisitions recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our first quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 41.9% was down 220 basis points from a year ago, reflecting the negative impact of markets and foreign exchange on quarterly base fees and a strategic decision to continue investing responsibly for the long-term. While we are always margin aware, we have deep conviction in the stability of our business model, which allows us to better navigate the financial challenges associated with short-term market volatility. Since year end, beta has been constructive, organic growth has improved and a number of our hedge funds are back above high watermarks. All of which contributed to 9% growth in our assets under management and position as well for the second quarter. We remain focused on funding our most critical strategic initiatives to optimize organic growth and significantly advanced two of these strategic initiatives, technology and illiquid alternatives during the first quarter. We are confident these investments will enhance outcomes for clients and generate long-term value for shareholders. Last month, we announced the binding offer an exclusive agreement to acquire eFront, the world\u2019s leading end-to-end alternative investment management software and solutions provider. As clients increasingly add to their alternatives allocations, the ability to seamlessly manage portfolios and risk across public and private asset classes on a single platform will be critical. The combination of eFront with Aladdin will set a new standard in investment and risk management technology, and reinforce Aladdin\u2019s value proposition as the most comprehensive investment operating system in the world. Subject to the French Works Council process, we expect the transaction to close in the second quarter. We have also announced the first close of long-term private capital, LTPC is an innovative perpetual direct private equity fund designed to create value for the long-term. Limit reinvestment risk and operate with lower volatility than comparable vehicles. It\u2019s a crucial new component of BlackRock\u2019s comprehensive alternative investment capabilities, which now include hedge funds solutions, real assets, private credit and direct private equity. LTPC is another example of BlackRock\u2019s ability to assess the market, organically develop our capabilities and deliver the products and solutions clients need most. Our capital management strategy has always been to first invest in our business and then return excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. As previously announced, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 5% to $3.30 per share of common stock and repurchased $1.6 billion worth of common shares in the first quarter including $1.3 billion repurchased in a private transaction at approximately $413 per share. We have now completed our targeted level of share repurchases for 2019, but we will remain opportunistic should relative valuation opportunities arise. BlackRock is having deeper and more strategic conversations, with a greater number of clients than ever before and our first quarter results highlight the value of the investments we have made to assemble the industry\u2019s broadest offering of active and index investment strategies, coupled with technology and portfolio construction tools. The diversity of our platform positions us to serve clients\u2019 needs in a variety of market environments and enables us to generate consistent and differentiated organic growth. Quarterly net inflows of $65 billion were positive across active and index strategies, as well as in our cash management business. BlackRock\u2019s institutional franchise generated $29 billion of net inflows representing 4% annualized organic asset growth, flows were led by momentum in fixed income, reflecting continued demand for liability driven investment solutions and our top performing active strategies. Institutional active net inflows of $15 billion were driven by $13 billion of active fixed income flows reflecting strong activity in our insurance client channel. Momentum in our illiquid alternatives franchise continued into 2019. Record quarterly net inflows of $6 billion were led by infrastructure, real estate, private credit and the previously mentioned first close of LTPC. In addition, we have approximately $22 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of strategies, representing a significant source of future base and performance fees. iShares net inflows of $31 billion reflected global client demand for a diverse range of strategies, including core, fixed income, factor and sustainable ETFs. We saw record quarterly flows in fixed income iShares as clients continue to adopt ETFs for corporate, emerging market and high yield bond exposures. Approximately 40% of iShares\u2019 close in the quarter were on higher fee products outside of the core, resulting in annualized organic base fee growth of 7% in line with organic asset growth in the quarter. Retail net outflows of $1 billion reflected industry pressures in international equities and world allocation strategies, partially offset by strength in BlackRock\u2019s municipal fixed income franchise and event driven liquid alternatives funds. Finally, BlackRock\u2019s cash management platform saw $6 billion of net inflows, as we continue to grow our cash business, leverage scale for clients and deliver innovative distribution and risk management solutions through a combination of Cachematrix and Aladdin. In summary, our first quarter results highlight the breadth of our investment strategies, coupled with our industry-leading technology and portfolio construction capabilities and an ability to service clients on a global scale. While we will never be immune to beta headwinds and the impact those headwinds can have in our short-term financial results, we intend to retain focus on investing in our highest growth priorities and exercising prudent expense discipline to ensure we meet the critical needs of clients and shareholders alike. Our goal remains to deliver consistent and differentiated organic growth in the most efficient way possible. With that, I will turn it over to Larry. Laurence Fink : Thank you, Gary, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining BlackRock\u2019s first quarter call. BlackRock\u2019s broad investment platform generated $65 billion of total net inflows in the first quarter, representing 4% organic asset growth and 3% organic base fee growth. The breadth of our investment capabilities, spanning index, alpha-seeking, alternatives and cash, coupled with our industry leading technology and portfolio construction capabilities, allowed us to generate strong flows, and importantly, meeting the evolving needs of our global clients. BlackRock\u2019s commitment to staying ahead of our client needs continues to resonate and we are deepening those relationships with our clients throughout the world more than ever before. Following significant declines in equity markets in the fourth quarter of last year, investors reverse their risk tolerance at the start of 2019. U.S. markets have regained their losses and both developed an emerging market equities, although not fully recovering from about 10% year-to-date. High yield fixed income the most challenged category last year is now seeing inflows. Improved investor sentiment has been driven in part by easing concerns around the global monetary policy and trade. The Federal Reserve and other central banks are emphasizing a more patient approach to monetary policy, quieting investments -- investors\u2019 fears of tightening monetary policy and conditions late in our cycle. And investors\u2019 focus on trade tensions have declined relative to last year, as negotiations between the United States and China progresses. Despite strong market performance year-to-date, average market levels are still lower than they are a year ago and investor optimism remains fragile as geopolitical risk and global growth concerns persist. While recent development in China should increase global capital investment spending notably weak Eurozone PMI data, it signals further slowdown in Europe, and the U.K. although a hard Brexit has been avoided in the near-term, those issues remain unresolved. In this global context, clients are continuing to turn to BlackRock. Our focus has always been and always will be to listen to our client\u2019s goals and challenges, so we could better anticipate and evolve ahead of our clients\u2019 needs. Today clients are increasingly asking for more transparency. They are searching for more value, and most importantly, like we are seeing in so many other industries, clients are looking for more convenience. And they want sustainable long-term returns, but they also want everyone\u2019s focusing on their outcomes and these are the major issues that impacting I would say the asset management industry today. I wrote in my letter to shareholders this year about the need for more dialogue around long-term outcomes. As we have done throughout our history, BlackRock continues to invest in our investment platform and our technology to deliver the outcomes our clients are looking for. Every decision we make is centered on enhancing our ability to partner with our clients. In two months, we will cross the 10-year anniversary of BlackRock\u2019s announcement to acquire Barclays Global Investors. Over the last 10 years, our strategy behind the merger has resonated being agnostic across alpha and index industries allows us to have a different voice -- a differentiating voice for our clients. Much has changed for our industry and for BlackRock in this past decade, rather than looking for individual products, clients are increasingly seeking a partner to help them create tailored portfolios. It\u2019s only by delivering that to clients that we can drive growth and create long-term value for our shareholders, and that is why we continue to evolve our platform and organization today. BlackRock\u2019s strategy for delivering long-term growth is centered on three main drivers; capturing the shift from product selection to portfolio construction; leading in technology across the asset management value chain; and gaining global and local expertise in high future growth markets around the world. We do all of this with the ultimate goal again of enhancing our clients\u2019 experience and deepening our client relationships globally. Last year, we launched the Client Portfolio Solutions teams to formally bring together the strategic advantages that enable us to create a whole portfolio of solution for both institutional and wealth clients. Leveraging BlackRock\u2019s differentiated research, our investment and technology capabilities and portfolio construction, Client Portfolio Solutions generated more than $11 billion of net inflows in the first quarter and continues to gain strong momentum. We are expanding our capabilities across portfolio of building blocks and investing in areas of highest client demands and ETFs are one of those areas. iShares generated $31 billion of net inflows in the first quarter and once again capture the number one market share of ETF flows globally in Europe, as well as the high-growth categories including fixed income ETFs, factor ETFs and sustainable ETFs. This quarter flows reflects the diversity of our iShares platform, by region in addition we saw $17 billion of net inflows in U.S. iShares and we generated $15 billion of net inflows in European iShares, which represented a 17% organic growth. In higher growth -- in higher fee iShares categories including fixed income factors and sustainable ETF, we generated a total of $38 billion of net inflows and core iShares generate $19 billion in the first quarter. While these flows are partially offset by outflows from a handful of equity iShares, which reflects the reversal of strong fourth quarter tax related inflows, iShares continues to benefit from long-term secular trends, including the global shift to portfolio construction and to fee-based wealth management. Financial advisors are increasingly adopting models to customize portfolio for clients in a simple and scalable way. The use of models is driving demand for both ETFs and high performing alpha strategies, in addition to digital tools that help advisors better see where risk and fees are being allocated and BlackRock is well-positioned for that. After more muted growth in 2018, we are seeing renewed demand for fixed income securities. BlackRock generated $80 billion of fixed income inflows across active and indexed products. Flows were led by increased adaptation of fixed income ETFs, which generated $32 billion of net inflows across high yield, emerging market bonds and treasuries. Non-ETF index fixed income flows of $29 billion were driven demand for LDI strategies as clients immunize their portfolios and we saw diversified flows into our top performing active fixed income platform, with net inflows of $18 billion across core fixed income, municipal bonds and high yield strategies. Performance in our active fixed income strategies remain strong with 83% and 85% of assets above benchmark or peer median for the three-year and five-year period. We are constantly innovating across our platform to meet client needs and delivering growth for shareholders. For example, in cash management where we generated $6 billion of inflows in the quarter, we are leveraging our Cachematrix technology to improve convenience and transparency for our clients. We are also innovating on the types of cash management strategy we offer to clients and last week we launched a Liquid Environmentally Aware Fund or LEAF as a prime money market fund with an environmentally focused strategy. The fund will use 5% of its net revenues to purchase and retire carbon offsets and direct a portion of proceeds to our conservation efforts. Increasingly, clients want sustainable strategies that provide financial returns and target a measurable social or economic impact. BlackRock\u2019s goal is to make those strategies more accessible to more people. Beyond dedicated sustainable investment funds, we are also integrating environmental, social and government risk factors across all our investment processes. We firmly believe business relevant sustainable data is useful for all of our portfolio managers and ultimately results in decision making that delivers better long-term results for our investors and our clients. With our continued focus on evolving ahead of clients\u2019 needs, we are also developing an innovative new private equity vehicles design to meet it institutional client needs for the long-term high quality private company exposures. BlackRock Long-Term Private Capital strategy, LTPC offers institutions the opportunity to invest on the continuum between publicly traded equities and leveraged buyout style private equity. The fund will have a perpetual structure and an active ownership approach designed to create value for the long-term. At the end of the first quarter, LTPC secured $1.25 billion of capital commitments and cornerstone investments. Including LTPC BlackRock had a record quarter in our illiquid alternative business with $6 billion of net inflows and clients continue to search for yield and attractive risk adjusted returns. We also deployed $2 billion of committed capital in the first quarter and have another $22 billion of remaining capital to deploy. As we look to bridge the gap between public and private assets, we also realized that clients benefit when alternative investments are evaluated inside a portfolio level risk management framework. That is why we announced last week our exclusive agreement subject to conditions to acquire eFront. This acquisition will deepen BlackRock\u2019s strength in two of our strategic growth areas, our illiquid alternatives and technology, and will enable portfolios that span traditional and alternative asset classes to be managed much more comprehensively. Technology is changing every aspect of the asset management landscape and BlackRock\u2019s results milestones and continuum innovation are only possible, because we prioritize making technology essential to our entire business. Strong global momentum continues in our Aladdin business driving 11% growth over year-over-year in our technology services revenues. A number of new client wins in the first quarter including Santander, the first asset manager to use Aladdin in markets such as Brazil, Argentina, Spain, Portugal, and momentum and investments we are making in technology will continue to drive our technology services revenues growth to the low- to mid-teens going forward. BlackRock\u2019s long-term strategy is to provide technology across asset management value chain and we are expanding our technology platform beyond our core Aladdin business to deepen our value proposition with clients and partners, and generate direct technology revenues for the firm. As the investment management ecosystem seeks deeper integration a long investment life cycle, we are extending Aladdin to our asset servicing providers to further unlock the network effects of Aladdin platform. Earlier this month, we announced the strategic alliance with Bank of New York Mellon to deliver an integrated data technology and asset management service capability to share clients to provide Aladdin. By enabling access to investment management and servicing capabilities on one platform, client will be able to further optimize, and optimize their operating models and reduce operating expenses. One of the biggest opportunities for Aladdin going forward is to make the language of portfolio construction for wealth management, wealth managers, financial advisors, individual investors. Aladdin Wealth is now live with nine clients based in the U.S., U.K., Continental Europe and Asia. We see tremendous opportunities for Aladdin Wealth to become the infrastructure of a wealth management landscape. But more importantly it provides BlackRock with an opportunity to deepen our value proposition and brand with wealth partners and their financial advisors. Accelerating trends included the movement towards portfolio solutions and a wider product usage necessary -- necessity of operating scale, enhanced regulatory reporting are creating the need globally for more comprehensive and a more flexible technology driven solution. Aladdin remains well positioned to capitalize on these trends as the industry, leading whole portfolio investment operating system. Just as we continue to innovate and evolve our investment and technology business to meet our clients\u2019 needs we are also evolving BlackRock leaders and we are evolving our organization to enhance client experiences with BlackRock. We made organizational leadership changes every few years because we firmly believe these changes bring great benefits to our clients, to our shareholders and to our leaders themselves. Recent announcements are centered on bringing BlackRock closer to our clients, deepening our relationships with them and more efficiently and more effectively delivering all of BlackRock\u2019s capabilities to our clients. These changes help us maintain our entrepreneurial spirit by bringing in fresh ideas to different areas of the firm and further developing our leaders around the world. I can say, very proudly, that I have never been more excited about BlackRock\u2019s organization and our people than any time in our history. We begin 2019 by maintaining our steadfast focus on client needs. This will continue to position BlackRock as the right partner for our clients and a leader in the growth areas of the future. With that, let me open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Laurence Fink : Hey, Craig. Craig Siegenthaler : Hey. Good morning, Larry. So we continue to see BlackRock expand further in that tax sector here. We saw this again in the first quarter the acquisition of eFront. My question is how will BlackRock clients use this software technology? And also more importantly, how do you plan on monetizing this technology, including potentially supporting your alternative fundraising effort? Laurence Fink : So we look at technology in five business brands across BlackRock and we are focused on every business. Actually we had a leadership retreat last week this past weekend. And we spoke about how we have to work on technology in every business. It\u2019s not the business that BlackRock that should be untouched with technology. Technology has to be the component of shaping how we do business. So we look at technology in five different areas. We look at technology to deliver better alpha using more data sources. We are using technology now, as I spoke about in my prepared remarks, creating technology for more convenient portfolio construction. Obviously, we are using technology with more operational efficiencies, Aladdin provider is a good example. Throughout our history, we are using more and more technology for risk management. And now we are using technology to create more convenience with our clients by delivering better tools for distribution and so we are framing technology across all these businesses. eFront really is a great example of us using a technology to really help us in delivering two out of the three major long-term strategies that we spoke about in my shareholder letter. We speak about why technology has to be driving BlackRock and why alternatives have to continue to drive the future of BlackRock. And eFront still helps us deliver in those two key categories, the third one is China. If I have to say a fourth one is retirement, but those are two of the key characteristics of our forward growth strategy. Related to eFront in itself it is going to be provided as a new revenue component of Aladdin and it\u2019s going to be an add-on cost to our Aladdin platform. It is -- and so it will be integrated on top of the Aladdin platform over time, but it will be another sleeve and we are actually there were some overlaps with the clients and there were many new clients that are part of eFront, so it allows us to have broader depth globally worldwide. And so we look at this acquisition as another milestone of us really trying to build technology across all asset categories and we did cite that we had some weaknesses in alternative technology in Aladdin and this really helps us accelerate the added sleeves of alternative technology on Aladdin. So this will be another revenue center for BlackRock as a part of the Aladdin platform. Craig Siegenthaler : Thank you, Larry. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Robert Lee from KBW. Your line is now open. Laurence Fink : Hi, Robert. Robert Lee : Great. Good morning. Good morning, Larry. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just flush out a little bit on the alternatives platform. Obviously, you spent in addition to the eFront, you have spent a lot of time and energy with some acquisition, the organic growth. Can you may be -- where do you feel like you stand with your old platform in terms of do you feel like at this point you have the most of the strategies covered or -- and it\u2019s more about kind of scaling with subsequent funds or are there still places you feel like there\u2019s maybe whole of\u2026 Laurence Fink : Sure. Robert Lee : \u2026 you are looking to fill? Laurence Fink : Let me have Gary start it off and I will try to answer if I need too. Gary Shedlin : Yeah. Rob, I think, we feel that we are very well situated on the illiquid platform at the moment, obviously, we have got a range of products now that span kind of across the more major categories. LTPC firmly puts us in the direct private equity, obviously, we have a significant real estate business and infrastructure business, a private credit business. We have a variety of solutions-oriented businesses, whether it would be funded hedged funds, funded private equity and broader alternative solutions. So I think we feel like we have got a foot in every one of the high growth markets. I think when we add it all up today we have got about $65 billion plus in illiquid plus another $22 billion or so of committed capital to go. So that gives us a fair amount of scale. I think when you look at the individual businesses, one could argue that individually they are not big enough and so that will come obviously with successor funds and continuing to develop -- continue to deliver the returns that our investors expect, and so obviously, as we do that I think successor funds will get bigger. And we will continue to opportunistically look for tactical opportunities to create more scale in those businesses. But as I think we have been very, very clear culture is incredibly important to us. We are not really looking to buy out anybody. We are really looking to buy in people who want to be a part of our very differentiated platform and we see those opportunities as we have seen in the past with our new partners from Tennenbaum or First Reserve and others. We will do things that basically make sense not only for clients but also for our shareholders. So bottomline is, we will continue to see what\u2019s out there and be opportunistic, but we feel like we have got a pretty good growth platform right now. Laurence Fink : As you know, Rob, we have been very systematic in how we have been approaching this. It has not been what I would call it metamorphic by any means. If you think about just our infrastructure platform, we started really infrastructure in 2012 by lifting out a team of people. We are over $20 billion now in infrastructure growing quite nicely. We are raising a couple more funds. So it\u2019s been very systematic and I think the same thing will be done over LTPC. Over time that\u2019s going to be continue to grow. We actually have opportunities that continue to build that out. We have real estate and so over time this is a growth area. Our first quarter was up $6 billion in growth. That was a record quarter for us as Gary suggested. We have $20 billion or $22 billion of the drag of committed capital right now and that they will be put to work. We look at this as a real opportunity and our clients are looking to us to be really focused on these types of opportunities. So I am pretty constructive on where we are at this point in time. Robert Kapito : Can I add one thing? The other part that we are excited about is that we have done some institutional surveys and it shows that the largest reallocation is going to be to the alternative space. So we do need to have a wide product base to be able to satisfy our current clients\u2019 needs. But also you know that we are very important to the retail base and they want exposure to the alternatives area. So we are also working very closely with our retail distribution partners to create the appropriate wrappers, to put the alternatives that have the appropriate risk and reward for those clients that are looking for it. So it\u2019s not just institutional investors, it\u2019s also retail investors that are looking to us for some exposure in the alternative space. Robert Lee : Okay. Thank you. Can I ask may be a tactical follow-up question, Larry, you mentioned there being some kind of reversal of the fourth quarter ETF equity flows that were driven by tax reasons. But broadly across the industry despite this big rebound in the market to kind of feels like demand for equities in general both index and active have been pretty muted. Is there -- is this really more just symptomatic of the people bifurcating the portfolios more going to alternatives than, obviously, better fixed income demand or is there something else going on underneath that business? Laurence Fink : So the question we saw strong rerisking for those were in cash and allocated back into fixed income. We saw that predominantly -- a lot of investors were believing that interest rates are going to go higher, Central Banks really continue to tighten and obviously the change in Central Bank forward forecast and their behaviors many investors were underinvested and put duration to work across the Board. As we have seen as Rob Kapito just mentioned we are seeing investors continue to barbell, I think, going more and more heavy into alternative spaces. What the first quarter showed also that investors are still selling equity exposures. As an industry there were major outflows again in overall global equities as an industry. This is one of the reasons why I actually believe we are at a pivot point now where equivalent markets despite the rally can have much more upside because the amount of under investments investors have in equities they have not rerisk in equities in the first quarter. And so to me -- we believed as you are starting to see renewed economic activity in the United States from the slow pace of the first quarter and we are moving closer to about 2.5% economy in the second quarter, we are seeing a stronger economic signal out of China from all the fears we have in the third and fourth quarter. So I would argue there is a high probability going forward that investors are going to begin to rerisk across the equity platforms. And what we hear from investors and we see, investors coming in every day seeing our leaders, seeing Rob, seeing me and the biggest question is we are being asked continuously, where should we put our money? There is huge pools of money sitting in the sideline and many people how we are going to have the continued downdraft in the fourth quarter. They thought interest rates are going to go higher. A lot of -- as I said the biggest risk is that clients are under invested not over invested. So we see more upside here, especially, in equities. Robert Kapito : So one thing on the tactical comment, if you started last year with a 60-40 stock mix, which is what most people have, by the time you got to somewhere in October, that number would have been 80-20, which is really too much risk. So you saw a lot of tactical asset allocation changes to get their portfolios back to 60-40, which means you have to sell stocks and buy bonds. And at the same time, the risk free rate during the year went from zero to 3% so bonds look pretty good coming out of cash. So I think we saw that in November and December. That added to the fuel to -- for the first time being able to take a tax loss for a very long time. But now in the first quarter that people are getting back to where they wanted to be, I think, the risk on trade is coming back into the marketplace and you see that reflected in where they are allocating their money tactically now. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research. Your line is now open. Patrick Davitt : Hey. Good morning, guys. Laurence Fink : Hi. How are you? Patrick Davitt : I am well. Thanks. You mentioned that the nine live Aladdin for Wealth clients. Could you update us where you think we are on the ramp-up of noticeable incremental flow from those nine go lives, update us on the pipeline of new go lives this year and are there any meaningful milestones you are just looking to see a more noticeable uptick inflows from that channel? Robert Kapito : So we are very optimistic on the Aladdin for Wealth, because for the first time it gives a lot of the financial advisors the ability to look and test their clients portfolios to make sure that they are taking the right risk in them. And so as they come on, we are building it together. They are asking can we do this, can we do this, what can we show our clients and of course within each system, the things that these firms are able to send out to their clients have to be approved they sent out that takes a little time. So there\u2019s a little bit of a lag. So there was a lag in implementation, and now we are in process with many of them on getting them on to the systems and to understand how it works and what they can actually use for their clients. So it is been an eye opening experience for many of their clients. What we didn\u2019t realize was that Aladdin for Wealth can be used as an asset gathering tool and most clients in the retail area have accounts at more than one firm. And if you are one of the firms that can show your client the risk and reward of their portfolios and then improve it that is a great advantage, and we are seeing a lot of money move for those who have Aladdin to with from people that don\u2019t have it. Also the business has moved from individual stock and bond picking to asset allocation and portfolio construction and that\u2019s what the financial advisors are expected to be able to do. By using Aladdin for Wealth, they are able to take not only one portfolio but hundreds of portfolios and organize them in an appropriate way for risk return using portfolio construction. It also helps each of these individual institutions utilize their models, as well as have an alternative model to compare it against BlackRock\u2019s models and so Aladdin for Wealth is helping the financial advisor to have tools for better decision making right at their fingertips, and also, of course, if they are using our portfolio allocation or our tools, there\u2019s a high probability that they may look favorably upon our products. In portfolio construction today, because of the way the compensation system works, they want to use the cheapest products that they can find to do that portfolio allocation and those wind up being ETFs and index product, of which we have a significant market share. So Aladdin for Wealth is helping the financial advisors have the tools to do their job better. It\u2019s helping us to be part of the infrastructure and the ecosystem to build out better tools and technology for our firms that unfortunately under invested in technology and at this time cost is very important to be able to buy it a good price and have it maintained is, I think, just going to grow for the future. So we are very excited about it. But as we have done with Aladdin, as we have brought clients on, we are learning as well what some of the advisors are in need and we are building it together to have the best tools and the tools will also create an ecosystem that also is working with their custodians so that it\u2019s much easier. And Larry mentioned the word convenience, so it\u2019s a tool that\u2019s right at their fingertips that they can log on and get really good information and very good scrubbed data so that they can have a better system. Gary Shedlin : But Patrick, just to be clear, so I just some of the terminology, I just want to make sure we are clear on. I mean the most significant, immediate impact from a P&L standpoint is obviously to see the revenue show up in our technology services line which is where the Aladdin Wealth line will hit. There\u2019s two components to Aladdin Wealth, there\u2019s kind of that what I would call more of the top-down kind of home office view, which is really driving the technology revenue and then there will be that bottoms up impact that basically will happen at the individual adviser level which will generate approach which I think was your initial question. Keep in mind, a lot of this is happening real-time we are rolling it out right now at many places. There is an element of training and getting all of these advisers up to speed on all the new tools that they will have at their disposal. So the flow, the flow deltas, which will then drive our base fees is going to take a little bit longer than the immediate impact of that technology revenue that you are going to see much more immediately. In other situations like, Envestnet, where we that is not an Aladdin Wealth but basically putting our portfolio construction technology on the desktop of the IRAs that have, again I think there you will see basically more impact in base fees because there\u2019s no specific technology revenue associated with that type of partnership. Laurence Fink : But early indications before the Aladdin Wealth users who have been on the longest there is evidence of increased\u2026 Gary Shedlin : Yes. Laurence Fink : \u2026 flows to BlackRock. We don\u2019t have enough statistics to really identify where it is. We don\u2019t have enough data with all the different users. As we said nine clients worldwide and we are in conversations with many more clients. So our objective is to have as Rob just suggested the architecture or risk in the wealth management channel using Aladdin for Wealth. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Laurence Fink : Hi, Michael. Michael Cyprys : Hey. Good morning. Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Just on another question on Aladdin here with eFront that now brings you into alternatives. Just curious as you look across the Aladdin platform what other adjacencies could make sense or capabilities that you would like to see strengthened with Aladdin particularly as you look across the competitive landscape today? Gary Shedlin : I think we are committed to being an end-to-end provider for risk management and analytics across from the front to the back. So I think we have been building out a lot of that in particular ourselves. I think the decision to do eFront was a conscious decision frankly that it was going to take us a lot longer to build that. Our belief is that the eFront transaction accelerates our development in the private asset classes conservatively by five-plus years. So I think we felt we needed to attack there when we can. Otherwise, I think, we will continue to add on all the obvious adjacencies when we think about an end-to-end provider and we continue again to continue to be tactical and opportunistic to basically balance where we think it makes sense to buy versus where we think it makes sense to build. Laurence Fink : But it\u2019s clear that we are -- if you look at our strategy in terms of inorganic opportunities, we are scrubbing, we are reviewing, we are really trying to understand the whole technology environment. That\u2019s where we are focused on. I have been saying this over quarters-and-quarters. We are not focused on asset management M&A in the developed markets. We are focused on if there is an inorganic opportunity in technology that adds more opportunities to be, as Gary said end-to-end provider, whether that\u2019s a data provider or a new technology or AI, we will continue to be either building it or using it -- using opportunities to acquire and that\u2019s what we are very much focused on and we have a whole team continuously looking at the whole ecosystem worldwide. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Laurence Fink : Hi, Alex. Alex Blostein : Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So, Gary, maybe just a refresher on some of the guidance that you guys provided in the beginning of the year, given the fact that markets move pretty considerably over the course of Q1, maybe how you guys thinking about outlook for G&A for the rest of the year. I think your original guide implies something a $1.6 billion kind of annual number, does that still hold and then any other comments around expenses would be helpful? Thanks. Gary Shedlin : Thanks, Alex. I would say really short answer is no change in guidance. I think that, as we said at the beginning of the year, we are very focused on managing the entire discretionary expense base. We continue to see our 2019 kind of core level of G&A expense to be essentially flat to our core level for last year and we are continuing to invest. I mean, as always there are things that come up that are effectively kind of not manageable, so we saw another, let\u2019s call it, I would say, roughly $15 million to $20 million of kind of like non-core G&A in this quarter between paying some fees to get eFront done and some more purchase price contingency, fair market value adjustments and some FX implications. But in terms of what we are managing, we are continuing to stick to the plan that we laid out for our Board in January. I think that we try to anticipate. We saw some volatility. And as I said in my prepared remarks, I mean, we are very much focused on the long-term not trying to manage doing margin on a quarter-to-quarter basis, obviously, we saw a lot of that beta back, which obviously better positioned us and I think we feel a little bit better with the markets where they are right now, when we went into our budgeting season back in the fall. But we are not going to continue to keep an eye down the field and play offense, and continue trying to optimize growth in the most efficient way possible. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Jeremy Campbell from Barclays. Your line is now open. Jeremy Campbell : Hi. Thanks guys. Just wanted to ask a quick one on the advisory and other line, I know you guys had mentioned some items that moved it on a year-over-year and sequential basis, but it was a pretty big step down. And so, I guess, just what\u2019s the outlook and how should we think about that line going forward from this lower 1Q type level? Robert Kapito : So our other revenue line item is really made up of three main components. The biggest component frankly is an equity method investment that we have had for a number of years, which is, obviously, where we are getting our attributable share of somebody else\u2019s earnings and that one is a little more complicated because we don\u2019t control that. And that frankly on a quarter-over-quarter basis, I am sorry, year-over-year basis was the most significant change there. The other two businesses that are effectively in that is our FMA business, our Financial Markets Advisory business, as well as our transition investment management business. I would say those are both smaller revenue line items, where there is significantly more consistency and those are both businesses that are important to BlackRock that we continue to look to grow and annuitize as much as we can. Albeit both of those tend to have some what I would call more capital market centric elements to them. So they are a little bit really the biggest piece of that year-over-year change was the equity method now. I think everybody knows who that is and you guys can track that as well as we can. Operator : Thank you. Your last question comes from Ken Worthington from JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Laurence Fink : Hi, Ken. Ken Worthington : Hi. Thank you for -- hi. Thank you for squeezing me in. Can you help us frame how iShares\u2019 operating margins and iShares\u2019 margins on incremental revenue have evolved over the last say two years or three years, clearly core is much bigger, fee rates are down, but assets are way up. So given the various cross-current, I was hoping to frame how margins might look in iShares and to what extent the significant growth in core and iShares overall have impacted the margins on incremental revenue there? Gary Shedlin : So, Ken, as you know we tend -- we don\u2019t talk margins of our individual businesses. We are very focused on a one BlackRock model to avoid all of our businesses operating at silos. It\u2019s very important to our culture and it\u2019s how we manage the business day-in and day-out. So we don\u2019t have those types of fully allocated P&Ls for our businesses, because we don\u2019t think of it in general is the right behavior day-to-day. I can help you on the revenue line item. I think back in December, we were at Goldman and we talked about what we see as effectively the long-term growth potential for iShares and ETFs. I think we outlined a 12% to 15% kind of topline asset growth rate. I think we do anticipate certain sectors growing faster than others, which is why we have tried to point people to an organic base fee rate that will be less than that. Historically, I think we have seen an organic base fee rate somewhere around 6 points to 7 points, less than that, which is part of the slide we put out at Goldman. Don\u2019t hold me exactly for those numbers you will have to go see it, but I think that\u2019s about what it was. And that takes into account both mix change in terms of faster growth in the core, but also as well as some of the strategic pricing investments we have made and we will likely continue to make that make sense for both clients and for our shareholders alike. This quarter in particular, we actually saw organic base fee growth equal to organic asset growth. It was right in the 7% area, and again, I think, that is a function again of about 40% of the flows being outside of the core and that\u2019s an area whether it be fixed income, strategic beta factors, ESG or other precision exposures frankly that tend to be more capital markets centric and the importance of that obviously is that those are higher fee than the core itself and I think we do continue to believe very strongly that as we see growth in the core, we also see growth outside of the core as people are tactically allocating portfolios around the core ETFs. So that\u2019s what I would tell you about the revenue. I think we feel very comfortable that that iShares business will be growing in excess of our 5% longer term growth target. But as it relates to specific margins, I will leave that to you guys to try and sort through, we don\u2019t manage the business that way. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks? Laurence Fink : I do. I want to just thank everybody for joining this morning and your continued interest in BlackRock. I believe our first quarter results are directly linked to the investments we have made over time and our deep partnerships we built with our clients globally. I think we differentiated ourselves by continuing to leverage our scale. We continue to invest broad investment and technology platform to deliver value to our clients and shareholders. We are continuing to drive technology as a leading -- in the transformation of who BlackRock is and the transformation of how BlackRock works with our clients and we will continue to do that. With that everyone have a very nice spring and we will be talking to you sometime in July. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Marcella and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference. Christopher Meade : Good morning, everyone. I am Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that, during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So, with that, I'll turn it over to Gary. Gary Shedlin : Thanks, Chris. And good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the second quarter of 2019. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. Global trade tensions once again escalated in the second quarter and market volatility followed. US equities climbed to record highs, though domestic equity markets moved down 7% in May only to increase 7% in June, emerging markets remain challenged and the 10-year treasury bond traded below 2%. Clients accelerated rebalancing and derisking activity, shifting out of equities and into fixed income and cash. BlackRock's globally diverse investment platform, combined with industry-leading risk management and portfolio construction technology, was purposely designed to not only withstand today's market volatility, but thrive in it. Our strategic positioning fosters deeper partnerships with clients, enables us to meet their goals in a variety of market environments, and drives more consistent and differentiated organic growth. BlackRock generated a record $151 billion of total net inflows in the second quarter or 9% annualized organic asset growth as clients once again turned to BlackRock for solutions-oriented advice to meet their long-term investment needs. Lower total organic base fee growth of 3% reflected mix change favoring lower-fee fixed income and cash assets and the impact of volatility-driven outflows from higher-fee iShares financial instruments and precision exposures during the month of May. Second quarter revenue of $3.5 billion was 2% lower than a year ago, driven in part by lower securities lending revenue and lower performance fees in the current quarter.  Including $61 million of costs associated with the successful launch of a closed-end fund, operating income of $1.3 billion was down 11% compared to a year ago. Earnings per share of $6.41 was down 4% as lower operating income and higher effective tax rate were partially offset by higher non-operating income and a lower diluted share count in the current quarter. Non-operating results for the quarter reflected $79 million of net investment income, primarily driven by the revaluation of certain strategic minority investments and higher marks on unhedged fixed income seed capital investments, but also reflected additional interest expense associated with the mid-April issuance of debt to partially finance the acquisition of eFront. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 24%. We continue to estimate that 24% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2019, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of non-recurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on tax legislation. Second quarter base fees of $2.9 billion were down 1% year-over-year despite the positive impacts of organic growth and acquisitions, primarily driven by lower securities lending revenue, the negative impact of diversion equity beta and foreign exchange movements on average AUM and strategic pricing investments. Quarterly securities lending revenue declined $33 million or 18% compared to record levels a year ago due to reduced gross exposures partially linked to hedge fund deleveraging in the second half of 2018, lower demand for hard-to-borrow US equities in the softer M&A environment, and lower spreads. In addition, the trend of reduced European seasonal demand continued from previous years. Diversion equity beta and FX continue to impact year-over-year base fee growth. While the S&P 500 was up 7% on average year-over-year, many markets linked to our higher-fee equity products, including Asia, emerging markets and global natural resources, were down 8% over the same time period, resulting in an overall decline of 2% on our revenue-weighted equity composite index. Dollar appreciation over the last year had a negative 1% impact on our year-over-year base fee growth. Sequentially, base fees were up 3% as a result of higher average AUM and the effect of one additional day in the quarter. On an equivalent day count basis, our overall fee rate declined 0.4 basis points in the second quarter, reflecting this diversion equity beta and the impact of mix shift towards lower-fee fixed income and cash assets. Performance fees of $64 million decreased 30% from a year ago, reflecting lower revenue from long-only equity products. However, we have seen improved performance in many of our single strategy hedge funds since year-end, better positioning us to generate performance fees in the second half of the year. Quarterly technology services revenue increased 20% year-over-year, reflecting continued momentum in institutional Aladdin and the impact of the eFront acquisition which closed in May. The combination of eFront with Aladdin sets a new standard in investment and risk management technology and reinforces Aladdin's value proposition as the most comprehensive investment operating system in the world. As Larry will discuss in more detail, overall demand remains strong for our full range of technology solutions and we're already seeing revenue synergies related to the combination of eFront and Aladdin. Advisory and other revenue at $53 million was down $25 million year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower fees from advisory and transition management assignments. Total expense was up 4% year-over-year, driven by higher G&A expense which reflected fund launch costs and acquisition-related expense in the current quarter. G&A expense was up $77 million year-over-year and $82 million sequentially, primarily due to $59 million of product launch costs associated with closed-end fund launches during the quarter. We exclude the impact of these product launch costs when reporting our as-adjusted operating margin. Quarterly G&A expense also included approximately $20 million in professional fees and contingent consideration fair value adjustments related to historical acquisition activities.  Intangible amortization expense was up $10 million sequentially, reflecting amortization of intangible assets acquired in the eFront acquisition. Our second quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 43.1% was down 210 basis points from a year ago, but up 120 basis points sequentially as US equity markets return to historic highs from a year ago. Despite a more challenging overall revenue capture environment driven by current market volatility, we continue to see strong performance in future drivers of differentiated growth, including ETFs, alternatives, technology and portfolio construction, and remain deeply committed to investing responsibly for the long-term. Our capital management strategy has always been to first invest in our business and then return excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. In connection with the previously mentioned eFront acquisition, which closed on May 10, we raise $1 billion in 10-year debt at a 75 basis point spread to treasuries. This represented the tightest credit spread ever for a 10-year senior debt issuance by a public asset manager. As a reminder, in the first quarter, we completed our targeted level of share repurchases for 2019, repurchasing $1.6 billion worth of common shares. While we will be opportunistic in repurchasing additional shares during the remainder of the year, we did not repurchase any shares of common stock in the second quarter. Quarterly net inflows of $151 billion were positive across asset classes, investment styles, regions and client types. Flows benefited from particularly strong demand across our fixed income platform, reflecting changing client preferences and validate our unique ability to partner with clients globally to meet their long-term needs in a variety of market environments. BlackRock's institutional franchise generated a record $87 billion of net inflows, representing 6% annualized organic base fee growth. Flows were led by fixed income and reflected demand for our top-performing active strategies and liability-driven investment solutions. Institutional active net inflows of $73 billion were driven by $59 billion of active fixed income flows, which included two sizable client wins. BlackRock's global insights and unique ability to offer holistic solutions are resulting in more significant strategic fundings than ever before. Multi-asset net inflows reflected continued growth in our LifePath Target Date franchise and active equity net inflows of $3 billion were primarily into quantitative strategies where long-term performance remains strong. iShares net inflows of $36 billion, representing 8% annualized organic asset growth, reflected continued growth in core fixed income, factor and sustainable ETFs. As previously seen in periods of significant market volatility, similar to the dynamic we saw in 2018, we saw outflows from higher fee financial instrument and precision exposure ETFs, which clients use to express real-time capital market sentiment and tactically allocate risk exposure. Quarterly outflows from these products resulted in an iShares annualized organic base fee growth of 1% for the second quarter and had a dilutive impact on BlackRock's overall annualized organic base fee growth. iShares crossed $2 trillion in AUM during the quarter and achieved the number one share of industry flows globally in the US and in Europe and in key product areas including fixed income, factors and sustainable ETFs. We continue to project a doubling of the global ETF market by the end of 2023, including significant growth in fixed income, factors and ESG, as well as in Europe. Retail net inflows of $2 million reflected strength in BlackRock's municipal fixed income franchise and the event-driven liquid alternative funds as well as the successful close of the $1.4 billion BlackRock Science and Technology Trust II, BlackRock's largest closed-end fund launch in the last seven years and the industry's largest in the last five years.  Momentum in our alternatives franchise continued with approximately $3 billion of retail and institutional net inflows in the second quarter. In addition, we have approximately $24 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of alternative strategies, representing a significant source of future base and performance fees. Finally, BlackRock's cash management platforms saw $26 billion of net inflows as we continue to leverage scale for clients and deliver innovative digital distribution and risk management solutions. In summary, our second quarter results highlight the value clients place in our investment platform and our ability to use technology and risk management to develop broad-based solutions across ETFs, alpha seeking and alternative strategies. While we can't control market volatility, the diversification and breadth of our business positions us to serve clients in a variety of environments, helping to drive consistent and differentiated organic growth through economic cycles. We will continue to invest responsibly on behalf of clients and shareholders to execute our strategy for long-term growth. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry. Laurence Fink : Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. For several quarters, I've spoken about the increasing depth and breadth of conversations BlackRock is having with clients. And this quarter's results demonstrates how those conversations are resonating, leading to significant strategic wins. We generated $151 billion of total net inflows in the second quarter, representing 9% annualized organic growth. Inflows were driven by a record activity in fixed income and cash and were positive across all client types, asset classes, regions and both active and index strategies as clients assessed the full breadth of BlackRock's platform in a more volatile environment. The deliberate investments we have made in BlackRock's investment and technology platform are manifesting in the quality and quantity of our engagements with clients. While our financial results are not immune to market volatility, as Gary described, we are having comprehensive conversations with more clients globally than ever before about outcomes and solutions, asset allocation, portfolio construction and investment and risk management technology. The culmination of these capabilities and expertise into a one BlackRock approach gives us a distinct and unique global perspective and gives a distinct voice with so many clients around the world, and it's translating into a larger, deeper strategic mandates for BlackRock. Following improved investor sentiment and global equity market rally through the start of year, macro and geopolitical uncertainty once again returned. The US-China trade tensions flared, renewing concerns about a slowdown in global growth, emerging markets equities have been negatively impacted and are down for the quarter; at the same time, US equities have hit a record high. In Europe, while uncertainties around Brexit continued to weigh on investor sentiment, a focus on interest rate policy has also led to an unusual situation where a strong demand for safety has supported fixed-income price appreciation, while equities have been delivering income. And after a period of rising rates, both the Federal Reserve and the ECB have shifted towards a more dovish stance. The market now expects several Federal Reserve rate cuts by the end of 2020 and the ECB has highlighted a readiness to introduce new easing measures to address inflation shortfalls and hopefully to extend the economic expansion. The combinations of these events, on top of a melt up in US equity markets, has driven a shift in risk sentiment in financial markets globally. Investors are derisking and rebalancing out of equities into fixed-income and cash in order to achieve their intended asset allocations in their portfolios. As the investment landscape evolves, clients continued to turn to BlackRock. Today, clients are looking for better, more resilient portfolios that can help them meet their goals. They continue to demand transparency, value and convenience in addition to sustainable long-term returns and better long-term outcomes. BlackRock's client-centered approach and skill positions us well to deliver on each of these client demands. As our investments in asset allocation, our investments in portfolio construction, a spectrum of investment solutions and technology, along our ability to bring all of those capabilities together that are generating growth and long-term value for BlackRock shareholders. Last month, BlackRock crossed the 10-year anniversary of our announcement to acquire Barclays Global Investors. Our willingness to just disrupt ourselves and the industry by bringing active and index together is creating the foundation of what BlackRock is today.  More importantly, what makes that transaction and each of our subsequent acquisitions so successful was our desire and discipline to integrate the organizations into one \u2013 one platform, one unifying global culture and one technology. While we face a different landscape and a set of challenges now, the culture and the approach that drove us to that combination 10 years ago are just as relevant today, a willing to reimagine our business, to think comprehensively about our client portfolios and to innovate and to use technology in new ways, all to help meet our clients' needs. BlackRock's global voice is translating into large client wins with insurance companies, pension and wealth distribution partners. Our conversation with clients are about understanding their investment challenges and helping them shape and execute strategic portfolio construction decisions. The strong organic asset growth we saw in the second quarter reflects this approach, and contributed to record institutional net inflows driven by a number of significant strategic client mandates. As clients chose to de-risk and rebalance their portfolios, BlackRock saw significant demand for fixed-income strategies. We generated our second consecutive record quarter for fixed income with $110 billion of net inflows diversified across our active and index fixed-income platforms. Inflows were led by $65 billion into active fixed-income strategies where performance remains strong with 82% and 86% of assets above the benchmark or peer medium for the third three and five-year periods. We also saw increased demand in our cash management business which generated net inflows of $26 billion, representing a 23% annualized organic asset growth. Results benefited from client derisking activity as well as a number of significant cash client wins.  In addition to the ability of our diverse investment platform that captures shift in client preferences across asset classes, long-term growth for BlackRock will be driven by a strategic positioning and our competitive advantages. BlackRock has the most diverse investment platform by investment style, from index and ETFs to alpha seeking and to illiquid alternatives, which enables us to be the leader in the industry to do more towards portfolios construction, to have global scale and are increasingly establishing a local identity which positions us to capture growth in high potential markets around the world. And we have leading risk management and technology capabilities that serve the entire asset management value chain. These differentiators align with areas of highest client demand and are fueling BlackRock's ability to grow faster than the industry average.  iShares is one of those areas of highest client demand and generated $36 billion of net inflows in the second quarter. iShares captured the number one market share of ETF flows globally in Europe and the United States and a diversified mix of high-growth categories, including fixed income, factors and sustainable ETFs, as well as the core area of our ETF platform. Flows were led by fixed income and core and included $9 billion in net inflows into factor and sustainable ETFs. We also saw clients use certain financial instruments and precision exposure ETFs to express risk-off views and tactical asset allocation decisions. It is the high secondary market liquidity and the unique options and lending markets around these ETFs that make them so valuable to institutional investors. As Gary mentioned, risk-off and volatility-driven outflows from these higher-fee ETFs masked organic fee growth across other iShares categories, all of which are longer-term in nature.  iShares crossed an important milestone in the quarter, reaching $2 trillion in AUM. This is just five years after reading $1 trillion and 10 years since we acquired the $385 billion franchise. Importantly, 80% of growth over the last five years has been driven by client inflows and we remain confident in the long-term secular growth opportunities for ETFs and we expect the industry could double in the next five years with iShares maintaining its market leadership. We are investing in our platform to deliver high-quality exposures to clients globally and to increase the adoption of ETFs with new clients and for new use cases. For example, we are seeing more investors use fixed-income ETFs, which recently crossed the $1 trillion in industry assets.  In an increasing number of ways, since BlackRock launched the first fixed-income ETF in 2002, these products have made it more convenient for all investors to access a diverse range of exposures. Institutions are adopting them as replacement for their individual bond holdings to enhance efficiencies of their portfolio management process. Individuals are using them to help generate predictable income or as a part of a broader portfolio. iShares fixed-income ETFs have also repeatedly demonstrated that they offer the clients an additional source of liquidity and transparency during the times of market stress. The combination of BlackRock's history as a bond manager, our expertise in ETFs and industry-leading technology and data capabilities create significant differentiation for iShares in this space, and we believe this is just a beginning. It took 17 years for fixed-income ETFs to reach $1 trillion in AUM and they still represent less than 1% of the $105 trillion global bond market. We believe they are well-positioned to double to $2 trillion globally within five years, especially if secular forces like bond market modernization, regulation and a move towards portfolios will take effect and create that type of systematic demand. Sustainable ETFs represent another strategic growth area for iShares as clients increasingly look for strategies that target a measurable ESG impact in financial returns.  We launched iShares ESG Leaders Fund in the second quarter which generated over $1 billion of net inflows, representing the best asset gathering in an equity ETF launch in 15 years. Since launching our iShares Sustainable Core ETFs in October, we have doubled assets to $13 billion and our clients' discussions suggest increasingly more client demand.  Beyond ETFs and across our investment platform, we're seeing greater demand for ESG and for sustainable investments. BlackRock has invested to develop significant expertise in this space. We are leveraging our insights and technology to analyze sustainability-related risk and opportunities across asset classes, so we can better deliver long-term results and opportunities for clients across index, active and alternative investment strategies. Demand for illiquid alternatives also remains strong as investors search for yield and attractive risk-adjusted returns in a sustained low rate environment. We generated $3 billion of net inflows in commitments across our illiquid alternatives business in the second quarter, led by credit, infrastructure and private equity solutions. Our teams are consistently deploying capital on behalf of our clients with another $1 billion of committed capital deployed in the quarter. As clients increase their exposure to private markets, they want more than individual alternative products. Increasingly, clients are looking for alternative solutions that fit in the context of their whole portfolios as well as technology to better understand risk and comprehensively manage portfolios across public and private markets. BlackRock can offer clients both alternative investment solutions and investment and risk management technology. Our acquisition of eFront, which closed this quarter, further strengthens our positioning and ongoing growth in our illiquid alternative business and will be supported and enhanced by our eFront over time. BlackRock's leading technology capabilities continue to support and enhance the strong results we are seeing across our entire platform. Technology services revenues grew 20% year-over-year, including the impact of eFront acquisition that closed in May. We are excited to share that we've already received our first combined client win notification for an eFront contract, alongside an Aladdin contract extension. This early success is a reflection of the immediate collaboration and teamwork across Aladdin and eFront, and reinforces our value proposition as the most comprehensive investment operating system in the world. With Aladdin Wealth, BlackRock is enabling our wealth management partners to offer transparency and convenience to their own clients. Aladdin Wealth is giving advisors better capabilities to connect with their own clients and providing wealth managers with a better risk management portfolio construction tools. Our goal is to make Aladdin Wealth the leading technology platform for wealth managers and deepen our value proposition with our partners and their financial advisors. We seek strong momentum going forward as industry consolidation, shifting product usage and regulatory requirements are creating the need for more holistic, more flexible, technology-driven solutions at both institutions and wealth managers. BlackRock is well-positioned to capitalize on these trends and is committed to enhancing our technology capabilities to continually meet our clients' needs. Over the course of BlackRock's 30-year history and in the 10 years since the financial crisis and our acquisition of BGI, markets have experienced various periods of volatility and uncertainty. I firmly believe that, in markets like these, clients put an even greater premium on the differentiating value proposition that BlackRock can offer. We remain focused on what we can control, bringing together the entire firm to serve clients, strategically investing in our competitive advantages and leveraging our global skill to be more disciplined in how we invest. We are deepening our strength by adapting our businesses to meet challenging client needs, being a leader in the highest future growth areas of our industry and serving our clients more broadly than any firm in our industry. By continuing to keep clients' needs at the forefront of our priorities, we will continue to be driving differentiating growth for our shareholders, and I'm confident we're very well-positioned for business for the future. With that, let's open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Ken Worthington from JP Morgan. Laurence Fink : Good morning, Ken. Kenneth Worthington : Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So, really going after cash management and fixed-income sales, hoping you could talk about the pipeline for both. So, clearly, 2Q was huge. There was a sort of a change in the rate outlook, lots of repositioning. What portion of that repositioning might be left as we look forward there?  And then, it seems like BlackRock was a disproportional winner in both fixed income and cash strategies. You did mention some of the drivers in your prepared remarks. But if you could, just maybe highlight the factors that you see which may have driven not only just good sales, but market share, win share as well. Laurence Fink : Thank you, Ken. So, I would say, what we are seeing more than ever before, our clients are finding the management of fixed income more difficult if they in-house manage it. They're looking for deeper relationships, to have either windows to the market by employing firms like BlackRock to manage part of their portfolios in fixed-income and, in some cases, now they're looking to outsource their entire platform of fixed income. And they are looking for more of a technology solution as a component of that. And it just leads to what I've been saying each quarter, Ken, having this holistic outcome orientation with our clients is leading to these type of broad conversations. We have many deep broad conversations ongoing now and we don't see that type of behavior dissipating in terms of these types of big types of opportunities. But a part of that also is just a systematic approach to fixed income where we're able to provide both index or ETF solutions alongside active solutions. And I do believe they coexist together. We are seeing more clients who employing ETF solutions for fixed income alongside active solutions. And so, having that comprehensive conversation, having the ability to source more product \u2013 and that's obviously in this environment now, smaller organizations are having a harder time sourcing, whether it's in the private credit markets or even in the public credit markets. And so, this is where scale is becoming even more important and also having that global footprint in terms of relationships is building these types of flows. I'll let Rob talk about the cash side, but we've been saying this is a huge competitive opportunity for us and we think much of this has started to manifest in this quarter and we believe in the quarters to come. Robert Kapito : So, let me just accent Larry's comments. So, the depth and the breadth of the conversations that we are having with clients is really resonating now and leading to these large strategic wins because clients are looking for a long-term strategic partner. So, these conversations are about understanding the investment challenges they have and helping them execute strategic portfolio construction decisions. And we have now the unique ability to offer a holistic solution. And this has to include technology, portfolio construction, modeling capabilities, have various asset allocation strategies that involve both passive and active strategies and includes trading and includes analyzing credits and it also includes balance sheet management. So, all of these things have been more significant to get the strategic fundings than ever before, and I think the result you saw in this quarter really reflect this. And our clients are putting out an even greater premium on this differentiated value proposition that we offer. Part of this is also cash. We saw $26 billion of cash management net inflows in the second quarter and we are now number three globally as a money market provider. And these flows come from both large separate accounts wins and strong flows into our institutional money market funds as we continue to innovate, leverage scale and deliver digital distribution and risk management solutions. So, as a reminder, more than 95% of BlackRock's cash assets under management is institutional where we are differentiated with our scale, risk management and technology. So, we believe this differentiated set of cash offerings, including money market funds, separate accounts, CTFs, ETFs and other short duration strategies help us to serve our clients. And lastly, I would say, in cash, we are transforming our cash management business by delivering distribution and risk management technology through a portal that we have called Cachematrix and also through Aladdin. So, we are creating a technology-first distribution strategy, and this is driving our success in cash as well as holistic approaches to get these large strategic wins. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Katz from Citi. Your line is open. Laurence Fink : Hi, Bill. William Katz : Good morning, everyone. Thank you very much for your comments and taking the question this morning.  So, Larry, just want to step back a little bit and I was wondering if you could sort of help sort of frame out what gets the active equity market going again. And within that \u2013 at least from a flow perspective. And from within that, how does products like Precidian with ActiveShares play into that and then what might be the risk to the passive business, if any? Laurence Fink : Let me talk about active equities and I'll let Gary talk about Precidian, but I wanted to say one comment about what does it do to passive ETFs. We had active positive flows in our equity business last quarter. It was in the form of a closed-end fund where we raised $1.6 billion and we saw good inflows in our scientific active equity team where we had great performance.  Where you see with other assets manager where they have flows, it's all performance-based. You have to prove, over time, value for their money. This is one of the big things we've always been talking about. If you cannot show the value or the fees for their return, you're going to continue to see inflows in other types of products. You're going to continue to see more flows into alternatives because of the inability of getting active alpha in equities. And so, when you think about a holistic approach, pension funds or insurance companies, they allocate their active risk across a whole spectrum of investment. If they don't believe they could get the value for their money in active equities, they're going to move that where they could get active alpha into more illiquids. So, that's the trend you're seeing. And so, you're seeing more of a transformation in the alternative space where they're getting more active alpha and you're seeing that's been barbelled by a predominance in ETFs. So, if more and more managers can provide value for their money in terms of active alpha returns after fees, then we're going to see systematic more flows back into active in the equity side. And so, I'm not here to project that the whole industry active is going to have active returns. I think it's harder and harder as I've been commenting over the years about active managers producing active alpha with all of the democratization of information. It's becoming much harder to differentiate yourself, and that's what we've seen. And so, we have systematically been shifting our equity teams into more thematics, into more model based and scientific, into I would say more specific portfolios with fewer shares, stockholdings. And so, we believe that's where active equities is going to be migrating and we've been doing that over the last two years and now we're starting to see some of that success.  On the rise of active ETFs, which I'll let Gary talk about, that will have no impact \u2013 and I underscore no impact \u2013 on index-based strategies. People are using index-based strategies for a purpose, and that is really the \u2013 getting back to my conversation about alpha allocation. So, when you think holistically about your alpha allocation, where are you going to get your active alpha? And so, that's the bigger issue more than anything. And I do believe, when people go into index-based strategies across factors or across sustainable types of products, those are more precision instruments, those are instruments that give them those type of reference. That's not going to change. And so, I'll let Gary talk about the Precidian, but if active investing becomes a larger component, then there could be an increased role of active ETFs. But let me have Gary talk\u2026 Gary Shedlin : So, Bill, I'll say just two things and then we'll move on. One is, obviously, BlackRock is a strong proponent of industry innovation and anything that basically enhances investor access to the markets, we're all for that. And, secondly, I would say that our goal for the future is to be wrapper agnostic. So, to the point Larry made, if an investor wants a passive product, a retail investor, they can choose between an index mutual fund or an ETF. If it's an institutional account, whether it's a co-mingle trust fund or a separate account. And I think similarly, to the extent an investor chooses they want an active product, we similarly think, if the future holds, that they can choose between a traditional mutual fund or an ETF. And that's good for investors, then we'll, obviously, make sure that we position ourselves to be part of that industry growth. Early signs I think are still out. There are some benefits versus a traditional mutual fund for an active ETF in the concept. There's maybe more tax efficiency and less cash drag, but, obviously, there are still some complications as it relates to transparency, the implications that transparency has for creates and redeems and bid/ask spreads and how that instrument is going to trade.  And so, I think it's early days. We're going to continue to watch the development of the product itself and how it relates to the ecosystem around it and we will, ultimately, make the best decision for our investors going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt from Autonomous. Your line is open. Laurence Fink : Good morning, Patrick. William Katz : Good morning, guys. I think, last quarter, you mentioned nine clients ramping up on Aladdin for Wealth and that it was still kind of early days in terms of seeing meaningful, identifiable, incremental organic growth from that. Could you update us on that number and maybe to what extent you're seeing more line of sight to increased adoption of BlackRock product through that ramp up process? Robert Kapito : So, the biggest opportunity for Aladdin is to make it the language of portfolio construction for wealth managers, for financial advisors and also for individual investors. So, Aladdin is currently live with 11 clients globally. This is Aladdin for Wealth.  We continue to see very strong client interest. I would caution you to say that, when we get an Aladdin assignment, there is sometimes three, could be as long as six-month implementation part of that before they come alive. And there's also, of course, ramp up fees that we have until they get large and they start to grow. So, we are seeing more and more demand. And, quite frankly, for every one client that takes on Aladdin or Aladdin for Wealth, it creates demand to become the standard in how people are going to look at technology. And what this does is simply brings risk transparency and portfolio construction capabilities, both in the institutional market and in the wealth market.  And also, when we're having conversations about our risk technology, it also piques their interest in what we can do with their portfolios and balance sheets and adds on to other business that we might do with them and, quite frankly, vice versa. So, when it comes to Aladdin for Wealth, there is a whole education process for advisors to use the technology and you can have any app you want, but you actually have to use it. And we're finding the increased interest is not only because of the risk technology it provides, it's becoming an asset gathering tool for these advisors. So, our expectation is it's going to grow. We have more client interest in it and it's, I think, going to continue to grow as it's been growing in the past for us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks very much for taking the question. If you could just guide into the nature of the active fixed income institutional mandate, I know you touched a lot about this on this, Larry. But if you can talk about maybe what do you think has changed for BlackRock in offering holistic solutions. Obviously, you guys have been well-positioned for that for quite some time, but you seem more optimistic on those types of mandates going forward. So, is it the technology that's linking in that's actually generating this growth or is it something else? And then, just added to that is the fixed income iShares usage as substitutes for bonds. Are you seeing that as a fairly permanent secular trend that should help the fixed income grow quarter-in, quarter-out? Laurence Fink : Thanks, Brian. I'm going to let Rob answer most of it, but this really is just a very vivid example of our positioning as an organization globally where our scale is bringing the ability to source assets, our consistency in performance, our agnostic ability to provide passive and active in fixed income. And so, it's really manifesting now as a deeper product conversation. But, Rob, why don't you\u2026? Robert Kapito : Yeah, I think the quick and dirty answer is just that they need a strategic partner. It's not about just filling or checking a box with one particular product. So, when you can go and you can provide the technology to them, you can provide opportunities for modeling portfolios, portfolio construction, when you can give that answer and have the products in-house to give them the appropriate asset allocation, whether it be passive and active, whether you can actually trade and get the allocations to provide them the products that they need, whether you can do the credit work on their current portfolio and improve it, then whether you can actually look holistically depending upon what type of client it is and help them with balance sheet management because, in a period of low interest rate, every basis point counts. And that's were also cash comes in to be able to provide the appropriate allocations in that balance sheet to improve it or the portfolio itself. Really makes a difference in a low interest environment. So, that's where we're seeing the interest in having more dialogue with us because I think this approach is unique in our industry. The second part is really what's driving fixed income to go more and more into an ETF structure. And you're going to hear a lot from BlackRock about this because there's really four or five different reasons. One is, there is an evolution in portfolio construction and millions of people are actively using fixed income ETFs in new and innovative ways to achieve a variety of outcomes. So, keep in mind, it is still a great way to derisk your portfolios. It is a good way to have more liquidity, more transparency, more diversification and better tax. It's just a better wrapper. There's growing adoption now by institutional investors. So, institutions like pension funds, asset managers and insurance companies rely on fixed income ETFs for very quick efficient market access. As the bond market now starts to modernize, electronification of bond markets are going to support the growth of fixed income ETFs as well as entrenched bond ETFs as part of a vibrant fixed income marketplace. So, technology is also helping this market to grow. And then, as the previous question alerted us to, there's constant ETF innovation. This is the development of new bond ETF exposures. And what it's adding is the most important part of this, which is convenience of investors to access the fixed income market with better liquidity at a better price, and we are constantly now coming up with new tools to customize portfolios and drive future bond ETF adoption. It is right now a very small portion of the fixed income market. We are very optimistic about the future growth. As Larry mentioned, global fixed income ETF assets under management crossed $1 trillion in June. And even at $1 trillion, fixed income ETFs represent less than 1% of the $105 trillion global bond market. So, we have high expectations for growth and we think we're going to benefit from the growth in this market. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Laurence Fink : Hi, Craig. Craig Siegenthaler : Hey, good morning, Larry. So, I wanted to see which of your recent investments in digital tools are providing BlackRock the biggest competitive advantages in our clients? And also, when you take a step back and look at your major competitors in financial services and firms that also have the ETF businesses like the Vanguard, Schwabs, JP Morgans with digital direct-to-consumer distribution platforms, what are your thoughts in entering the wealth management space at some point? Laurence Fink : Gary? Gary Shedlin : I'll give you an update on our investments. I think, obviously, we've made a number of minority investments, Craig, which are definitely part of our capital management strategy. I think we are looking to use our balance sheet and the stable cash flow that our business generates more aggressively to basically position us to effectively learn and partner with a number of very innovative companies without necessarily having to take full control day one. I think it basically helps us add value to their business and, ultimately, derisks our strategy of ultimately having the option to combine with those companies over time where, frankly, they may benefit from their unique culture and basically our broader reach. So, today, we've basically got a number of them. Obviously, iCapital and Scalable are most well-known. Again, I think Scalable kind of expands our global advisor capabilities and what we've done with FutureAdvisor into Europe, which I think is very successful. iCapital, obviously, is more on the front end of the alternative strategy and will at some point really, whether we own it or not, will basically pair very nicely with what we're doing on an eFront-Aladdin technology combination. We've, obviously, done other things even more unique and our minority investment into Envestnet, I think, has been incredibly beneficial, not only in terms of the fact that the stock has gone up significant since we bought it, but, more importantly, it offers an opportunity to get Aladdin on the desktops of thousands and thousands of RIAs in a way that effectively helps them not only benefit their own practices, but helps distribution of our underlying asset capabilities. And then, there's a number of smaller issues, smaller companies, whether it's Embark or Acorns, again, which gives us an opportunity to learn about the evolution of distribution in a more technological way and to basically help these companies drive more value. As it relates to the issue of going direct, we have no intention of going direct. We are an intermediated model. We partner with lots of companies who distribute our products. And, frankly, all of the investments that we're making are intended to basically be beneficial to our shareholders and to clients, but, frankly, respecting the fact that we are an intermediated model going forward. Larry? Laurence Fink : And I would just say one on a more holistic basis. When I write my CEO letters, I focus on the societal changes. And we are seeing huge societal changes with more millennials and more Gen X and they are much more adept in using technology and we need to be at the forefront of helping them. I do believe the retirement crisis in America is a component of lack of financial literacy. And so, anybody \u2013 it is all our respective jobs is to use technology to improve financial literacy and improve better transparency for people who are investing. We need to take the fear out of managing of money for most people. If we could reduce that fear of management of money, I think the outcome will be leading to more people putting their money to work, and that's one of the structural problems we see in Europe and other parts of the world. And so, to me, it is only \u2013 it's going to have to be through better and more unique technology, and that is what's driving us to try to provide leading technology, Aladdin for Wealth, to create more transparency. When you think about the movement, especially on the advisor side with more and more movement toward illiquids, when you think about iCapital and then eFront, if we could provide better transparency and information on the illiquid side alongside Aladdin for Wealth, it will lead to better financial literacy towards investing in illiquids. But it will probably lead to better outcome investing for everybody. And so, when you think about how we are trying to design our technology and our technology offerings, it is all \u2013 the foundation is some of the things that I write about and how we can then take this and really build a unique position in all those societies we work in in terms of trying to provide better financial literacy, better financial outcomes. And so, that's the entire foundation of what we're trying to do. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached our allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks? Laurence Fink : I want to thank everybody for joining us this morning and for the continued interest at BlackRock. Our strong second quarter results is really linked to really these deliberate investments we've made over time. And what I've been continuously talking about, our deep partnerships we've built with clients globally, being footprinted globally by providing a deeper purpose in all the communities we operate. We see meaningful opportunities that continue to leverage our differentiating scale. BlackRock's purpose of trying to help people having and achieve better financial outcomes. We're trying to use our leverage to invest in our investments and technology capabilities for the ultimate value creation for our clients. And through the value creation for our clients is going to lead to longer-term deeper value for our shareholders going forward. Everyone, have a good summer. Hopefully, people have some time to take off and we'll talk to you in fall. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference. Christopher Meade : Good morning, everyone. I am Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that, during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So, with that, I'll turn it over to Gary. Gary Shedlin : Thanks, Chris. And good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the third quarter of 2019. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. The third quarter was once again marked by significant market volatility associated with ongoing global trade tensions and geopolitical uncertainty around the world. While US equities finished the quarter up 1%, emerging market equities ended the quarter down 5% and the US dollar continued to appreciate against the euro and pound. As we have seen in previous periods of market volatility, industry flows slowed in the quarter and clients continued to rebalance and derisk favoring fixed income and cash over equities.  Even within equities, investors demonstrated caution, shifting from momentum to value and favoring high dividend and low volatility funds. BlackRock's business model, however, continues to work as well as it ever has. Over the last 12 months, we have generated approximately $350 billion or 5% total organic growth.  Our fully integrated One BlackRock business model was purposely built to bring together the entire firm to meet client needs in today's evolving ecosystem. Our globally diverse investment and technology platform, including our risk management and portfolio construction tools, is positioned to deliver not simply products, but comprehensive solutions to clients no matter the market environment. We remain focused on thoughtfully investing in our business for the long-term and capturing growth in areas of highest client demand. These include iShares, especially higher growth and higher fee segments like factors, fixed income, sustainable, and megatrend ETFs, illiquid alternatives, and technology where we continue to evolve Aladdin's multi-asset analytics and portfolio construction capabilities. These investments will position BlackRock to continue delivering higher and more consistent organic revenue growth across market cycles. BlackRock generated $84 billion in total net inflows in the third quarter or 5% annualized organic asset growth, driven by continued momentum from our industry-leading fixed income and cash businesses. Total annualized organic base fee growth of 3% reflected this mix shift toward lower fee products, but was also impacted by volatility driven outflows from higher fee market-driven iShares ETFs in August. In particular, EEM, our flagship emerging markets ETF, saw $6 billion of outflows during the quarter. Third quarter revenue of $3.7 billion increased 3% year-over-year and operating income of $1.5 billion rose by 7%. Earnings per share of $7.15 were down 5% compared to a year ago, however , as higher operating income and a lower diluted share count were offset by lower non-operating results and a higher effective tax rate in the current quarter. Non-operating results reflected $7 million of net investment loss, primarily driven by the mark-to-market valuation of our minority stake in Envestnet. Recall that non-operating results in the year ago reflected a $40 million gain attributable to the disposition of our equity interest in DSP. Non-operating results versus a year ago also reflected additional interest expense associated with BlackRock's mid-April debt issuance to partially finance the eFront acquisition. Our as adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 23% compared to 16% a year ago, which reflected $90 million of discrete benefits. We estimate 23% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the fourth quarter of 2019, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of non-recurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on tax legislation. Third quarter base fees of $3 billion were up 3% year-over-year, primarily driven by organic growth, the positive impact of market beta and acquisitions, partially offset by the negative impacts of foreign exchange and strategic pricing investments and lower securities lending revenue. Dollar appreciation over the last year had a negative 1% impact on our year-over-year base fee growth, while lower cash spreads led to a 6% year-over-year decline in securities lending revenue. As previously mentioned, BlackRock's differentiated platform has generated total organic asset growth of almost $350 billion over the last 12 months. But divergent beta and mix change, items that we can't control, continue to impact our absolute level of base fee growth as compared to growth in average AUM. While the S&P 500 was up 4% on average year-over-year, the BlackRock revenue weighted equity index was actually down 1% as markets linked to our higher fee equity products in Europe, Asia-Pacific, the emerging markets, and natural resources were flat to down 8%.  In addition, in the recent market environment, clients' preferences has favored lower risk assets and approximately 85% to our organic growth over the last year has been in fixed income and cash, which have relatively lower fees compared to other asset classes. While base fees were up 3% sequentially, as a result of higher average AUM and the effect of one additional day in the quarter, on an equivalent day count basis, our overall fee rate declined 0.4 basis points versus the second quarter, reflecting this ongoing impact of mix shift and divergent beta. Performance fees of $121 million decreased $30 million year-over-year, reflecting lower fees from alternative and long-only equity products. Sequentially, performance fees increase as a result of a single European hedge fund that locks annually in the third quarter and once again delivered strong performance over the last 12 months. Quarterly, technology services revenue increased 30% year-over-year, reflecting the impact of the eFront acquisition and continued growth in Aladdin.  Demand remains strong for our full range of technology solutions and digital distribution tools. Total expense was up 1% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher compensation expense and expense linked to the eFront acquisition, offset by lower G&A and direct fund expense.  G&A expense was down $29 million from a year ago, primarily due to lower transaction related and foreign-exchange remeasurement expense, partially offset by higher technology expense in the current quarter. Sequentially, G&A expense was down $86 million, primarily due to $59 million of product launch costs incurred in the second quarter and lower contingent consideration fair value adjustments and foreign-exchange remeasurement expense in the current quarter. Consistent with prior years, our fourth-quarter G&A spend will be seasonally higher than the first three quarters of the year. At present, after adjusting for the acquisition of eFront, we anticipate that our full-year core G&A spend will be generally in line with the full-year guidance we provided in January. As a reminder, core G&A expense excludes the impact of product launch costs, contingent consideration fair value adjustments, foreign-exchange remeasurement expense and transaction-related fees. Direct fund expense was down 4% year-over-year and 5% sequentially, despite higher average AUM due to a benefit recognized in the current quarter. We would expect direct fund expense to return to a more normalized level in the fourth quarter. Intangible amortization expense was up $15 million year-over-year, reflecting a full quarter of intangible asset amortization related to the eFront acquisition. Our third quarter as adjusted operating margin of 46% was up 180 basis points from a year ago, reflecting significantly lower levels of non-core G&A expense in the current quarter. Ongoing market volatility is contributing to increased beta divergence and client preference for fixed income and cash, leading to a more challenging industrywide revenue capture environment. However, BlackRock's differentiated business model, financial position, and strategic alignment with high growth opportunities allows us to continue investing responsibly for the long-term. Our capital management strategy is specifically designed to support this Invest First ideology and then return excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. During the first quarter, we completed our targeted level of share repurchases for 2019, repurchasing $1.6 billion worth of common shares and stated that we would be opportunistic with respect to repurchasing additional shares during the remainder of the year. In line with that commitment, we repurchased an additional $100 million worth of common shares during the third quarter, taking advantage of attractive relative valuation opportunities that arose during August's market volatility.Quarterly net inflows of $84 billion benefitted from continued strong demand for iShares, alternatives, fixed income and cash, reflecting BlackRock's unique ability to meet client needs in a variety of market environments. iShares ETFs are unique in having a broadly diversified set of products that serve both long-term buy-and-hold wealth investors and institutional asset owners, as well as tactically-oriented institutional investors who value secondary market liquidity and the vibrant options ecosystem. iShares net inflows of $42 billion, representing 8% annualized organic asset growth, reflected continued momentum in fixed income, factor and sustainable ETFs, each a market segment that has strong long-term growth potential and a higher fee relative to BlackRock's total fee rate. Quarterly fixed income ETF flows of $24 billion was driven by clients' ongoing adoption of these products as a critical component of their portfolios. Factor and sustainable ETFs generated $13 billion of quarterly flows as investor demand for these exposures, especially in the US and Europe, increased in the current environment. BlackRock is the industry leader in all three of these fast-growing categories. Retail net inflows of $7 billion reflected broad-based strength in active fixed income, partially offset by outflows from multi-asset world allocation products. BlackRock's US wealth advisory franchise continues to gain share and has seen year-to-date organic growth of 8% in alpha funds and SMAs, while the industry as a whole remains flat. Institutional and retail demand for alternatives continued, with $3.5 billion of net inflows into illiquid and liquid alternative strategies in the third quarter, driven by real estate, private credit, infrastructure and event-driven hedge funds. In addition, we have approximately $22 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of alternative strategies, representing a significant source of future base and performance fees. BlackRock's institutional franchise generated approximately $4 billion of net inflows in the quarter. Positive institutional index flows, driven by continued strength in LDI, more than offset approximately $4 billion of institutional active outflows in the quarter which were primarily due to several client-specific active fixed-income redemptions. Net inflows into higher fee quantitative active equities and alternative strategies resulted in overall positive institutional organic base fee growth for the quarter. Finally, BlackRock's cash management platform saw $32 billion of net inflows, a post-financial crisis record and crossed the $500 billion AUM threshold as we continue to leverage scale for clients and deliver innovative digital distribution and risk management solutions through cash matrix and Aladdin. Cash is a strategic asset class and BlackRock's diverse cash management offering, including prime, ESG, government and munis, position us well to serve our clients' cash needs and continue to grow our market share. In summary, our third quarter results once again demonstrate the resilience of our globally diversified investment and technology platform to drive consistent and differentiated organic growth in a variety of market environments. Our focus remains on delivering the solutions our clients need to achieve their long-term investment objectives. We can't control market volatility or the impact it may have on our revenue capture quarter to quarter, but we can ensure that we meet the needs of our clients by generating exceptional risk-adjusted performance across all of our investment products. We continue to leverage our competitive positioning and the stability of our financial model to invest responsibly in high-growth areas such as ETFs, alternatives and technology that are critically important to clients and shareholders alike. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry. Laurence Fink : Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. More than ever before, clients are looking for asset manager partners who understand their whole portfolio and investment goals. They want partners who can provide insight in the context of a complex and changing investment landscape. And rather than just sell products, they're looking for asset managers who can deliver solutions that meet their financial objectives. In the third quarter, a number of macroeconomic and geopolitical events drove global market volatility and heightened investor uncertainty. BlackRock's differentiated model continues to generate strong results.  By always looking ahead to recognizing unmet client needs, we have positioned BlackRock with the diversity, scale and global full portfolio perspective to help our clients navigate their investments in all market environments. As Gary mentioned, we generated $84 billion of total net inflows, showing strength in many areas across the combined active and indexed platforms. We increased revenues by 3% and operating income by 7% year-over-year. During the third quarter, geopolitics were once again a primary driver of markets, impacting investor sentiment. Global market index sold off, had a tumultuous August as the US treasury yield curve inverted and trade tensions escalated. However, markets reversed course in September. And following a significant rotation out of momentum stocks and into value that had been building over the last year, US markets achieved their greatest year-to-date gains in more than two decades and averaged 3% higher sequentially in the third quarter. Meanwhile, even with a partial recovery in September, emerging market indexes averaged 3% lower for the quarter, a 6% divergence in these markets. Fixed income, the low and negative interest rate environment persists. In an effort to extend the economic expansion, we're seeing unprecedented synchronized signs of intervention by central banks globally. For the first time since the financial market, the Fed announced that they would add liquidity into the system after a brief spike in short-term repo rates signaled liquidity constraints, or maybe supply issues. Meanwhile, in Europe, the ECB announced they would restart their asset purchase program to support their inflation targets. The simultaneous rise in historical safe assets alongside riskier equities in the third quarter highlights investors' uncertainty about the global economy, the state of trade negotiations and the Federal Reserve's path of monitoring easing. In this unprecedented environment and faster than any time since the financial crisis, clients are transforming what they demand from asset managers. They demand transparency, value, convenience, higher returns and better outcomes. They want a global perspective, an insight, from partners they trust. BlackRock is uniquely positioned to meet those client needs. Our combination of active, index, factors, cash and alternatives, powered by our industry-leading portfolio construction and risk management technology, enables us to take a whole portfolio approach and is resonating with clients more than ever before. The value of our differentiating model we have built is increasing as we make the most of BlackRock's capabilities, from the asset management to risk analytics to ESG solutions through partnerships and strategic advice. One recent example of how we bring the best of BlackRock together for clients is our strategic partnership with Rabobank in the Netherlands. We are providing an innovative solution consisting of a custom set of funds that combine technology, data and investment and risk management tools through Aladdin that benefits the needs of Rabobank's clients for transparency and value. We also recently published our eighth global insurance report which includes BlackRock's analysis of key findings from our survey of 360 insurance companies in 25 countries, representing more than $16 trillion in assets.  Insurers are increasingly focused on building portfolio resilience through diversification and better portfolio construction. They want to optimize fixed income, integrate private markets and increase sustainable investing, themes which we see more broadly across our client base. BlackRock has the insights, the technology, the whole portfolio context to help our insurance clients understand practical actions that they could take to address their needs, and we have the breadth in solutions that they are seeking. Our ability to be a valued partner is the direct result of the investments we have made to stay ahead of our clients' needs and innovative across our platform. Our innovations across illiquid alternatives, fixed income ETFs, factors. sustainable investments, cash and much more are driving our inflows.  Clients have entrusted us to manage $350 billion of new assets over the last 12 months alone, representing 5% organic growth rates. And as clients re-risk out of cash into fixed income, BlackRock will participate and benefit by virtue of our solution-based approach. We have even more opportunity for BlackRock going forward and continue to invest in the highest growth areas for the future \u2013 iShares, illiquid alternatives and technology. In iShares, we've doubled our asses from $1 trillion five years ago to more than $2 trillion today. We believe the ETF industry itself can double over the next five years and we're investing to support the growth of the industry and maintain BlackRock's leadership. The movement by independent financial advisors and direct platforms in the US to eliminate transaction costs is increasing accessibility to investing for more and more people and we believe will accelerate ETF adoption. The elimination of barriers to investing is a good thing. It democratizes access and enables more people to save, invest and reach their long-term financial objectives. With the commission free moves, we now have access to more clients than ever before and we remain confident that iShare value proposition will continue to drive growth and BlackRock iShares market leadership. iShares generated $42 billion of net inflows in the quarter, led by strong growth in fixed income, factors, core and European ETFs. We once again captured the number one market share in ETF flows globally, in Europe in the high-growth categories including fixed income, factors, sustainable ETFs. iShares is not just one, but rather several product segments \u2013 core, fixed income, factors, sustainable, megatrends and precision ETFs, each with a range of different ways that different clients are using them. For these segments, fixed income, factors, sustainable and megatrends, represent more than $600 billion of AUM today and have generated more than 20% annual organic asset growth on average over the last five years and have a higher average fee rate than BlackRock's overall business. Demand remains exceptionally strong for fixed-income ETFs where iShares is the market leader. We captured $24 billion of net inflows in the quarter and a record $87 billion already year-to-date as client demand for fixed-income exposures accelerated, including from other asset managers. Growth is coming from the adoption of ETFs as replacement for individual bonds and individual sources of liquidity and transparency during times of market stress. Fixed-income ETFs have also been utilized by more and more fixed income investors for active purposes, using ETFs as a mechanism to get active returns. We are also increasingly seeing clients adapt shorter duration fixed-income ETFs as a substitute for cash in their portfolios. And now with commission free, this proposition is even stronger for cash substitutes. Fixed income ETFs are a technology that is accelerating and will definitely modernize the global bond market. We are the industry leader in factors and our factor iShares have more than tripled in assets over the last five years from $44 billion to $161 billion in AUM today, including over a 25% annual organic growth rate on average. Year-to-date, we captured the number one share of factor flows, surpassing nine ETF factor players as well. We see increased adoption in model portfolios and from RIAs as wealth clients look for a high-value factor exposure that support resilience and defensive positioning in their portfolios. Demand is also coming from European clients looking for greater value than traditional active and better returns than traditional indexes. Sustainable ETFs are a strategic segment that while relatively small today at $40 billion in industry AUM we believe can grow to $400 billion over the next decade as more clients look for strategies that target a measurable ESG impact in financial returns. iShares sustainable ETFs represent $16 billion in assets, up from $1 billion five years ago. We have generated more inflows in sustainable ETFs than any other manager this year and have four out of the industry's five largest sustainable ETFs. Client demand for sustainable investment solutions extends way beyond our iShares business. Shifts in demographic and investment conviction are driving increased interest in sustainable investing globally and these forces are likely to accelerate. BlackRock is committed to providing clients with choice across the investment spectrum that aligns with their investment goals. We currently manage over $65 billion in dedicated sustainable investment funds, an additional $500 billion of accounts that apply exclusionary screens. We are integrating ESG data, ESG tools, ESG research insights to support our investment teams in every asset class, so all teams, active and passive, can incorporate material ESG data into their process with the idea of enhancing risk-adjusted returns. I've spoken in the past about using technology to drive more BlackRock's revenues. Technology is a priority and a strategic differentiator for BlackRock. In addition to generating direct technology revenues, we're increasingly using technology to enhance our results in our asset management business. For example, we're transforming our cash management business by integrating technology into our business model. We are delivering cash matrix technology to help clients streamline their operations and quickly and efficiently make more informed decisions. Five years ago, cash management was $281 billion business. Through technology, organic growth and acquisition, we crossed $500 billion in AUM July. This represents over a 200 basis point global market share increase from five years ago and is an important milestone as scale is a key value proposition for clients in the asset class. Increasingly more and more BlackRock holistic client relations are starting through a cash management assignment. Illiquid alternatives is another area where we're innovating to scale our business, expand our platform and integrate technology into a business model and momentum is increasing.  Including net inflows and commitments, we raised over $5 billion in illiquid alternatives in the third quarter, led by real assets in private credit. We have raised a total of $46 billion in the last three years and nearly doubled our illiquid alternative platform to $92 billion in AUM and dry powder today. Demand for private markets remain strong as clients seek longer duration, higher returns and eFront further strengthens our illiquid alternatives and will support growth over time. Our direct technology service revenues grew 30% year-over-year as more clients are looking for holistic and flexible technology solutions to operate their businesses more effectively and more efficiently. For institutions, Aladdin is an enterprise investment and risk management systems that power the entire investment process on one single platform. What truly differentiates BlackRock is its user/provider business model, its ability to provide integrated, multi-asset capabilities throughout the entire investment process, from sophisticated portfolio analytics and construction to trade execution to compliance and to investment operations. The combination of eFront with Aladdin further reinforces Aladdin's value proposition as the most comprehensive investment operating system in the world.  Aladdin is also a powerful solution for customers and custodians who service their assets through Aladdin providers, as well for wealth managers who need to offer transparency and convenience to their own clients through Aladdin Wealth. We now have 13 clients using Aladdin Wealth and expect to further growth to come from our expansion into different wealth segments and markets around the world. Aladdin is increasingly the language of portfolio construction for wealth managers.  Understanding and managing risk is critical to helping clients achieve the financial outcomes consistent with the intended objectives and risk preferences. We're also seeing more and more clients use Aladdin Wealth as a business enabler, to grow their business in a differentiated way in the markets, using it to have client-centric, portfolio-based conversations that enhance their dialogue with their clients. We're strong momentum going forward as industry consolidation, shifting product usage and regulations are increasing the need for a more holistic and flexible, technology-driven solution at both institutions and wealth managers. BlackRock is well positioned to capitalize on these trends and is committed to enhancing our technology capabilities to continue to meet our clients' needs and their future needs. In a world where the merits of globalization are being challenged by so many, BlackRock has and will continue to be a global company. We have a global footprint with employees in over 30 countries, with clients in more than 100 countries. And we are making a global impact, working to improve issues such as retirement in every country where we operate.  This focus on using our expertise in high-growth regions around the world positions BlackRock to both drive increased flows and fulfill BlackRock's purpose of helping more and more people experience financial well-being. We recently crossed the 20th anniversary of BlackRock's IPO. On October 1, 1999, BlackRock listed on the New York Stock Exchange for $14 a share. Today, we're trading around $434 per share, representing a 19% compounded annual growth rate for our shareholders. As market changes and as our clients expect more from us, we stay true to the innovative instincts that has defined BlackRock and enabled the strong results we are seeing today.  We at BlackRock will continue to evolve, we will continue to innovate, we will continue to stay in front of our clients to meet our clients' needs, while reinforcing our key strategic differentiators. Our global scale and reach, a culture centered on client needs, a global voice heard around the world and a One BlackRock approach to delivering for clients. With that, I'll open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question. Laurence Fink : Good morning, Craig. Craig Siegenthaler : Hey. Good morning, Larry. I wanted to get your perspective on how the commission cuts over the last two weeks at the e-brokers will impact both distribution and also the overall competitive dynamics on these US e-broker platforms. And also, any impact as we think about either flows or the underlying economics still? Laurence Fink : I'm going to let Rob Kapito answer that question, but if you could see my face, I'm smiling at the opportunities. Robert Kapito : So, Craig, the commission-free trends have been very positive for iShares. And as Larry mentioned in his opening remarks, the elimination of barriers to investing simply means that more and more investors are going to have the ability to use ETFs. And as the ETF market leader, this has got to be good for BlackRock. More clients than ever before have access to the value and quality of iShares funds to hopefully achieve their investment goals. So, commission-free trading is actually accelerating ETF flows in the two fastest growing US wealth channels. One is the US RIA and that represents a $5 trillion market that has grown at a 10% compound annual growth rate. The other area is the US direct investors, and they represent $7.5 trillion in market that has grown at a 10% compound annual growth rate. So, our share on the e-broker platform has expanded since the commission-free trends began, and these segments are becoming a larger growth engine for BlackRock overall. So, we're confident this will increase the number of investors using iShares as an essential part of their portfolios, and with our focus on quality exposures at very good value, we think that we will continue to lead the industry. As you know, global iShares generated $42 billion of net inflows, representing 8% annualized organic asset growth, and these flows were driven by growth in fixed income, core, factor, and sustainable ETFs. So, just to reiterate, because this is important, fixed income ETFs are a technology, and they're accelerating the modernization of bond markets and had a very good quarter with $24 billion of net inflows led by treasuries, mortgage-backed and high-yield corporate bond funds. We are also seeing clients increasingly adapting shorter duration fixed income ETFs as a substitute for cash in their portfolios. On the factor ETFs, we saw $9 billion of net inflows as investors sought resilience in their portfolios and defensive positioning; for example, in our min vol factor ETF. The sustainable ETFs saw $4 billion of net inflows as we see increasing client demand for achieving sustainable outcomes alongside financial returns. And as Larry mentioned, iShares captured the number one market share of global, European, core, fixed income, factor, and sustainable ETF flows in the third quarter. So, this is just another way that we think is going to increase interest and demand for ETFs for our investors. Laurence Fink : I'd just add one more thing. Rob said it and I said I think in my prepared talk. Having commission free for low duration makes ETFs a great alternative to bank deposits, a really good solution towards money market funds. And so, a commission free in the fixed-income realm \u2013 cash and fixed income is a real opener for so many more participants. Operator : Your question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. Laurence Fink : Hi, Alex. Alexander Blostein : Hey, Larry. Good morning, everyone. Just building on the last question, so commission-free ETF trading accelerating growth into ETFs makes total sense. I was hoping that you guys could comment on some of the economics that could come out of this. In particular, I was curious how the payment and potential savings really from reinvestments maybe of some of the payments that you guys are currently making to some of the platforms could come through, whether or not that's a margin improvement dynamic for BlackRock or is that an area of additional spending for other platforms or lower management fees on some of the ETFs? So, maybe you could help us kind of flesh out the economics a little bit better. Thanks. Laurence Fink : So, let me just say one thing. Our relationship with Fidelity, as I kind of alluded to it, is as strong as ever. Our relationship is way beyond ETFs. It's about education. It's about working with their platform. And so, our relationship with Fidelity is unchanged, if that's what you're trying to allude to, related to what we pay them and other things. We have a great relation with Fidelity. We have great opportunities looking forward with them too. And I'll let Rob \u2013 go ahead. Robert Kapito : And we have other distribution agreements. They're not impacted by this. It really just simply gives us more access, and since we are already a very known commodity to these distribution groups, this really only enhances it, and it really is not impacting the fees that we are charging on our ETFs . This is a way for our clients to get in commission free to trade, which is very important as clients have moved more away from individual stock-picking to a portfolio construction and are using ETFs as a major tool in that portfolio construction. So, getting into it is where they're saving the money. It's not really impacting our fees. Maybe Gary wants to add to that. Gary Shedlin : I think you guys both got it. I don't think there's any question this is a great outcome for well-branded, scaled ETF providers. And we're going to continue to prosecute our strategy as we ever have. But I don't see that there's any impact on our pricing structure as it relates to ETFs from this move. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America. You may ask your question. Laurence Fink : Good morning, Michael. Michael Carrier : Good morning, Larry. Just given the strength in alternative flows this quarter, I wanted to get your view on the outlook and how you're positioned to grow, given rising allocations in the private markets. Maybe some of the near-term challenges we're seeing with private companies looking to go public. Laurence Fink : Well, I think on one segment, private companies are having problems. And that's more growth-oriented, technology companies that are having problems going public. I don't see the overall market is in much trouble. But related to BlackRock and alternatives, as we said for a number of years now, alternatives is a strategic priority for BlackRock. We're now up to $126 billion in liquid and illiquid strategies. We manage now $71 billion of illiquid AUM across infrastructure, real estate, private credit and now LTPC. We raised $5 billion the last quarter between commitments and wins. And we raised over the last three years $46 billion, doubling our AUM in the category. I also believe, and this is one of the fundamental reasons why we think technology connects and helps us in flows, our acquisition in eFront, obviously, it's going to make the Aladdin system even more robust which I talked about, but eFront also gives us a greater ability to penetrate in terms of illiquid alternative sales. And so, we truly believe there is a deeper connection between what we're doing in technology and then the illiquid alternatives. And this is consistent with all our \u2013 with the entire BlackRock platform. We have consistently differentiated ourselves in the fixed-income universe for now 30-odd years by having risk technology. After the BGI transaction, we added all of the sleeves of technology for equities and that became a bigger component of what we're doing. And now, through the eFront acquisition. It really does help us having a unique perspective and a unique ability to integrate what we're trying to do in terms of illiquid alternatives. So, you're correct in saying, we're seeing more and more utilization of alternatives as an asset category. We know many clients are moving from 10% to 12%. Some clients are moving to 12% to 18% in terms of allocation. But there are also areas within the illiquid area that, in some markets, the valuations are fully priced too. And so, I don't think it's a perfect scenario. The area we believe and where we have a unique emphasis on \u2013 where I believe, over the next 5 to 10 years, we're going to see an expansion, that will be in the infrastructure side. We believe infrastructure is going to be a bigger and bigger component of both public and private, like we did in Abu Dhabi, but we see many, many opportunities like we did in Mexico a few years back. So, we believe that there's going to be \u2013 firstly, there's great client demand for the product and the key is finding the strong supply. And I do believe more and more entities, more and more players are looking to do this. I would also just say, we are one of the leaders in renewable energy. The cost now to put up solar fields, it produces electricity at or cheaper than natural gas. As a leader in renewable energy, this is going to be a major component of our future. Part of our flows was in a renewable energy fund. We just raised another big block. We're about to close the final raise of that fund. So, overall, it's a major component of how we're evolving our organization and we're very excited about the dialogues we're having with more clients. Operator : Your next question comes from Bill Katz with Citi. You may ask your question. Laurence Fink : Hey, Bill. William Katz : Good morning, everybody. Thank you for taking the questions. So, maybe a two-part question if I could. I guess, the first part of it is, as you think about your spending outlook into the new year, you highlighted three different areas \u2013 alternatives, technology and passive \u2013 where are you in the respective growth cycles as you sort of think about year-on-year increase?  And then, secondly, Gary, you mentioned that you step into the stock in August when you thought about relative value. Can you sort of clarify, when you say relative value, how are you thinking about that, what would be the multiples to the group to the market? I'm sort of curious of your \u2013 at present to which you're seeing that opportunity. Laurence Fink : Sure, Bill. So, in terms of your spending question, was it a question as we're thinking about the New Year, is that how you're thinking about it? Christopher Meade : He can't answer that. Gary Shedlin : Okay. Well, I'll just assume it's a question. So, yeah. I think \u2013 look, we're, obviously, very mindful that we're in a market environment that makes predicting beta or counting on beta in a lower return world, given where volatility is, getting where divergent beta is, where fixed income markets are more complicated. So, we are obviously more aware than ever that we need to basically continue to invest in our major engines of growth. We highlighted alternatives. We highlighted technology. We highlighted ETFs. There's obviously much more beyond that, but those are the three that are incredibly critical priorities for the year and we are going to seek to get as much investment dollars into those businesses as we can going forward, which means, given our commitment to continue to be margin aware that we're going to reallocate as aggressively as we can to make sure that we are being mindful of both margin and long-term value creation for our shareholders.  In terms of the second question, which was \u2013 what was the second part of the question? Oh, the capital return. Thank you. In terms of capital return, I think you mentioned a number of them. We look at value relative to our peers. We look at value relative to the market overall. We look at value relative to what we believe our growth prospects are and we're constantly trying to basically see where we think it makes sense just given some of the \u2013 the market goes down and sell asset manager mentality comes from, where were we think there's some of valuation opportunities that make sense for our shareholders going forward. So, we look at all three investments. Absolutely relative. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. Laurence Fink : Hi, Mike. Michael Cyprys : Hey. Good morning. Hey, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to dig in a little bit more on low and negative rates. With rates so low and going lower across the world and negative rates in some parts, I guess as we look out over the next couple of years, how do you see that impacting the asset management industry just in terms of how you're managing the business, how you structure portfolios, the impact this could have to fees and asset allocations as well.  And just maybe a second part related to the asset allocation, we've seen a lot of flows into fixed income, but with rates so low, at what point do you see an influx of flows into equities, just given return rates are so low? What's the catalyst for equity inflows? Laurence Fink : Let me just start off. We built the model of BlackRock really to be able to work with our clients in risk-on, risk-off environments, low vol, high vol, and the key is working on their long-term solutions. And all the ins and outs of markets, let's be clear, it's on the margin for most investors. It's not big giant changes. They may reallocate 4%, 5%, 6% of their portfolio and navigate around that. At the same time, much of the flows, maybe they're outsourcing more and more of their portfolio. They may be looking for \u2013 they may be consolidating managers. But I'd say the most important thing that \u2013 how we've designed the organization is to make sure that we have the diversity in the platform, so we could be the best we can as a solution provider to our clients. The other thing that we're try to drive is making sure that not one asset class drives our business.  And so, in answering your question about low or negative interest rates, it appears they're going to be with us longer than I think we all expected at the beginning of the year. And with that, I think client trends have been to move still to de-risking until they have some sign as to where they should navigate.  At the same time, clients on the margin are still as a de-risk in some categories. They're looking to put some of that money to work in higher risk or less liquid strategies like illiquid alternatives to try to get as much return as they possibly can. As I said in an earlier conversation that there are some areas that look rich to us already in the private area, but there are a lot of opportunities in other areas. I don't see persistence in low rates being a major cause for clients looking for lower fees. In fact, 2019, I would not qualify as a year of massive fee pressure. But when clients are looking to do big, giant restructurings or are looking to do major reallocation out of many managers into one manager, they're certainly looking for fee reductions if you're able to have a majority of those assets. So, you offer that type of scale and it doesn't really impact our margins as much.  But I don't know that it really matters for us where are clients going, when do they pivot back into equities. We're not seeing any indication at the moment that clients are asking more and more questions about when do they jump back in. As I said, I think we get \u2013 clients are heavily in equities now. What we see every quarter is marginal changes in their portfolio allocation. It's not dramatic changes.  Rob, did you want to add\u2026? Robert Kapito : Yeah, I was going to say, and dovetailing a report that you did, Michael, that we read that was very good, our survey shows something very similar that clients are not adding into their equity portfolios. They're using that portion to go into alternatives. And it's getting back to the original barbell trade where they're using short-term fixed income, so that they're keeping the risk the same and then allocating more to alternatives. Actually, I think this is a benefit for us for two reasons. One, in portfolio construction, they need to use the cheapest products and we are offering the passive and the ETFs which are growing in that way. Two, we are also offering the alternatives. But, three, more importantly, is sourcing assets. And it's become very difficult for clients to source assets by themselves and, therefore, they're putting out more money for people that can actually find these particular assets, which dovetails into what Larry is saying, into new asset classes being real assets like infrastructure and others which they would have a very difficult time sourcing themselves. So, it's actually fitting in to the strategy that we have, both having the passive and lower-priced product and now offering the higher-priced source assets, whether it be private credit which you saw grew dramatically last quarter here and the real asset and other alternatives which we agree with you are going to continue to grow. Operator : Your next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. You may ask your question. Laurence Fink : Good morning, Patrick. Patrick Davitt : Hey. Good morning, guys. Could you dig in a bit more on the client-specific institutional bond outflows against what still looks like pretty robust flows broadly? And through that lens, are you still seeing a big institutional mandate pipeline, I guess, outsourcing the bond management capability like we talked about last quarter? Gary Shedlin : Sure, Patrick. It's Gary. So, again, if you think about some of the trends that we've had, we've talked about during the year, I think we've seen broad-based strong performance and flows in our active fixed income business. That's come from a combination of some of the market environment that we've talked about, but also really strong performance across the platform, candidly. If you recall last quarter, we called out a number of very significant large, strategic client wins and we actually had about $65 billion of positive flows in the second quarter. This quarter, we had a couple of clients that went the other way and we had, I think, in the average [ph] about $7 billion of outflows in the quarter. Again, I would call those more client-specific, lumpy redemptions. But it's hard to look at this in any three-month period of time. I think, more broadly, you need to look at the longer-term trend. And on a trailing 12-month basis, we're running right now at about $55 billion of active fixed income inflows, which is representative of about 7% organic asset growth rate. So, I think we will have timing issues, but the clear trend here is very positive in terms of the strategic positioning of this business. Operator : Your final question comes from Kent Worthington with JP Morgan. You may ask your question. Laurence Fink : Hey, Ken. Kenneth Worthington : Hi. Good morning. Thank you for squeezing me in. One follow-up on the earlier questions on e-brokerage. Do you think the move to zero commissions in e-brokerage might impact pricing in the wealth management industry more broadly, either in full service brokerage or advisory where pricing seems to have been pretty resilient thus far? And if so, are there opportunities for BlackRock to adjust its approach to distribution in the wealth management industry? You highlighted cash ETFs and e-brokerage, are there similar examples sort of for change in wealth management? Thank you. Laurence Fink : There's no question, the resiliency of the overall fees for wealth management is pretty inelastic so far. We're starting to see some of the e-brokers charge much lower fees than the traditional wealth management platforms in terms of the overall advisory fee. But, unquestionably, when commissions are free, the investor is going to have to make a choice. Is the value proposition of having that advice worthwhile versus having a commission to your relationship? And every client is going to have to make that assertion.  But I do believe, just like we've seen in ETFs, we see now in e-brokerage, there is more and more fee pressure across different segments of financial services. Quite frankly, through technology, distribution is a better connection too. So, I believe where we are going to benefit, with the evolution of what's going on in wealth, though, is models and portfolio construction. And I do believe a portion of that is going to be factors and ESG. I think those will be the added products like we said how cash and short-term duration bonds will be lifted by that. But we also believe the utilization of models and portfolio constructions is going to be a major component of that value proposition for advice. And through that advice, we are absolutely confident that factors and ESG will play a larger role and it will accelerate adaption of those products. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks? Laurence Fink : I'd just like to thank all of you for joining this morning and for your great questions and your continued interest in BlackRock. Our third quarter results are directly linked to our deliberate investments we made over time, but, more importantly, our results speak loudly about the deep partnerships we're making globally with our clients. I said it time and time again, clients are looking for solutions. They're not looking for an asset manager who's talking about a product. Clients are looking for asset managers who are helping them with their purpose, not the asset manager's purpose. The client is looking for organizations that can help them in risk-off periods, in periods of risk-on. And I believe if you look at our $350 billion of flows over the last 12 months, our model is working. And we are continuing to be excited about the opportunities we have for BlackRock in the future. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you, Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference. Chris Meade : Good morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may of course differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So with that, I'll turn it over to Gary. Gary Shedlin : Thanks, Chris. Good morning and Happy New Year to everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to present results for the fourth quarter and full year 2019. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I will review our financial performance and business results. Our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as adjusted financial results, and I will be focusing primarily on our as adjusted results. For many years, BlackRock\u2019s differentiated globally integrated asset management and technology business, including our risk management and portfolio construction tools, has proven its ability to deliver for clients and shareholders in different market environments, and that continued in 2019. A difficult fourth quarter of 2018 created a challenging start to the year, but as we noted a year ago volatile market environments create opportunities for growth at BlackRock as long as we remain disciplined to continue playing offense. BlackRock achieved both revenue and earnings growth during 2019. Investment performance across our active products was excellent with 86%, 76%, and 84% in taxable fixed income, fundamental and systematic active equity assets respectively above benchmark or peer median for the trailing 3-year period. We generated record net inflows of $429 billion, representing 7% organic asset growth and 5% organic base fee growth, enabling us to once again beat our aspirational organic growth target for the fifth time in the last seven years. And we finished the year with strong momentum reporting over $129 billion in total flows in the fourth quarter. The financial strength and stability of our operating model allows us to continuously invest through market cycles and capture growth in areas of highest client demand by technology, illiquid alternatives and iShares, especially higher growth strategic ETF segments such as factors, fixed income sustainable and megatrends. These investments position BlackRock to offer clients not simply products but comprehensive whole portfolio solutions and to generate consistent long-term growth for shareholders. Full year revenue of $14.5 billion was up 2%, while operating income of $5.6 billion increased marginally. Earnings per share of $28.48 was up 6% versus 2018. For the fourth quarter, BlackRock generated revenue of $4 billion and operating income of $1.5 billion, up 16% and 17% respectively from a year ago, when results were impacted by significant market volatility. Quarterly earnings per share of $8.34 was up 37% versus 2018, also reflecting higher non-operating income, a lower effective tax rate, and reduced diluted share count in the current quarter. Non-operating results for the quarter reflected $85 million of net investment income, primarily driven by the mark-to-market valuation of our minority stake in Envestnet and higher marks on unhedged seed capital investments. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 18%, driven in part by discrete benefits linked to additional guidance on U.S. tax reform. We currently estimate that 23% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for 2020. The actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of non-recurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on recently enacted tax legislation. Fourth quarter base fees of $3.1 billion were up $310 million year-over-year primarily driven by the positive impact of market beta, organic growth, and higher securities lending revenue partially offset by certain strategic pricing investments. Year-over-year quarterly base fee growth of 11% lagged growth of average AUM of 16%, however, due to the ongoing impact of divergent equity beta and client preference for lower risk fixed income and cash assets in 2019. In addition, while fourth quarter base fees were up 4% sequentially, our overall fee rate declined 0.1 basis points versus the third quarter. Full year base fees ended up 2% notwithstanding the impact of a significant global equity market decline in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. As a reminder, we entered 2019 with an annualized base fee run rate approximately 6% lower than 2018. Fourth quarter performance fees of $239 million more than doubled versus a year ago collecting strong alpha generation from liquid and illiquid alternative products. Full year performance fees of $450 million were up 9% compared to 2018, despite a significant number of liquid alternative products entering the year below their high watermarks. Importantly, recognized performance fees from illiquid alternatives were up significantly in 2019 and represented approximately 30% of total performance fees for the year. Quarterly technology services revenue increased 35% year-over-year and full year revenue of $974 million increased 24%, reflecting the impact of the eFront acquisition and continued growth in Aladdin. Excluding eFront, technology services revenue grew 12% for the full year and we continue to target low to mid-teens growth going forward. Demand remains strong for our full range of technology solutions and digital distribution tools including institutional Aladdin, eFront, and Aladdin Wealth. Fourth quarter advisory and other revenue increased 30% year-over-year reflecting higher transition management and advisory assignments. Total expense increased 4% in 2019, driven primarily by higher compensation and G&A expense and the acquisition of eFront. For the full year, compensation expense increased $164 million or 4% primarily reflecting higher headcount, higher performance fees, and higher deferred compensation expense. Our full year comp-to-revenue ratio of 34.8% was moderately higher than 2018 as a result of the mark-to-market impact of certain deferred compensation programs in 2019 and the full year impact of retention awards related to recent acquisition activity. Recall that year-over-year comparisons of fourth quarter compensation expense are less relevant because we determine compensation on a full year basis. Fourth quarter G&A expense was up $130 million sequentially due to seasonally higher levels of marketing and promotional spend, higher technology expense, and the aggregate impact of $48 million of quarterly expense related to contingent consideration fair value adjustments and foreign exchange remeasurement. Overall, G&A expense increased 7% in 2019, reflecting higher levels of technology spend, the impact of the eFront acquisition, and $59 million of fund launch costs related to the successful second quarter close of the $1.4 billion BlackRock Science and Technology Trust II. Excluding the impact of eFront and various non-core items such as contingent consideration fair value adjustments, product launch costs, and FX remeasurement expense, we estimate that our full year core G&A spend increased 2% versus 2018. While we continually focus on managing our entire discretionary expense base, we would currently expect 2020 core G&A expense to increase approximately 5% relative to comparable 2019 levels driven by continued investment in technology and market data including sustainability initiatives and the full year impact of the eFront acquisition. Our full year as adjusted operating margin of 43.7% was down 60 basis points versus 2018 reflecting our strategic decision to continue investing responsibly in 2019 despite the more challenging overall revenue capture environment created by last year's fourth quarter market volatility. We continue to see strong performance in our future drivers of differentiated growth including ETFs, alternatives, technology and portfolio construction and remain deeply committed to investing responsibly for the long-term and optimizing growth in the most efficient way possible. And we are prudently using our balance sheet to best position BlackRock to achieve this success. During 2019, we allocated over $750 million of new seed and co-investment capital to support our growth with our investment portfolio now exceeding $3 billion for the first time. We also closed the strategic acquisition to eFront which in combination with Aladdin will provide clients with an ability to seamlessly manage portfolios and risk across public and private asset classes on the single platform. And we remain committed to systematically returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases returning an aggregate of $3.8 billion to shareholders in 2019. We repurchased approximately $1.7 billion worth of shares at an average share price of $414 per share taking advantage of attractive relative valuation opportunities that arose during the year. Since inception of our current capital management strategy in 2013, we have now repurchased approximately $8.7 billion of BlackRock stock reducing our outstanding total shares by 9% and generating an unlevered compound annual return of 14% for our shareholders. At present based on our capital spending plans for the year and subject to market conditions including the relative valuation of our stock price, we would anticipate repurchasing at least $1.2 billion of shares during 2020 consistent with our guidance a year ago. In addition and also subject to market conditions, we expect to see Board approval later this month for an increase to our first quarter 2020 dividend. BlackRock's globally diversified investment platform combined with industry leading risk management and portfolio construction technology enables us to bring together the entire firm to partner with clients in order to meet their evolving needs. Fourth quarter total net inflows of $129 billion representing 7% annualized organic AUM growth and 10% annualized organic base fee growth led by flows into strategic focus areas including iShares and illiquid alternatives. Full year flows of $429 billion were positive across active and indexed, all asset classes, client types and regions and reflected significant strength in fixed income and cash which accounted for approximately 85% of organic growth. Globalize shares generated $183 billion of net inflows for the year representing 11% organic growth. Importantly, we saw momentum into year end driven by a resurgence in equity ETFs. Fourth quarter iShares net inflows of $75 billion represented an annualized organic asset growth rate of 15%. Notably in 2019, over 80% of iShares flows were driven by strategic product segments which saw 28% organic growth. We also saw continued strength in the core segment with 15% organic growth partially offset by volatility driven outflows from precision exposure ETFs primarily in May and August. Within the higher fee strategic segment, it was a record year for fixed income ETFs where iShares is the market leader. We generated $112 billion of net inflows into iShares fixed income ETFs representing 26% organic growth. Demand remains exceptionally strong as investors seek more efficient market access, portfolio construction evolves in wealth management and technology accelerates the modernization and electronification of the bond market. We achieved the number one share of the industry factor ETF flows with $34 billion across a diverse range of factor iShares. During 2019, U.S. Min Vol or USMV was our largest and the industry's fourth highest asset gathering ETF capturing over $12 billion in net inflows. This is the first time a factor exposure outpaced every market cap weighted iShares ETF in terms of aggregate flows. iShares sustainable ETF lineup represents the fastest growing of our strategic segments generating $12 billion of net inflows and ending the year with $22 billion of AUM more than any other active or index firm. During 2019, the iShares ESG Leaders Fund raised over $1 billion representing the largest equity ETF launch in the past 15 years. BlackRock generate full year retail net inflows of $16 billion outperforming the broader active mutual fund industry. Inflows were led by our suite of active fixed income products and liquid alternatives partially offset by outflows from Multi-asset World Allocation products. Fourth quarter retail net inflows of $8 billion reflected similar trends, but also included the seasonal impact of capital gains reinvestment. BlackRock's Institutional franchise generated record long-term net inflows of $136 billion in 2019 representing 4% organic base fee growth. Institutional flows reflects strength in fixed income, liquid alternatives and multi-asset solutions. Active net inflows of $2 billion were primarily into quantitative strategies for long-term performance remained strong. Momentum in our illiquid alternatives franchise accelerated and we saw $14 billion of net inflows in 2019. We also have $24 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of alternative strategies representing a significant source of future growth and performance fees. Finally, BlackRock cash management platforms continue to increase share by leveraging scale for clients and delivering innovative digital distribution and risk management solutions. In 2019, we saw $93 billion of cash management net inflows across the platform including prime, sustainable, government and muni funds. Our innovative Liquid Environmentally Aware Fund or LEAF continues to see strong momentum with $1 billion of net inflows since launch earlier this year. In summary, our 2019 results demonstrate the resilience of our platform which allows us to invest through market cycles and drive consistent and differentiated growth in a variety of markets. Our strategy is working. We will continue to invest responsibly during 2020 including in key growth areas like iShares, alternatives and technology to deliver the solutions our clients need to best position our employees for professional growth and to generate long-term returns for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry. Larry Fink : Thank you, Gary. Good morning everyone and Happy New Year and welcome to a new decade. BlackRock has consistently and systematically invested for the future in preparation to meet clients changing needs by building a whole portfolio investment and technology platform providing thought leadership on the macro and geopolitical environment and innovating in areas like factors and sustainable investing. We are adapting to and driving change in our industry and building deeper more strategic partnerships with more clients than ever before. The benefits are our investments are evident in our results this morning. We generated a record $429 billion of total net inflows for the year representing 7% organic asset growth and 5% organic base fee growth. BlackRock's result reflects the strength of our platform which is diversified across now $2 trillion in active strategies, $5 trillion in iShares and index strategies and now over $500 billion in cash strategies. We generated $226 billion of net inflows in iShares and index, we generated $110 billion in flows in active investing and we generated $93 billion in cash strategies. Flows were positive across all client channels across all asset classes and across all regions including more than $1 billion in net inflows in each of 16 countries and in more than 71 different products. The total net new assets our clients entrusted to us in the past year equates to the level of assets under management of a top 50 global asset manager. After a dramatic fourth quarter 2018 market decline, which lowered BlackRock's AUM last year by $500 billion, we began 2019 at a challenging starting point. We entered the year with a base fee run rate that was about 6% lower than 2018 base fees. However, the successful execution of our 2019 strategy delivered revenue growth, operating income growth, earnings growth and alongside we are continuing to invest in future opportunities. 2019 was marked by heightened geopolitical and trade tensions which created volatility in financial markets, uncertainty around the U.S. and China trade negotiations, Brexit and other concerns about a slowdown in global growth all impacted investor sentiment, driving industry flows into safer fixed income and cash strategies, cash assets throughout the year. In a late cycle dovish turn by central banks globally, monetary policy proved again a powerful tool in offsetting so much of the geopolitical risk. We saw equity markets close 2019 at record highs followed by decisive U.K. elections to move forward with Brexit. And now we have a preliminary agreement on trade that will be signed today by the U.S. and China. The S&P 500 finished the year up 29% and yet emerging markets only rose 15%. 2019 also marked the year of milestones and transformations for the asset and wealth management industries. The ETF industry crossed $6 trillion in assets and iShares crossed $2 trillion. We still believe iShares in the industry are the early stages of growth. However, as clients are using iShares in many ways including as liquidity management, for hedging instruments, but also market access vehicles for central banks and to tactically access markets for Alpha managers. Increasingly, we are helping clients use iShares as an instrument of active returns and public markets. That's creating large and significant new market opportunities. Sustainability reached an inflection point with more and more clients focused on the impact on environmental, social and governance factors on their portfolios. Some to better align their investments with their values and more because of the implications of financial risk and returns related to sustainability and climate change. As I discussed in my letter to CEOs, which came out yesterday, we're entering a new era of finance, the investment risk presented by climate change are set to drive a significant reallocation of capital and companies investors and governments, we all need to be more prepared. Throughout the year BlackRock continue to invest and further differentiated our business model. We adapted to and drive change in our industry and ultimately enabled a deeper, a more comprehensive partnership with more clients than ever before. The benefits of our investments in strategic growth areas are clear. We saw strong flows in iShares, record flows and commitments in illiquid alternatives, record revenues and technology services in 2019 and active strategies where the industry faced muted flows. BlackRock generated $110 billion of net inflows and are active AUM is at an all time high. Our liquid environmentally aware fund franchise is nearing $8 billion in size less than a year after our launch. And we made significant progress to lead the industry in growth areas like OCIO, factor-based and sustainable investing and regions around the world including most recently China. iShares as the ETF market leader and generated $183 billion of net inflows for the year, 57 iShares ETFs each generated more than $1 billion of net inflows and we saw record flows in fixed income and we saw record flows in Europe. We once again captured the number one market share of 2019 in industry flows globally. Also in the United States, in Europe and in high growth segments such as fixed income ETF, factor ETFs and sustainability ETFs. We are optimistic about continued double-digit growth in iShares because we see vast new markets opening up and how clients want to use these exposures, iShares is expanding its range as a modernizing force in financial markets, nowhere is this more true than in fixed income ETFs. Fixed income ETFs will be one of the largest drivers of BlackRock's growth over the next decade. The combination of BlackRock's history as a bond manager. Our expertise in ETFs and our industry leading technology and data capabilities has created significant differentiation for iShares. After having pioneered the first fixed income ETF in 2002, iShares fixed income AUM surpassed $565 billion and generated a record $112 billion of net inflows in 2019, compared to the previous record of 2017 of $67 billion. While some of this has been as a result of a strong year in fixed income markets overall, we see this as a secular shift. We see this as a technology shift. We expect to reach a $1 trillion in fixed income iShares within the next five years and the growth path is going to be differentiated than equities. Growth in fixed income ETFs coming from the modernization of the $100 trillion bond market itself and from conversations of bond securities from institutions, central banks and even other alpha managers into ETFs. More investors than ever before have used iShares factor ETF to take active risk tapping into factors as an additional source of potential return beyond strategic asset allocation. We generated $34 billion in factor flows in 2019, significantly outpacing all other index and all other active factor providers. At the same time, we are seeing secular shifts in their regulatory and distribution landscape that is propelling more and more investors to iShares. For instance, in Europe we believe the ETF industry could double to $2 trillion over the next five years as MIFID II is driving change across a variety of business models and price transparency is focusing clients on value for money which will drive more demand for ETFs. In this region we are generating record iShares inflows of $60 billion and the industry crossed $1 trillion of AUM as ETF adoption accelerated. And in the United States, we see independent financial advisory and direct platforms shift their strategies to eliminating transaction costs, democratization access to investing through ETFs and enabling more people to invest to reach long-term financial objectives. We think this will be beneficial for brands like iShares that can deliver client high quality exposures with transparency, with ease of access and for good value. While, I've seen our monthly flows accelerated across these platforms since the move to commission free trading in October. Our expectation is for the benefit of these moves to play out in the coming months and years, especially for firms like us that can invest at scale and can invest for the long-term. We also had a record year in our illiquid alternative business and momentum is accelerating evidenced by increased fundraising and fund vintages as more clients reassess their liabilities and their liquidity needs associated with them, they are taking a longer term view on the assets in their portfolio and increasing allocation to illiquid alternatives. BlackRock generated $14 billion of illiquid alternative net inflows in 2019 up from $8 billion in 2018 and just $1 billion of net flows in 2017. Growth was driven by our infrastructure business by real estate, by LTPC and private credit. Fourth quarter illiquid alternatives results included the $1 billion close of a third global renewable power fund as well as our second and third close of LTPC in which we secured an additional $1.1 billion of commitments. Growth in our illiquid alternative business will further enhance and supported by our acquisition and integration of eFront as we leverage technology to enhance better solution we provide to our clients. Technology remains a key differentiator for BlackRock. Any strategic growth area, technology is how we've been able to scale our business into a global, multi-asset organization we are today and it enables us to have a deeper, more resilient conversation with more and more of our clients. Our long-term strategy is to provide technology for much of the asset management value chain as possible and make Aladdin the language of portfolios. Demand remains strong for Aladdin and our technology capabilities and we expect growth will be driven by expanding Aladdin's capabilities to existing clients, to attracting new clients, to inorganic growth, including eFront and the growth of our client's businesses as they scale themselves. Technology services revenues of $974 billion increased 24% year-over-year and more than doubled since 2014. McKinsey Research shows that only 3% of technology startups reach $1 billion in revenues and I'm proud that BlackRock will soon cross that milestone. Our Aladdin and eFront technology is used by more than 900 clients in 68 countries, including 16 wealth managers that have 35,000 financial advisors serving millions of end investors. The vast majority of our technology service revenues today come from our institutional Aladdin capabilities, which set the standard in investment management technology. And now with the integration of eFront, this will reinforce, our value proposition as the most comprehensive investment operating system for investors in the world. One of the biggest future growth opportunities is Aladdin Wealth. Macro forces are impacting the wealth industry including a more challenging market environment, heightened customer expectations, more regulation, technology advancements and this is driving demand for a deeper portfolio, analytical and risk transparency, portfolio construction, product and scale. These are all core to the Aladdin Wealth value proposition. Additionally, we are seeing more and more clients using Aladdin Wealth as a business enabler. Particularly in markets such as Europe and Asia where wealth managers are using Aladdin Wealth to move their business away from transaction commissions and retrocession based revenue model to more of an advice driven model. BlackRock's technology facilitates our ability to fulfill our purpose and helping more and more people experience financial wellbeing by building best in class tools for ourselves and for our clients, we are able to construct better portfolios and then deliver better outcomes. Tools alone, however, are not sufficient. As I wrote about in my letter to CEOs, BlackRock like all the other investors need clear uniform and useful data on not only financial disclosure, but increasingly more uniformed and wide spread standard for sustainability disclosure, which will be vital to financial analysis and investment decision making going forward. As sustainability becomes increasingly material to investment outcomes, BlackRock is putting ESG data and analytics at the heart of Aladdin and our risk and quantitative analysis team. We are increasingly evaluating ESG risks with the same rigor as traditional measures such as credit or liquidity risk. Client demand for sustainable products and solutions continued to accelerate. As a global leader investment management our goal is to also be the global leader in sustainable investing by incorporating sustainability at the core and how we manage risks, how we construct portfolios, how we design products, and most importantly, how we engage with companies. As we wrote in a letter to clients yesterday, we will be making sustainability the standard for investing, including making sustainable investing more accessible to more of our investors. We intend to double our ESG offerings to 150 funds over the next two years, including sustainable versions of our flagship iShares product, so the clients have more choice for how they invest their money. Client demand is also increasing for outsource CIO solutions as many are being asked to do more with less. BlackRock generated $16 billion of OCIO net inflows in 2019 representing a 10% organic growth, including winning the largest OCIO mandate awarded in the U.K. in recent years. Outsourcing currently represents only $2 trillion of the $85 trillion of manage assets globally, and we believe the market will increase by 50% over the next five years. I've talked many times on these phone calls in the past about BlackRock being one of the largest long-term growth opportunities for BlackRock. In line with our commitment to invest in operate there, BlackRock entered into a memorandum of understanding last month to explore establishing an asset management joint venture in China, which will enable us to provide more people with access to BlackRock investment capabilities. As I said in the past purpose is using the long-term profitability. A company's prospect for growth is inextricably from how it manages sustainability and serves its full set of stakeholders and that is so true for BlackRock. One of our greatest opportunities is to fulfill our purpose lies in our responsibility as a largest manager retired assets in the world. We estimate the two-thirds of the assets we manage are related to people's retirement, including our $1 trillion defied contribution business. We are levering the full breadth of our capabilities and scale to benefit all our stakeholders, including clients, employees and stakeholders and shareholders. Everything we do is rooted in the culture of focusing on the long-term and we are aggressively embracing change and investing to stay in front of the industry changes, but most importantly, we're investing the stay in front of our client's needs, so we could have them better prepared for their future. The benefits of BlackRock's investments are evident in our consistent growth. Over the last three years, we've generated nearly $1 trillion of net organic inflows, 30% of revenue growth, 19% operating income growth, and a 43% total return for our shareholders. We entered 2020 better positioned than ever to serve our clients, to deliver growth for our shareholders in the years to come. I want to thank BlackRock's employees for their commitment to upholding our culture and living our purpose, which was critical to our success in 2019. We remained focused in making sure that all our people stay true to our culture and our purpose and that is what differentiates BlackRock in the asset management industry. With that, let's open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Dan Fannon : Thank you. Good morning. Larry Fink : Good morning, Dan. Dan Fannon : As you think about 2020, can you talk about the outlook for fixed income? In 2019, I think at the start of the year, you talked about rerisking within your client base, you saw big inflows, and now on the active side in the second half of the year, we've seen modest outflows. Can you just kind of level set kind of what clients are doing, your outlook for growth, and how you're positioned? Larry Fink : Well, I think probably the biggest macro change for fixed income, beyond if interest rates go up or down is going to be the utilization of fixed and ETFs for active strategies. As I said in my prepared remarks and Gary mentioned and I'll let Rob talk about it a little more, we believe this is going to be a fundamental shift in how people use fixed income as an exposure, and they're going to be using ETFs as that vehicle for active returns. I believe this is going to be an overwhelming trend in the fixed income landscape as it's easier to navigate; it's cheaper to navigate; and importantly you provide much greater flexibility with substantially less operational risk when you use ETFs versus the myriad of thousands of bonds. The specifics of the outflows in fixed income were very \u2013 idiosyncratic with one or two clients. We are seeing some clients, as I said, replace the what we define as an active strategy into more ETF strategies, and so it's hard to differentiate those two things as we build deeper, broader, dialogues about how to use ETFs in a portfolio setting. Rob, do you want to add more to that? Rob Kapito : No. I would just add, in general, I think there is a common belief now that rates are going to be lower for longer, and with the amount of money that has been sitting on the sideline in cash, clients cannot afford that anymore at getting less than 1% returns, so they are more than willing now to extend out of cash into fixed income, and those are the flows that we are seeing and rather than come into individual bonds, the trend has been to use a more diversified portfolio that they can go into, and ETFs have been the beneficiary and because of BlackRock's position in fixed income, we have been the beneficiary of those particular flows, which we expect will continue into 2020. Larry Fink : Let me just add, putting a whole year perspective because I can't respond to one quarter versus another. For the full year, we had $75 billion of active inflows in fixed income. For the full year, we had $112 billion in ETFs, and so when you put it all in perspective and then we had obviously even more in index and other types of LDI and other types of strategies. So we had a very strong year in fixed income, and one of the business propositions we provide to our clients is having a holistic conversation about how one can use ETFs in their fixed income strategy. And so, the active ETF mix is kind of harder for you to decipher, but we are having broader, deeper relationships with more clients in fixed income than ever before. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Lee of KBW. Robert Lee : Great. Good morning. Happy New Year, everyone. I just want to -- maybe going back to eFront, I know it's only been like seven months or eight months, but can you maybe just kind of give us a sense of how you've incorporated, may be start to monetize that, and And then maybe more broadly within Aladdin, I mean to the extent you want it to be kind of the language of portfolios, do you think you now have kind of the full set of capabilities that you need, and it's really just kind of execution or are there other aspects to the platform that you feel like you need to build out and add on to? Gary Shedlin : So, Rob, I think that early stages are suggesting that everything we anticipated about the eFront strategic fit with Aladdin was well thought through and ultimately is going to come true. Again remember, Aladdin effectively began as more of the premier Risk Analytics and Portfolio Analytics system designed primarily to liquid. As you know, we spent a bunch of time thinking about attempting to build what we've done on the liquid side for illiquid as we thought about doing eFront. And the reality is doing eFront will accelerate that by a number of years for us. I think clients have been very engaged with us in terms of thinking about getting and bringing their entire portfolio together on a single technology platform that allows them to basically bring the same expertise we've been doing for them for years on the liquid side. So, their illiquid to get a complete view of the entire whole portfolio that they have from a risk and analytics perspective. We've had a strong and growing pipeline with a number of live opportunities globally. We actually won our first joint client, which we announced earlier in the year, and our expectation is that this will, that as we bring this together over the next six months to 12 months, it will continue to basically reinforce our long-term growth of low to mid-teens for the combined technology business. Larry Fink : I would just add, the language of portfolios is becoming more and more real and we're committed to that. This is why we believe we have to add sustainability sleeves to Aladdin to making sure that our clients and our investors at BlackRock can look at the sustainability as one of the key investment risk going forward. What we did in factors and adding factor sleeves onto our Aladdin system. I think the key that we've been doing is we are providing more content for the same value proposition, and so while we continue to drive elevated content with the same fee structure. And as what then happens is as the clients grow, we grow with them. And that has been one of the key characteristics of how we've designed Aladdin growing with our clients' needs. But as the clients now believe in more of the components of Aladdin they're putting on more of their assets onto Aladdin and so then we grow with Aladdin. And so the key characteristic is for us to continue to innovate to stay in front to be more additive. And I'm looking back now with our eFront acquisition. I don't even know how we were able to operate without having those sleeves now and making -- we've been spending years talking about the need with our investors to have more illiquids and now we have the technology to be helping them to. And this is why we believe it's additive, not only for the Aladdin business, it is very additive for our all -- for our entire Al's business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Larry Fink : Good morning, Ken. Ken Worthington : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. To follow up on that. So your annual letter, the focus on climate change. So as you did with Aladdin in risk management, are you planning or are there opportunities to leverage the expertise you're developing in sustainability to profit either by selling sustainable technology or ESG strategy solutions. In other words, can sustainability be a new Aladdin for BlackRock rather than just another element of Aladdin? Rob Kapito : So following up on Larry's last answer, we certainly see huge opportunities in using the sustainability platform that we have for other profit centers for BlackRock and to add into our Aladdin value proposition. So what I could see coming forward would be creating new screens that others would be interested in to screen for ESG, creating specific model portfolios and models that many of our distribution networks would want to use. Potentially creating new indices in the market as people are looking for someone to take the lead and creating an appropriate indices to pinpoint specific areas of sustainability in the future and offer new products like specific ESG, ETFs and it's already working in that sustainable ETFs for iShares were the fastest growing category in 2019 and it generated $4 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter or total of $12 billion for the year. So I can see also adding on new products, which many of our clients would look for. So, as Larry mentioned, the value proposition of Aladdin would grow as we incorporate our platform into the Aladdin platform for other clients of Aladdin to be able to use. That's just the beginning of some of the ideas we've come up with that that we can put forward in 2020. Larry Fink : Let me just add to that. As I said yesterday in my CEO letter and the firm's client letters, we believe sustainability and the issue is going to have a very large investment impact. For those investors investing in a long illiquid product they have to seek now in 10 years if there is evidence of climate change, how that will be impacting that investment that has a 10-year horizon. So more than ever before we have to drive analytics to help more and more clients, more and more investors understand the interconnectiveness of how climate change, the potential impact of climate change, how does that impact every single investment we have. And because of the resources of BlackRock, the scale of BlackRock I believe more than ever before if we execute on what we intend to do and we could, that's our intention. If we execute, we have probably one of the broadest opportunities that we've ever had. I believe we will be able to differentiate ourselves more than any other firm by providing these analytics by using them on Aladdin as using them as an investment tool this can differentiate us more than any other organization. And this is a call to arms at BlackRock. This is probably the biggest project that we've worked on in years that we have embraced the entire organization and I want to underline the entire organization to be more prepared to start focusing on the analytics. So we have better understanding, overlaying let's say imaging technology on the physical impact on the world and different elements of rising temperatures or rising water levels. By having a better understanding how insurance companies are focusing on their insurance risk and looking at areas that have potential climate risk implications whether that is from fire, flooding or other actions. I do believe as I said in my letter, the possible changes from climate risk have serious implications in other countries that have heat issues and beyond any flooding issue, it could just be heat that's changing the output of their crops. What does that mean for that country's GDP? Should we honor that country's debt? These are all really important things and that I don't believe the investor universe is prepared and it's the management's expectations at BlackRock that we become the leader in designing better tools and helping people navigate this uncertain sustainability future. We are really passionate about it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt of Autonomous Research. Larry Fink : Good morning, Patrick. Patrick Davitt : Good morning, guys. On the 5% G&A growth guide, it sounds like there's kind of a lot of adjustments we should be making to 2019 to get to the base for that 5% growth, could you kind of walk through everything we should be backing out specifically? Gary Shedlin : Sure, Patrick. I mean, I think we've been, we've tried to be pretty transparent on our definition of non-core. So just for a little perspective, I mean if you look at the fourth quarter; the fourth quarter was up about $130 million. We talked about some of the seasonality in there, but there was about $50 million of, again, what I would call non-core, in that case, it was contingent purchase price value adjustments as well as foreign exchange remeasurement. That $50 million is probably about 150 basis points of margin in the fourth quarter alone. If you look at the full year, we had about $164 million of what I would call non-core that included $60 million plus for fund launch cost, that's already adjusted out of margin, but it also included a little over $50 million of these purchase price fair value adjustments, which is actually as those go up, it means that the businesses that we've acquired where we have contingent payments are doing better. So that's a good thing. We had about $31 million of FX remeasurement, and there's probably of $15 million to $20 million knock in there for just deal fees related to things that we were doing during the year. So that's kind of the numbers that we would basically think is kind of a non-core. And so while we think about that 5%, we're trying to look at apples-to-apples. And remember, we also have a little bit of lift up from the year just general because we have 12 months of eFront relative to the eight months that we had in 2019. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Larry Fink : Good morning, Alex. Alex Blostein : Hey, good morning everybody. So I wanted to turn discussion a little bit to pricing to Gary, I think at the end of last year we talked a little bit about potential kind of strategic reinvestments in some of the ETF as you've done in the past. Could you expand on that a little bit I guess which product categories do you guys think you could target here and how is your kind of tech enabled distribution could help block or capture AUM in product categories that I guess more sensitive to price moves? Gary Shedlin : So Alex, it's really no different than the messaging we offered at your excellent conference at the end of the year. I think that, frankly, obviously, we'll react to pricing in various segments of our business. But the reality is, most of our strategic pricing investments are really driven towards our iShares business. And I think as we said for the most part, we have a number of criteria we need to meet in terms of when we will make those decisions. We need to see high future growth, but we need to basically see growth in particular where clients are price sensitive and if we see basically the combination of those two things, we will consider basically making pricing investments. Since about 2016, we've invested approximately 1.5% to 2.5% of iShares revenue annually and over that period of time iShares revenue has grown very substantially roughly by 25%. And we think that in that respect as a look back that pricing investments have been good, not only for clients but honestly also for our shareholders by virtue of the positive NPV that we've delivered. In 2019 our pricing investments were at the lower end of that range, but I would expect that we would move to a more normalized level of pricing investments during 2020 and obviously that's an important element of maintaining leadership within our iShares franchise. We know that those tend to be long-term sticky assets and revenue streams. And we think about pricing investments no different than any other strategic investment in our company and we tend to budget them and take them into consideration as we think about making sure that we are growing or optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible. There is no question that we think at the moment, most of the pricing will be focused on the core and likely in certain elements of more of the core related fixed income categories, but importantly I think most of the growth that we are seeing in the strategic segments that Rob mentioned earlier as well as where the client simply don't focus on price as a key decision of their buying decision in the precision instruments and importantly in the liquidity areas, those are higher fee today and those will not be a target of any of our pricing investments going forward. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks very much. Hey, good morning. Thanks very much. Maybe just to hone in more time on the fixed income iShares. So far we're seeing quarter-to-date or January-to-date about $7 billion of fixed income iShares flows about -- little about $2 billion in core and about $5 billion institutional. So just talk about that institutional trend, which seems to be continuing, is it more, are you seeing it more from targeting specific allocations or our institutional managers substituting the ETFs for bonds because of the tighter bid-ask spreads that you're seeing in the ETF and do you see that latter element being a more powerful growth driver going forward. RobKapito: Yes. So, it's both. So I think there is a lot of reallocation done and our forte because of our scale and size is to capture those institutional flows into our fixed income iShares. So one is its allocations that are being done as people have their view to the value of equity is in the value of bonds in their portfolio. And then as you know the supply and the time it takes to find fixed income and build a diversified fixed income portfolio is quite difficult and can be quite expensive. This is a very quick, convenient, less friction way, more liquid diversified way to get in. So people have now substituted building those portfolios by simply going out and getting that portfolio on the Exchange and it is, winds up being cheaper and more effective. They are also using, we're seeing a lot of model changes and in the models that we have seen that are being used by institutions they are also targeting ETFs. And then, if they want to have any sort of precision, any sort of view on factors or any sort of view on particular areas of the market, they are able to achieve it much quicker and faster in fixed income. So we saw that at the end of the year as the market went down and now this is the time when most institutions sit down and talk about their strategy. We've seen that continue those flows into the beginning of the year. So I think we're very positioned well to attract these institutional large flows. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks? Larry Fink : Yes. Thank you, Operator. Thank you everyone for joining our morning, and your continued interest at BlackRock. I am proud of the progress we have made to lead the industry throughout 2019. And I can promise we will continue to invest. We will continue to innovate in the years to come. So we could be better in what we do and better to meet our clients' needs. And through that we will generate more growth. And if we continue to fulfill our purpose of helping more and more people experience financial well-being, we will be better positioned as an organization and to you, our shareholders. Have a great start of the New Year and enjoy the next decade. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated First Quarter 2020 Earnings Teleconference. Participants in today's call will include Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; President, Robert S. Kapito; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; Chief Operating Officer and Head of BlackRock Solutions, Robert L. Goldstein; Global Head of iShares and Index Investments, Salim Ramji; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you, Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference. Chris Meade : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may of course differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So with that, I'll turn it over to Larry. Larry Fink : Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. I know this is a difficult time for many people. So first and foremost, I hope you, your families, your friends, your neighbors are all staying healthy and safe. Before I begin, I want to take a moment to express the gratitude of everyone at BlackRock, for the men and women, women on the front line of this crisis, for the doctors and nurses and everyone working so hard today, putting their own health at risk to support the safety and health of our communities and to our country\u2019s. And to all of you thank you.  As I wrote in my Chairman's Letter to Shareholders, we\u2019re living and working in an unprecedented environment. In just a few short months, the COVID-19 outbreak has transformed the world for all of us. As individuals, businesses, small and large, for entire industries, for every government around the world, it has presented tremendous medical, economic and human challenges that will be long lasting and will reverberate for years to come. Our global markets were impacted by extreme volatility, liquidity receded, and then oil price were a exacerbated stress. Swift actions by policymakers, and several central banks represented the type of decisive responses that are needed to overcome this extreme market adversity. There has been tremendous monetary policy to stabilize financial markets and we're beginning to see the type of fiscal policy that could stabilize our economies. No one knows precisely how long these conditions will persist. However, I expect the continued actions taken by government, taken by the central banks, with careful design and coordination will help the economy recover. And I believe that coming out of the crisis we have an opportunity to accelerate towards a more sustainable world. Through these challenging times, the strength and resilience of BlackRock's business model has become even more apparent than ever before. The investments that we've spoken to in many, many quarterly updates over the long-term to diversify our investment capabilities and to operate on a unifying technology platform, Aladdin, are differentiating us in this moment for clients, for our shareholders and for our employees.  We did not design our operating model for this pandemic or any -- or/and almost any virtual work environment in mind. But because of BlackRock\u2019s strong culture and our long history of connecting a global organization on one technology platform has enabled more than 95% of our 16,000 employees to work remotely from home, while continuously delivering seamlessly for our clients.  The areas in which we strategically invested over the last few years, iShare ETFs, illiquid alternatives to sample investment strategies and Aladdin are all helping solve clients\u2019 unique needs in this environment, and continually deliver strong performance and growth to BlackRock.  Momentum in 2019 continued into the first quarter, and we saw $75 billion in net inflows in the first seven weeks of the year. Despite market related outflows including over $40 billion of derisking by institutional clients in index strategies in the last five weeks of the quarter, we ended the quarter with $35 billion in net inflows driven by cash and liquid alternatives, iShares sustainable and factor ETFs, and our active equity platform. Over the last month, BlackRock's biggest priority has been focusing on the health and safety of our employees and all their families. By focusing first on our employees, ensuring their well-being and positioning them with our technology, our tools, and the support they need, BlackRock has been able to accomplish a tremendous amount. In these times having a unified technology platform that connects us all digitally is more important than ever. Our performance during the quarter would not have been possible without a unifying technology, without a unifying risk management system, and careful business continuity planning. I'm incredibly proud on how Aladdin has enabled us to rebuild BlackRock beyond its walls to deliver the operational resilience, advice and solutions our clients need at this time. Aladdin processed record trade volume in recent weeks, even with a remote global workforce, and has provided a transparent view, which is a risk and scenario analysis for the benefit of our asset management clients. But not only has Aladdin proven to be a significant differentiator for BlackRock itself, but it has enabled nearly 250 third-party Aladdin clients, other asset managers, asset owners, banks and insurance clients to also operate seamlessly during this time. We've been hearing incredible positive feedback from the Aladdin community about its resilience, its benefits, and so our clients were able to proceed just as strongly as BlackRock. Rob Goldstein, BlackRock's Chief Operating Officer and Head of BlackRock Solutions, who joins us today will discuss in a few moments BlackRock's organizational and technology strengths during this time, and also how Aladdin is delivering for third-party clients. In addition to our technology, certain products especially iShares have once again proven to be a critically important tools for providing liquidity and transparency to investors and markets. As we have seen repeatedly in periods of market volatility, investors including many first time asset managers, and institutional users turn to iShares for incremental liquidity, market access, as well as long-term investments. iShares generated $14 billion of net inflows in the most volatile quarter we've experienced in recent history, benefiting from a $44 billion of inflows in the first seven weeks of the year. Our diverse product lineup across sustainable investments, factor strategies and core equity continue to drive growth, with sustainable ETFs bringing in $10 billion of net inflows alone, the best quarter in its history. Despite outflows from market driven fixed income and precision segments, these ETFs performed exactly as expected as clients use them to actively reposition portfolios, reduce risk during market stress. As we invested in the growth of fixed income ETFs, many speculated on how these products would behave during a market shock, and whether or not they could withstand waves of selling. Having now been through a once in a generation market shock and market participants have noted that fixed income ETFs were tested beyond a doubt and worked incredibly well. We believe this will serve as a further accelerant for fixed income ETFs\u2019 growth going forward. Salim Ramji, Global Head of ETFs and Index Investments is with us today and will speak about how iShares experienced increased investor adoption, delivered tighter bid ask spreads than any other ETF and underlying securities, provided incremental liquidity and price transparency, especially in fixed income for all markets and for all of the investors.  With interest rates globally back to historic lows, the investments at BlackRock continues to make -- to build a diversified illiquid investment strategy and differentiated global sourcing capability across our alternative platform, are benefiting our clients as they took to meet their long duration liabilities.  BlackRock raised a total of $7 billion of net inflows and commitments in illiquid alternatives this quarter, our third best quarter in history. We also deployed $2 billion on behalf of our clients and closed several large client commitments in the midst of market volatility including our third vintage global energy and power funds. It's our third fund, which raised a total of $5 billion, surpassing the total assets in the first two capital raises.  The investments we made in our active equity platform are also showing results. We generated a fourth consecutive quarter of active equity inflows with $4 billion, even as the broad active equity mutual fund industry saw more than a $100 billion of outflows during the first quarter. We have invested for years in our active equity platform and in better data analytics and technology, a more important risk-taking culture and having global scale and reach.  We are seeing strong performance today with 76% of our fundamental active equity assets above benchmark or peer median for one year and I'm confident the business is well positioned to capture more client demand as clients reposition their portfolios in the coming months. Throughout the recent market volatility, one enduring trend has been the move to sustainable investing. In addition to the $10 billion of sustainable ETF inflows I've already mentioned, we continue to see broad and strong interest in active sustainable strategies even as equity sold off more broadly.  In January, BlackRock committed to be placing sustainability at the core of our approach as an investment manager in how we manage risk, how we construct portfolios, design products and engage with companies and to be making sustainable investing accessible to more people. These commitments remain a priority and we continue to make progress in executing on them. The pandemic we\u2019re experiencing now is further highlighting the value of sustainable portfolios. We've seen sustainable portfolios deliver stronger performance than traditional portfolios during this period, and we expect clients rebalancing in the current environment will include a substitution of some traditional assets to sustainable ones as they see the potential for the long-term benefits.  BlackRock's goal is to be a leader in -- a global leader in sustainable investing, and we believe the assets we manage for clients in this category will reach over $1 trillion by the end of the decade. We also saw strong quarter for our multi-asset platform, which also generated $4 billion in net inflows. Our Global Allocation franchise, a long-term flagship product now under Rick Rieder\u2019s leadership significantly outperformed peers and stays true to its three decade promise of providing upside return with limited downside capture. Global Allocation is now positioned in the top quintile of its peer group for the one, three, and five year period respectively. BlackRock's cash management platform generated a record $52 billion in net inflows in the first quarter benefiting from a surge in industry flows into U.S. government funds over the past three weeks. Our commitment to build scale in our cash management business and extend a rigorous risk management platform to every part of BlackRock is providing a key differentiator for our clients. The strength of our results in the first quarter is directly linked to our efforts to stay connected with clients throughout the crisis.  Investors globally are looking to BlackRock for even more insights, more thought leadership on the economy, on markets, on geopolitics, on asset allocation. Our goal is to help clients navigate market volatility while also staying focused on the long-term goals. Through virtual connectivity we're having a richer conversation with clients than ever before about their whole portfolio, and in many cases, deepening our partnership with them.  Over the last three weeks BlackRock has connected with nearly 50,000 clients, significantly eclipsing all historical records for client contacts.  BII has hosted dozens of calls reaching thousands of institutional investors and financial advisors and providing daily updated emails to 1,000 more who are subscribed. In the last week of March alone BlackRock's senior business leaders met virtually with approximately a 100 CEOs, CIOs, executives, public officials, further amplifying hundreds of outreach calls from our client facing teams. This connectivity enables us to better understand the challenges that our clients are facing. And a comprehensive platform of solutions has enabled us to help clients reallocate risk, to help clients rebalance, helping clients provide more liquidity and capturing opportunities in response to market moves.  BlackRock Invested Institute, BII, our Financial Markets Advisory Group FMA team, and our Global Public Policy Group has closely engaged with regulators, central bankers and other public officials to provide guidance on practical targeted monetary and fiscal solutions in support of the global economy during this time.  BlackRock's FMA Group, which advises financial and official institutions, as well as other public and private capital market participants have been awarded mandates to advise both the New York Federal Reserve Bank and the Bank of Canada on programs designed to facilitate access to capital for businesses to support the economy. We are honored to have been awarded these mandates and approach these assignments with a great sense of responsibility. Advisory work is built into the fabric of BlackRock. Beginning as early as 1994, when we worked with General Electric to unwind Kidder Peabody's mortgage assets, our FMA practice has adopted and evolved over time, working across an array of mandates from crisis-oriented assignments to regulatory and sustainability frameworks. Given the sensitive nature of these assignments, FMA is a segregated walled off business within BlackRock and operates behind a stringent information barrier, while still providing the benefits of Aladdin, BII and BlackRock's global scale and reach to our clients of FMA.  Our most recent partnerships are a testament to the trust we have earned over time. And we will continue to work with others around the world to navigate during the difficult period. During this extraordinary time BlackRock remains focused on continuing to drive forward on our commitments to our clients, shareholders and employees. This is required greater and more frequent connectivity than ever before with Board of Directors, our global Executive Committee, and our broader employee base.  Since the start of the crisis, I am sending weekly strategic financial and operational updates to our Board. Our global leadership team is meeting every single day, rather weekly, as we do during normal times. And we're hosting global firm wide town halls each week to ensure our people, our partners are feeling updated and feeling connected. Just as we are focused on strong corporate governance and communication across BlackRock, our investment story should continue to engage and communicate with companies through this time on behalf of our clients. In addition to proxy season fast approaching, the team is actively engaging with companies on topics like operational resiliency and how companies are taking the care of their employees, contributing to their community and living their purpose. These issues are more important than ever before. BlackRock is helping our communities during this time of great need. Early in the first quarter before the full impact of the pandemic upending global markets, we contributed our remaining 20% stake in PennyMac to our existing donor-advisory fund and we created a newly established BlackRock Foundation with a goal of supporting a more inclusive and sustainable economy. Since then, through these charitable funds, we committed $50 million to immediate COVID-19 relief efforts. Our focus has been two-folds, supporting frontline medical workers who are the true heroes in the crisis, as supporting food banks, which are on the frontline at helping address the financial hardship and social disallocation that the pandemic is pouring into so many. Challenging environments have always been -- have always offered BlackRock an opportunity to further differentiate ourselves with all our stakeholders and in the industry itself. And I\u2019m proud to say that it\u2019s happening once again and I believe BlackRock\u2019s position has never been stronger. We remain committed in growing and investing at BlackRock. Our performance today reflects the investments we made in the resilience of our platform by supporting our people, by building our culture and forging deep partnerships with our clients. We have consistently and strategically invested for the long-term to create the most diverse global asset management and technology service firm in the world. And we believe we are better positioned than any firm to weather shocks like these and help our clients through the same. Throughout the firm there have been countless examples of everyone living our purpose to help more people achieve financial well-being and I could not be prouder or more grateful of the commitment of BlackRock to people. The world is facing a challenge that is truly unprecedented in our lifetimes. BlackRock will continue to do everything we can to support our clients, the societies where we operate more broadly as we seek to overcome this. To everyone on the call, to all our shareholders, to BlackRock\u2019s employees and our colleagues around the world, please stay safe and healthy. With that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Gary to talk about our financial results. Gary Shedlin : Thanks, Larry, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our earnings call and I hope everyone and their families are remaining safe and healthy. Before I turn it over to Rob and Salim, I\u2019ll briefly review our financial performance and business results for the first quarter of 2020. While our earnings results discloses both GAAP and as adjusted financial results, I\u2019ll be focusing primarily on our as adjusted results, which exclude the financial impact of our previously announced charitable contribution. The investments we have continuously made over the years to build a scaled business model with diverse global investment capabilities, best-in-class technology and rigorous risk management, have enabled us to differentiate ourselves and serve clients in a variety of market environments. Our ability to deliver for clients, employees and shareholders during this global crisis was absolutely sustained by that commitment. As Larry mentioned, BlackRock entered the year with incredibly strong momentum. During the first seven weeks of the year, total net inflows of approximately $75 billion representing 7% organic asset and 90% organic base fee growth were paced by strength in iShares and Americas and EMEA retail. However, as the market reacted to the COVID-19 health crisis and its projected economic impact in late February, the BlackRock equity index declined approximately 25% by quarter end and we saw institutional and retail clients derisk and seek liquidity.  Consistent with broader industry trends we experienced outflows for the balance of the quarter primarily in institutional index, iShares and active fixed income partially offset by strong inflows into our cash management franchise. In the aggregate, BlackRock still generated approximately $35 billion of total net inflows during the quarter representing 2% annualized organic asset growth. However, annualized organic base fee decay of approximately 1% reflected outflows from higher fee iShares precision exposures, mix change favoring lower fee fixed income ETFs and broad-based redemptions in active fixed income strategies. As BlackRock has demonstrated, environments like this create unique opportunities for growth as long as we have the discipline to realize them. While we will not reduce our workforce this year as a result of COVID-19, we have determined to freeze hiring in the current environment. We remain committed to act decisively as one BlackRock to focus our existing resources where the impact will be greatest and to aggressively reallocate in challenging markets. We intend to continue playing offense, so we are able to deliver differentiated organic growth once we emerge from this crisis. First quarter revenue of $3.7 billion increased 11% year-over-year, while operating income of $1.3 billion was up 3% and reflected the impact of $84 million of costs associated with the successful closed-end fund launch this past January. Earnings per share of $6.60 were essentially flat compared to a year ago as higher operating income, a lower effective tax rate and a lower diluted share count in the current quarter were more than offset by lower non-operating income versus a year ago. Our as adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 18% and included $64 million of discrete tax benefits, including benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vest in the first quarter of each year. We continue to estimate that 23% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2020, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of non-recurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on previously enacted tax legislation. Non-operating results for the quarter reflected $17 million of net investment income as mark-to-market losses on unhedged seed capital investments and our minority stake in Envestnet were more than offset by $244 million unrealized gain related to our investment in iCapital, which completed a successful recapitalization during the first quarter. First quarter base fees of $3.1 billion were up 9% year-over-year primarily driven by organic growth of 4%, the net positive impact of market beta and foreign exchange on average AUM, effect of one more day in the quarter and higher securities lending revenue partially offset by strategic pricing changes on certain products. On an equivalent day count basis, base fees were flat sequentially and our effective fee rate increased 0.2 basis points from the fourth quarter reflecting strong fundraising activity in illiquid alternatives. However, as a result of significant global market declines including the impact of divergent equity beta and FX related dollar appreciation, we enter the second quarter with an estimated base fee run rate of approximately 12% lower than our total base fees for the first quarter. Performance fees were $41 million for the quarter, up $15 million year-over-year reflecting higher fees from liquid alternative products. Recent market volatility has impacted the performance of certain long-only and liquid alternative products and could result in reduced ability to earn performance fees for the remainder of 2020. Quarterly technology services revenue increased 34% year-over-year reflecting the impact of the eFront acquisition and continued growth in Aladdin. Excluding the impact of eFront, technology services revenue grew 13% year-over-year. As Rob Goldstein will discuss in more detail, we continue to complete Aladdin implementations for new clients and overall demand remained strong for our full range of technology solution. While we continue to target low to mid teens technology services revenue growth over the long-term, near-term revenue growth may be impacted by extended sales cycles and longer implementation periods as clients work remotely. Advisory and other revenue of $64 million was up $15 million year-over-year primarily reflecting higher transition management assignments and increased equity method earnings related to our historical investment in PennyMac. Please note that as a result of the charitable contribution of our remaining 20% equity stake in PennyMac earlier this quarter, we will no longer recognize non-cash equity-method income related to this investment going forward. Total expense increased 15% year-over-year driven by higher G&A, compensation and direct fund expense. G&A expense was up $165 million year-over-year reflecting $84 million of closed-end fund launch costs associated with the successful January close, the $2.3 billion of BlackRock Health Sciences Trust II. We exclude the impact of these product launch costs when reporting our as adjusted operating margin. The increase in year-over-year G&A expense also reflected higher technology expense, including certain one-time costs related to facilitating remote operations associated with COVID-19 and higher professional services expense, partially offset by lower marketing and promotional expense.  Quarterly G&A expense also included approximately $60 million in contingent consideration fair value adjustments, and costs related to certain legal matters, including Aviron Capital, LLC. Sequentially, G&A expense increased $38 million largely driven by the aforementioned fund launch and legal costs, partially offset by seasonally lower marketing and promotional expense, lower contingent consideration fair value adjustments and lower FX remeasurement expense. Our first quarter results reflect the final fair value adjustment to our contingent payment related to the successful acquisition of First Reserve and we would expect less variability in contingent consideration fair value adjustments going forward. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up 7% year-over-year, reflecting higher-based compensation, partially linked to higher headcount. Sequentially, comp and benefit expense was down 6%, primarily reflecting lower incentive compensation driven by lower operating income and performance fees, partially offset by higher seasonal payroll taxes and higher base compensation. Direct fund expense was up $35 million or 14% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher average index AUM. Our first quarter as adjusted operating margin of 41.7% was down 20 basis points from a year ago, primarily reflecting higher levels of non-core G&A expense including legal costs, and contingent consideration fair value adjustments.  As Larry stated earlier, our current priority is to ensure the health and safety of our employees and to maintain operational excellence to best serve clients in this environment. We\u2019re continually focusing on managing our entire discretionary expense base and we will be prudent in reevaluating our overall level of spend once we are able to more confidently assess the longer-term revenue impact of this crisis over the coming months. As always, we remain margin aware, committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible and laser focused on a long-term strategy centered around iShares, illiquid alternatives, technology and creating whole portfolio solutions. We are well positioned for differentiated growth even during this crisis, much as we were when we began the year. Our capital management strategy remains to first invest in our business, and then consistently return excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. BlackRock\u2019s cash generation and liquidity position remains strong. Our debt-to-equity ratio is less than 1 times EBITDA with no debt maturities in the next 12 months, and we continue to use our cash flow to seed and co-invest in new products. As we\u2019ve previously announced in late January, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 10% to $3.63 per share and have no plans to reduce our dividend during the remainder of the year. We also repurchased $400 million worth of common shares in the first quarter. At present, based on our capital spending plans for the year and subject to market conditions, including the absolute and relative valuation of our stock price, we still anticipate repurchasing at least $300 million of shares per quarter for the balance of the year consistent with our previous guidance in January. Larry referenced that BlackRock has recently held thousands of conversations with clients, providing reassurance, guidance and strategic advice in the midst of this crisis. Our connectivity with clients and the commitment to a solutions-based approach is resonating more than ever before. Total net inflows of $35 billion were led by cash management, alternatives, and iShares reflecting the positive impact of the investments we have consistently made to diversify and scale our globally integrated platform. Our cash management business generated a record $52 billion of net inflows, as clients sort the safety of our scaled platform during the market slide. And we saw $3 billion in illiquid alternative net inflows and raised an additional $4 billion in commitments across infrastructure, private credit, and secondary private equity. As Salim will cover in more detail, iShares saw a record on exchange volume serving as a critical investor tool for liquidity and price discovery in volatile markets and generated $14 billion of net inflows, led by $11 billion of equity and $10 billion of sustainable ETF flows. As expected iShares\u2019 highly liquid trading oriented precision exposures saw outflows in this market, but performed as designed to help investors quickly and efficiently reallocate risk exposure in a volatile market. Finally, a number of our active strategies continue to generate strong performance and positive flows. Active equity and multi-asset strategies each generated $4 billion of net inflows respectively during the quarter. In summary, our first quarter results once again demonstrate the resilience of our platform. While we\u2019re not immune to market headwinds and the impact those headwinds can have on our near-term financial results, we remain confident that we will navigate this crisis as we have others and emerge better positioned for relative growth. We intend to remain focused on investing in our highest growth priorities while exercising prudent expense discipline to ensure we meet the critical needs of our employees, clients and shareholders. The diversity of our platform and stability of our operating model position us to outperform in a variety of market environments and will enable us to generate differentiated organic growth over the long-term. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to our Chief Operating Officer, Rob Goldstein, who led the efforts to rebuild BlackRock beyond its four walls and ensure our operational capabilities remained resilient and best-in-class. Rob Goldstein : Thanks, Gary. And just echoing Larry and Gary, we are undoubtedly living through one of the most challenging and unusual times of modern history, and I hope that everyone is staying safe and healthy. So I wanted to spend the next 10 minutes discussing how the collective we of BlackRock have been preparing for and adapting to this rapidly evolving and fluid situation, and how Aladdin has played a key role in the business continuity and crisis management of both BlackRock as well as our Aladdin clients. As many of you know, since its founding 32 years ago, BlackRock has been built on a foundation of technology, a thesis that asset management is an information processing business that requires a highly efficient, highly automated process to function. This mindset, which is really exemplified by Aladdin and coupled with our One BlackRock culture has allowed us to spend the past few weeks effectively transitioning BlackRock from a company operating in 91 offices and 40 countries around the world to an almost entirely remote workforce, effectively operating in 16,000-plus home offices, all while continuing to deliver for our clients and importantly for each other against the backdrop of incredible market volatility and obviously social stress. We have teams that have been planning for business interruption and disaster scenarios for years, but plans are just plans until a real world crisis comes along and a scenario of 95% of the company working from home and equity trading volumes being 65% higher than we\u2019ve ever experienced before, which was what we experienced the week of March 16th was by no means the scenario that we had expected. While there was certainly some potholes in the first few days, we\u2019re incredibly proud of the way in which our teams have implemented our plan to protect our employees, to deliver for our clients and to ensure operational integrity. We effectively built BlackRock outside the walls of BlackRock, and we used Aladdin to provide the connective tissue. To us, business continuity is about ensuring that our employees have access to the resources they need to keep themselves and their loved ones safe in the crisis, that we have the means to continue serving our clients and to continue to act as a fiduciary to them, no matter where we or they are physically located, that our people have the tools to interact with each other in an entirely virtual world, and importantly that Aladdin is equipped to operationally process record volumes and to provide transparency into portfolio risks in a rapidly changing highly volatile market for both BlackRock as well as our Aladdin clients, the Aladdin community. In summary, it\u2019s about staying connected, staying engaged with each other, staying engaged with our clients and leveraging our platform and technology and supporting each other in this unprecedented time. So let\u2019s take a look at what BlackRock outside the walls of BlackRock actually looks like and talk a bit more about how we got here. As of March 31st, we had over 95% of our global workforce of more than 16,000 employees working from home. In order to support this predominantly remote workforce, we relied on both technology and our overarching culture as a firm, our One BlackRock culture. It doesn\u2019t change in this model, in fact, if anything, it needs to be reinforced and maybe even stronger. Unlike many financial institutions, BlackRock operates as a technology company. Since inception 32 years ago, we\u2019ve lived by this mindset with Aladdin at our core. Even before the coronavirus, roughly 90% of our employees logged into our network remotely at some point over a typical 90-day period and we offer a number of ways to securely connect to our network from either a personal device or a BlackRock laptop. This connectivity was optimized, this connectivity was enhanced as part of our business continuity planning.  We also worked to ensure that everyone across the firm had the appropriate technology to be able to do their job from home. From ordering thousands of laptops months ago to building full workstations at home for groups of portfolio managers and traders, this effort enabled us to remain fully operational and effective throughout this whole period and has been steadily improving as we settle into this new normal. Interestingly, we have a culture that already leverages video calls, Symphony chats really as the norm. In fact for the past many years, at least five years, every employee in the firm has had a camera on their work zone enabling all internal calls to include video. This has allowed daily stand ups, hurdles, team meetings, town halls to all migrate seamlessly to this virtual setting that we\u2019re living in. With clients, we have focused on maintaining connectivity, no matter where they or we are located. Clients look to BlackRock even more in times of market volatility and uncertainty. So our ability to communicate with them, to serve them has remained at the forefront of every decision we have made.  Thousands of our institutional retail public sector clients have attended virtual BlackRock events in the past few weeks. And as Larry mentioned, we\u2019ve been talking to our clients more than ever before. We\u2019ve also continued to prioritize providing physical and mental health resources to our now largely remote workforce, rolling out new or enhanced programs to our employees including telemedicine capabilities, access to clinicians to answer urgent coronavirus questions, group counseling sessions, backup childcare. In my 26 years at the firm, I don\u2019t believe there has ever been a time we\u2019ve communicated more to our clients and to our employees. I also don\u2019t believe there\u2019s ever been a time where it\u2019s been more appreciated.  Our focus on service, our focus on communication obviously extends to Aladdin as well. The Aladdin client community has expressed great appreciation for the responsiveness and the proactive nature of our service teams and has said that the stability and resiliency of our platform has been absolutely essential to their own business continuity planning. Without Aladdin\u2019s automation of processes, consistency of data and technical resiliency, the transition to a work from home model would have been much more difficult. To quote the CEO of one of our clients in a recent article on their coronavirus response \u201cPreviously manual processes have been swept away by Aladdin.\u201d So this is always important, but obviously it becomes even more important in this environment. Personally, I can\u2019t imagine how challenging it must be to run a firm with a cobbled together infrastructure through this situation.  Aladdin clients are also looking to us as a partner and a thought leader during these uncertain times. One example of this was using Aladdin to publish what we call a new market-driven scenario, a stress test, based on the coronavirus to all of our Aladdin clients in early February. This provided clients with a framework for considering the market implications of a global pandemic. It allowed them to layer on their own views and ultimately stress test their portfolios on Aladdin. Our modeling and analytics teams are constantly working to understand the model, the impact of new governmental policies and programs. For example, how forbearance programs may impact prepayment speed and the risk of mortgage-backed securities and then sharing those findings with our clients.  Capabilities and thought leadership like this are our focus of building lasting partnerships with clients have led to incredibly strong relationships. These relationships, coupled with the power of Aladdin have led to very high contract renewal rates and continued interest in doing more together for the Aladdin community. I believe our client relationships will only get stronger as we navigate this new environment together. During this time, we even hit a new Aladdin community milestone, one I would have never anticipated. With our first Aladdin client go-live while both organizations were in full business continuity mode, while everyone was working from home. We had seven total go-lives in the past four weeks including in countries like Italy and Spain, and we\u2019ve also kicked off a number of new client implementations fully remotely. It\u2019s been truly remarkable. Aladdin is built for these times, and we are both proud and also quite humbled by the feedback we\u2019ve received from clients. Market shocks and market volatility just underscore the need for robust enterprise operating and risk management technology and Aladdin is uniquely positioned to provide both to our clients. Growth will be driven by the need for more efficient streamlined operations, the rise of outcome portfolio construction and the ever growing need for whole portfolio technology solutions.  Building BlackRock outside the walls of BlackRock and the resiliency of our platform and technology in response to the Coronavirus has been one of the most remarkable projects and efforts I\u2019ve ever witnessed. We have proven we can build BlackRock, One BlackRock outside our walls. This is a combined manifestation of our culture, our global platform, Aladdin, lots and lots of planning, lots and lots of hard work really over many years. So I\u2019ll now pass it over to Salim to discuss how clients have been using ETFs and iShares to invest in this unprecedented market. Salim Ramji : Thanks, Rob. I just echo the sentiments of others. I hope everyone is safe and healthy and stays that way. I\u2019m going to spend the next 10 minutes just talking about what we\u2019ve seen this quarter through the lens of iShares and there are really three points that I wanted to make. First, I\u2019ll give you a little bit of context on the quarter. Second, I\u2019ll talk you through some of the most extreme tests to ETFs and indexation we\u2019ve seen in our recent history and I wanted to show you how iShares\u2019 performance excelled during that period. And finally, I wanted to give you some insight into how this is unlocking new sources of client demand and accelerating major trends, which is why we remain optimistic about the medium-term growth prospects for iShares. So first, we\u2019ve seen two very distinct environments over the course of this quarter in which I iShares gathered 14 billion. Flows across our product segments reminded us that iShares is in a model that has multiple product segments across core, strategic and precision exposures. The first half of the quarter saw $44 billion inflows across nearly all product segments. As market turbulence hit towards the end of February, we saw $30 billion of net outflows throughout the quarter concentrated mostly in our highly liquid flagship fixed income and a few precision market driven exposures. But throughout the quarter our core and strategic product lines, which are each about a third of our iShares assets, provided a solid $23 billion worth of flows and often very steady growth. Core equities delivered $11 billion with its growth largely coming from the growth of model portfolios and buy and hold segments globally. Our sustainable line raised $10 billion in the quarter, which puts us as the global market leader with 66% market share. Our factor ETFs raised nearly $2 billion, even as the industry saw outflows in factor strategies and our fixed income ETFs experienced high volatility during the -- high volatility of flows during the quarter ending roughly flat in a fixed income market across active and index, which saw record outflows of $178 billion just in the US alone. From a client and competitor lens, the first half of the quarter was spread across our wealth and institutional clients. The outflows in the second part were largely led by institutions. The movement to commission free platforms, which we saw in the last quarter of last year across RIA and direct to the United States has continued to benefit ETFs and iShares, our monthly flows have increased especially from advisors with more investments that we\u2019re making to build our brand with individuals. And finally, the decline in our global market flow share in the quarter occurred largely in the last half and is attributed to three things. Outflows in our precision and market-driven and fixed income ETFs, a segment that we have and competitors don\u2019t; pull back in March amongst global institutional buyers across a range of at risk assets, again a segment that we are in, that most of our competitors aren\u2019t; and finally, switching behavior amongst competitors from their index funds to ETFs.  But the real story of this quarter is not inflows, but the resilience and performance. iShares, as well as indexation and ETFs as a category, came under one of the most extreme tests in our history. And I\u2019m not just talking about market volatility, but also the need for liquidity, for price discovery, for functioning markets in the face of poor market-wide circuit breakers, for tens of billions of dollars of index rebalances in extraordinary markets and with most teams of BlackRock and our partners working from home. The most important thing that happened this quarter was in the face of these extreme tests, iShares functioned efficiently and provided a better way for investors to access markets through this turbulence. They have proved that they do what we said that they would do. And let me just give you four facts. The first simply is usage. When volatility surge, investors increasingly use ETFs to allocate capital and transfer risk. In the latter half of the quarter, ETFs averaged 37% of the tape versus 27% in 2019. The second fact is that through these market swings, ETFs provided a better way for investors to access markets. Specifically in many instances, it was cheaper to trade the ETF than it was to trade the basket of underlying securities. While ETF spreads have widened in line with the market, the spreads of the most frequently traded iShares those with ADV of greater than $100 million are tighter than our competitors. Third, extreme volatility in the equity markets showcase the successful implementation of market structure improvements from the last five years to resume after trading halts. Despite facing market wide circuit breakers on four distinct days in March, ETFs and iShares resumed trading normally. And finally, as in prior high velocity market episodes, iShares provided price discovery to the bond market. ETFs have been modernizing the bond market by contributing real-time information about pricing and market conditions. To take just one example, on March 12th, an especially volatile day, the iShares investment grade bond ETF LQD traded almost 90,000 times, while its top five holdings traded an average of 37 times. Across multiple fixed income sub asset classes, mortgages, investment grade, high yield, even treasuries, iShares ETF prices were leading indicators of actionable markets. Now our teams are constantly monitoring the market to ensure that our iShares are performing as clients expect them to. We are constantly surveilling a few of those in quality metrics across several thousand ETFs globally. But there are four metrics that you can use to assess the health and trading quality of iShares especially in periods of volatility. The first is usage, ETF as a percentage of equity or bond trading volumes. As markets get more volatile, more investors turn to ETFs, especially iShares, and this is a significant strategic advantage. The second metric is trading costs relative to the underlying assets, and how do ETF bid offer spreads compared to the underlying equity or bond portfolios. iShares have proven to be more efficient than competitors, and the market, which is why total cost matters more than just total expense ratio, especially for tactical allocators. The third metric is price discovery. Discounts and premium to NAV are one indicator, but they aren\u2019t decisive. Sometimes the ETF is providing discovery and one way to determine if an ETF is providing price discovery to markets is look to the underlying volume of trading in the ETF versus the volume of trading in the underlying securities markets themselves. Not all ETFs do this, but iShares consistently does this better than competitors. And finally, there is tracking. This is something we are laser focused on, not just in ETFs, but across the entire indexing business of BlackRock. For example, flagship, fixed income, iShares tracked performance at just 3 basis points in the quarter while competitors tracked in the double digits. The volatility of our tracking was also lower than our peers over the course of this historically turbulent quarter, highlighting the efficiency with which we manage our products. Now, iShares\u2019 performance under extreme conditions is unlocking new sources of client demand and expanding our opportunity set. Let me just give you color from three accelerants that we\u2019re seeing that fuel our optimism for the medium and longer term. The first stems from what we\u2019ve been referencing throughout this call : The growth of fixed income, ETF usage and the modernization of the bond market itself. Since February, we have had hundreds of conversations and reach thousands of clients from pension funds to large wealth managers to asset managers to insurance companies about our fixed income ETFs. In nearly every case, when we took them through the facts and showed them how iShares performed under extreme cases, they came away reassured. We\u2019ve even started to convert long-term skeptics. Towards the end of the quarter, we saw first-time buyers among significant asset managers, insurance companies and pension funds globally, deploying a few billion to start towards our fixed income iShares slot. This is part of a bigger movement, it\u2019s one that Larry and Rob have spoken about which is the modernization of the bond market. And this latest extreme test is another proof point about how iShares are becoming an essential technology in the fixed income market. And when that market is under stress, investors turn to iShares even more.  Our conviction is even stronger today that fixed income ETFs will be a $2 trillion market over the next four years with a significant growth opportunity for BlackRock. The second accelerant stems from the growth of model portfolios globally. In times of volatility, we see more investors, especially in wealth management move to discretionary model portfolios. The reasons are straightforward. They\u2019re simpler, cheaper, more diversified and tend to perform better over the medium term. iShares benefits in two ways, through the models that BlackRock manages and even more significantly through the models that third parties, often our clients manage themselves, where iShares plays a central role at the core and increasingly in factors and ESG. Last year growth in models accounted for about 30% of iShares\u2019 flows in the United States, and we\u2019re seeing that growth accelerate. Q1 was a record quarter for our managed models of iShares. Models are a critical area of growth and we think it should account for half of iShares\u2019 growth over the medium term.  The third and final accelerant is sustainable ETFs, which is we think is not only a major growth area, but one that is right for indexation. Q1 was a record quarter for us in sustainable ETFs at $10 billion. We now manage $40 billion across ETFs and index mutual funds. But these are just early days. Client demand has surprised us to the upside. We are seeing iShares being bought as part of tax loss harvesting campaigns, as core parts of asset allocation and model portfolios and is tactical exposures by institutional investors. IShares is leading the market in part because of product and education, but also commitment and an intention to focus on building out a global and diverse set of products that now numbers 100 across ETFs and index funds. We expect our sustainable ETFs are going to grow 4x or 5x, over the next three to four years. I hope you better understand forces that are driving our flows this quarter, especially precision, market driven, segments and institutional clients, and the diversity of the platform. That doesn\u2019t make the next quarter and the one after that any easier to predict. Even with the upswing that we\u2019ve seen in the past couple of weeks. But what is both predictable and stronger as a result of Q1 are two things : The resiliency and performance of iShares in the face of the most extreme tests that we have faced in our history; and the growth opportunities that these tests and the accelerants are driving. As we looked at that medium to long-term, our confidence in iShares and our prospects for double-digit asset growth, strong revenue growth and market leadership remains strong. So with that, I\u2019d like to turn it back to Larry. Larry Fink : Thank you, Salim. I want to thank all of you for joining us this morning. Hopefully, you heard from hearing from -- hearing from Salim and Rob, I hope you get a sense of the depth of the leadership team at BlackRock beyond Rob Kapito, and myself. I hope you also found today\u2019s insights helpful in better understanding how BlackRock is helping our clients and our employees navigate this unprecedented environment and how our diverse business model provides us a greater resiliency in times like this. The strategic investments we\u2019ve made over recent years in key areas for growth continues to deliver. And we believe BlackRock is more differentiated in this environment than ever before. I cannot be prouder of how BlackRock\u2019s 16,000 employees have come together during this time to help one another and to ensure we\u2019re doing everything we can on behalf of all our clients worldwide.  With that, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Michael, your line is open. Michael Cyprys : Maybe just Larry, in your Shareholders Letter, you mentioned one of the biggest changes for asset managers is around the use of technology. And you had mentioned that asset managers will have to be as good at it as any tech firms. So I guess curious how you see the industry bridging the gap from where you are today to that aspirational state of as good as is any tech firm and what areas on the technology front are you at BlackRock focused on improving today? Larry Fink : Michael I am pleased to have Rob Goldstein, our Head of Technology to give you a much more precise answer that I can. Rob? Rob Goldstein : Thanks, Larry, and thanks, Michel. The -- it's an interesting question. As I mentioned during my comments earlier that since the beginning we've always thought of the asset management business as an information processing business where you have enormous amounts of data that you need to effectively manage, process and compile in a way that it becomes actionable, it becomes trustworthy and then people can make decisions about it. And what's amazing is that even in this year 2020 with all of the technology innovation that has happened in the broad world and in our industry, the truth is, asset management and the broader industry with which it lives in does not have a common language that is used across market participants. And that's what we've been trying to accomplish and that's been our aspiration with regard to Aladdin. We actually have a strategy that we call Tech 2025 that has a few basic pillars to it, which is about this concept of building and enabling this whole portfolio ecosystem and having Aladdin be the language of portfolios in terms of doing that. That ecosystem and where we\u2019re focused is on bringing together both public and private markets into one combined language and one combined platform. We're extending Aladdin to be a platform -- to not just be a system, but to be a platform and to be a language that effectively connects in with other important technologies within the broader ecosystem that we live within.  And then lastly, I would just say, within BlackRock, we're very focused on data, how we use data, but also how we leverage new techniques, particularly techniques like artificial intelligence, advanced data science, to do more information processing, to find more alpha signals within data. In fact, what's interesting is some of the capabilities that we've developed within our AI lab, which is something still a year and a half old, some of those capabilities actually were quite important in terms of the scale that we achieved through this recent market volatility. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Craig, your line is open. Craig Siegenthaler : I wanted to come back to the financial markets advisory business. Could you walk us through each of the government programs they've already been assigned to? And then also how should we think about the potential AUM and fee opportunity for the firm? Larry Fink : Thanks Craig. Let me answer the first part and maybe I'll allow Gary to finish up the question. As I mentioned on the call, we\u2019ve built FMA from the very beginnings of the firm. Actually our first revenue when we started the firm was that, we didn't call it FMA, but it was an advisory assignment and then it really took hold as I think I said in our call that, it's been part of our platform truly since 1994. And over time, we've really successfully completed these crisis oriented mandates where we have been working on regulatory assignments for financial institutions. And now we're actually working with a number of institutions on ESG risk and risk analytics and their strategy related to it. So it has been truly a component of BlackRock. Then over the last few years we haven't really discussed, because it becomes much more notable during financial crisis like it did in 2008 to 2012. We don't -- we did not build this with the idea that we're going to be needed during these crises as we built it to help our clients during normal times in resiliency. But I don't think during crisis, I don't think there's any firm in the world that\u2019s better prepared to be working on these truly critical assignments of designing programs for assisting our clients, whether it is assistance in terms of related to monetary policy, be in terms of how it is effectuated, the procedures and the policies. And this is something I'm very proud of. It has been already noted that we won a rather large assignment with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, with the Bank of Canada and now the European Commission on ESG. And we're having dialogues across different governments right now. And so I do believe it's going to continue to be opportunities for us. It will continue to give us strong differentiation. And I've been -- I'm very proud of how resilient this division is. But importantly, how it is helping our clients by capturing all the informational flow from BlackRock and helping design these effective programs with our clients and yet retain the confidentiality of all the information segregated, separated, differentiated, we are -- this is a very strong component of our fiduciary culture. On the financial aspects, Gary, do you want to respond to that please? Gary Shedlin : Sure, Larry. So Craig, good morning. As Larry said, we're obviously very proud to be advising both the New York Fed and the Bank of Canada on programs to support the economy. I don't think it'll come as a major surprise to you that it's our policy not to comment on the terms of our relationships with individual clients. It's obviously up to our clients to determine whether they want to publicly disclose that information on our work with them. But I can offer you the following.  From a pure income statement perspective, any revenue related to these assignments is actually going to flow through our advisory and other revenue line item from a geography standpoint.  In terms of advisory flows in the first quarter, you will note on our AUM schedules that we did note 1.2 billion of advisory flows during the quarter on Page 4 of our earnings release. And those in fact were driven by management of assets linked to the New York Fed assignment. All public information regarding our mandate with the New York Fed will be available, some is and some will become available on their websites.  As it relates to the first -- the CMBS facility itself, that actually does have an investment management agreement and a specific fee schedule on the website. And you know that'll give a fee rate of 2 basis points on the first $20 billion, 1.25 basis points on the next $30 billion and no incremental revenue after $50 billion. As it relates to the other two facilities, the primary and the secondary market, corporate credit facilities, the actual investment management agreements and fees on those have not been published yet by the fed. But there are term sheets that broadly talk about the outlines of each of those on their website. And at such time as agreements are signed, they will ultimately in the spirit of transparency by the Fed be posted on their website.  In terms of I would just say the Bank of Canada relationship as Larry mentioned, FMA has been selected as an advisor on the design of a commercial paper purchase program to help support the flow of credit to the economy by alleviating strains in their CP markets. Bank of Canada has also retained two other -- well one is an additional asset manager and one as a custodian. And again, all that information I would point you towards their website for more detail. Operator : Your next question comes from the line Bill Katz with Citigroup. Bill, your line is now open. Bill Katz : Larry, I\u2019m just sort of curious, you had mentioned you've been in contact -- one of the themes on this call is you\u2019ve been in sort of contact with a lot of your clients throughout the quarter, particularly toward the end of the quarter, a lot of moving parts. But I'm sort of wondering if you're getting any sense of how allocation changes may shift here, whether it be on the institutional side or the retail side? And I was wondering if you could maybe answer a question through the prism of maybe asset allocation versus product allocation? Thank you. Larry Fink : So let me start with that related to the de-risking, risking. And I'm going to have Rob Kapito talk about this too because he's on the frontline of this. Obviously we had vast de-risking from February 21st to the end of the quarter. And much of it was done using indexed products to go in and out of the marketplaces. But our conversations have been very broad in terms of what our clients are going to start inching back into the marketplace. So we had a recent call in the month of April with 750 institutional clients and 75% of that group expressed plans to actively take on more risks and by -- start beginning to buy in dips, while only 5% expressed that they are taking risk off the table. And we're seeing this across the board in our illiquid alternative space. We are actually having deeper, longer, broader dialogues than ever before. Clients are looking -- continue to looking for that. As we showed in sustainability issues, clients are just as interested today despite all the underpinnings of the global economies related to COVID-19. And so I would say, clients have done broad de-risking. They wanted to get their foundation in views. Some of them will be -- had already entered the market. Some of them are going to be waiting because they expect another dip and it really depends on the client's position. We actually have some clients who were needed to sell because of the decline in energy prices. And there are all many reasons where you had not just a de-risking but we have governments who need cash flow and need to spend on that. And so, that's also a thing that has, in my mind that drove -- as oil prices were being driven down, it obviously created an environment where those countries that have been benefiting from rising energy prices and stable energy prices, they were investing dollars and now there they\u2019re into support their economy, they've done other things in terms of using some of their vast savings to support their own economy. We also expect to see clients continue to look at different equity strategies. In fact, one great client of BlackRock's heard from us about opportunities and they sold a large component of their U.S. government bonds and bought a portfolio of -- a conservative portfolio of dividend stocks, so selling government bonds and going up to a higher yielding asset class with upside potential in terms of beta. So they obviously went from one extreme government bonds to not hyper growth equities, but equities that provide a foundation of higher income than what you could earn in bonds. So, across the board. Let me have Rob continue to give you a little more texture and color. Rob Kapito : Yes. So we're in a unique position because of the diversity of the platform. So we get to look at clients\u2019 preferences as they evolve. And what we did see was some outflows in active fixed income. But then where did people go? We saw $52 billion of inflows into cash. We saw $4 billion into active equity and $4 billion into multi-asset and $4 billion into liquid and illiquid alternatives. So a lot of clients looked at where levels were in interest rates and looked to actually re-risk and it was broken down more by institutional and retail. Certainly a lot of institutions, some chose to de-risk and that shows the buildup in liquidity moving into cash, when others realize valuation opportunities and equities were at levels which they had wished they were able to invest in amongst these declines, so they entered.  On the retail side, people were a bit concerned about credit and they were concerned about being in the right credits that represent -- companies that represent the new normal or that have better business models. But one thing in the asset allocation, which I didn't expect and give Larry credit for calling this one was, in this reallocation people use this to go into ESG oriented products or they structure their portfolio in a more ESG oriented way. And we saw that in the flows and reflected in our ESG oriented products which had extraordinary inflows. So, that was one of the interesting aspects of this change in asset allocation. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Patrick, your line is open. Patrick Davitt : A lot of investors have been growling that the fed purchasing ETFs and in particular non-investment grade ETFs, hence set some sort of bailout for BlackRock in the ETF industry more broadly. What is your reaction to that? Do you think the ETFs even needed it or is it more of a quick way to backstop the underlying? And finally, do you think iShares flows since then were helped meaningfully by that shift of the Fed? Larry Fink : I object to your -- the way you framed it as a bailout. I don't know where you're coming from with that question. I think it's insulting. There is -- all the issues around what we're doing with governments is based on great practices. There was never any questions about supporting one market or using tools. But beginning to the details of the answer after I responded to your framing of the question, let me give the answer to Salim. Salim Ramji : Yes, look, in terms of investment grade and high yield flows, those have continued to recover as those markets have continued to recover. And I think that ETFs, whether it's our investment grade ETFs or high yield ETFs, are part of those markets. And so as clients have chosen to at risk or come back into risk, they've done those into investment grade and high yield, including accessing the underlying bond market and the bond ETFs that we and others represent. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Dan, your line is open. Dan Fannon : Gary, I was hoping you could provide some additional color around being margin aware, as well as staying on the offensive. Obviously, we heard the comments around still waiting to think about the duration of this market backdrop, but just curious as to what you're doing now and what potentially you could do if things don't recover from here? Larry Fink : Gary? Gary Shedlin : Yes, sure, Dan. Good morning. So just looking back at the margin for the quarter. I think as we mentioned, it was down 20 basis points from a year ago primarily due to higher G&A. So let's put that in perspective, first. G&A was up significantly 43% year-over-year versus an 11% increase in revenue. That included about $155 million of what we would call non-core items for the quarter. I think we've called out a bunch of them, but just to be clear, we had $84 million of fund launch costs. We had $35 million of certain legal costs. We had $25 million of our, what we hope is kind of the last big contingent fair value adjustment that was related to first reserve. We had some FX remeasurement, and importantly, we had some incrementally higher technology costs in the quarter associated with business continuity planning. So about 80% of that year-over-year increase was due to those non-core items and that actually impacted our margin by about 170 basis points for the quarter alone. If you exclude those non-core items, our G&A was up about 8%, which was about $30 million and again that was driven by higher technology expense and professional fees, offset by lower T&E and marketing spend. So I think it's important just to kind of keep that in some perspective. I think as we think about the rest of the year in terms of expense, I would say, kind of the following. Obviously, a significant amount of our expense is, in fact, let's call it variable. 50% of our expense base is manageable in the context of compensation. That's people and incentive comp. We've got about 30% of our expense base that it would be related to AUM type drivers, like direct fund expense and distribution. And then I would say of our G&A, probably about half of that is manageable. The remaining, I mean the biggest pieces there are marketing spend and our T&E spend, which will both clearly be lower in the current environment. But as I think, we think about expense right now, as Larry mentioned, our current priority is really to maintain the health and safety of our employees, to ensure operational excellence to best serve our clients in this environment. I think we have shown repeatedly that we have pretty strong expense discipline and are prepared to manage the entire expense base. And we will clearly be very prudent in reevaluating that once we actually have a better assessment of what the long-term revenue implications of this crisis are. We've been at this now for five weeks. I think the last thing we want to do is to basically react too quickly for a crisis that we don't yet know whether it will be months or weeks or quarters. And in the meantime, I think we are going to make sure we act decisively, we're going to focus resources and we're committed obviously not to reducing our workforce this year as a result of COVID-19. But we are going to slow down hiring. I think in previous difficult and volatile markets, I think you've seen us through our model being able to grow organically and ascend margin. We think it's incredibly important we continue playing offense. We've seen time and time again firms who would have cut back too quickly and then when things get back to normal, they're simply not ready to basically take advantage of all the opportunities in front of them. So we're going to continue to basically watch and monitor. And as part of that I might say that we did decide to postpone our Investor Day this year due to current events, but we are going to plan to maintain a regular dialog with shareholders and the investment community over the coming months through these expanded earnings calls, through a number of virtual events hosted by our business leaders and we'll definitely keep you up to speed in terms of the details as they become more clear. Operator : Your final question today comes from Ken Worthington with JP Morgan. Ken, your line is open. Ken Worthington : We saw a huge move in cash and money market funds in the market sell-off, but regulators had to step in again to support money market funds. If regulators impose further restrictions on money market funds, could this next round of rules possibly kill off the money market fund structure or maybe just prime funds? Or do the financial markets really need this money market fund structure for the T-Bill and commercial paper markets? Larry Fink : That's a great question, Ken. Let me give it to Rob Kapito. Rob Kapito : So I think the money market business is an important business. And of course as you clearly identified, it's broken down into more of a treasury-based and a prime-based. But for a companies, the short-term debt that they borrow from investors through prime money market funds really do serve it as an important source of cash flow, which covers sometimes operations and within that sometimes payroll. And you can imagine in an environment that we're going into, this is a very important area for them to be able to raise cash. So while the prime funds have changed obviously into floating rate NAVs, I think what's important in these funds is that they're sold to the right people and the right people understand them. For us, just to keep in mind, prime funds really represent $121 billion of the $594 billion that we have in our cash business and we're managing the flows into our prime funds and keeping liquidity above what I would consider appropriate risk levels in our 2a-7 funds. We've built liquidities in these funds and feel pretty good about our current position. And when this crisis occurred, we were very quick to raise significant liquidity early in the crisis, one, due to our strong market position that we were able to access good secondary market liquidity, but one is also from learning from the past. So we wanted to stay well in excess of our regulatory liquidity thresholds through the entire month of March. There is also a lot of credit work that has to go into these and I don't think people understand the amount of effort and time and work that goes into making sure you also are buying the right product here. And I know that there are several of our competitors that have to step in and support these funds. We did not need to step in to support our funds. So the Fed has also made expansions for previously announced facilities allowing the money market mutual fund liquidity facility to accept municipal variable rate, demand notes and bank CDs as collateral, and allowing the commercial paper funding facility to accept the high-quality tax-exempt commercial paper as eligible securities and lowering prices as well on the commercial papers. So look, we think it's still an important funding source. Will this particular crisis bring more regulatory pressure? It could. But I think it would impact the prime funds first, and knock the other funds, which I still think are very important not only for the issuers but also for clients to maintain the cash positions, get some sort of rate for that and be comfortable with the credit quality. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks? Larry Fink : First of all, thank you for joining us this morning and for your continued interest in BlackRock. Let me just state first, I'm very honored by the trust that our clients, the governments and communities have placed for BlackRock. We approach it with a deep sense of responsibility. We are a fiduciary in every action we do. We're a fiduciary in terms of information. We're a fiduciary in terms of how policy is being executed. And let me just say, we're committed to making sure that we are doing everything we can for our clients. We are committed in making sure our advice is one as a fiduciary to governments. And we will continue to build that presence. And I do believe the results of our working with many, many governments is a testimonial to the fiduciary foundations of who and what we are. I'm also incredibly proud in the way our organization has come together guided by our long-standing principles and being true to our purpose to support each other and supporting our clients and supporting all the communities where we operate during this time of great need. I just want to emphasize more than ever before, a long-term focus has never been more critical for our investors. What has taken BlackRock here over the last 32 years is our ability to always focus on the long term. And we will continue to invest, we will continue to innovate in the years to come. We will continue to build the best leadership team in financial services. And we will continue to try to be the best source of stability in times of crisis. We want to meet our clients' needs more than ever, we want to make sure that the communities where we operate is a community of growth, not contraction. And more than ever before, we need to fulfill our purpose in helping more people worldwide in experiencing financial well-being, trust and hope, hope for their future, hope for the future of their community, hope for the future of their children and their children's children, and that's our purpose at BlackRock to do that, to work with communities, to work with our clients, and to hold dearly and tightly our employees so they feel safe and with that safety, they could continuously build that safety and hope to our clients. Please everyone, stay safe and have a wonderful quarter as best we can in the second quarter. Thank you. Bye, bye. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Maria, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today\u2019s call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Mead. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference. Chris Meade : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019m Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock\u2019s actual results may, of course, differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which list some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So, with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Gary. Gary Shedlin : Thank you, Chris and good morning everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the second quarter of 2020. I hope everyone and their families are remaining safe and healthy in the current environment. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results. BlackRock's ability to deliver for clients, employees, the communities in which we operate, and our shareholders, no matter the market environment, is a testament to the resilience of our differentiated business model, which has been purposely built with a mindset of consistently investing for the long-term. Our performance throughout the COVID-19 crisis, including the strength of these second quarter results, is a direct result of the scaled business model, supported by diverse global investment capabilities, best-in-class technology, and rigorous risk management. Our whole portfolio approach is fostering deeper partnerships, and now more than ever clients want to hear from BlackRock. BlackRock generated $100 billion of total net flows in the second quarter, reflecting 6% annualized organic asset growth and 10% organic base fee growth, as clients re-risk and once again turned to BlackRock for solutions-oriented advice to meet their long-term investment needs. Organic growth reflected record flows into iShares fixed income ETFs and Active Equity, fifth consecutive quarter of positive flows in this product category and continued leadership in cash management solutions. Momentum also continued in sustainable strategies and illiquid alternatives. Second quarter revenue of $3.6 billion increased 4% year-over-year and operating income of $1.4 billion rose by 10%. Earnings per share of $7.85 was up 22% compared to a year ago, also reflecting higher non-operating income, a lower effective tax rate, and a lower diluted share count in the current quarter. Non-operating results for the quarter included $210 million of net investment income, driven primarily by mark-to-market gains on unhedged seed capital investments and our minority stake in Envestnet and also reflected incremental interest expense associated with the successful pre-refinancing of our May 2021 debt maturity. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 23%. We continue to estimate that 23% is a reasonable projected tax rate for the remainder of 2020, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of non-recurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on previously enacted tax legislation. Second quarter base fees of $3 billion were up 2% year-over-year, primarily driven by organic growth and higher securities lending revenue, partially offset by the negative impact of equity beta and foreign exchange movements on average AUM and strategic pricing changes to certain products. Securities lending revenue increased 40% year-over-year and 33% sequentially, primarily driven by higher average on loan balances as hedge fund leverage recovered from March lows and higher cash spreads. Sequentially, base fees were down 3% despite higher securities lending revenue and positive organic growth in the quarter due to the significant impact of first quarter global market declines and foreign exchange movements on our second quarter entry rate and average AUM. The impact of negative divergent beta was also the primary reason we saw a decline of 0.2 basis points sequentially in our second quarter effective fee rate. Performance fees of $112 million increased 75% from a year ago, reflecting higher revenue from alternative and long-only equity products. Since the end of the first quarter, we have seen strong performance from certain single strategy hedge funds, which better positions us to generate performance fees in the second half of the year. Technology services revenue increased 17% year-over-year reflecting continued momentum in Aladdin and the impact of the eFront acquisition, which closed in May of last year. Since acquiring eFront, we have executed on our integration plan and feedback from current and prospective clients as well as our own alternatives team has been overwhelmingly positive. We remain committed to low-to-mid teens growth in technology services revenue over the long term, driven by new clients, deeper relationships with existing clients, and expansion of Aladdin's functionality. The operational and financial impacts of this crisis underscore more than ever the need for robust enterprise operating and risk management technology solutions. However, as mentioned last quarter and despite successfully implementing over 18 Aladdin go-lives since the pandemic began, near-term revenue growth may be impacted by extended sales and contracting cycles in the current environment. Advisory and other revenue of $39 million was down $25 million sequentially, primarily reflecting the absence of PennyMac equity method earnings following the charitable contribution of our remaining equity stake in the first quarter as well as lower transition management assignments. Total expense was essentially flat year-over-year, driven in part by higher compensation and lower G&A expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up 6% year-over-year, reflecting higher base fee and incentive compensation driven in part by higher performance fees. G&A expense was down $82 million year-over-year and $165 million sequentially, primarily due to significant amounts of non-core G&A expense, including contingent consideration fair value adjustments, foreign exchange re-measurement, and product launch deal and legal costs in prior periods. Second quarter G&A expenses of $388 million, which included $12 million related to a fixed asset impairment and several million dollars of incremental costs associated with COVID-19, also reflected meaningfully lower G&A expense versus pre-pandemic levels. In January, we communicated an expectation for an approximate 5% increase in 2020 core G&A expense versus comparable 2019 levels, driven by continued investment in technology and market data, including sustainability initiatives and the full year impact of the eFront acquisition. At present, given reduced levels of T&E in the current environment, we would expect core G&A expense for the year to be closer to 2% higher than comparable 2019 levels. Our second quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 43.7% was up 60 basis points from a year ago, primarily reflecting lower G&A expense in the current quarter. We remain margin aware and committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible. Our long-term strategic growth plan continues to be focused on iShares, illiquid alternatives, and technology as well as driving sustainable investing and creating whole portfolio solutions. As you will hear more from Larry, we have never been better positioned to deliver for clients and to continue generating differentiated organic growth. With that in mind, we expect to restart selective hiring in the second half of this year. Our capital management strategy remains first, to invest in our business and then return excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. During our first quarter earnings call, we reaffirmed commitments to both our dividend and share repurchase plans for the year. In late April, we completed the debt issuance to increase liquidity in the current environment, take advantage of historically low interest rates, and pre-refinance our $750 million 4.25% notes due May 2021. We successfully issued $1.25 billion of new 10-year notes with a 1.9% coupon, which was the lowest U.S. dollar coupon in BlackRock's debt stack and the second lowest 10-year coupon ever from a financial issuer. And in May, PNC successfully monetized its entire 22% position in BlackRock through a secondary stock offering, culminating a 25-year partnership with our firm. This transaction effectively completes BlackRock's evolution to a 100% publicly held company, and we are humbled by the commitment of many of our largest and longest tenured shareholders who participated in the offering and welcome a number of significant new investors to our company. In connection with the secondary sale, BlackRock repurchased $1.1 billion of its shares directly from PNC at a price of $415 per share. In total, we've now repurchased $1.5 billion worth of common shares during 2020, completing our targeted level of share repurchases for the year, but we'll remain opportunistic should attractive relative valuation opportunities arise. Over the past 15 weeks, BlackRock has been more connected to clients than ever before, offering differentiated advice and solutions that are unique to our globally integrated and scaled investment and technology platform. Organic growth of a $100 billion in the second quarter, suggest that these clients want to hear from us from us now more than ever. iShares net inflows of $51 billion, representing 11% annualized organic asset growth and 13% annualized organic base fee growth reflected continued growth in fixed income and sustainable ETF, partially offset by outflows from precision international equity exposures, as institutions continue to use these instruments for tactical allocation decision. Year-to-date, iShares net inflows are now in line with a year ago, despite a more challenging first quarter, led by strong growth in the second quarter. Many of the trends that favor the growth of ETFs have been further catalyzed as a result of recent market disruption and coupled with the performance and resilience of iShares during this period has strengthened our conviction in the overall growth outlook for ETFs. iShares fixed income ETFs generated record quarterly net inflows of $57 billion in the second quarter, driven by renewed investor appetite for fixed income and acceleration in long-term secular growth trends and even stronger investor confidence in fixed income ETFs following their strong performance in that market stress earlier this year. Momentum in sustainable iShares also continues with $8 billion of net inflows in the second quarter. iShares remain committed to its goal of increasing investor access, sustainable investing through ETFs and we now lead the market globally in this high-growth strategic product category. Retail net inflows of $16 billion representing 11% annualized organic asset growth, were positive in both the U.S. and international. Inflows were led by high-yield bond, active equity, and event-driven liquid alternatives funds. Institutional net outflows of $5 billion reflected approximately $3 billion of active inflows, primarily driven by fixed income, LifePath Target Date Funds, OCIO, systematic active equity, and illiquid alternative strategies, offset by nearly $8 billion of net index outflows primarily in fixed income. Institutional and retail demand for alternatives continued in the second quarter with approximately $3 billion of net inflows across liquid and illiquid strategies, driven by infrastructure, private equity solutions, and our event-driven hedge fund. We currently have approximately $24 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of alternative strategies, representing a significant source of future base and performance fees. BlackRock's cash management platform crossed $600 of AUM during the quarter, driven by $24 billion of net inflows. A significant portion of that growth was driven by corporate clients who acted to reinforce balance sheets and strengthen liquidity in the current environment and we also witnessed strong flows back into institutional prime funds. As gross yields have remained above relevant thresholds, we have not waived fees on flagship government funds to-date. However, we expect potential fee waivers may be implemented during the second half of the year. Finally, second quarter advisory net inflows of $14 billion were primarily linked to asset purchases managed by our financial markets advisory group. Revenue linked to these assignments is primarily reflected in the advisory and other revenue line item of our income statement. BlackRock's second quarter results once again demonstrate the resilience of our platform, underscore the importance of our deep long-standing partnerships with clients, and highlight the value of investments we have made over time. The diversification and breadth of our business positions us to serve stakeholders in a variety of environments and to continue playing offense, so we are able to deliver for clients, employees, and shareholders, both during and after this crisis. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry. Larry Fink : Thank you, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. I know this continues to be a difficult time for many people. So, first and foremost, I hope you all are staying healthy and safe. Our clients are turning to BlackRock more than ever as they face increasingly uncertainty about the future. Pensions, many of them already underfunded are having an even harder time meeting their liabilities in a persistent low-rate environment. Insurers are dealing with the dual impact of a sharp increase in payouts and declining asset values. Individuals are becoming even more dependent on their retirement savings, which are all the more challenging to build in this environment. People have now worked for months home, while also maintaining distance from their friends and loved ones. This prolonged isolation is increasingly many people's desire for connectivity. I feel this way. I see it across all our people at BlackRock. I'm hearing it from our clients worldwide. BlackRock's strong fiduciary culture and our unified operating and technology platform has allowed us to adapt to serve and connect with our clients through this period. Across all segments, all geographies, clients have sought timely, contextualized context to help them analyze economic indicators, understand policy actions, make sense of these turbulent markets and rebalance their portfolios accordingly. BlackRock's strategy has been centered around sharing the insights that meet this demand and delivering the comprehensive investment and technology solutions our clients need to build resilient portfolios. We are bringing together the entirety of the BlackRock platform for more clients in more ways than ever before. And as a result, clients are entrusting BlackRock with a greater share of their assets through deeper partnership. BlackRock generated a $100 billion in net inflows in the second quarter, representing 6% organic asset growth and 10% organic base fee growth. Our platform was positioned to meet this client demand because of investments we made over time to build a truly client-centric business. It is critical that we continue to invest in our business through these difficult times, not only to serve clients and shareholders, but to support our employees and communities now more than ever, the compassion forward-thinking will be essential to our future. The human toll of COVID-19 continues to be severe. The virus is highly infectious. Therapies remain elusive, and vaccinations are still months away. While economic pressures are not comparable to the human loss, month-long shutdowns have been devastating to those who have lost their jobs and income. Over the past few weeks, government leaders have been forced to make inevitable choices between stemming the virus and reopening the economy. In some emerging market countries, these choices are even more difficult given the fragility of their economic systems, the fragility of their healthcare infrastructure, and the lack of fiscal and monetary space. Despite this backdrop, financial markets have rebounded as historic stimulus measures by the world's central banks and governments have been unquestionably successful in limiting investor fears. These policy measures, combined with the anticipated pace of recovery has fueled optimism in the market. The S&P 500, for example, has bounced back more than 40% since its lows in March and is once again approaching a record high. We are speaking to you from our New York City offices as BlackRock employees begin their return to the office in split operations on Monday. I remain cautiously optimistic about our path to recovery, and I'm heartened as we begin to return to somewhat normalcy. There will be positive societal changes from this pandemic despite the uncertainty and the suffering it is causing today. More companies will adopt a more permanent remote work coming out of this crisis, which will have a positive environmental impact as congestion eases in cities and hopefully, improve quality of life for more people. And uptake in the use of technology by more people than ever before will catalyze change in many industries, including asset and wealth management. At the same time, local and national governments must grapple with the lingering economic toll of the pandemic, including its potential to exasperate income and equality if the real and financial economies remain divergent. BlackRock is leveraging the full breadth of our capabilities to meet our clients where they are, be relevant in their changing needs and to provide them with solutions. Aladdin has enabled BlackRock and its clients to seamlessly operate from home. iShares ETFs have provided investors with transparency, liquidity, and price discovery -- and price discovery during periods of extreme market stress. Clients turn to our scaled cash management platform for liquidity and safety, driving $77 billion of inflows in the first half of this year. And BlackRock's ability to be whole portfolio partners for clients have proven critical as more institutional and client and wealth clients are turning to us for help, designing and implementing a more resilient portfolio. Our client-centric approach drove $18 billion of net inflows year-to-date in BlackRock managed models and outsourced CIO solutions. Our strong fiduciary culture is resonating in the depth of our relationship and the strength of our results. As in the past times of crisis, BlackRock's financial markets advisory team has been once again called upon to serve governments and the broader public. FMA's work as an adviser extends back to 1994, and the work they are doing today with five governments around the world, including the New York Federal Reserve Bank, on programs that support the economy is another reflection of BlackRock's ability to deliver insights and information. These recent partnerships are also a testament to the trust we have earned executing these types of assignments over time and the trust of clients and regulators have in BlackRock's culture. Volatile markets create opportunities for generating alpha and we are seeing the benefits across our active platforms, which is top performing with 82% of both fundamental active equities and taxable fixed income assets above benchmarks were peer median for the three-year period. Strong active performance across a number of our flagship mutual fund franchises drove global retail net inflows of $16 billion in the second quarter, positive across the United States, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. Flows globally were led by demand in our top-performing high-yield bonds, our health science products, our technology funds, supported by our global distribution reach, and a deepening partnership with wealth managers and financial advisers around the world as they turn to BlackRock for insight and whole portfolio solutions. Across retail and institutional active equities were generated -- generated a record $8 billion of net inflows, our fifth consecutive inflow quarter for active equities. The momentum we are seeing is a direct result of our investment to evolve the platform with better data, analytics, technology, and a more informed risk-taking culture with global scale and reach. Our diverse and top-performing active fixed income platform was well-positioned for renewed client appetite in the second quarter and saw $13 billion of inflows following outflows across the industry in the first quarter. Growth was driven by high-yield and the second close of the BlackRock securitized investor fund, which invests in assets financed under an adjacent to the recently reintroduced Federal Reserve term asset-backed security loan facility. Client demand is strong across our top-performing fixed income platform, which includes five of the 29 Morningstar gold-related active fixed income mutual funds in the United States. Clients need differentiated, sustainable alpha in their portfolios more than ever before. BlackRock has never been better positioned to meet their needs and I'm confident we will continue to generate the differentiated organic growth in all our active strategies. BlackRock is working with our clients in more ways in both active and index. iShares generated $51 billion of net inflows in the second quarter led by demand for fixed income and sustainable, partially offset by outflows in certain precision and core international equity ETFs as clients use iShares to rebalance the core of their portfolios or express risk off sentiments in Europe and the emerging market equities. iShares has a purposeful, differentiating business model that serves the broadest set of clients with the most diverse set of ETFs. Our combination of value, performance, and versatility allows us to effectively serve individuals, partner with financial advisers and wealth managers, and enable institutional investors with a tool for strategy and tactical allocations and liquidity management. Client demand for iShares is accelerating globally, particularly in fixed income and sustainability, and in the RIH where our flows are up meaningfully and our leading market share position has further strengthened since the movement to commission-free trading by U.S. brokerage firms last year. We remain confident in the long-term growth of both iShares and the ETF industry. iShares fixed income ETFs generated a record $57 billion of net inflows in the second quarter. Through extreme market turbulence, they functioned incredibly well, which is unlocking new source of client demand globally and particularly, pension funds, insurers, and asset managers, including over 60 first-time institutional clients of fixed income ETFs in the first half of this year are increasingly turning to ETFs as a preferred technology for liquidity, transparency, lower transaction costs, and a better price discovery across market cycles and across the fixed income market. They are using ETFs for active fixed income strategies and we continue to believe fixed income ETFs can double in the next five years to $2 trillion with iShares leading the market. Demand for sustainable products continue to accelerate as clients are increasingly turning to ESG, not only for investments that reflect their values, but also to enhance performance, risk management, and portfolio construction. BlackRock generated a record $17 billion in sustainable iShares ETFs inflows year-to-date, outpacing the $12 billion from all of 2019 as we innovate and expand innovate and expand innovate and expand access to sustainable investment solutions. For example, last year, when we launched our Liquid Environmentally Aware Fund or LEAF strategy, it was the first money market fund to incorporate ESG. In one year, it has grown to $13 billion. Last year, we launched four iShares ESG asset allocation ETFs, the first of their kind and together with other launches, we now have more than three quarters of the way towards our three-year commitment of 150 ESG ETF offerings. We are also developing sustainable data analytics within Aladdin to address the need for better data and better technology to focus on climate risk. We continue to anticipate BlackRock's sustainable assets under management will reach $1 trillion by the end of the decade, and we are focused on investing in this fast-growing area. We are seeing increased demand for private market strategies as clients look for uncorrelated sources of return to meet their long duration liabilities. We generated over $3 billion of illiquid alternative inflows and commitments in the quarter, driven by infrastructure and our private equity solutions. Infrastructure will be a key component to driving growth as we look ahead to restarting the global economy. Infrastructure investments benefit not only investors, but create jobs in local community for individuals who work on the development, operations, maintenance of such assets. BlackRock has purposely built a diversified infrastructure investment team, which now manages $28 billion in client assets and we look forward to partnering with more clients in this asset class. Our results today are all enabled by our unified technology platform, which is a significant differentiator and growth driver for BlackRock. Technology services revenues grew by 17% year-over-year, as clients turn to Aladdin for comprehensive end-to-end technology that supports the entire investment process. As Gary mentioned, it has been one year since we acquired eFront, and we recently crossed an important milestone with our first client going live on joint Aladdin and eFront solution. Trends that have fueled Aladdin\u2019s growth across institutional, wealth, and provider segments are only accelerating out of this crisis. We continue to target low to mid-teens technology services revenue growth over the long-term. Two years ago, I wrote about the importance of every company operating with a sense of purpose, that in order to deliver durable long-term returns, company needs to focus on all their stakeholders, not just their shareholders. This has been further amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our investment stewardship team, which has been speaking with companies for years on these issues, have intensified their focus and dialogue with companies over the last few years to better understand how they are managing the S in ESG. Asking questions like how are they -- how are corporations protecting and inspiring their employees? How are we contributing to society? How are they balancing the pressure of society with efforts to oversee long-term financial and operational performance? Within BlackRock, we are focused on living our purpose with compassion and with a lot of courage. This includes working together to build a more fair and just society. Recent events of racial injustice have been appalling, painful, and truly eye-opening, because they reveal how pervasive these issues are in our society. BlackRock has firmly committed to racial equality and while we've made a lot of progress in these recent years, it is clear to me that we have not -- we are not where we need to be. That is why BlackRock is making a long-term commitment to build a more inclusive, a more diverse firm and use our platform and our voice to advocate for change within our industry and more broadly. We laid out some very specific goals for our self over the next several years. The process of building a more just, equitable society will not be easy or quick and driving real change will require long-term accountability and measurable progress. I am honored by the trust that clients, governments, and communities that have placed in BlackRock, which we approach with a deep sense of responsibility. We are committed to staying focused on our mission and true to our purpose. This is what enables us to thrive even during these unprecedented times and to deliver long-term value to our clients, to our shareholders and to all our stakeholders. We crossed an important milestone in BlackRock's evolution as a public company in May. PNC exited their full position in BlackRock, which means many more stakeholders now have the opportunity to participate in BlackRock's future growth and performance. I want to thank PNC and their leadership for their support over the past two and a half decades. BlackRock could not be who we are today if we did not have that strong partnership with PNC. But I also want to welcome our new shareholders and thank our existing shareholders who have continued to put their trust and support in BlackRock over time. With that, operator, let us open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Larry Fink : Good morning Dan. Dan Fannon : Good morning. My question's around flows, if you could expand upon the strength of active equities and then also talk about multi-asset where you saw some outflows in the quarter? Gary Shedlin : So, thank you, Dan. You know that we believe that all asset management decisions are active, and as clients focus more on outcomes, both alpha seeking and index are going to play a pretty big role in their portfolios to drive returns. And in a lower return environment, alpha generation is even more critical as active managers have the potential to deliver a much greater portion of total investment return. So, active strategies have a critical role in building efficient portfolios for clients, with strong performance after fees.  Now, the type of volatile market that we've seen in 2020 created a lot of opportunities for alpha generation. And as Larry mentioned, our integrated platform is positioned to deliver investment solutions and portfolio construction, leveraging the industry's most comprehensive array of active and index strategies across equity, fixed income, multi-asset, alternatives, and cash. And the investments that we've made in our platform and our optimization of the unique assets that we have, our scale, access to relationships, and information globally, our data and technology, including Aladdin, and portfolio construction expertise have positioned us to capture client demand and drive investment performance. In equities, we have arrived. It's about performance. BlackRock has now seen five consecutive quarters of active equity inflows, including $8 billion in the second quarter and $18 billion over the last 12 months. The active equity net inflows in the first quarter were driven flows into several top performing franchises, where organic growth has been supported by a track record of consistent active equity outperformance, a differentiated offering at the right value and distribution partnerships included our health sciences with $3 billion of net inflows performing in the top quartile for three years and five years; technology with $3 billion of net inflows performing in the top decile for the three and five-year periods; capital appreciation and large cap growth with $1 billion of net inflows performing in the top quartile for the three-year and five-year periods. In addition, we saw $1 billion in scientific active equity flows from institutional clients. So, it's been a long journey. The investments we've made over the past few years, including high-quality, in-house research capabilities and the BlackRock Investment Institute, have positioned us better than ever before to capture client demand, and we'll continue to invest in data and technology to drive sustainable alpha generation, and we are incredibly proud of our equity team. On the multi-asset area, the net outflows of $5 billion were primarily due to outflows from global allocation as the world allocation industry category saw pressure. BlackRock's global allocation franchise significantly outperformed peers and stayed true to its three-decade promise of providing upside return and limited downside capture. Global allocation is now at the top of its peer group, performing in the seventh, 12th, and 21st percentiles over the one, three, and five-year periods. Global allocation has seen its share of the world allocation category net outflows fall from minus 32% at year end to minus 10% through May 2020, while maintaining its minus 8% market share of the category of assets under management. So, look, we continue, you know, that we've made changes in our global allocation, rebuilt the team. We are seeing very good momentum in that, and we expect to see growth return back in that, but we also continue to see multi-asset inflows into our LifePath Target Date franchise and continued momentum in our OCIO business. So, it\u2019s an important area for us, but we are going to see both inflows and outflows as the world turns to different allocations depending upon the volatility in the market. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse. Larry Fink : Hi, Craig. Craig Siegenthaler : Hey, good morning, Larry. Hope you guys all doing well. Starting with fixed income ETFs, we all saw the strong momentum in 2Q. But what do you see as the key drivers? Which client groups were the biggest buyers? And then how do you think about the addressable market relative to your $2 trillion target as we size the opportunity even longer term? Gary Shedlin : So, Craig, we obviously have big ambitions for fixed income ETFs. And this last quarter has validated that this is an important asset class, core fixed income going forward. In some of the previous comments, we mentioned that the industry has crossed $1 trillion mark in assets under management, and we predicted this would double by 2024. But today, the category is already over $1.3 trillion with over growth split evenly between the second half of last year and the first half of this year, and our conviction in iShares leadership has been strengthened as a result of the strong performance and market disruption that you saw in the first quarter, and record iShares fixed income flows of $57 billion in the second quarter. So, more directly, investors of all kinds have more confidence in fixed income ETFs than ever before following the extreme test in the first quarter. iShares Fixed income ETFs performed under extreme stress with better liquidity, price discovery, usage, tracking, and bid/ask spreads than the underlying markets and competitors. So, as a result, we've seen increased demand from both institutional and retail investors, including a notable acceleration in adoption coming from wealth managers, asset managers, pension funds, and insurance companies all around the world. We just published earlier this week a paper called Turning Point, which provides further facts around our performance and why investors are using fixed income ETFs. We have seen iShares attract over 60 new highly sophisticated pension plans, asset managers, and insurance clients to become first time fixed income ETF buyers and now hold $10 billion year-to-date. Even prior to the Federal Reserve purchase of fixed income ETFs, insurance companies were net buyers of fixed income ETFs throughout the volatile first quarter and more than $2 billion worth of LQD was purchased in the first three months by these institutional investors, with 83% occurring before the Federal Reserve announced plans to buy ETFs. So, today, we manage over $634 billion in fixed income ETF assets and that's up from 514 this time last year and 402 two years ago. So, iShares gathered 47% of the $118 billion of industry flows year-to-date into fixed income ETFs and this inflow into ETF contrast with the continuing outflows that the rest of the fixed income industry has faced over the first half of 2020. So, investors of all types are recognizing that fixed income ETFs are more efficient, more transparent, offer better performance and more convenient ways to access the bond market. So, we continue to believe that global fixed income ETFs can double to $2 trillion in the next three to four years, driven by the modernization of the $100 trillion bond market and from conversions of bond securities by institutions, central banks, and alpha managers into ETFs and we're going to continue to evangelize, and we will continue to work with clients on how these tools can provide them with good value in the fixed income market. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Larry Fink : Hi Ken. Ken Worthington : Hi, good morning. Good morning. Maybe taking fixed income from a slightly different direction. Interest rates have fallen to unprecedented lows in the U.S. and fixed income product yields are following. There's speculation that the ultra-low interest rate environment could alter traditional U.S. asset allocation, for example, the 60/40 model to the detriment of fixed income allocations. So, do you think there are longer term implications of lower or ultra-low yields on investor asset allocation to fixed income? If so, are the implications similar or different for retail versus institutional? And ultimately, what does this mean for the growth of BlackRock traditional fixed income assets? Gary Shedlin : So, with low interest rates, there is still a room for a significant allocation to fixed income. We see it in the asset allocation models and we see it in specifically in the models that we are building both for the RIA channels and also for other institutions. BlackRock generated $60 billion of fixed income inflows across both the active and index platforms and this was meeting new demand and new client appetite for fixed income. So, investor confidence in both the active fixed income funds and the fixed income ETFs actually grew. And following the strong performance and the liquidity management needed amid this market stress in the first quarter and second quarter, we were pretty well-positioned. So, even though interest rates were lower, we saw that people needed an alternative to cash. And what we saw is incredible demand into both the high-yield and the investment-grade credit area. So, we saw a $13 billion of active fixed income net inflows, and that reflected $8 billion and $5 billion of net inflows from both retail and institutional clients, respectively. Institutional flows were pretty broad based, so even through rates were low; the retail flows were led by the high-yield franchise with about $8 billion of net inflows and where our flagship high-yield bond is performing in the 17th percentile. Now, the other point about low interest rates is note that when it comes to ETFs, we're the number one global franchise player. So, rates seem low in the U.S. today, but they have been lower outside of the U.S. So, we are seeing a huge demand for U.S. fixed income from Asia and from Europe. So, even with low rates, it's all relative. I still think that the fixed income market is going to continue to grow. You also saw the volatility in the markets, which is going to lead to people needing to execute in a more efficient way. So, I understand where you're going in that. But people will be still looking for fixed income. It just may move from treasuries to credit, to alternative structures. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr of Evercore. Larry Fink : Hi, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Hello, there. How are you? Larry Fink : Very well. Glenn Schorr : So, I want to talk about illiquid. Thank you. Good. Good to hear. But I want to talk about illiquid build. Clearly, it's happening. I heard your comments about both infrastructure and private equity, and I see you $75 billion now. Where do you still need to build maybe focus a little more on the private credit side? And just wanted to, in conjunction with that, get your opinion on the recent DOL ruling for inclusion in 401(k) and Target Date Funds? Thanks. Larry Fink : Great question. So, we continue to emphasize and grow our illiquid alternatives. We're seeing growth across the world in every area of the world and across all their different distribution channels. I believe we continue to have very large and real opportunities. As I said earlier, we are going to continue to be driving great growth in our -- in the infrastructure area, and we\u2019re going to continue to see real opportunities in some of our credit opportunities and even in some of the private equity areas. We're going to continue to build this out organically by building out our teams. Our hedge funds actually across the board have done exceedingly well in these very volatile times. Our European hedge fund is, once again, a double-digit performance. Our health science products continue to be doing exceedingly well. And so, I think, what is really happening overall is I think five years ago, we were not as recognized as being a participant in the illiquid alternative space, and today, we are. We are in the top five in terms of asset growth and we continue to be driving even more accelerated growth in these areas. And related to the DOL rule, related to Target Date Funds, this is a positive development. It will increase access for individuals, the benefit in the private markets and we're very well-positioned with the relationships in that area. And obviously, because our LifePath Target Date franchise of being more than $260 billion, we have great opportunities to present different asset categories into these strategies. And so, we are very well-positioned. It's very early days. We have to see how this implementation will work, what type of disclosure is going to be necessary. But we're excited about these opportunities, for us to have an accelerated position in the illiquid area, because of our strength and positioning in our Target Date business. And so, I'm quite excited about this opportunity. But how this is going to be implemented, the type of disclosures we need to do, we need to make sure that the investors know what they're investing, and they know the associated risk in it. We're talking about retirement assets and as a fiduciary, we have to ensure that our clients' retirement assets are protected and they understand fully the risks associated with the investments. And so, as investors move their retirement assets across different investment spectrum, a great need for risk analytics. And this is only going to mean more opportunity for eFront and Aladdin, as more and more clients are starting to look at illiquids and there's going to be a great need for technology and technology utilization to help them understand the risk. And I believe the need for technology and risk management in these areas is going to be required as -- for all of us as a fiduciary to all our clients' retirement assets. Operator : Our next comes from the line of Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Larry Fink : Good morning Alex. : Good morning everybody. A question for you guys around Aladdin and specifically, I wanted to talk about provider Aladdin. We haven't gotten an update on that in a little while, but it looked like Citi, I think joined the platform. I think you guys are already partnered with BK and a handful of others. So, maybe talk a little bit about where the build-out stands, whether or not BlackRock is still kind of the of the primary customer of -- provider of Aladdin and when do you guys would anticipate other asset managers potentially joining the service? Gary Shedlin : So, Aladdin provider, as you know, was created as a response to the industry's desire for closer integration along the investment lifecycle to drive efficiency. And as a leading investment management platform used by 90-plus asset managers globally, Aladdin is uniquely positioned to drive increased standardization across the ecosystem. So, by working directly with asset servicers to streamline the operating model, Aladdin provider leverages Aladdin's proprietary data interfaces and workflows to drive this connectivity and the transparency and the information symmetry between the asset manager and the asset servicer. So, through provider Aladdin, we have the capability now to enable custodians and middle office outsourcers to service client assets directly on Aladdin and this allows a further refinement and reduction of friction in our clients' operating models, improving the data quality and streamlining the workflows. So, more broadly, we are seeing the demand for what we're going to call interoperability with asset managers, trading venues, and the market data providers as they continue to grow as clients they want to increase straight-through processing. And this will consolidate the number of systems that they have to do their jobs and maintain optionality in their counterparty relationships. So, we're continuing to build this out. This is part of BlackRock's long-term technology strategy to provide technology for as much of the asset management value chain as possible. So, we are continuing to build this out, lots of interest and I think it will improve the ecosystem going forward. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Bill Katz of Citigroup. Larry Fink : Hi Bill. Bill Katz : Good morning everybody. Thank you so much for taking the call this morning. So, maybe a big picture question for you just given all the moving parts, I appreciate that the market beta is probably the biggest variable test. But assuming sort of a neutral view of that, how do you sort of see the fee rate evolving from here? And then, Gary, you had mentioned the potential for some money market fee waivers in the second half. Just wondering if you could help potentially quantify that? Thank you. Gary Shedlin : Sure, Bill. Good to hear your voice. So, I don't think anything has really changed with regard to our views on fee rates. As you know, we talk a lot about what we can control and what we can't control. And so as we've talked before, our fee rates are, obviously, in many respects, tied to beta, in particular, divergent beta, what's going on in FX, client risk preferences and the like. And I think as we mentioned last quarter, as we entered the quarter with a fee rate that was obviously down as a result of what was happening in the market. I think the good news is a combination of strong markets and organic growth and the second quarter has almost entirely eliminated the headwind that we had talked about last quarter. And while Q2 AUM, as you said, is up 13% since the first quarter, it's obviously still down. So, we estimate we're entering the third quarter at a run rate that's essentially equal to our first quarter base fees. We're probably about 4% higher entering the third quarter than we were over the second quarter. But on an equivalent day count basis, our base fees were still down sequentially. And as you know, that was despite higher security lending revenue as well. The impact of negative divergent beta NFX was also the primary reason we saw that decline 0.2 basis points in our second quarter effective fee rate, which will obviously impact us going forward. So, we're still -- there's still some beta issues. The good news is this quarter, we obviously saw a positive difference in our organic base fee growth relative to organic asset growth, and that's because we saw some significant success in some of our higher fee products. Rob's talked a lot about those. Obviously, iShares ETFs was this strategic category. It comes in higher than our average fee rate, as well as our active and our illiquid. So, I think to the extent that we can continue to watch and push some of those products, which I think we're incredibly well-positioned for, as we think about all of the trends coming out of the pandemic that have been in many respects magnified before the pandemic, where we were investing, so ETFs sustainability, fixed income more broadly, I think we're going to see some very positive impacts if we can see that continuation going forward. On the fee waiver point, as I mentioned in my initial calls, we haven't yet waved any fees. But in the past, when our clients have struggled with low rates and subject to market conditions, we have used yield support waivers. They typically come into play when yields fall below management fees. We typically share them with our distribution partners. And previously in other periods of time, we've tried to maintain yield floors of somewhere around one to three basis points. And so while timing is obviously depends on a lot of things depending on how quickly portfolios grow, how quickly portfolios turnover. We haven't really come into that. So as an example, our fed fund gross yield today is roughly around 26 basis points. That's in excess of the management fee, which is closer to 17 basis points. So, we do think that, kind of, putting in our -- looking at our crystal ball, that will probably start to hit us in August or September, but I would say a couple of things as you think about that. If we do choose to implement yield support waivers, we do anticipate that about 40% to 50% of those would be shared with our distributors, so that lessens the bottom line impact for us. And we would also anticipate that primary impact would be on U.S. government funds, which represents today about 50% of our overall -- our cash business. And then the final point I would -- I'll just leave you with in this current low rate environment, as we also mentioned, we've been seeing increasing flows into prime funds. And I think as long as those are operating and with the Fed currently, providing some secondary market support there, we do think we'll continue to see people migrate out of government funds and into those prime vehicles, which we don't anticipate to be impacted by fee waivers. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks? Larry Fink : I want to thank everybody for joining us this morning and for continued interest in BlackRock. I am proud of the progress we made and helping our clients through that uncertainty in the first half of 2020. We will continue to invest and innovate in the years to come, so we can better meet our clients' needs. That's what we're all about. We're going to continue to generate growth and importantly, fulfill our purpose in helping more and more people experience financial well-being. That is our purpose. That is what differentiates us. It is our fiduciary culture of building strong, deep, long-term partnerships with our clients, with our communities where we work with governments, and we will continue to do so. I wish all of you to have a safe and healthy start to the third quarter, and let's hope for all humanity that we find a solution quickly for this dreaded disease. Thank you, everyone, have a good quarter. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference. Christopher Meade : Good morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that, during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which list some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So, with that, I'll turn it over to Gary. Gary Shedlin : Thanks, Chris. And good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the third quarter of 2020. And I hope everyone and their families are remaining safe and healthy in the current environment. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as adjusted results.  BlackRock's steadfast focus on serving clients, employees, shareholders and the communities in which we operate continued in the third quarter. Our strong performance during the quarter and throughout the year amid unprecedented market uncertainty is a testament to the investments we've made over time to build a diverse and resilient business model, the strength of our BlackRock brand, and the commitment of our amazing employees to always deliver for clients.  Our broad-based platform, pairing diverse investment capabilities with best-in-class technology and rigorous risk management, has now generated almost $400 billion of total net inflows over the last 12 months, representing 7% organic base fee growth. Our voice is resonating with clients more than ever, and our ability to address their current challenges to whole portfolio solutions, no matter the market environment, is a direct result of the strategic vision we embraced well over a decade ago and grounded in the strength of our one BlackRock culture.  BlackRock generated $129 billion of total net inflows in the third quarter, representing 7% annualized organic asset growth and 9% annualized organic base fee growth. As markets strengthened during the third quarter, BlackRock leverage the entirety of its global platform to help clients meet long-term needs.  Not only did we see positive flows across all asset classes, investment styles and regions for the quarter, we have also generated positive flows over the last 12 months across each product type on our active platform, evidencing the strength of our alpha generating capabilities.  Record third quarter revenue of $4.4 billion increased 18% year-over-year, while operating income of $1.8 billion rose 17% and reflected $83 million of costs associated with a successful closed end fund launch in late September. Record earnings per share of $9.22 was up 29% compared to a year ago, also reflecting higher non-operating income and a lower effective tax rate and diluted share count in the current quarter.  Non-operating results for the quarter included $116 million of net investment income, driven primarily by mark-to-market gains on our seed and co-investment capital, but also reflected incremental interest expense associated with our second quarter debt issuance to pre-refinance our May 2021 debt maturity. Our as adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 23%, which we estimate is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the fourth quarter of 2020.  Third quarter base fees of $3.2 billion were up 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by 6% organic asset growth and the positive impact of market beta and foreign exchange movements on average AUM, partially offset by strategic pricing changes to certain products.  Sequentially, base fees were up 9% from the second quarter, reflecting similar dynamics, but also the positive impact of one additional day in the quarter and the negative impact of lower securities lending revenue, which declined $57 million from record second quarter levels as cash spreads tightened in response to the Fed's intervention in money markets. The impact of lower securities lending revenue during the quarter was the primary reason we saw a sequential decline of 0.2 basis points in our annualized effective feed rate, despite the positive impact of strong organic base fee growth.  Record quarterly performance fees of $532 million increased significantly on a year-over-year and sequential basis, reflecting strong overall performance from our single strategy hedge fund platform. A significant portion of the year-over-year increase in performance fees was attributable to a single hedge fund that [lapsed annulling] [ph] the third quarter and once again delivered exceptional performance over the last 12 months.  Quarterly technology services revenue increased 9% year-over-year. While recent growth has been impacted by extended sales and contracting cycles in the current environment, we remain committed to low to mid-teens growth in technology services revenue over the long term. Demand for integrated and resilient investment management technology to support effective risk management and operational efficiency has meaningfully accelerated in the complex remote work environment brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Advisory and other revenue of $42 million was down $20 million year-over-year, primarily reflecting the absence of PennyMac equity method earnings following the charitable contribution of our remaining equity stake in the first quarter.  Total expense for the third quarter was up 19% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher compensation and G&A expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense increased 27% from a year ago, driven in part by higher incentive compensation associated with higher performance fees and operating income. And G&A expense was up $76 million year-over-year, reflecting $80 million of closed-end fund launch costs associated with the successful close of the $2 billion BlackRock Capital Allocation Trust. Recall that we exclude the impact of these product launch costs when reporting our as adjusted operating margin.  The increase in year-over-year G&A expense also reflected higher technology expense, including certain costs related to COVID-19 and lower marketing and promotional expense, which is where we categorize our T&E expenditures. Core G&A expense for the third quarter, which among other items, excludes product launch costs and certain incremental costs associated with COVID-19 was essentially flat with the second quarter. And we would continue to expect core G&A expense for the year to be generally in line with the estimates we provided in July.  Our third quarter as adjusted operating margin of 47% was up 100 basis points from a year ago, benefiting from significant performance fees in the current quarter. We remain margin aware in the current environment and committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible. Our long-term strategic growth plan continues to focus on accelerating growth in Aladdin, iShares and private markets, keeping alpha at the heart of BlackRock delivering whole portfolio solutions and becoming the global leader in sustainable investing.  Our capital management strategy remains first to invest in our business and then to return excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. As a reminder, in the second quarter, we completed our targeted level of share repurchases for 2020, including the repurchase of $1.1 billion of common shares from PNC at $415 per share. While we did not repurchase any shares of common stock in the third quarter, we intend to be opportunistic, should attractive relative valuation opportunities arise during the remainder of the year. As you'll hear more from Larry, BlackRock has never been better positioned to deliver for clients as we leverage our unique insights, guidance and solutions to help clients meet long-term investment needs.  Third quarter organic asset growth of $129 billion reflected the diversity of our platform, with strong flows across the franchise, especially in iShares, active strategies and cash.  iShares net inflows of $41 billion represent an 8% annualized organic asset growth and 7% organic base fee growth, reflecting continued momentum in fixed income and sustainable ETFs \u2013 two strategic product categories where we have leading market share \u2013 and inflows into higher fee precision exposures as institutional buyers utilize these highly liquid trading instruments to express tactical market views.  Retail net inflows of $20 billion, representing 11% annualized organic asset growth and 12% annualized organic base fee growth, were positive in both the US and internationally and across all major asset classes. Inflows reflected broad-based strength in active fixed income, equity, liquid alternatives and multi-asset funds. As previously mentioned, retail multi-asset flows also included the successful close of the $2 billion BlackRock Capital Allocation Trust closed-end fund made possible by the top decile performance of our global allocation investment team.  BlackRock's institutional franchise generated approximately $37 billion of net inflows in the third quarter, reflecting demand for our top performing active strategies and industry leading index capabilities and renewed client interest in fixed income.  Institutional active net inflows of $30 billion are also broad based across all product categories and were led by $12 billion of active fixed income flows, reflecting strong activity among insurance clients. Multi-asset net inflows of $11 billion were driven by continued growth in our LifePath target date franchise and OCIO client wins where BlackRock's global insights and unique ability to provide whole portfolio solutions enable us to be the partner of choice for clients.  Across our retail and institutional client segments, we generated a record $10 billion of active equity net inflows, representing our sixth consecutive quarter of positive flows in this product category. Flows were led by top performing franchises in technology, health sciences and US growth equities, as well as quantitative strategies.  We remain well positioned for future growth in our active businesses, with over 80% of fundamental active equity, scientific active equity and taxable fixed income assets performing above their respective benchmarks or peer medians for the trailing five-year period.  Overall demand for alternatives also continued, with nearly $5 billion in net inflows into illiquid and liquid alternative strategies during the third quarter, driven by infrastructure, real estate and liquid alternatives.  Momentum and fundraising remained strong as we have approximately $23 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of alternative strategies, representing a significant source of future base and performance fees.  BlackRock's cash management platform continued to grow, even as the broader industry saw outflows, generating another $28 billion of net inflows in the third quarter. In September, as gross yields fell below relevant thresholds, we did begin to waive fees on select government funds. While there was minimal impact of third quarter base fees given our proactive management of portfolios during the year, we would expect fee waivers to accelerate during the fourth quarter and into 2021.  Finally, third quarter advisory net inflows of $3 billion were primarily linked to asset purchases managed by our financial markets advisory group. Recall that revenue linked to these assignments is primarily reflected in the advisory and other revenue line item of our income statement.  The continued strength of BlackRock's results once again validates the resilience of our globally integrated asset management and technology business model, which allows us to consistently and responsibly invest for the long term, evolve ahead of client needs, and serve all of our stakeholders, no matter the market environment. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry. Laurence Fink : Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining the call. I hope you and all your loved ones are staying healthy and safe. We're reporting earnings this quarter from BlackRock's New York office once again. I've been back in the office about three days per week since last month, and has been very productive and incredibly energizing as we are working diligently to help more and more clients and more and more people, both in this environment and certainly over the long run.  As investors around the world continue to deal with the pandemic and the uncertainty about the future, BlackRock is doing everything we can to help clients navigate the challenges that come with it.  Clients are looking for strategic insights on the economy and markets, including the impact of inflationary pressures and sustainability risks and opportunity across their entire portfolios. They want guidance on how to navigate market rotation and volatility. They need solutions that make their portfolios more resilient for their long-term needs and their long-term aspirations.  BlackRock is better positioned than ever before to deliver our comprehensive global investment platforms across actives and index, across asset classes and geographies and across all exposures. All of this is unified by one culture and unified by one technology platform, all to serve our clients better.  We have purposely built our business model over the last 32 years both organically and through historic transformational acquisitions to be centered around client needs. This positioning, coupled with our strong fiduciary culture, has differentiated BlackRock in the asset management industry. Clients are entrusting us with a greater share of their assets and developing deeper partnerships with BlackRock across their whole portfolios. And this has been reflected in our results.  We generated $129 billion in total net inflows in the third quarter, representing a 7% organic asset growth and 9% organic base fee growth. Our strong organic growth underscores the benefit of the diversity of our platform. We saw positive inflows across all client types, all asset classes, all investment styles and across our regions. We delivered 18% revenue, 17% operating income and 29% earnings growth, while at the same time expanding our as adjusted operating margin year-over-year. Consecutive quarters of strong growth through the pandemic are a testament to the flexibility and our resilience through our business model.  Our ability to aggressively embrace change, to evolve to meet our clients' needs continues today and drives our strategy for long-term growth. And I'm more convinced than ever before that our ability to meet the challenges of our clients will continue to drive future growth for BlackRock.  The global pandemic remains a key factor for investors over the near and long term. While many individuals and companies are going through a painful period of readjustment as we enter the ninth month of COVID-19, economic activity is beginning to restart around the world as fatalities and hospitalization rates per infection are dropping.  Despite renewed localized lockdowns to contain the virus clusters, the unprecedented joint monetary/fiscal policy response by many governments, including the US, is providing a bridge for disrupted income streams and has so far surprised on the upside.  This improving macro backdrop has fueled an equity market rally over the past few months, in large part due to the mega cap technology companies. Investors need to navigate growing risk in the coming months. However, including the different speeds of economic restart across countries, a lag in stimulus, particularly in the US and the upcoming US election next month, which could have significant implications on policy and on markets. This pandemic is also accelerating key structural trends, including the fragmentation of the global economy. And what I've been repeatedly talking about, the silent crisis of retirement.  We continue to use the full breadth of our capabilities to meet the needs of our diverse client base, including pensions, insurers, and other institutions around the world, as well as wealth managers who serve millions of individuals. The strength of BlackRock's brand enables us to participate in many of the critical conversations impacting our industry and society. We're listening to our clients and bringing their voices to these conversations. Nowhere is this more evident than in our sustainability strategy and ambitions. Investors are increasingly recognizing that sustainability considerations are central to investing in whole portfolio construction and I firmly believe this move towards ESG is a tectonic shift that will be playing out for the years to come. BlackRock is accelerating our efforts to ensure we may remain uniquely positioned to serve clients with research, investment solutions and technology.  We've grown our sustainable solutions to more than 125 iShares ETFs and over 65 dedicated active strategies. And we're now working on building new technology capabilities to help BlackRock and our clients quantify and measure factors, such as the impact of climate change on companies and on our entire portfolios. Through our financial markets advisory group, we are leveraging our capital markets expertise, our industry leading analytics and technology, and fiduciary business model to serve governments around the world and the people they serve.  We take on these mandates to fulfill our purpose of helping more and more people experience financial wellbeing, and we approach the great responsibility that comes with it with utmost fiduciary focus and professionalism.  We're seeing clients increasingly look for alpha in their portfolios and BlackRock's top performing $2 trillion in AUM and active management platform is well positioned to deliver when they need it most.  I'm incredibly proud of the alpha our portfolio management teams across BlackRock are generating for our clients. Our ability to deliver differentiated returns as a result of our long-term investment to build an active platform with global reach, interconnectivity across teams and across regions, an unparalleled access for our teams to data and insights, integrated technology and risk management and scalable processes that enable them to do their job and to deliver more consistent outcomes over the long term. Our active investment teams value the benefit of BlackRock's platform and this is translating into some of the strongest performance we've seen across the platform. 80% of our fundamental active equities and 87% of our taxable fixed income assets are above benchmark or peer median for the three-year period. And this is driving flows across our active business.  Our team's expertise is now being recognized. For example, our health science strategy was recently ranked number one for risk-adjusted returns out of more than 9,000 US equity mutual funds that have a 15-year track record or more. We generated $47 billion of active inflows in the third quarter, positive across equities, positive across fixed income and multi-asset strategies, and positive across all our alternative strategies. This included record 10 billion of net inflows in active equity strategies and the successful launch of the BlackRock Capital Allocation Trust, which raised $2 billion, the second largest close-end fund launch in our history and the industry since 2013.  In the current low interest rate environment, clients are looking for yield in their portfolios. The industry saw strong client demand for fixed income strategy in the third quarter and BlackRock's diverse and comprehensive fixed income platform generated $70 billion of inflows across active and index strategies.  We also saw continued demand for our cash management strategies and generated $28 billion in net inflows despite the low rate environment and even as the industry experienced redemptions in the quarter. iShares net inflows of $41 billion were driven by client demand across multiple product areas. Fixed income and sustainable ETFs led the way, with strong flows in core equities and precision exposures. The strong flows we were seeing across multiple product segments with iShares globally are a result of the strategic investments we made over time to support the adaptation of ETFs and the evolution of their many uses, and to build the largest, the most diverse and the most liquid platform globally.  We saw record momentum around fixed income ETFs, which continue to attract new users. iShares fixed income ETFs generated $20 billion in net inflows in the third quarter, and we have captured nearly 40% of industry flows year-to-date. As we've said before, fixed income ETFs are one of the fastest growing categories in asset management. It crossed $1 trillion in assets last summer and now over $1.4 trillion, and we think it can be a multi-trillion dollar market in the years ahead.  iShares market leadership, our liquidity and performance under the stressed conditions early this year has meant that clients of all types globally have been turning to iShares at greater scale.  Our leadership is the result of our longstanding focus on modernizing the bond market and our long-term strategic commitment to the value, to the transparency, to the liquidity and performance that iShares fixed income ETFs can bring to clients.  Demand for sustainable products is accelerating as more investors embed ESG considerations in their portfolios. BlackRock generated another $8 billion in inflows in sustainable iShares ETFs in the third quarter and $25 billion year-to-date, more than two times the entirety of all of 2019.  We also believe that sustainable indexing is helping to expand the market for sustainability overall by expanding access to more clients who want to invest in this way. A focus on sustainability can help make portfolios more resilient and BlackRock remains committed to being the leader in this high-growth strategic segment and making sustainable investing accessible to more people worldwide.  In addition to iShares, we are also innovating the tax efficient product designs across our platform, the movement towards fee-based advice and client needs for tax optimization in their portfolios create significant opportunity for BlackRock, and we are investing heavily in both ETFs and separately managed accounts or SMAs.  We're the second largest provider of retail SMAs and we recently launched our tax managed equity index SMA strategy in the [indiscernible] RIA channels. This is an important addition to our $126 billion SMA business that has been strong growth over the past several years, particularly in fixed income where we are a market leader.  We're focused on expanding our capabilities and innovating in both solutions and portfolio enablement technology to meet the needs of our clients, our financial advisors and also their own clients.  Clients will increasingly need alternative return sources, such as private market for portfolio diversification and resilience, particularly in down markets. Alternatives are playing a critical role in holistic portfolio construction, and we have purposely invested over time to build a comprehensive, a diversified platform across infrastructure, private credit, real estate, private equity solutions, hedge funds and alternative solutions to meet client demand for this asset class.  The benefits of these investments are very clear. We generated $5 billion in net inflows across liquid and illiquid alternative strategies in the third quarter, and we deployed another $2 billion of client capital as we seek out opportunities for our clients. And as clients increase their alternative allocation within their portfolio, they're looking for a more sophisticated whole portfolio view of their entire asset base.  One of the biggest structural trends within our industry is a growing need for robust enterprise operating and risk management technology. The pandemic has accelerated the shift from fragmented technology system to unified technology platforms like Aladdin that can support the increased need for risk transparency across asset classes and the construction of more resilient portfolios. And it's also highlighting the importance of a better understanding of sustainability risk and opportunities in portfolios. BlackRock is expanding Aladdin's ESG data and analytics, and we recently released over 1,500 third-party ESG metrics to Aladdin clients. We're developing new Aladdin products as well that serve a growing demand and need for better tools to manage climate risk in investments. And we're very excited to having early conversation with our clients about Aladdin Climate.  BlackRock is a global company, with employees in over 30 countries and clients in more than 100 countries. I have spoken before about the importance of being immersed in local markets around the world, so we can respond to the unique needs and objectives of these clients in their home market and effectively delivering all of BlackRock's capabilities. We are seeing the benefits of that approach, with clients in Europe and Asia entrusting us with more than $57 billion of long-term net inflows in the third quarter, representing nearly half of our total organic growth during this period, and we continue to use our expertise to improve issues such as investor access and retirement for more people around the world.  In Brazil, we have worked with local regulators and exchanges to cross-list ETFs on a local exchange, which will reduce barriers for Brazilians to access global markets. With rates at an all-time historical low of 2%, the current backdrop has never been more favorable for Brazilians to diversify their holdings, and BlackRock is well positioned to capture that opportunity.  Clients are increasingly interested in emerging markets as long-term investments, including China which is the world's second largest economy and a key area for investment return opportunities and portfolio diversification.  Many of our clients expect us to both understand and invest in this market on their behalf because it is an important component in achieving their long-term financial goals. Having a local presence in China will help us better serve clients globally. We also believe that we could apply our global expertise in China as the country seeks to reform and open its financial markets and address its own retirement needs.  During the quarter, we received regulatory approval that allows us to take the next steps towards forming a wholly own fund management company and a wealth management company joint venture.  To anticipate what client needs and evolve our platform to meet these changing needs, BlackRock is continuously working to ensure our senior-most leaders represent the breadth of our business, the depth of our talent and diversity of our clients we serve.  We recently added three new members to our global executive committee. I'm more excited about our BlackRock organization, our people and the strength of our leadership bench than at any time in our 32 year history. I continue to be incredibly proud of our 16,000 employees who partner with clients, they uphold our culture, they live our purpose each and every day. Together, we have helped a lot of people navigate this crisis. We are helping people invest for their future and we're helping governments get their economies back on track.  Our employees are earning our clients' trust because of the high standards we hold ourselves to. We are true to who we are, we are living with purpose, we have a voice that's resonating with more clients than ever before.  I see a tremendous opportunity ahead. And BlackRock remains focused on the long-term, on aggressively embracing change, and evolving so we can best serve our clients over time.  I look forward to extending on our ambitious plans in the year ahead. With that, let's open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Michael Carrier of Bank of America. Michael Carrier : The strength in active flows was better than expected and better than what you are seeing industrywide? I'm just curious, what are you seeing as the driver specific to BlackRock, whether it's client, product specific. And then, based on conversations, either you see more follow through for this demand going forward? Thanks. Laurence Fink : Let me have Rob answer that question. And I may do a color backdrop after that. Rob Kapito : Mike, I think that you would agree that, in the environment that we are experiencing this year, every single bit of alpha generation is critical to our clients. I think Larry said it well. We're very proud of the strong active performance that we have across all asset classes. And I think this is a result of our investments to build a platform. And this platform now has global reach, the interconnectivity across the teams and regions, unparalleled access to data and insights through the creation of the BlackRock Investment Institute. We have now fully integrated our technology and risk management and we have very scalable processes. So, this platform is really enabling our teams, and I would say our strong teams, to deliver much more consistent outcomes over the long term for our clients when they need it the most. And if we generate alpha and we have that performance, then assets will come in because the clients need them.  Anything to add, Larry? Laurence Fink : Let me just add another thing. Obviously, performance matters. And I believe the most important characteristic of our active inflows, both in fixed income and equities, is a function of our whole portfolio approach. As more and more retail moves to fee based, it is much more of a solution orientation, it's much more about a whole portfolio approach. And under COVID now, with the connection with the financial advisor and the RIAs to their clients is now done remotely, the need for investment technology, like Aladdin for Wealth, is even more important. And so, having BlackRock play a role and building deeper relationships between the advisor and their clients, providing better risk analytics, it allows us to have, in our models, our products in front of that too. And it's a combination of performance, but also over a 15-year horizon of building this enterprise to do that connectedness and then using that enterprise and all the culture of interconnectedness among portfolio teams, I believe it's driving better alpha and driving a better connectivity with those leading towards more consistent inflows across active and index type of strategies. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse. Craig Siegenthaler : I want to circle back on the strong flows across all client segments in fixed income. And I think we know part of this is driven by overall risk aversion and also heavy rebalancing. But just given where rates are today, do you think some of this strong fixed income migration is eventually diverted into other areas like alternatives and equities? And then, within fixed income, maybe into more higher yielding segments like structured credit, loans and high yield? Rob Kapito : Craig, even in the face of sustained low rates, clients are going to need fixed income in their portfolios to meet their long-term goals, to match their liabilities. And I think in a period like this, what you might find is people stretching for yield. And we try to make sure that they're not overextending and taking too much risk for that yield. But I think, clearly, what you will see is a migration from low yielding government securities to corporates and high yield, which took place, to private credit which is taking place and for alternatives which have become less alternative to have a stronger and larger percentage of a client's portfolio. So, that is why, as Larry has mentioned, it's important to have the breadth of products that we have across fixed income, so that people can migrate to capture that higher yield. And it extends from cash to short duration fixed income, to illiquid alternative allocations. And it really is the full spectrum.  It also will move into multi-asset flows. And that's why our business, in creating multi asset products, are helping those clients to capture that additional yield, which is so critical right now, without taking too much risk. Laurence Fink : I would just add. There's no question, Craig, government bonds are going to play less and less of a role for most retirement portfolios. They still play a big role in bank portfolios and other regulated institutions. But unquestionably, you would own government bonds for liquidity purposes, you certainly would not use government bonds for income purposes. And so, you are going to have a migration across to different asset classes and different asset categories. And so, as Rob suggested, I believe our comprehensive platform within fixed income, having a strong, purposeful ETF platform in fixed income, which we've been advocating since 2012, a historical strong fixed income organization since the beginning of our firm has allowed us to have a differentiation in flows. And as I said, I certainly believe fixed income ETFs are going to play a bigger and larger component over the entire fixed income market. And with our positioning and with our constant educating clients worldwide on how can they use fixed income ETFs for their portfolio composition needs in fixed income is going to continue to drive our, I would say, above-industry trends in fixed income. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Larry, just to focus on your comments on sustainable investing a little bit more deeply. Obviously, you showed a lot of leadership here with, I believe, $125 billion in AUM. And you cited the iShares franchise, it's over $50 billion in AUM, if I'm not mistaken, with $8 billion in flows. Could you possibly update us on what you think flows were in sustainable product outside of the iShares in the quarter? I think the goal was to get to $1 trillion eventually by the end of the decade. Maybe just thoughts on how active management can play a role in your product lineup in addition to the passive side in ETFs? And maybe just also on the \u2013 weaving that ESG into the technology side, if you can comment on that on Aladdin and Aladdin for Wealth as well. Laurence Fink : As I said in my 2020 CEO letter, we believe climate risk is investment risk. And I do believe that \u2013 when I wrote the letter, obviously, the pandemic was not top of mind at all. It was some virus that was in China that we didn't really understand as much. And obviously, now, it changed the course of the book. The pandemic, in many cases, created an existential health risk. And I do believe, at the same time, we are seeing more and more climate change impact, and that is an existential risk.  So, I think what we are witnessing and what we're hearing from clients, COVID has made climate change more top of mind. We're having more dialogues worldwide than ever before. And more dialogues here even in the United States. In the United States, we have to operate as a fiduciary in the law of this land. Our labor department has required all investments as a fiduciary to ensure that everything you do is about maximization of return.  We need to continue to drive technology and information to show how climate change is investment risk, and this is why we are so focused on Aladdinizing data for climate change. And as I said earlier, we are creating Aladdin Climate as one of the components of Aladdin, and we hope to be rolling that out. We're working with many different sustainable data providers to put that on Aladdin. And so, as a result of it, we need to as a fiduciary to show why climate risk for [indiscernible] why it is investment risk. But we're seeing across the board, whether it's individual investors, whether it is family offices, that they don't need as much data or documentation that they believe that climate change is investment risk. I would say, in Europe, more than ever before, if you do not have a climate overlay on everything you do, you will not see any real flows. It is now a requirement in Europe to have a sustainable lens if you're investing across all those countries of Europe. And now, that's beginning to even have conversations in Asia. And most recently, we've had conversations in China about the role of climate change on long-term retirement assets and how should they play it.  So, getting into some of the details, we currently have about $127 billion in sustainable products. We are reaffirming the $1 trillion. We believe that we'll be able to reach that. As you frame the question, obviously, we talked much about the index related or the ETF related sustainable products. I did note that we have about 67 different active strategies related to sustainability. But let's be clear to, it is our ambition in our fundamental equities, it is our ambition in our fundamental fixed income to have sustainability as an overlay in everything we do. And we're not there yet. And we said in our client letter that we'll be getting there within a year and we believe we'll meet that objective. So, we do believe that we can provide that information to our clients who are seeking it out. And we are working with all clients. Let me be clear. Some clients still do not believe in climate change, and we're working with them. We're trying to show them why we believe it is. But if a client is still seeking to invest in an index that happens to have hydrocarbons, as a fiduciary, we're going to continue to invest for them on their behalf. It is their money and not our money. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Michael Cyprys : Just on consolidation, it seems to be picking up across the industry. And if that does continue and if we see larger mergers and mergers across the value chain, I guess, how do you think this could impact the competitive dynamics and industry structure? And in what scenario would BlackRock participate in? And what could make sense for BlackRock here? Laurence Fink : Well, since my CFO is an investment banker who is responsible for a lot of historical M&A in the industry, let's have Gary respond. Gary Shedlin : Transformed investment banker. Maybe just a few observations on what we're seeing today. I think I would characterize that there's very little surprise from our standpoint by the recent acceleration and consolidation in the industry. If you think a couple of the trends that are out there, we're seeing obviously revenue and expense pressures increasing. And that was even before the pandemic. We've talked about the importance of multi asset investment capabilities and how critical they are to addressing whole portfolio solutions. We've talked about technology expertise, whether to support operational infrastructure, risk management, portfolio construction, or even digital distribution, that is really becoming a need-to-have and not a nice-to-have. And whether or not you are a global firm or not, you need to have global insights to be able to give your clients the best advice.  If you think about those last three trends, in particular, BlackRock really identified those last three trends well over a decade ago and we began the evolution to really purposely build the firm to what it is today. And in many cases, see today's consolidation activity as a validation of the strength of the business model that we've created. And so, while we see the industry continue to consolidate really in the hopes of creating what we already have \u2013 think about global reach, scale, best-in-class technology and risk management, diverse investment capabilities, from passive to active, the ability to build whole portfolio solutions \u2013 our intention is really to maintain our focus on our existing strategy, and effectively, to just be a beacon of stability in a world that's going to be ever consolidating.  And as consolidation accelerates, I think we feel more strongly than ever that we're going to benefit from the disruption that it's going to create, and we'll likely to continue to gain share. Large scale integrations are not easy, especially when today's deals are really driven by a need to cut costs quickly, which means you have to combine disparate operating cultures, you have to rationalize investment teams with different processes, and you have to take advantage of distribution relationships that overlap and, in many cases, are not unique across the industry.  So, from our standpoint, our M&A strategy has not changed. We will consider inorganic opportunities only if they are accretive to our long-term organic growth. We are not looking to take advantage of cost efficiencies to drive EPS secretion. We are much more focused on thinking about tactical M&A that will broaden our technology capabilities, expand our global distribution reach and potentially scale certain parts of our private markets franchise, but really are much less focused on the pursuit of traditional investment management consolidation.  And I think as many of you have seen, we're also looking to more aggressively use our balance sheet to take minority investments where control deals may not make sense. And I think we've had great success in things like investment in iCapital and Scalable Capital, which are much more focused on digital distribution and really trying to utilize technology for flow as opposed to necessarily technology to drive revenue growth of the technology line itself. Michael Cyprys : Very good. I like that word beacon. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Alexander Blostein : I wanted to ask you guys around some of the operational lessons learned from the COVID environment for the last, call it, six months or so. On the one hand, it sounds like opportunities for Aladdin could accelerate, given the challenges faced by the financial advisor community. But also, I was curious if you guys are rethinking some of your own G&A footprint and how that could sort of evolve once the world normalizes. Thanks. Gary Shedlin : Look, I think the biggest lesson learned, obviously, was that we were able to very quickly migrate from 16,000 people in 60 offices to 16,000 people in 16,000 offices. And I think, obviously, our commitment to a single technology operating system was absolutely crucial to our ability to migrate that way.  Obviously, we had some early bumps in terms of just trying to get people the technology, they necessarily need at home, but I think we transitioned seamlessly into that environment. And I think, frankly, the performance, whether financially or operationally, over the last six plus months is certainly evidence for that. I think that, as it relates to the broader pandemic, I think that we have seen, frankly, an acceleration in almost every single strategic trend that we were guiding the business towards pre-pandemic post-pandemic. And so, I think the pandemic has really accelerated our growth opportunities and everything that we were focused on before, if you think about it, whether it was ETFs and the performance of fixed income ETFs through the pandemic, we talked about technology, Larry mentioned how important it's going to be to get private assets into whole portfolio solutions we were investing there, whole portfolio solutions more broadly, sustainability which we kicked off before the pandemic was a reality. It's obviously been accelerating incredibly strongly.  So, I think in many cases, that pandemic has really driven for us many more of the themes that we were pointing the business towards, and we feel will clearly accelerate growth as a result.  As it relates to getting back to the office, I'll have Larry jump back in there. I think that we are doing the call from the New York office today. There's no question that employee wellbeing remains our priority and we'll be following all the official guidance and putting the health and safety of our employees first always as we look to return to the office. And we are continuing to operate on a split operations basis. But, look, we're still operating with only about 6% to 7% of our employees back in the office. Well, I think we can get through that today operationally. I think, over time, I think the culture of BlackRock is still an office type of culture where innovation has always been driven by having people working together. And I think longer term, we're going to hope that we get back there as quickly as we can. Laurence Fink : I would just add. There are many lesson that we're learning from the horrificness of the pandemic and the health concerns. I don't think any of us thought we could operate as efficiently remotely. As Gary said, now we're operating in 16,000 offices. I believe that was one of the great fears, could we actually accomplish that, can we have the operational efficiencies working remotely. And by and large, many large companies, including BlackRock, have learned that, yes, we can work remotely without much in terms of degradation of operational efficiencies. We still have some of the cultural issues that I'm particularly worried about. But let's be clear, I don't believe we will have 100% back in office even when we have 100% solutions related to the virus. I believe this will become a blessing. I believe this is going to be considered a benefit if we could have \u201330%, 40% of our workforce that they can work remotely at periods of time during the year. Can you imagine how each city will have reduced congestion? Think about what that would do to the environment. Think about it, your average employee commutes on average an hour each way that we free up for a portion of the year, two hours of their day. They can spend that two hours doing more work, they could spend two hours improving their health by exercising, they could spend two hours more in building a deeper, stronger, more resilient family. And so, there are many blessings through this. And I think we're all going to be adapting doing this. And I do believe society will be better off through these processes. And so, this is what we're talking about related to BlackRock. We have to stay in front of our clients' needs. We have to adapt. And I think one of the great adaptations that we're going to learn from the horrificness of COVID is working remotely and having a \u2013 but having still some core part of your enterprise working in office. And I think this is all going to be a real positive lesson. And it will create another dynamism for all our economies.  And so, I look at this as a great learning experience. We're benefiting from this and our clients could benefit from this also. Operator : Your next question comes from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Dan Fannon : The question on flows, the 50% of flows coming from Europe and Asia. Curious if that's a record and whether that was reflective of a surge in gross sales, lower redemptions, or any kind of outsize mandate wins. And then just thinking about the momentum in that business, how we should think about the contribution from these regions going forward? Gary Shedlin : Dan, great question. Obviously, one quarter is always hard to basically make any significant trends. And so, I think we always have to think about this more broadly. Obviously, we're seeing institutional wealth clients facing a variety of complex challenges. We're seeing pensions are underfunded. We're seeing insurers dealing with, obviously, sharp increases in payouts and declining asset values. We're seeing financial advisors adapt to new ways of interacting with their clients, and obviously, individuals who are more dependent on retirement savings, which obviously are more challenging.  Clients globally are reacting to all of those things. And they're allocating to a variety of different countries and sectors and growth areas, whether it's US tech or underappreciated areas like emerging markets. And everybody is considering their own specific challenges at one point in time.  But I think the more broad point for us is that, while there's unique issues related to each of those geographic areas, clients in all the regions and all types are really turning to us. And we've talked about the positive flows we've seen across the board delivering alpha and the fact that we had, in this particular quarter, a number of flows coming from clients in Europe and Asia. But I think we are obviously a global firm. We're investing globally, we're spending a lot of time and energy investing in our European franchise, as well as our Asian franchise. Larry has talked before about our commitment to becoming local in each of the countries in which we operate, which I think is reinforcing the commonality and the uniqueness of BlackRock brand, but trying to be specifically local to each of those countries and basically pushing a lot of the decision making closer to where the clients are more broadly as a firm. And I think trends around sustainability as well are obviously critically important as we see countries outside of the US adapting to that much more quickly than we are. So, I think it's just indicative of our global footprint and the fact that we're trying to basically invest all around the world to make sure that we can deliver for our clients. Laurence Fink : Dan, I would just add to what Gary said. I think it speaks very loudly of our comprehensive platform worldwide and our commitment to be local in every community we operate.  I would say the other thing is us really helping clients understand the utilization of ETFs. The US was years ahead of Europe and Asia. And Europe is slowly catching up. ETF adaptation in Europe and Asia is accelerating. And I would also say we are seeing more consistent retail flows in EMEA across all products. And so, I think this is \u2013 some of it is a new trend, but I think the trend towards ETFs is just the beginning of a big macro trend.  I also believe as more financial advisors worldwide are moving to fee base and are moving to more of a fiduciary relationship, it means more whole portfolio solutions. And no firm is better positioned because of our emphasis of being local, our comprehensiveness and our ability to work with our clients worldwide on the adaptation of more products and different products. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks? Laurence Fink : Thank you, operator. I want to thank all of you for joining us this morning and for your continued interest in BlackRock. Hopefully you could hear from all of us, we're very proud of the progress we made to help our clients navigate this turbulent investment landscape and building for our clients a more resilient portfolio.  I am more convinced than ever before of BlackRock's ability to meet our clients' challenges will continue to drive our growth in the future.  I've always said that companies with long-term visions and purpose at the center of their strategies are those that will succeed over the long run. BlackRock's long-term vision to build a platform that is centered around our clients is resonating. Our focus on the long term is fueling our investments in BlackRock's people, in all the communities where we operate and in our platform as we continue to evolve ahead of our clients' needs. I can assure you, we will continue to invest and innovate in the years to come and to serve all our stakeholders, our clients, our employees, our communities, and obviously, our shareholders.  This is still our purpose in helping more and more people experience financial wellbeing and a better hope for a better future. And I wish all of you a safe and healthy fourth quarter. Thank you.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Gerald [ph] and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference. Christopher Meade : Thank you. Good morning everyone. I\u2019m Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which list some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So, with that, I'll turn it over to Gary. Gary Shedlin : Thanks, Chris. Good morning and Happy New Year. I hope everyone and their families remain safe and healthy through the holidays, and it\u2019s my pleasure to present results for the fourth quarter and full year 2020. Before I turn it over to Larry, I\u2019ll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as adjusted-financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. Throughout BlackRock\u2019s history, we have consistently and systematically invested in our business with a commitment to serving clients, employees, shareholders, and the communities in which we live and operate. As a result, while the world faced unprecedented challenges in 2020, we were well prepared to provide clients with thought leadership, investment insights, and risk management tools to ensure the physical and emotional well being of our employees and to give back to our communities. BlackRock\u2019s strong performance during this challenging year is a testament to our diverse and resilient business model. Our steadfast focus on helping clients achieve their long-term goal and the dedication of our incredible people. We generated net inflows of $391 billion in 2020, representing 5% organic asset growth and 7% organic base fee growth meeting our organic growth target for the sixth time in the last 8 years. Importantly, we finished the year with increased momentum, generating $127 billion of total net inflows in the fourth quarter, reflecting record quarterly organic base fee growth of 13%. Strong performance from our entire active franchise along with near record iShares flows, which benefited from client de-risking and year-end tax planning contributed to this quarters robust organic base fee growth. We continued to play offense in 2020 as the strength and stability of our operating model allowed us to invest through volatile markets, both organically and inorganically, expand our full year operating margin and return approximately $3.8 billion of capital to our shareholders. Each of our critical growth priorities, including iShares, Aladdin, private markets, alpha generation, whole portfolio solutions, and sustainable investing drove significant growth during the year. Full year revenue of $16.2 billion was up 11%. Operating income of $6.3 billion rose 13%, and earnings per share of $33.82 was up 19% versus 2019. For the fourth quarter, BlackRock generated revenue of $4.5 billion and operating income of $1.8 billion, up 13% and 20% respectively from a year ago. Quarterly earnings per share of $10.18 was up 22% versus 2019 driven by higher non-operating income and a reduced diluted share count versus a year ago, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate in the current quarter. Non-operating results for the quarter included $153 million of net investment income, primarily driven by mark-to-market gains on our unhedged seed and co-investment capital. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 20%, reflecting $61 million of net discrete tax benefits. We currently estimate 23% as a reasonable projected tax run rate for 2021 though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of non-recurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation during the year. Fourth quarter base fees of $3.4 billion were up 10% year-over-year, primarily driven by 7% organic growth and the positive impact of market data and foreign exchange movements on average AUM, but partially offset by lower securities lending revenue and higher discretionary money market fees in the current quarter and strategic pricing investments over the last year. In addition, while fourth-quarter base fees were up 5% sequentially, the impact of lower securities lending revenue during the quarter driven by a continued tightening of cash spreads was the primary reason we saw a sequential decline of 0.2 basis points in our annualized effective fee rate despite the positive impact of strong organic base fee growth. As we look into 2021, based on current market conditions and the interest rates, we are planning for the possibility of lower securities lending revenue and higher discretionary money market fee waivers as compared to 2020. In isolation, this could have an additional 0.3 basis point negative impact on our fee rate this year as compared to our fourth quarter annualized base fee rate. Bear in mind that our higher interest rate environment and continued strong organic base fee growth could mitigate these headwinds, especially with continued momentum in our higher fee, active equity, and alternative businesses, and then nearly roughly -- and nearly 40% of gross money market fee waivers are generally shared with distributors reducing the impact on operating income. Fourth quarter performance fees of $419 million were up 75% year-over-year capping a record year for performance fees that totaled $1.1 billion more than double to 2019 levels. While this year's performance fees reflected strong alpha generation across the entirety of our alternative and long-only investment platforms, approximately 60% of the full year increase was attributable to a single hedge fund strategy that delivered exceptional performance during the year. Quarterly Technology Services revenue was up 11% year-over-year, and full year revenue of $1.1 billion increased 17% in part reflecting the impact of the eFront acquisition. While demand for integrated and resilient investment management technology to support effective risk management and operational efficiency remained strong, growth in 2020 technology services revenue was impacted by strength of [ph] sales and contracting cycles associated with the pandemic. In addition, year-over-year revenue growth also reflected certain eFront clients shifting from an on-premises license model, in which revenue is generally recognized upfront to a hosted model, which is more consistent with how we service our broader Aladdin community and where revenue is recognized over the life of a contract. As we anticipate more clients embracing eFront\u2019s hosted model, which will impact year-over-year revenue comparisons and in an effort to provide greater transparency into Aladdin\u2019s business momentum, we intend to begin disclosing growth in ACV, or annual contract value. ACV growth represents a point in time year-over-year comparison of our technology services revenue run rate and is more representative of how leading technology companies measure their top line growth. Technology Services ACV at year end, 2020 increased 12% versus a year ago, and we remain committed to low-to-mid-teens growth and ACV over the long term. Fourth quarter and full year advisory and other revenue decreased year over year, primarily reflecting the absence of PennyMac equity method earnings following the charitable contribution of our remaining equity stake in the first quarter of 2020 and lower advisory and transition management revenue during the year. Total expense increased 10% in 2020, driven primarily by higher compensation and non-core G&A expense. For the full year, compensation expense increased $571 million or 13%, primarily reflecting higher base and incentive compensation driven by higher performance fees and operating income. Recall that year-over-year comparisons of fourth quarter compensation expense are less relevant because we determine compensation on a full year basis. Overall G&A expense increased 7% year-over-year, reflecting higher levels of non-core items primarily related to the net impact of higher product launch costs, legal fees COVID-19 related costs and fixed asset impairments, offset by lower contingent fair value adjustments FX re-measurement expense and deal related costs during the year. Excluding approximately $280 million of non-core G&A expense incurred in 2020, which included $166 million of aggregate fund launch costs, core G&A expense for the year remained essentially flat compared to 2019 as higher technology and portfolio services fees were offset by lower T&E expense. Recall that we exclude the impact of fund launch costs from reporting our as adjusted operating margin. Our full year as adjusted operating margin of 44.9% was up 120 basis points versus 2019 and benefited from record performance fees and securities lending revenue during the year and a lower level of core G&A expense than anticipated. As we have previously stated, our business has never been better positioned to take advantage of the opportunities before us, especially amid industry consolidation disruption to deliver differentiated organic growth. And we remain deeply committed to investing responsibly and aggressively through market cycles and for the long term in order to optimize organic growth in the most efficient way possible. Consequently, our 2021 investment plan currently includes the repurposing of lower T&E expense back into our business to fund incremental investments in technology and market data in support of our sustainability and other growth initiatives. At present, excluding the impact of market data, taking into account our anticipated level of expense growth and more normalized level of performance fees and the current rate environment, which may impact year-over-year comparisons of sec lending revenue and money market fee waivers, we would anticipate a 2021 as adjusted operating margin generally in line with our 2020 results. We're also investing through prudent use of our balance sheet to best position BlackRock for continued success. During 2020, we allocated over $1 billion of new seed and co investment capital to support our growth and our year end portfolio now approximately is $3.5 billion. We also continue to make strategic minority investments. And as you will hear from Larry shortly, we will announce later today an investment in Clarity AI, a sustainability analytics and data science platform. And in the fourth quarter, we announced the acquisition of Aperio, a pioneer in customizing tax optimized index equity SMAs to enhance our wealth platform and provide whole portfolio solutions to ultrahigh net worth and advisors. Following the close of the period transaction in early February, we will incur additional intangible amortization expense relative to 2020. We also remain committed to systematically returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases and return an aggregate of $3.8 billion to shareholders in 2020. We repurchased approximately $1.5 billion worth of shares in 2020 and an average share price of $439 per share taking advantage of PNC decision to exit their ownership position in May. Since inception of our current capital management strategy in 2013, we have now repurchased over $10 billion of BlackRock stock, reducing our outstanding total shares by 11% and generating an unlevered compound annual return of 19% for our shareholders. At present, based on capital spending plans for the year and subject to market conditions, including the relative valuation of our stock price, we are targeting the repurchase of $1.2 billion of shares during 2021 consistent with our guidance a year ago. In addition and also subject to market conditions, we expect to see board approval later this month for an increase to our first quarter 2021 dividend. As you will hear more from Larry, BlackRock has never been better positioned to deliver for clients as we leverage our unique insights, guidance and solutions to help them meet their long term investment needs. Fourth quarter total net inflows of $127 billion, representing 7% annualized organic AUM growth and 13% annualized organic base fee growth were led by flows into iShares and our top performing active franchise. Full year net inflows of $391 billion were positive across active and index, all asset classes, client types and regions, and reflected broad based strength across iShares and active and cash strategies. Global iShares ETFs generated $185 billion of net inflows in 2020, representing 8% organic asset growth and 7% organic base fee growth. We saw strong growth in core in each of our strategic product areas and our precision exposures which benefited from risk on sentiment during the fourth quarter. Within our strategic products segment flows were led by fixed income and sustainable and we also saw in in-flows into factors despite the industry categories seeing outflows. The fourth quarter is typically our strongest quarter for iShares due to year-end rebalancing and tax planning. But this quarter was especially strong with net inflows of $79 billion representing 14% annualized organic asset growth and a record 17% annualized organic based fee growth reflecting the breadth of our product and client segments. BlackRock generated full year retail net inflows of $70 billion representing 10% annualized organic asset growth and 8% annualized organic based fee growth, significantly outperforming the broader mutual fund industry. Retail flows were positive in both the U.S. and internationally and reflected broad, based strength in active fixed income, equity and liquid alternatives. Fourth quarter retail net inflows of $35 billion reflected similar trends, but also included the seasonal impact of capital gains and dividend reinvestment. Institutional index net outflows of $29 billion in 2020 reflected equity net outflows partially offset by fixed income net inflows, as several large clients rebalance portfolios after significant equity market gains or tactically shifted assets to fixed income and cash. In addition, a large U.S. public pension client recently announced a diversification of their plan to meet revised guidelines. BlackRock will maintain management of the significant majority of the plans assets, but we do expect to transition approximately $55 billion of low fee index assets to another investment manager during the first half of 2021. While this transition will result in a significant net asset outflow, it will have a deminimis impact on our organic base fee growth for the year. BlackRock\u2019s institutional active franchise generated $32 billion of net inflows in 2020, reflecting broad based strength across all product categories, active net inflows were led by $14 billion of multi asset net inflows reflecting continued growth in our life path, target date, franchise, and significant momentum and our OCIO business. We also generated $7 billion of net inflows in active fixed income, primarily from activity among our insurance clients. Across retail and institutional client types, we generated a record $30 billion of active net equity net inflows for the year and have now delivered seven consecutive quarters of positive flows in this category. Flows were led by top performing franchises in Technology, Health Sciences and U.S. growth equities, as well as quantitative strategies. We remain well positioned for future growth in our active businesses with over 85% of fundamental active equity, systematic active equity and taxable fixed income assets performing above their respective benchmarks or peer medians for the trailing five year period. Overall, demand for alternatives also continued with $17 billion of net inflows into our illiquid and liquid alternative strategies during the year, driven by infrastructure, private equity solutions, credit and our multi strat and global event driven hedge funds. Momentum and fundraising remains strong, and we have approximately $24 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of strategies representing a significant source of future base and performance fees. BlackRock\u2019s cash management platform generated another $9 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter, even as the broader industry saw outflows and a record $113 billion of net inflows in 2020. During the fourth quarter, we incurred approximately $30 million of discretionary yield support waivers, and, as previously discussed, expect such fee waivers to increase in 2021. Finally, full year advisory net inflows of $20 billion were primarily linked to asset purchases managed by our financial markets advisory group. We called it revenue linked to these assignments is primarily reflected in the advisory and other revenue line of our income statement. This time last year, none of us could have predicted the unprecedented challenges that we and our clients around the world would face during 2020. By remaining true to our purpose, investing ahead of our client\u2019s needs and respecting our one BlackRock culture, we look back on 2020 as a year that included some of the strongest and proudest moments of our 32-year history. Our relationships with clients have never been deeper. And we believe in our platform, we believe our platform is as well positioned as it's ever been to meet the needs of all stakeholders over the coming years. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry. Laurence Fink : Thank you, Gary. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining the call. I hope you and all your loved ones are staying healthy and safe. For decades, BlackRock has built our strategy, platform and culture around staying in front of our client needs. We've deliberately invested in our business so that we are prepared to help clients navigate the most complex challenges of the investment landscape, and the world changes all around them. And that is showing up in results today. The hardships experienced by people globally in 2020, and inequalities further exasperated by the pandemic have only strengthened BlackRock\u2019s sense of responsibility to help millions of people build savings, to make savings easier and more affordable, advanced sustainable investing and contribute to a more resilient, global economy. The pandemic has taken a dramatic toll on all our lives, disrupting the way we work the way we live. At the same time, it has led to a profound shift in how economies and how societies even operate, creating opportunities to redesign our society for the future. Investors around the world, most of whom are saving for long term goals like retirement are experiencing the economic impact of the pandemic, which is leading to rising inequalities within and across nations continued low interest rates, even in the face of rising inflation expectations, and it's a tonic shift towards sustainable business practices. These trends will require investors to rethink portfolio allocation, and they are increasingly turning to BlackRock for insights and solutions, so they can fulfill their purpose on behalf of their stakeholders. Our diverse global investment platform with active and index strategies across all asset classes, integrated technology, data, and risk management, and global scale and connectivity enables us to deliver strong and consistent investment performance and for more stable outcomes for our clients. Our voice developed over years of managing assets for a diverse set of clients globally, has helped BlackRock partner with our clients and has helped us to advocate on their behalf. We encourage the companies, our clients are invested in to operate with a long term mindset, increased transparency and important sustainability factors and focus on all of their stakeholders and this is driving BlackRock\u2019s performance. BlackRock\u2019s differentiated approach is resonating with our clients worldwide, leading to deeper partnerships with them. And as you could see driving incredible momentum across our businesses. BlackRock generated $391 billion of total net inflows in 2020 representing 5% organic asset and 7% organic based fee growth. We delivered 11% revenue growth, 13% operating income growth, and 19% earnings per share growth. And on top of that, we were able to expand our margins by 120 basis points over a year-over-year basis. These results reflect the benefits of our consistent investments and the diversity of our platform. Flows were positive across all major client types, across all asset classes, and all geographic regions including more than $1 billion of net inflows in each of the 19 countries and into 104 different products. In strategic growth areas, we saw record client demand for active equities, sustainability, our cash products and our alternative investment strategies. We also generated 185 billion of net inflows into iShares ETFs and we also delivered a record $1.1 billion in technology services revenues. By supporting clients with solutions no matter their objective or risk preference, BlackRock is positioned to generate differentiated growth and invest for the future. Our long term strategy remains to focus on accelerating growth in iShares, accelerating our growth in illiquid alternatives, accelerating our growth in technology and making sure that performance and generating alpha is at the heart of BlackRock. We're doing this through delivering whole portfolio solutions and becoming the global leader in sustainable investing. These investments will benefit of course our shareholders that are benefiting all our stakeholders. Sustainable sustainability, recent inflection point this past year, driven by the convergence of business practices, regulation, technology advancements and we're seeing it across client preferences. BlackRock generated 68 billion of net inflows and sustainable strategies in 2020, representing over 60% organic growth, and we launched over 100 new products in 2020 to expand investor choice. We are seeing strong demand across client segments. Institutional clients are increasingly seeking sustainable strategies to mitigate exposures and to capture opportunities. While we have -- clients are using ETF building blocks, especially our sustainable iShares ETFs in both sustainable and traditional model portfolios. We recently surveyed investors representing $25 trillion in assets, who said they plan to double underscore double their allocations to sustainable products over the next five years to nearly 40% average from a level of approximately 18%. BlackRock sustainable investment platform is well positioned to meet this demand and we will continue to believe the $200 billion we managed today will go to $1 trillion and sustainable investments by the end of this decade. Clients worldwide are continuing to adopt ETFs throughout the year, and iShares drove $185 billion inflows in 2020. In the U.S. iShares ETFs crossed $2 trillion last week, doubling our size in just four years. Our European iShares generated nearly $60 billion in net inflows becoming increasingly important to our global growth. Overall, iShares ETFs particularly in the first quarter as it unlocked new sources of client demand with active managers ensures an asset owners globally. BlackRock\u2019s scale engineering, technology and ecosystem partnerships have enabled us to maintain robust liquidity across iShares ETFs and execute some of the largest rebalances in history, all with tight tracking air and while operating our platform fully remotely in this environment. We witnessed four defining moments in our ETF business in 2020. One, iShares outperformed in the face of the most severe market stress test in ETF history. Two, fixed income ETFs shied as a modernization for us for the $100 trillion bond market. Three, sustainable ETFs are making sustainable investing more accessible to investors. And four, we are seeing an increased adaptation of ETFs and well portfolios as more wealth management industry shifts towards a more fiduciary commission free model. We believe that these moments and BlackRock performance in them will continue to support and accelerate the long term growth of iShares and the broader ETF industry. More than 70% of our annual iShares flows were from strategic product segments led by fixed income and sustainable product categories. 2020 was a turning point for global clients adoption of fixed income ETFs and fixed income iShares generating $89 billion of inflows. We estimate that over 100 asset managers and asset owners globally were first time adopters in 2020 in fixed income ETFs, and 80% of our top active managers are now using our fixed income ETFs. Fixed income iShares is now a $690 billion business and we continue to believe it will grow to $1 trillion over the next two to three years. Sustainable iShares ETS saw a record $47 billion in net inflows in 2020 and AUM tripled year-over-year to $82 billion. We're rapidly expanding our product suite partnering with index and data providers to expand product choice in this category. With more than 140 iShare ETFs and index funds globally we have the broadest choice of any firm and our goal is to continue innovating so that more investors more people, more savers have greater access to sustainable strategies. Shift in the wealth management landscape towards digitization, centralization and outsourcing in both the United States and Europe are increasing ETF usage among these clients. Growth and model portfolios across all platforms is an example of how technology and the transparency of fee based wealth management are tailwinds for the ETF market. Model portfolios are driving approximately a quarter of iShares globally -- growth globally and we expect growth in models, especially customized models developed in partnership with clients to account for more than half of the iShares flows in the coming years. BlackRock is deepening partnerships with wealth managers and financial advisors globally by offering high quality insights and solutions across both index and active strategies. And no other firm can link those two strategies together. We are seeing strong demand for our top performing active mutual fund franchise even as a broader U.S. active mutual fund industry saw more than $250 billion of outflows in 2020. In November, we announced the acquisition of Aperio which will accelerate our lead leadership in the fast growing U.S. separately managed account space. Wealth managers are increasingly looking for partners who can provide personalization and whole portfolio solutions. And now BlackRock is well positioned to be the partner of choice for the full spectrum of wealth clients. We want to make it easy for wealth managers to access our investment strategies across funds ETFs, SMEs, and models and construct a more resilient, risk aware portfolio using our technology. Active strategies and strong performance after fees are critical in building efficient resilient portfolios. And as public markets, both equities and fixed income become more efficient. Clients are increasingly looking for a differentiated manager who can find differentiating sources of alpha. It's not just about beating a benchmark or peer medium, but delivering incremental, tangible dollar returns for clients. BlackRock's investments over time in integrated technology, data, risk management, scale global reach, and the interconnectivity is enabling us to generate strong investment performance at a time when clients need this performance the most. Our active business generated over $30 billion of alpha returns for clients in 2020, which is leading to more high demand than ever before. BlackRock generated $88 billion of total active inflows for the year including a record for BlackRock, $30 billion of active inflows and active equities. Private markets are also increasingly an important component for alpha and investor portfolios, as both growth assets and diversification. BlackRock has built a broad platform across infrastructure, private credit, real estate, and private equity to meet client demands. We more than doubled our illiquid alternative platform over the last five years, and today we manage $86 billion on behalf of clients. We raised a record $25 billion of client capital in 2020 led by infrastructure, private equity solutions, private credit, and the final close of our direct private equity long term private capital strategy. LTPC is one of the largest first time-funds raised to date with a total of $3.4 billion, and a great example of BlackRock's ability to innovate and organically developed private market solutions to beat our clients' evolving needs. And in an increasingly competitive environment for deploying capital, we are leveraging the benefits of BlackRock scale and size to deploy capital on behalf of clients. Our capital market team gives us a differentiated access to unique deal flow for clients in 2020. And this team alone helped us source 2,100 such opportunities. 20 years ago, we recognize the important value proposition Aladdin can provide for our clients. Today, our technology is a $1.1 billion revenue business. As more clients than ever before are looking for a unified technology platforms like Aladdin, that can support their whole portfolio across both public and private assets. And we are committed and remain focused on continuously evolving Aladdin for the next 20 years to come. As sustainability becomes a critical building block in all portfolios, our ambition is to put Aladdin at the center of sustainable investing, and address the challenges investors are facing and in the future. We launch Aladdin Climate to help clients better access both the physical risk of climate change and the transition risk to a low carbon economy on their portfolios. And we're committed to providing clients with everything they need for sustainable investings in Aladdin. Access to sustainability data, and its analytics, and tools to seamlessly implement sustainable portfolios. In line with this commitment, we made a minority investment in Clarity AI, which provides tools to access environmental and social impact, and we'll be connecting with the capabilities throughout Aladdin. Our ability to address clients challenges enables us to fulfill our purpose and drive strong, long term performance. Over the last five years, clients entrusted us with $1.5 trillion of net new assets, which in turn has enabled us to create over 3,500 jobs globally. And on top of all that, we delivered 141% total return for our shareholders. I am deeply humbled by how BlackRock 16,500 employees have supported each other and our clients throughout this challenging year, which is critical to our success in 2020, More than 90% of our employees and our annual employee opinion survey said, they are proud to work at BlackRock, and we remain committed to upholding our culture and everyday living our purpose. We built BlackRock because we believe in the long term growth of the capital markets, and the importance of being invested in the capital markets. Even today BlackRock only is 2% of the global financial assets. And we see tremendous opportunities ahead to continue supporting the growth of global capital markets, and helping more people invest and save. Everything we do is rooted in our culture of focusing on the long term, and we will be continuing to innovate using our scale and contributing to more equitable, resilient future, to benefit our clients, to benefit our employees, to benefit our shareholders, and the people in the communities where we live, where we work, where we operate. I firmly believe that the efforts of 2020 will position BlackRock to deliver value over the long term for all of our stakeholders. With that, let's open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. You may now ask your question. Laurence Fink : Good morning, Alex. Alex Blostein : Great. Good morning, Larry, good morning everyone, Happy New Year to you all. First question, I wanted to ask you guys around scale at BlackRock in relation to the margin guidance that you guys provided for 2021. I guess given the strong exit on the revenue front, this implies a pretty healthy pickup in spending. I know you talked about some specific areas like technology and market data, but can we maybe get a little more specificity on kind of what are the key areas where you expect to add into 2021? And again beyond that, how should we think about the ability of BlackRock to deliver positive operating leverage beyond 2021? Gary Shedlin : Thanks, Alex. It's Gary. Happy New Year. I'll take the first swag at that and then let others chime in. So, look, our performance in 2020 clearly reflects, as we've talked about at length a strategic commitment to investing responsibly in our business across market cycles and our margin of the year of 120 basis points improvement over last year benefited from a number of what I would call, items that we saw in 2020 that will be potentially a little different next year. And of course, we're trying to stare into a crystal ball like everybody else, but margin last year benefited from record performance fees. We had securities lending revenue that was also a record. And I think as we've talked about, we did have a lower level of core G&A expense than anticipated. So, if you think about it from my perspective, the margin pop we saw this year was probably a little bit higher than we would normally have expected. And as we stated previously, we've never been better positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us. And we are passionate as you know about investing responsibly and aggressively. So many have asked and in fact we were asked to your -- at your conference about our plans for next year, and whether we would drop some of those reduced core spending levels to the bottom line, and our view at this point is when we look out at the opportunities in front of us and what's happening in the industry that we see a very unique opportunity to continue playing offense maybe even a little harder and to invest that money back into the business to support incremental investments in technology, market data, and a variety of other areas to support those growth initiatives. So, when you say like what those are, I think it's very consistent with what we've talked about. I think we look to invest meaningfully higher next year, again, in terms of repurposing some of those dollars. And remember, we didn't really complete all of our investment plans. During the year, we put a hiring freeze on in 2020 in March and didn't really start rehiring until late in the third quarter. So, we're a little bit behind. So there's a little bit of catch up and there's a little bit of incremental that's going to happen, and strategically, I think private markets, iShares, Aladdin sustainability, whole portfolios, stewardship, China, which is obviously starting to ramp up as we're going to get operational there. In terms of technology, we are in the midst of our cloud migration. We are seeing opportunities in terms of tech infrastructure as well as health and safety improvements throughout the organization. So I think with that in mind, we feel that this is the right time for us to kind of ramp it up, and given that we saw a little bit of a higher margin this year than we would have anticipated it results in a little bit of a more moderated margin story for 2021. Operator : Your next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. You may now ask your question. Laurence Fink : Hi, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Hello there. How are you? Okay. So, if I look back on 2020, it's interesting, right? Because rates go to zero, and there's a lot of things at play, but you had really good fixed income flows, both active and passive, and that's continuing. I'm sure it is a big picture that goes into Larry's opening remarks. As people start thinking about higher rates and potential inflation on the outlook, how do you think asset allocations are going to change, particularly on the fixed income front? Gary Shedlin : Well, I don't have a crystal ball. So, right now the forward curve does show interest rates going up quite significantly as high as 180. Last time I looked for the ten-year. I -- we are saying -- we believe that because even at that rate, that is not going to change the allocation that remarkably because I do believe at that rate, liability rates are still going to be longer, and as a result the demand for equities will persist. But in terms of fixed income, we have not really seen much change in client preferences, they are consistently looking at products like SIO, which is a specialized fixed income product that is not targeted to is not targeted to -- is not targeted normally to duration. We expect to see more global demand in global bonds as a mechanism away from the potential lowering of the U.S. dollar. We will -- we are continuing to see emerging markets beginning to show interest as a macro trade. And we continue to see more and more interest in private markets, in private credit. So I -- and in which we are strong in all of these. So, I don't think you're going to see a persistent large scale rebalancing out of core fixed income assets. The positive side, I would say if rates go up for the yield curve, it's going to make obviously the banking system to be much stronger. It's going to make lending even easier to be had. I think a rising yield curve is a positive sign for the economy. And so all of that, in my mind leads to probably better equity valuations. Rob, do you have anything you wanted to add to that? Rob Kapito : Yes. I think that demand is still going to outstrip supply. But I think, Glenn, the way we look at it is as people allocate to fixed income, they're going to allocate differently. And the fixed income iShares flows are going to benefit from the low-rate environment, as we've already started to see. And as people start to do this reallocation, this is why we've seen as Larry mentioned in his opening remarks, over 100 new asset managers and asset owner clients come into fixed income but come in through iShares. And a good statistic is 80% of the top asset managers are now using fixed income ETFs. So we think there's still demand, but the demand is going to be shown differently as they come in, and we're very well positioned in our iShare business to take that money in fixed income. Operator : Your next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. You now ask your question. Laurence Fink : Hey, Craig, Happy New Year. Year. Craig Siegenthaler : Hey, good morning, Larry. Happy New Year, and hope you guys are all doing well. Actually is on scale. We've all witnessed the pickup in M&A activity in the asset management industry. And many CEOs have discussed the need for distribution scale. And since BlackRock is the largest asset manager in the world with the largest distribution platform globally, I just wanted to hear your perspective on BlackRock unique distribution scale advantage. And also, do you think firms that have a trillion or 500 billion of AUM really need to buy their firms to improve their scale? And also hoping Gary can chime into just given his deep background in M&A? Laurence Fink : So why don't you start on that one part and I'll finished last part? Gary Shedlin : Sorry, I'm not on. So as we think about -- I guess it was a two-part question. Your first question was on scale and how do we think about that in the context of M&A, Craig? Or is it what are the unique scale? Craig Siegenthaler : First question is on, talk about BlackRock's unique distribution scale advantage? And then, as you look at the industry do you think other firms that are fairly large, but not the same size as BlackRock. Do they really need to buy other firms to improve their scale? And is that a real advantage for them? Gary Shedlin : I'm going to try to avoid commenting on what other firms should do. But obviously, as you know, our competitive advantage in terms of what we believe drives a lot of our value proposition is global reach, is best-in-class technology, risk management, diverse investment capabilities across the spectrum of active and passive. And then, obviously, to be able to bring all of that -- all of that together. We've been at that now for well over a decade, in terms of not only trying to identify the pieces that we need, but also integrating those pieces into a distinct and unique one BlackRock culture. We think that's really critical to our success today, both in terms of being able to reach clients with boots on the ground, as Larry mentioned, 16,000 plus people, over half of those people are outside of the Americas these days, having capabilities to have thoughtful investment discussions by virtue of the fact that we are local in our local markets. And Larry talks about that a lot. And obviously, I don't think that there's really a great opportunity for a number of our competitors to just recreate Aladdin overnight in terms of those capabilities. So, I think, again, breadth of product, breadth of reach, breath of insight, all brought together with technology and risk management creates this unique franchise that frankly seems to be humming on multiple cylinders today. And I think, we -- do we view that as unique? Yes. Do we view it as something that other people could create, potentially, but I'll leave that to the challenge. But as I said, we've been doing this for a decade, and it's going to take quite a long time for people to try to replicate I think what we have right now. Laurence Fink : Let me try to respond to the first part of the question. I believe our distribution platform has been buttress quite a bit over the last five years has been a long term commitment. We are providing a uniqueness as Gary suggested across the world in terms of providing that conversation that intersects both active and passive and risk analytics. No firm can do this at this moment. I believe the elevation of content by the wealth manager has been one of the giant changes too. As the wealth management industry has moved away from fee base to an advisory base, they've really elevated their ability to have deeper, broader conversations. And they're looking for a few partners who could work with them and build that out. And we are certainly kind of one of the go-to firms. We're helping that. And we're able to help them deliver that global insight and advice, and more importantly, the solutions that helping them. So it is the combinations of having iShares interactive strategy. But now with the overlay of technology to customize portfolios. And today, the customization of portfolios and personalizing a portfolio is becoming more and more in need in the wealth management space. It is not about selling a bond fund or a stock fund anymore. It is not about buying a stock or a bond. It is about a holistic whole solution portfolio. And so, our uniqueness is about that and how we deliver it. Just as a response to the industry, the industry has been always designed around a specific product, a specific fund. And for the firms who only have a product or in one asset category, they have a difficult time to really respond to whole portfolio solutions. And I believe this customization, the personalization of whole portfolio solutions is becoming the driver, the driver in terms of most of the wealth management conversations. Do we need to do more acquisitions for distribution? Not in the United States, not in the Europe. Could we do somewhere in another part of the world where we don't have a strong footprint? Sure. That is consistent what I've said over the last three to five years. And importantly, what we are going to do like we announced today they Clarity AI minority interest. What we are trying to do is provide in this portfolio customization, also uniqueness and data and analytics to drive better decision making, which will ultimately drive better performance. And I think that is also the uniqueness of BlackRock. And why we are so constructive on the opportunities we have working with wealth managers worldwide. Operator : Your next question comes from Robert Lee with KBW. You may now ask your question. Laurence Fink : Hey, Rob, Happy New Year. Robert Lee : Hey. Everyone, Happy New Year. Hope everyone is doing well. Thanks. Larry, I guess a regulatory question. It does feel like after being pretty quiet and dormant for bunch of years, starting to see more talk about relooking at asset managers for their systemic risk and everything. So just kind of maybe your take on where you see -- if you see, where you see that kind of chatter picking up? Is it more in Europe or here? I mean, your perspective, I think would be helpful? Laurence Fink : Great question. We've built BlackRock around the whole foundations of strong global capital markets. I think we have been a big beneficiary over the years by we believed in global capital markets, and the expansion of global capital markets over the last 20 years. And I think the size of our footprint and the size of the AUM that we managed is because of our commitment to building broad scale capital markets. One of the interesting points I said this at the end of the -- my speech today. Our size, relative to the global capital markets, is almost virtually unchanged to what it was in 2009. So in 2009, we were under 2% of the global capital markets. And today, we're a little bit over 2% of the global capital markets. So as much as we've grown the world, capital markets have grown. The use of government debt as a mechanism finance deficit has grown. The use of the equity markets for IPOs and new companies and the expansion of other countries expanding their capital markets, whether the capital markets expansion in the Middle East or parts of Asia have been really quite extraordinary. So we are benefiting that. What we need in that. And we've always welcomed that. We need to make sure that regulators focus on a well functioning capital markets to build a more resilient economy. So we have encouraged regulation worldwide to ensure well functioning capital markets. And that is the key criteria, how we look at it. I would say the one myth about asset managers. The asset manager industry is highly regulated already. At BlackRock, we are regulated by the SEC. Because we have a Trust Bank. We're regulated by the OCC. We're regulated by the CFTC by FINRA, overseas, we're regulated across the board. We are not a bank. And that's why we are not regulated by one regulator, the Federal Reserve. But we're regulated by almost any other organization and regulator. The asset management industry is still highly fragmented. And so, I believe, we welcome a conversation. And we are encouraged about how regulators are focusing on the need of a well functioning capital market. But the concept of that asset management industry is not regulated, that must be coming from bankers. We're not a bank. We don't -- all $8.7 trillion of our assets are other people's hard earned savings and money. We have a contract with every one of our clients. In most of our short term funds, mutual funds, ETFs, they could sell those assets in a day. And our institutional liquid portfolios, they could do it over 30 days. And depending on some of the long term, private assets, that depends on the contract that we have with each individual client. But the notion that asset managers are not regulator, it's just a myth. It is not true. But as the largest asset manager in the world, as a fiduciary, to all our clients savings, we want a highly functioning markets. And at the time when markets need more supervision, in almost all cases, we have been systematically in favor of ensuring market safety and soundness. And we will encourage that going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. You may now ask your question. Ken Worthington : Hi, good morning. I'm curious your views on the outlook for tax managed investing in the aftermath of COVID. And the outlook for higher personal income and investment taxes in the U.S. and abroad. To what extent might demand here provide another catalyst for ETFs and direct indexing growth inside and outside the U.S. into the outlook for tax managed investing contributes your interest in Aperio? Rob Kapito : Well, the answer is yes. But it comes under a broader picture and that is, we're seeing increased demand for what is called personalization and customization. And that includes tax managed, it also includes ESG, and includes factor preferences. And as mentioned before, wealth managers are looking to do more with fewer partners. So they want partners who can offer whole portfolio solutions. And that's why we are positioning ourselves to be the partner of choice. With our acquisition of Aperio, we are further enhancing our value proposition for whole portfolio SMAs [ph] across equity, fixed income, alpha factors, and index solutions. Because ultimately, we want to make it easy for wealth managers to access our investment strategies across funds, ETFs SMAs, even models, and be able to construct more resilient risk aware portfolios using our technology. So we're seeing as a result of our investment in serving more and more wealth managers, we saw 185 billion of iShare close. We're seeing strong active flows, including inflows across active mutual funds, even as the industry saw outflows. And we're reaching out to more advisors with our advisor center and our partnership with investment. Now, on the self-indexing part of your question. Look, self-indexing. indexing certainly has some advantages. And the advantages are cost and flexibility. So we're exploring constantly self-indexing in areas where there aren't well defined indices. And that would be in smart beta, in fixed income, factors, in ESG. And currently, we have six self-index ETFs. So we also continue to have great relationships with our index providers. And we believe this often significant value in having a third party provider. And clients especially institutions, often value that brands and are benchmarked to those particular indices, as well the major index providers, they provide services more than just the brand. They provide research, IP tracking, corporate events. So, we're also seeing better price competition among the index providers and the sharing of IP. And I think you've also seen our recently announced collaboration with Morningstar focused on enhancing style investing for clients to better represent the size and style mandates in the U.S. equity market. So, a lot set, but a lot of that has to do with this customization, this personalization. And as you rightfully say, a lot of that is going to be focused on tax going forward, and we want to be positioned well for that. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks? Laurence Fink : Thank you, operator. Thank you all for joining this morning for your continued interest in BlackRock. BlackRock's 2020 results are a direct result of a steadfast commitment to serve our clients and putting their needs at the center of everything we do. We will continue to invest and innovate in the years to come so we can be better helping millions of people to build up savings, to make investments easier, more affordable. We're going to continue to advance sustainability investment and contribute to a more resilient economy. All of that in my mind will be continuing to drive the success of BlackRock in 2021 and beyond. Everyone have a good start. Everyone, please feel safe. Everyone, please stay healthy. And everyone please get a vaccination. Thank you. Bye-bye now.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Jerome, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock, Incorporated First Quarter 2021 Earnings Teleconference. Our hosts for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference. Christopher Meade : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which list some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.  So, with that, I'll turn it over to Gary. Gary Shedlin : Thanks, Chris and good morning everyone. I hope everyone and their families are remaining safe and healthy. It's my pleasure to present results for the first quarter of 2021. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer this comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as adjusted results. BlackRock's platform has been built over time to help clients meet their objectives regardless of market environment or risk appetite. We've invested for years to develop industry-leading franchises in high growth areas, such as ETFs, private markets, technology, and more recently sustainable investing, so we can help clients construct resilient, whole portfolios that leverage both active and index capabilities. While few of us could have predicted that we would still be confronting the human and economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic a year later, the events of the past year have only strengthened our resolve to continue to invest for future growth in order to evolve our business, live our purpose and meet the needs of all of our stakeholders, including clients, employees, shareholders, and the communities in which we operate. The investments BlackRock has consistently made to build a best-in-class investment in technology platform centered around a fiduciary mindset where clients always come first in a collaborative and unifying one BlackRock culture that encourages emotional ownership are driving incredible momentum across our entire business. BlackRock generated record net inflows of $172 billion in the first quarter, our fourth consecutive quarter with over $100 billion in quarterly inflows, representing 8% annualized organic asset growth and 14% annualized organic base fee growth. Strong performance from our entire active franchise, once again, contributed to this quarter's robust organic fee growth. Over the last 12 months, our broad-based platform pairing diverse investment capabilities with best-in-class technology and rigorous risk management has now generated over $525 billion of total net inflows, representing 14% organic base fee growth, well in excess of our 5% long-term target. First quarter revenue of $4.4 billion increased 19% year-over-year, while operating income of $1.5 billion rose 21% and reflected the impact of approximately $180 million of costs associated with the launch of the nearly $5 billion BlackRock Innovation and Growth Trust, our largest closed-end fund ever in late March. Earnings per share of $7.77 was up 18% compared to a year ago, also reflecting lower non-operating income and a higher effective tax rate, partially offset by a lower diluted share count in the current quarter. Non-operating results for the quarter included $8 million of net investment income as gains in our co-investment portfolio were largely offset by the mark-to-market impact of our minority stake in Envestnet. Our as adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 21% and included $39 million of discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vest in the first quarter of each year. We continue to estimate the 23% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2021, so the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of non-recurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation during the year. First quarter base fee and securities lending revenue of $3.6 billion was up 18% year-over-year, primarily driven by strong organic base fee growth and the positive impact of market beta and foreign exchange movements on average AUM, partially offset by higher discretionary money market fee waivers, lower securities lending revenue, and the effect of one less day in the current quarter and strategic pricing investments over the last year. Sequentially, base fee and securities lending revenue was up 6%. On an equivalent day count basis, our effective fee rate was essentially flat compared to the fourth quarter, a strong organic base fee growth driven by our higher fee active businesses more than offset higher discretionary money market fee waivers and lower securities lending revenue in the current quarter. Performance fees of $129 million were up significantly from a year ago, reflecting strong performance in our liquid alternative and long-only investment platforms and the impact of COVID related market volatility a year ago. Quarterly technology services revenue increased 12% from a year ago. Annual contract value, or ACV, increased 16% year-over-year, reflecting particularly strong growth from the first quarter of 2020, which was impacted by slower sales and contracting disruption in the early days of the pandemic. We remain committed to low to mid teens growth in ACV over the long-term Aladdin's resilience has been a key differentiator throughout the COVID crisis, and client demand remains strong. As Larry will discuss in more detail, we see tremendous opportunity to continue building out Aladdin's climate and sustainability risk analytics and data capabilities, making it central to constructing sustainable portfolios of the future. Advisory and other revenue was down $33 million year-over-year, primarily reflecting the absence of PennyMac equity method earnings following the charitable contribution of our remaining equity stake in the first quarter of 2020, as well as lower transition management revenue in the current quarter. Total expense increased 17% versus the year ago quarter, driven primarily by higher compensation, direct fund and non-core G&A expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up 24%, primarily reflecting higher incentive compensation driven by higher operating income and performance fees and higher deferred compensation, reflecting additional grants and the mark-to-market impact of certain deferred compensation programs relative to depressed levels a year ago. Approximately 80% of the increase in our compensation to revenue ratio year-over-year was attributable to this mark-to-market impact on certain deferred compensation programs. Direct fund expense increased 16% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher average index AUM. G&A expense was up $32 million year-over-year, and the $111 million sequentially reflecting approximately $180 million of previously disclosed closed-end fund launch costs. Recall that we exclude the impact of these product launch costs when reporting our as adjusted operating margin. Year-over-year G&A comparisons were also impacted by approximately $155 million of non-core G&A expense in the first quarter of 2020, which included closed-end fund launch costs, contingent consideration fair value adjustments and costs related to certain legal matters. On a core basis, quarterly G&A expense was essentially flat year-over-year, as higher portfolio services and technology expense was offset by lower T&E, marketing spend and professional fees. Quarterly G&A expense also benefited from a delay in planned spending in a number of areas, which we expect to incur over the remainder of the year. And tangible amortization expense increased $9 million year-over-year as a result of the acquisition of Aperio, which closed on February 1st. Our first quarter as adjusted operating margin of 44.4% was up 270 basis points from a year ago, benefiting in part from significantly lower level of non-core G&A expense versus a year ago and the delayed timing of certain investments spend in the current quarter. As we stated in January, our business has never been better positioned to take advantage of the opportunities before us, and we remain committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible. We continue to see numerous opportunities to invest for growth, including sustainable investing, private markets, technology, and China, and intend to pursue these opportunities responsibly. Our capital management strategy remains first to invest in our business and then to return excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We continue to invest through prudent use of our balance sheet to best position BlackRock for continued success, through seed and co-investments to support organic growth and through tactical M&A and strategic minority investments to accelerate our growth ambitions. During the first quarter, we closed our acquisition of Aperio, and as Larry will discuss in more detail, announced a partnership with Temasek to co-invest in innovative decarbonization technology. We previously announced a 14% increase in our quarterly dividend to $4.13 per share of common stock and also repurchased $300 million worth of common shares in the first quarter. While we will remain opportunistic with respect to additional share repurchases during the year, there is no change to the minimum repurchase guidance we provided to you earlier this year. As you'll also hear from Larry, BlackRock has never been better positioned to deliver for clients as we leverage our unique insights, guidance, and solutions to help them meet their long-term investment needs. Record net inflows of $172 billion in the first quarter, including $133 billion of long-term flows reflect the strength of our broad-based franchise with positive flows across every asset class, investment style, client channel and region. Our iShares and BlackRock ETFs generated net inflows of $68 billion, representing 10% annualized organic asset and base fee growth. Results highlight the diversity of the product segments within our ETF franchise with growth led by continued strength in core equity and sustainable ETFs. We also saw strong flows into our higher feed liquid markets driven precision exposures, as clients continued to rerisk, particularly in international equities and tactically position their portfolios for the reopening of economies worldwide. First quarter fixed income ETF flows of $1.6 billion reflected demand for shorter term and floating rate bond exposures, which was largely offset by outflows from longer duration ETFs, especially LTV as investors reacted to the most significant steepening in the yield curve since 2013. These inflows, even with the drag from longer duration products, speak to the diversity of our fixed income ETF franchise, which will continue to benefit from strong long-term secular growth. Record retail net inflows of $37 billion, representing 17% annualized organic asset growth and 25% annualized organic base fee growth were positive in both the U.S. and internationally and across all major asset classes, including fixed. Inflows reflected broad-based strength across the entirety of our top performing active platform, which is well-positioned to capture resurging demand for active equities and investor appetite for yield, where our diversified fixed income range, including unconstrained high yield, international and broad market strategies are positioned to meet client demand in any rate environment. BlackRock's institutional active franchise generated $17 billion of net inflows led by continued growth into our LifePath target date and alternatives platforms. Institutional index net inflows of $11 billion once again reflected equity net outflows, which were more than offset by fixed income net inflows, as clients rebalanced portfolios after significant equity market gains or sought to immunize portfolios through LDI strategies. As previously discussed in January, we expect a large U.S. public pension client to transition approximately $55 billion of low fee index assets to another investment manager. This transition is likely to occur during the second quarter of 2021 and will have a de minimis impact on our organic base fee growth for the year. Across our retail and institutional client businesses, we generated a record $21 billion of active equity net inflows, representing our eighth consecutive quarter of positive flows in this category. Flows were led by top performing franchises in technology and Midcap growth, which benefited from the previously mentioned launch of the BlackRock Innovation and Growth closed-end fund. We remained well-positioned for future growth in our active businesses with over 80% of fundamental active equity, scientific active equity and taxable fixed income assets performing above their respective benchmarks or peer median for the trailing five-year period. Demand for alternatives were also continued, with nearly $9 billion of net inflows into liquid and illiquid alternative strategies during the quarter, driven by infrastructure, private equity solutions and liquid alternatives funds. Fundraising momentum remain strong, and we have approximately $27 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of alternative strategies, representing a significant source of future base and performance fees. Finally, BlackRock's cash management platform continued to grow and outperform peers, generating almost $40 billion of net inflows in the first quarter and topping $700 billion in assets under management for the first time. During the first quarter, we incurred approximately $78 million of gross discretionary yield support waivers, and expect such discretionary fee waivers to persist for the near term, especially in light of the recent growth in our U.S. government fund franchise and the supply demand dynamics in the short dated U.S. treasury and repo markets. Future levels of discretionary fee waivers will be impacted by several factors, including the level of AUM and funds with existing waivers, gross yields and competitive positioning. Our strong performance over the last 12 months is a testament to our purpose, the strong execution of our strategy, the competence our clients place in us, and the hard work commitment and resilience of our employees. Our relationships with clients have never been deeper, and we will continue to invest responsibly from a position of strength to meet the needs of all of our stakeholders over the coming years. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry. Laurence Fink : Thanks, Gary. Good morning to everyone. And I want to thank all of you for joining the call. I hope you -- excuse me -- hope you and your loved ones are continuing to stay healthy and safe. We are reporting earnings today from our headquarters in New York City, and I'm incredibly energized by being all together as a group, as a team, as partners. I'm cautiously optimistic for a return to normalcy in the coming months as vaccinations rollout. And I'm looking forward to seeing all of our stakeholders in person again. The strong results BlackRock saw this quarter or the outcome of a multiyear investments we've made in our asset management and technology platform to better serve our clients worldwide, more than ever before we are seeing the benefits of these long-term investments resonating. We have stronger results and deeper relationships with the clients across their entire portfolios. We generated $527 billion of net inflows and a record 14% organic base fee growth over the last 12 months, including a very strong 2021. Over a decade ago, we acquired iShares based on our conviction in the value proposition of ETFs. Our continuous investments in our platform since then to help more clients use ETF to build better portfolios have fueled iShares growth from $385 billion during the acquisition to more than $2.8 trillion today. We began expanding our alternative platform more than five years ago. And today, we manage nearly $200 billion in these strategies for all our clients. Our leadership in alternatives only just begun and we're seeing momentum accelerate, as we scale our offerings, as we source our capabilities and our integration of data and technology into the management of private markets assets. We've been investing in all aspects of our Aladdin Technology to better serve our client's needs. We saw demand for a unified whole portfolio of technology, and we enhanced Aladdin with eFront to offer portfolio construction and risk analytics capability in one view across all public and all private markets. We created an end-to-end platform that enables straight-through processing between the asset owners, the asset managers, the custodians through Aladdin provider. We created Aladdin Wealth to help financial advisors build better portfolios for millions of clients around the world. We recognize the growing impact of sustainability risks and the opportunities on our client's portfolios. And as I will discuss in more detail later on, we are investing to systematically integrate climate and broader sustainable factors across all our investment offerings and risk management processes. We manage over $200 billion in long-term sustainable assets today. And more recently as well, clients increasingly focus on the importance of after tax returns and their investment, we acquired Aperio to enhance BlackRock's ability to meet these client's needs. The investments we made and continue to make in our platform enables BlackRock to have a holistic perspective and a voice that resonates with our stakeholders. More clients than ever before are turning the BlackRock for insights and for guidance. They want to hear from us on topics such as how to position their portfolio for rising interest rates and inflation. How should they think about the U.S. deficits? How to think about the potential opportunities from new infrastructure policies, and how to invest for a net zero world? We're vocal on issues that are important to our stakeholders, like cultural issues that impact our employees, that policies that impact our communities. We speak loudly and work for all our stakeholders. The benefits of BlackRock's differentiating approach are clear in the strength and consistency of our results. As Gary told you, our total net inflows of $172 billion in the first quarter were diversified across all client types, asset classes, investment styles, and regions, and represented an 8% annualized organic asset growth and a record 14% annualized organic base fee growth. As a COVID-19 vaccine rollout continues and restrictions are eased, a significant acceleration of economic activity is anticipated, despite the consistently high numbers of cases around the world and now the introduction of many new variants. Investors are navigating their portfolio through uncertainty, such as the strength of the reopening, structural changes to the economies and fiscal policy and consequences for growth in inflation when activity is more fully restored. Interest rates coming off, historically lower levels have put pressure on fixed income assets and led to a rotation within equity from growth to value. Unlike the taper tantrum of 2013 however, the reason rising rates been gradual as investors look for greater compensation for holding longer duration bonds and investor appetite for risk assets remain very strong. There is a lot of money in motion today. The level of fiscal support we have seen over the past year is four times that of a global financial crisis, but many investors continue to keep significant amounts of cash on the sidelines. To reach their investment goals, they will need to deploy that money in solutions that provide yield and preservation of their assets. BlackRock has deliberately built our industry-leading fixed income business to meet client's needs regardless of the rate environment. Changing rates that manifest in rotating within fixed income and BlackRock diversified platform and strong active performance with 84% of our taxable fixed assets above benchmark appear medium for three-year period was well-positioned for the demand. We saw $17 billion in net inflows and active fixed income driven by unconstrained total return, municipals, international, and high yield bond funds. Client demand for active strategies continue to accelerate at BlackRock. BlackRock generated $59 billion of active net inflows across asset classes in the first quarter, including another record quarter for active equities. Strong active flows included the nearly $5 billion launch of the BlackRock Innovation and Growth Trust, the second largest ever closed-end fund launch in the United States by innovating and product structure, generating strong investment performance and offering strategies aligned with the needs of our clients. We are leading the turnaround of the closed-end fund IPO market. BlackRock strong active performance and flows are a direct result of these investments that I spoke about to build a platform with collaborative intelligence, advanced data and technologies in a whole portfolio approach. We have never, ever been more better positioned to deliver durable alpha for our clients. And I am confident we will continue to capture more demand for active strategies as we further strengthen our platform and invest in our platform. In liquid alternatives we are seeing the magnitude of client flows increase every year. In the first quarter, we generated a record $11 billion of inflows and commitments. Results spanning from private credit to infrastructure to private equity solutions, including the final close of inaugural $3 billion private equity secondary fund. Infrastructure investments will be a key component of long-term returns in client portfolios as governments launched long overdue infrastructure products and projects to restart their economies and build for a more resilient future. The $2 trillion infrastructure plan in the United States will create significant opportunities for putting capital to work in this asset class. Within infrastructure, renewables represent more than 50% of the transactions globally. And BlackRock is well-positioned with one of the industry's largest renewable power franchises. We recently closed the third vintage of our global renewable power fund raising nearly $5 billion, which is more than the first and second vintage combined. iShares and BlackRock ETF generated $68 billion of net inflows in the first quarter, the strongest start to a year in our history. Importantly, flows reflect the diversity of our ETF platform and the benefits of strategic investments we made over time to support the adaptation of ETFs. The evolution of new uses, the reduction in barriers like emissions and growth in areas such as model portfolios. The work we are doing to expand our sustainable iShares business is the great example of how we continue to innovate ahead of our client's needs. We generated $17 billion of net inflows in the quarter across the sustainable iShares spectrum from screens to thematic strategies. We recently crossed $100 billion of AUM in this category, up from $26 billion just a year ago. The global transition to a net zero economy will impact every company's growth prospects and BlackRock believes these -- believes that they are adapting and pivoting their strategies and business models ahead of this tectonic shift that will outperform over the long-term. Every investor will need to position their portfolios accordingly, and BlackRock is investing to provide clients with more choice as we become a leader in sustainable and climate aware investing. We launched two low carbon transition readiness ETF last week, raising a total of nearly $2 billion, representing the largest ETF launch in U.S. history. Traditionally climate products have been backward looking really focused on reported greenhouse gas emissions. Using advanced data and analytics and research driven by insights, BlackRock developed a forward-looking active climate investments strategy and a transparent active ETF vehicle. These active ETFs are the first of their kind and a great example of how BlackRock is innovating to expand access to sustainable strategies for more investors worldwide. In total, BlackRock manages $353 billion in sustainable investments, including cash. And we believe this category will grow to more than $1 trillion by 2030. Sustainable investing presents opportunities for BlackRock, not only in terms of AUM growth, but in the demand for industry-leading technology and data. As sustainability becomes a critical building block in portfolios, investors need a clear understanding of how sustainable related risks and opportunities impact their portfolio. One of the newest opportunities for BlackRock is powering portfolios to a new sustainable standard with Aladdin, because climate risk is investment risk. Our ambition to make Aladdin Climate the standard for assessing this risk with investors portfolio and helping clients navigate and capture investment opportunity presented by the transition to a net zero economy. Investments we have made in Aladdin over the years to serve more clients with better risk analytics end-to-end operating systems and the benefited scale drove a 12% year-over-year growth in technology services revenues. We consistently hear from clients that poor quality or availability of ESG data and analytics is the biggest barrier to deeper and broader implementation of sustainable investing. That is why we're evolving Aladdin sustainability to help clients better assess their exposures and their positions across all their portfolios. Our minority investment in Clarity AI will integrate analytics and data covering 30,000 companies and nearly 200 companies within Aladdin. And our partners who have rep risks will give clients the ability to identify ESG risk exposures in private investments and create a holistic view of risk across their portfolios. Advancing towards a net zero economy by 2050 will require more than better data and analytics. It will require transformational innovation in carbon reduction and elimination -- eliminating technologies. BlackRock has partnered with Temasek to establish decarbonization partners to invest in innovative decarbonization solutions to help accelerate global efforts. This initiative will provide clients with an opportunity to participate in a net zero transition by complimenting BlackRock's existing renewable power and energy infrastructure investment platform. In line with our strategic focus on technology and sustainability, we nominated Hans Vestberg, Chairman and CEO of Verizon to our Board of Directors for his deep experience in international markets, technology and sustainability. The same time I want to thank Mathis Cabiallavetta for his passion and his dedication to BlackRock and its shareholders over the last 13 years. He will not stand for reelection at BlackRock Annual Meeting next month, and it will be missed by our entire board and by me and the entire leadership team at BlackRock. Our results and the speed of our forward momentum underscores the importance of BlackRock's fiduciary approach and culture. I truly believe our culture is what set BlackRock apart. It drives our performance. It pushes us to innovate. It pushes us to stay ahead of our client's needs. And it guides our decisions, and it guides our behaviors. Critical to our culture is building an environment of inclusivity, belonging, trust, and creating a safe environment. More than ever before at BlackRock leadership team And I are focused on instilling this culture with all of our 16,700 employees around the world [technical difficulty] feels a sense of belonging. The strength of our first quarter results across iShares private markets, technology and active and sustainable strategies is more broad-based today that any point in our history, but our global scale and our unique client interactions give us greater ability to invest in our client's future and ultimately for the benefit of our shareholders. I see tremendous opportunities ahead for BlackRock's focus remaining on embracing change, investing for the long-term so we could best serve all our stakeholders. And I look forward to executing on our ambitious plans in the years ahead. With that operator, let's please open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brian Bedell : Great. Laurence Fink : Hey, Brian. Brian Bedell : Thank you. Good. Hey, good morning. Congrats on fantastic quarter again. A two-part question on sustainable investing. Just first wanted to make sure I get the numbers correct. I heard $353 billion in sustainable AUM and I also heard -- I thought I heard you say $200 billion. I just wanted to make sure those -- what those two numbers were. And then in the 1Q flows, we have $17 billion of iShares, but what additional flows would be coming into other sustainable products. And then the broader question would be on the Temasek partnership and more broadly for carbon transition. Obviously, a huge evolving field. As you thought about what the asset management TAM might be in that field and how you might tackle that through not only this partnership, but that obviously through the ETFs you launched in other products as well. Laurence Fink : Well, first I apologize that we created any confusion. So, let's start. We do have $200 billion, sustainable long-term assets. Brian Bedell : Okay. Laurence Fink : The difference is we have a broad base cash management space that is becoming more and more sustainable. So, if you add the cash side or the short term cash, it comes up to that $300 billion number. I hope I answered that question properly now. Brian Bedell : Yeah. Laurence Fink : Two, I think, the opportunity in transition is amazing. It is estimated we need to spend $50 trillion to have a decarbonized world and to do that is investing in new technologies. And we are very pleased at having a partner in Temasek, and we have had many conversations with them related to how can we bring the world closer to a decarbonized world without a premium or without a green premium. And this is specifically so relevant, not just in the United States, but it's so relevant in the emerging world. The emerging world is still growing and still has a greater need for electricity, greater need for building. The emerging world is just at the beginning of their economic growth. And so, if we are going to get to a net zero world, the need for innovation and investing for green hydrogen to bring that premium down to zero for biofuels, for sequestering carbon at a very inexpensive price, all of these are going to require new technologies for agriculture. Agriculture produces over -- close to 15% of the carbon footprint when you -- related to that. And so, we have many areas where it is going to require new technologies, and I truly believe we are going to have many young people instead of going into data and technology related to the social side of technology. I believe many, many innovations that are going to come from young startup innovative companies. But I would also say I am very bullish on our traditional hydrocarbon and chemical companies as they pivot. And I've had conversations recently with a CEO of a very large oil and gas company. Just yesterday I had a conversation with a CEO of a very large chemical company, and we're actually talking to them about how can BlackRock invest with them side by side on technologies for decarbonization. I mean, the science and technology that are existing companies in terms of the understanding of carbon and understand the science of transforming it to a more decarbonized world is great. And so, we are very encouraged about investing in startups, and that's what Temasek BlackRock decarbonization funded. But we actually are having many conversations about investing with our infrastructure teams, with our private teams, with our debt teams to finance this. We've had numerous conversations with companies related to biofuels. And so when we -- our employees are flying around the world that we could have a footprint that is net zero. And so, all of these are great opportunities for us and the investors worldwide. Gary Shedlin : And Brian, just to -- it\u2019s Gary. Just to -- quickly just capture what Larry was talking about in terms of long-term and total. The flow number in terms of sustainable strategies for the quarter was $24 billion long-term. That broke down into $17 billion in ETFs and $7 billion in what we would call active. And I would basically say that that was very broad-based across the platform and primarily equity, but also in fixed income multi-asset and all -- that represents in the aggregate on a long-term basis about a 50% annualized organic growth rate inflows. Operator : Your next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. Larry, I was hoping that you could expand upon the institutional backdrop today in terms of risk profile. And what -- how those conversations are evolving with the rate backdrop and what's going on with fixed income and how we should think about kind of rerisking or derisking in this kind of backdrop. Laurence Fink : Hi, Dan. Thank you. There's not one consistent conversation going on institutionally. Obviously, the question of inflation, the question of do deficits matter, are prominent conversations with our fixed income investors now. Some fixed income investors are looking to derisk, but derisking by going into low duration or unconstrained strategies. Some of them are looking to say I need more credit, or I need more coupon to take on that duration risk. And so, there's -- we still see demand in high yield evidenced by our flows.  So, I don't think there's one specific trend. But I would say the narrative around the question of inflation deficits are becoming a very prominent part of our conversations. Obviously, many questions related to equity valuations. The rotation from growth to value is that overdone at this moment, especially if the vaccinations take longer and other questions on that. And so, those were probably the dominant conversations. But if anything, Dan is, we said some of the prepared remarks, there is incredible pools of cash on the sidelines. I would say overall our clients are still sitting with big pools of money. Overall, they're still under invested. Now, I would say as a 10-year treasury rises in rates, that our liabilities become less burdensome. And so -- and if there is any continuing rising of the 10-year rate, the need for extending duration is no longer as necessary.  And so -- but the dialogues are very robust now. Many clients are putting and allocating more and more to privates and alternatives. Many clients now are using ETS for active exposures. That's accelerating, not decelerating. And so, I would say there's nothing that's prominent in any one conversation, except one thing, the conversation around sustainability.  There is not a conversation today with an institutional client on how should they think about climate risks? How should they think about transition risk? And as I just said in my prior question, what we are trying to have our clients focus on, not the fear of transition, not the enormous need for transition, but the opportunities that transition will entail to get it right. The investment technologies to make sure that we don't have this green premium or the net zero world will not happen, especially in the emerging world. And so, this is the beauty of, I would say of, capitalism. This is the beauty of capital markets that more and more clients are looking to be more prepared for this long-term trend. And many, many clients are asking the question, what role should their portfolio play in this long-term trend. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Michael Cyprys : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking -- hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to circle back to some of the investment spend commentary. You guys were articulating here. I'm just hoping maybe you could elaborate a little bit on how you're thinking about investing here, where specifically. And maybe if you could -- just maybe focus a little bit more on -- how would you characterize the pace of investment spent here in 2021 versus maybe the last couple of years. And does that accelerate, just given the market uplift? How are you thinking about pacing that? Gary Shedlin : Thanks. Thanks Mike. So, we are -- I think as we indicated previously, we're definitely accelerating our pace of investment spend into 2021. I think that's a combination of a couple things. I mean, I think the first thing is that I think it's really critical to know and look back at our results, not only for this quarter, but the momentum for the last year had that effectively reflects the fact that we have consistently spent in our business to stay ahead of client -- client's needs, and across the franchise. I mean, without that consistent level of investment to try and stay ahead of those needs, we don't generate $525 billion of flows and 14% organic base fee growth with four quarters over a hundred billion dollars. We believe and you've heard Larry reaffirm it that our business has never been better positioned to take advantage of those opportunities, whether it's sustainable. There has been talking about a lot this morning, private markets, technology, China, and we are going to pursue those opportunities responsibly. That being said, we obviously remain margin aware all the time. We're focusing on managing that entire discretionary expense base as always. And we're committed to optimizing growth in the most efficient way possible. But our accelerated spend this year is really a function of what I just said, which has all the opportunities that we see before us and the reality that we just didn't spend what we thought we were going to spend in 2020. We made a strong commitment to our employees, not to reduce our headcount. And I think that was a good thing, because we saw the work units and the volumes increase throughout the year. We didn't really turn the hiring spigot back on until the second half and frankly late in the second half of last year. And so a lot of what we're doing this year is catching up to our business. We went into a year with a very specific budget in terms of our discretionary spend, whether that was in hiring, or spending on G&A. And we have made no changes to that since we last chatted. Obviously, I think between beta and our organic growth, we're ahead of where we thought in terms of the business. But our intent is to continue to spend throughout the year as to the original budget. We definitely got off to a little bit of a slower start in terms of tech, M&P spend. We are obviously anticipating some pickup in T&E towards the end of the year. And it's full speed ahead in terms of our plans for the year. Operator : Your next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Laurence Fink : Hi, Craig. Craig Siegenthaler : Hey, good morning, Larry. My question is on Aladdin. So, if we look at the 16% year-on-year growth in annual contract revenues, can you talk about the components of the growth between the core operating system platform provider Aladdin and Aladdin for wealth? And I also wanted to hear how the portfolio analytics and risk management tools are now encompassing ESG and helping investors to build better portfolios across factors like sustainability. Gary Shedlin : So, Craig, I'll take the first and then I can -- I'll let Larry jump in and talk about our investment across the platform in terms of sustainability analytics and some of the things we're up to. We talked about the fact that we did have 12% year-over-year growth in revenue. And I think as always, the large preponderance of our technology services revenue today remains what we would call kind of the institutional Aladdin component. Obviously, we have other ports of that in terms of a variety of different, whether it's Aladdin Wealth or accounting or a bunch of other things, but the majority of that Wealth -- the majority of that growth is still year-over-year tied to the institutional business. Some of the component adds that we're basically anticipating, growth in over time are still at the early stages. And so, there's no question that as we begin to grow out things like Aladdin Climate, which is really just getting started, we think that's going to be having a much more significant impact on our year-over-year growth. There's no question that we believe that the demand for integrated and resilient investment management technology is increasing. The pandemic has increased awareness on the importance of technology. We're seeing industry consolidation, shifting product usage and regulatory requirements creating the need for more holistic and flexible solutions. And our pipeline for the remainder of the year is strong. So, again, continue to feel very good about that business. As I mentioned, the ACV at 16% is probably a little ahead of where we normally anticipate that just by virtue of the comparison to a year ago. But we are -- we feel really, really good about our positioning in that business, especially given our whole portfolio view across public and private markets. Laurence Fink : I would just add that, if you think about the growth of Aladdin from a platform that was just analyzing bonds to where we are today, the demand from our clients in terms of having an operating system that is end-to-end an operating system that is connected to their custodial bank like Aladdin provider and operating risk management system that not only connects public markets, but private markets. And we built those platforms around that. And then with the need of more information at the financial advisors fingertips, so they could provide deeper, broader risk analytics to their clients and that's Aladdin Wealth. We have built Aladdin around the needs of our clients to offer a better experience, better outcomes. And then I can't think of a better -- and more important time when Aladdin was necessary when we were all working remotely and still I'm working remotely and having an operating system that is connected worldwide. And the -- our clients worldwide have actually become more enthusiastic about how Aladdin shapes and helps their business. We believe Aladdin actually improve their performance and there was research by third parties that suggest those who have Aladdin have better financial performance. Then when you think about climate risk and transition risk, that is going to encompass from cash to the most long dated privates across the entire portfolio, across all products, across our regions, the need for Aladdin Climate and having data and analytics to justify the investments. We have to live under the department of labor rule of remaining to be a fiduciary. And so, we have to justify as a fiduciary that climate risk is investment risk. And so, more than ever before, I believe Aladdin is as well positioned because of how we navigated it to make it end-to-end through the custodian, to the wealth manager, now publics and privates. And then importantly, now with sustainability really speaks about the resiliency of the operating system and why we continue to have deeper, broader conversations with more clients. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Laurence Fink : Good morning, Alex. Alexander Blostein : Hey, Larry. Good morning. Good morning everybody. I was hoping we could spend a minute on BlackRock initiatives in private markets specifically. And I guess looking back over the last couple of months, you guys raised a $3 billion secondary fund. And I think I saw a $5 billion renewable power fund. What else is in the fundraising pipeline over the next call it 12 to 18 months? And what areas, I guess, within private markets, do you want to lean into more, both organically and inorganically given that space continues to experience a pretty significant growth? Gary Shedlin : So, we've had a focus on our alternatives business for the last several years. And while we haven't raised $20 billion in one fund, we've raised $2 billion in 10 funds, and then those continue to grow. So, we have -- our current focus will be on credit, which is where our clients are looking to invest. As Larry mentioned in sustainable, we're looking at renewable energy, which we just raised one a very large fund. We will be following very closely the infrastructure bill and figure out how we can raise assets that we can deliver to our clients for infrastructure, which for many of our clients who would like long duration type assets, infrastructure fits very well. So, we'll probably go in that direction a bit more. And then, simply and seeing how the private equity market evolves and where our clients can earn alpha, drove our secondary and liquidations fund as some of the older vintages come due from some of the stable private equity companies that are looking to start new funds, but liquidate what is left in the older funds. So, what we're trying to do is really have a very careful eye on where we think the next value chain is and cannot be described both in a liquid form and an alternatives of funds. But what I would tell you is that our general theme is alternatives are going to become less alternative. And so, we are following that very carefully. And currently we are very focused on that -- how that compares with what our team thinks about sustainability and ESG going forward and how we combine the two. Operator : Your next question comes from Robert Lee with KBW. Your line is now open. Robert Lee : Great. Thanks. Thanks. Hey, how's everyone doing? Hope everyone's doing well. I'm curious to know -- so are -- how are you thinking about or clients starting to think about -- I guess it's a popular thing now, but digital assets and I don't mean crypto per se, but now how are you starting to think about digital assets as a potential new asset class or investment class? And then I guess as part of that, maybe being a little facetious, but are we going to see Aladdin digital in two years on one of these calls? Laurence Fink : Well -- hey, Aladdin, it is all digital. But -- in our dialogue with our clients, clients are asking questions related to what is the role of crypto or digital assets related to part of their portfolio. As you suggested, Robert, it is perceived as a possibly new asset class, similar to maybe commodities or gold. We don't believe it is a substitute for currency, but I do believe we're going to have digitization of currencies. So, it is just -- it's a conversation. We are investigating and how we can create -- how we could create different products if there's client demand related to crypto. But I -- let me just frame it. And I think one of the reasons for our success with our clients over the last 33 years has been our consistency of focusing on long-term investing. It is not about the markets and the behaviors of the markets and the ins and outs of the markets. Much of the dialogue today related to -- whether it's a game stop or what's goes out and with Reddit, it is about the TikTok and the day trading. And then, the activities around Bitcoin and other crypto, we're fascinated about it. We're excited about it as more people are enjoying looking at it, but the most of it is about trading and ins and outs of the marketplace. And so, in our dialogues with our clients worldwide, it is not a major question that is being asked. It is not a major conversation related to how does that fit into their portfolio. Summit does. Does it fit into their portfolio as a long-term investor? And I would just say overall, the actions around products that are around trading and the navigation of markets and new asset classes, it is not about -- it's just not about the whole foundation of our platform about long-term investing. And so, if somebody really wanted to build a big, deep dialogue related to this, they're probably going to go to another source. And that is just not a large foundation of the conversations we're having now. I mean, the conversations we're having with unsustainability is greater today than it was the last time we spoke to you. The conversation we're having about transition opportunities is so much greater than it was a quarter ago. And I believe the momentum there, I believe the opportunity there is so much larger than how is a crypto asset a long-term asset. And so, I don't want to diminish anything related to crypto and digital ideas. I'm fascinated about it. I think there -- it is going to be an asset class. We'll see how it performs over a long-term. And it may be a great asset class, but let's wait and see. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks? Laurence Fink : Thank you, operator. I want to thank all of you for joining us this morning and for your continued interest in BlackRock. Our first quarter results, again, are a direct result of our steadfast commitment to serving our clients. We are spending all our time trying to position our firm to staying in front of their needs, to try to anticipate their needs. So, we can be the first conversation with every client. And I believe we're fulfilling that. We're fulfilling a need in the entire financial services industry by focusing consistently on long-term, not -- we're not here to talk about the TikTOK of the market and the ups and downs. It is about focusing on items like retirement, focusing on items like sustainability and stakeholder capitalism. These are the things that we believe are building resiliency to the BlackRock business model, but also building long-term wealth for our clients and serving our clients well. Our job is to build a better future for our clients, so they could build savings and make investing easier, making investments more affordable, helping advance sustainability investing, and contributing in our communities to have a more resilient economy. And I believe our first quarter results truly illuminate our positioning with our clients, our positioning in the community. And we're winning more share of mind, more share of wallet with our clients than ever before. And we will continue to invest as Gary said for our future to stay in front of our client's needs. Have a good quarter. We'll talk to you later. Bye now. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference. Christopher Meade : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So, with that, I'll turn it over to Gary. Gary Shedlin : Thank you Chris and good morning everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to present results for the second quarter of 2021. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as adjusted financial results, I'll be focusing primarily on our as adjusted results. Last month at our 2021 Investor Day we highlighted how the investments we have consistently made to support growth have enabled us to execute on our framework for shareholder value. We have invested and evolved over time to create a globally integrated investment and technology platform that enables clients to construct resilient whole portfolios that meet their objectives regardless of market enjoinment or risk appetite. And we continue to invest in our industry-leading high growth franchises such as ETFs, private markets and technology and they are accelerating investments to drive growth in our ESG traditional active and solutions capabilities. The combination of our comprehensive and integrated investment platform with global and local distribution capabilities once again delivered strong results for the quarter, and we remain very well-positioned to continue delivering differentiated organic gross in the future. BlackRock generated total net inflows of $81 billion in the second quarter, representing 4% annualized organic asset growth. As previously disclosed, second quarter net inflows included the full impact of a $58 billion low fee institutional index redemption from a large U.S. public pension client. Strong net inflows from ETFs and our entire active franchise once again contributed to this quarter's robust 10% annualized organic base fee growth. Over the last 12 months, our broad based platform pairing diverse investment capabilities with best-in-class technology and rigorous risk management has generated over $500 billion of total net inflows, representing 13% organic base fee growth well in excess of our 5% long-term target.  Second quarter revenue of $4.8 billion increased 32% year-over-year and operating income of $1.9 billion rose 37%. Earnings per share of $10.03 was up 28%, also reflecting lower non-operating income and a higher effective tax rate compared to a year ago. Strong year-over-year comparisons benefited in part from significant improvements in equity market conditions versus a year ago. Non-operating results for the quarter included $145 million of net investment income, primarily driven by mark-to-market gains in our private equity coinvestment and unhedged seed capital portfolios. Our as adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 24%. We now estimate that 24% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2021, primarily reflected an increase in certain tax -- state tax rates though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of non-recurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation during the year. Second quarter base fee and securities lending revenue of $3.8 billion was up 27% year-over-year, primarily driven by the positive impact of market beta on average AUM and strong organic base fee growth, partially offset by higher discretionary money market fee waivers, lower securities lending revenue and strategic pricing investments over the last year. Sequentially base fee and securities lending revenue was up 5%. However, our effective fee rate was down 0.3 basis points, as strong organic base fee growth driven by our higher fee active businesses and the impact of one additional day in the current quarter were more than offset by higher discretionary money market fee waivers and the impact of divergent equity beta in the quarter. During the second quarter, we incurred approximately $165 million of gross discretionary yield support waivers driven in part by continued strong flows into our U.S. government money market funds. While the Fed's recent technical adjustments to the IOER and RRP have modestly helped, we still expect discretionary fee waivers to persist at or around current levels for the new term. However, future levels of discretionary fee waivers may also be impacted by several additional factors, including the level of AUM and funds with existing waivers, gross yields and competitive positioning. Performance fees of $340 million were up significantly from a year ago, reflecting strong performance across our entire investment platform, including liquid and illiquid alternatives and long-only strategies. Quarterly technology services revenue increased 14% from a year ago, while annual contract value or ACV increased 16% year-over-year, and continued to reflect strong growth from the second quarter of 2020, which was impacted by slower sales and extended contracting in the early days of the pandemic. We remain committed to low to mid teens growth in ACV over the long-term. Total expense increased 29% versus the year ago quarter, driven primarily by higher compensation, direct fund and G&A expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up 34%, primarily reflecting higher incentive compensation driven by higher operating income and performance fees and higher deferred compensation, reflecting the impact of additional grants associated with prior year compensation and certain compensation arrangements related to a previous acquisition. Direct fund expense increased 30% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher average index AUM. G&A expense was up $73 million or 19% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher technology portfolio services and marketing spend. Sequentially, G&A expense was down $124 million, reflecting the impact of approximately $180 million of product launch costs incurred in the first quarter, partially offset by higher technology and marketing spend. Intangible amortization expense increased $10 million year-over-year as a result of our Aperio acquisition. Our second quarter as adjusted operating margin of 44.9% was up 120 basis points from a year ago, benefiting in part from significant equity market improvements over the last year. BlackRock has never been positioned -- has never been better positioned to take advantage of the opportunities before us. And we remain committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible. Our capital management strategy remains first to invest in our business, including through prudent use of our balance sheet, and then to return excess cash to shareholders. We see incredible opportunity to make Aladdin the language of all portfolios and are investing to evolve Aladdin for its next leg of growth. As Larry will discuss in more detail, during the second quarter, we announced a partnership with Baringa, including the acquisition of their industry-leading climate change scenario model, which will enhance Aladdin Climate's capabilities and set a new standard for climate analytics. In addition, yesterday we announced a minority investment in SpiderRock Advisors, a tech enabled asset manager, focused on providing professionally managed option overlay strategies. This investment adds incremental product capabilities to our recent acquisition of Aperio and extends our market leading personalized SMA franchise. We also repurchased an additional $300 million worth of shares in the second quarter and stand by previous guidance as it relates to share repurchases for the remainder of the year. As we discussed at Investor Day, our strong and resilient platform has never been better positioned to deliver for clients as we leverage our scale, unique insights and solutions orientation to meet their long-term investment needs. Quarterly net inflows of $81 billion reflected continued momentum across our entire investment business, especially in our ETF and active platforms. Our ETFs generated net inflows of $75 billion in the second quarter, representing 11% annualized organic asset and base fee growth. We also crossed $3 trillion in assets globally for the first time. Core equity and higher fee precision ETFs continued to generate strong inflows, particularly in international equities. However, most of our growth this quarter came from the strategic category led by continued strength in our sustainable ETFs and renewed strength in fixed income, as well as steady positive flows into factor and thematic ETFs. Retail net inflows of $21 billion representing 9% annualized organic asset growth and 10% annualized organic base fee growth were positive in both the U.S. and internationally and across all major asset classes. Inflows continued to reflect broad based strength across the entirety of our active platform, and we remain well-positioned to capture demand for both active equities and an investor appetite for yield where our diversified fixed income range, including unconstrained high yield international and broad market strategies is equipped to meet client demand in any rate environment. BlackRock's institutional active net inflows of $43 billion were led by $35 billion of multi-asset net inflows, largely driven by a significant outsource CIO mandate from a U.K. pension client. As Larry will also discuss, BlackRock is uniquely positioned to deliver customized hold portfolio solutions by capitalizing on our global scale, expertise and investment technology in risk management and focus on sustainability. During the second quarter, we also saw continued demand for active fixed income and the liquid alternatives and LifePath target data offerings. Institutional index net outflows of $80 billion were impacted by the previously mentioned single client redemption during the quarter. Outflows from index equities were partially offset by inflows into fixed income, as clients rebalanced portfolios after significant equity market gains were sought to immunize portfolios through LDI strategies. Despite overall asset net outflows across BlackRock's institutional franchise for the quarter, annualized organic base fee growth was 6% as net inflows into higher fee active and alternative strategies more than offset the de minimis base fee impact of low fee index equity outflows. Overall, BlackRock generated approximately $63 billion in quarterly active net flows across the platform, notching our ninth consecutive quarter of positive active equity flows. Demand for alternatives also continued, with nearly $7 billion of net inflows into liquid and illiquid alternative strategies during the quarter, driven by single strategy hedge funds, fund of hedge funds solutions, real assets, private credit, and private equity solutions. Fundraising momentum remain strong, and we have approximately $31 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients and a variety of alternative strategies, representing a significant source of future base and performance fees. Finally, BlackRock's cash management platform continued to grow, generating $23 billion of net inflows in the second quarter, driven by both prime and U.S. government money market funds. Despite facing net zero returns in both the U.S. and Europe, client demand for cash strategies remained strong, given the significant liquidity in the financial system and by helping clients manage their cash, we are building broader and deeper strategic relationships. Our continued strong performance is a direct result of a thoughtful growth strategy that has been well executed by a talented group of purpose-driven employees who live the one BlackRock culture each day. We are thankful for their tremendous effort and contributions to our success over these last 18 months. We will continue to embrace change and invest responsibly for the future, so that we can meet the needs of all of our stakeholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry. Laurence Fink : Thank you, Gary. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining the call. We are once again reporting earnings today from our headquarters in New York City, and I'm happy to see more and more of our colleagues in the office in recent weeks and I remain cautiously optimistic for a gradual return to having people back in the office and a little normalcy. After more than a year of virtual meetings, I spent the last few weeks meeting with clients in-person again. I also spoke at the G20 in Venice on Sunday about sustainability and climate change, and it was great to be back on the road. Our business is built on listening to the people we serve and understanding their needs. And there is no substitute for meeting face-to-face with people to hear directly from them about their investment challenges, their opportunities, and what lie ahead for them. It is through these conversations that we're able to build a deeper relationship with our clients across their whole portfolio and to ensure BlackRock is always evolving and staying current and staying in front of their needs. This longstanding client centric approach is powering consistently strong results for the benefit of all our stakeholders. Total net inflows of $81 billion in the second quarter, representing a 10% organic base fee growth were driven by continued momentum and strategic growth areas. We saw client demand in our ETF and illiquid alternatives are active and sustainable strategies, as well as our scaled cash management solutions. And we developed 14% year-over-year growth in technology services revenues, as clients increasingly turned to Aladdin. We have now delivered organic base fee growth in excess of our 5% target for five consecutive quarters, including 13% over the last 12 months from over $500 billion of net inflows. This is driving strong financial performance, and I'm very confident that we have significant room to grow, as we are partnering with more clients on larger and more comprehensive mandates than ever before in our history. The global economic restart continues to broaden in the second quarter as vaccinations were rolled out and some countries are gradually reopening. With significant amounts of cash still in the sidelines, markets are anticipating continued growth near-term, despite the potential for various restrictions in certain regions, certain countries due to the variant. We have seen equity markets rally year-to-date with most indexes up over 10% for the first half of the year and hitting record highs. We look ahead to the remainder of the year and beyond. Inflation concerns top of mind for investors who need to assess the potential impact on their portfolios. Debate remains as to whether this inflation will be transitory or structural and central banks will need to balance their monetary policy decisions alongside expansive fiscal policy by so many governments. In this environment, clients are looking for scaled partners who have a deeper understanding of the global picture and a platform that can construct portfolios tailored for their needs and for their future goals. They're turning the BlackRock to help them navigate uncertainty. They're turning the BlackRock to invest more opportunistically and they're turning BlackRock to help them plan for their future and our deliberate investment over many years to build a resilient and scaled asset management and technology platform is helping them in their needs. And we are delivering for them. Building on what we laid out at our Investor Day last month, we remained focused on consistently improving and investing ahead of our client's needs and the biggest growth areas of the future. And ETFs, the benefit of our investments over time are showing up through accelerated momentum across the franchise. In June client assets and our ETF past $3 trillion globally, driven by second quarter net inflows of $75 billion. It took 15 years for iShares to get to $1 trillion in assets. It took iShares only five years to get to $2 trillion in assets. And it just most recently took iShares only two years to get to $3 trillion. Importantly, the more majority of this growth at each milestone has been organic, as more investors are you using ETFs in more ways. They are using the built whole portfolios. There are using iShares to invest beyond traditional market cap weighted indexes, and they're using iShares more than ever before to access the bond markets efficiently. Our ETFs grew across each of our core, our strategic and precision product categories, whether with more than half of our net inflows coming from our strategic categories, led by fixed income and sustainable ETFs. We saw more than $22 billion of net inflows into our fixed income ETFs as investors sought more efficient ways to access fixed income and turn to us for a more broad range exposure, including Chinese bonds, multi-sector municipal bonds, inflation leaked ETFs. We now manage more than $700 billion in fixed income ETFs, and continue to believe that this category will grow to a $1 trillion by 2024 as fixed income ETF modernize the $100 trillion bond market. Momentum in sustainable ETFs remained strong, with another $14 billion of net inflows in the second quarter. Including the launches of our low carbon transition readiness ETF, we have seen $30 billion in net inflows into sustainable ETFs in the first half of 2021 compared to $46 billion in all of 2020. With nearly $120 billion of sustainable ETFs, BlackRock has four times the size of the next sustainable ETF player. And we are incredibly well-positioned for the future for our client's needs in this fast growing category. Demand for sustainable strategy is accelerating from investors worldwide in both index and active. Within active sustainable strategies, we saw $4 billion of net inflows in this second quarter. Sustainable investments offer significant opportunities to generate alpha for clients. And we are focused on innovating ahead of their needs. For example, we announced last week the first close for the Climate Finance Partnership, we'll invest in Climate infrastructure across emerging markets. This strategy is a great example of how public and private sectors can come together to deliver positive environmental and socially impact for communities and attractive risk adjusted returns for clients, including global institutional investors, for governments and for philanthropies. BlackRock's broader active platform is playing an increasingly important role in our client's portfolios. And we're seeing the benefits of our investment in our growth and our investment performance. We generated $63 billion of active net inflows in the second quarter across equities, fixed income, multi-assets and alternative strategies. This growth is outpacing that of the $70 trillion active management industry, as we continue to captive active market share. Long-term investment performance is strong with over 85% of our fundamental active equities, systematic active equities, taxable fixed income assets outperforming the benchmark or peer mediums over the past five years. By delivering durable alpha for clients, we remain well-positioned to continue to generate growth in active strategies. More clients are looking to outsource their entire portfolio, as regulations intensify, operating costs rise and investing grows more complex. They want customized solutions, spanning active index alternatives powered by sophisticated technology and risk management. The breadth of BlackRock's investment platform, our portfolio construction expertise and our Aladdin technology uniquely positions us to meet these client's needs. We are honored to be entrusted to manage the over $30 billion of pension assets for British Airways in the second quarter, through the creation of a bustle bespoke investment and service model. This partnership represents the largest of its kind in the U.K. pension fund, and we believe it will be a catalyst for more transformational change in the industry. We manage over $200 billion in OCIO assets today, and believe that trend towards outsourcing will only continue to accelerate. We are also seeing demand for personalization growing more among the financial advisors and our wealth clients. And we're continuing to invest behind the democratization of tax efficient, personalized portfolios and scale. BlackRock is partnering with financial intermediaries and providing model portfolios, which utilize our broad range of iShares ETFs and actively managed funds, as well as separately managed account strategies across alpha, factor investing and index investing. Building on our acquisition of Aperio, we recently announced a minority investment in SpiderRock Advisors, which will further enhance our ability to provide wealth managers and financial advisors who tax efficient, personalized portfolios and risk management solutions. This is another major step we are taking to advance our market leading franchise in personalizing and personalization of SMAs. Alongside ETFs, SMA is continue to see high growth rates as advisors and personalization and tax management to wealth client portfolios. BlackRock is the second largest SMA provider today with over $200 billion in assets, including Aperio. And we remain focused on investing in a comprehensive platform of solutions and customization capabilities for the wealth management market. BlackRock's commitment to evolve and to meet our client's needs is recently most evident in sustainability. As we adapt to the fundamental restructuring that the energy transition is driving across the economy, we are investing across products, data, technology capabilities, so we can help clients address their impact of sustainable factors on their portfolios and help them capture significant client demand for sustainable solutions. Last year, we began developing Aladdin Climate to fill need in climate risk analytics and to help investors better understand and act on climate risk. Aladdin Climate measures at both the asset and portfolio levels, the impact of physical risks, like extreme weather event and transition risks such as policy changes, new technologies and energy supply. In June, we will further -- in June we further advanced Aladdin Climate through a new partnership with Baringa. The combination of Baringa's climate transition risk models and Aladdin's financial and physical risk models will provide investors with the ability to better understand and customize their risks -- their climate risk exposures. This partnership is a significant milestone in the build-out of Aladdin Climate and will set a new bar in the industry for climate analytics and risk management tools. We're also committed to bringing the benefits our global platform to clients around the world by deepening our local infrastructure. We're investing in people who speak every language to understand local markets and regulations, and have insight into how the changing world intersects with each of our client's goals. This includes investing in the leading -- excuse me -- this includes investing in -- to be the leading global asset manager in China. Rapid economic development and wealth accumulation in the world's second largest economy has propelled the growth of the $9 trillion Chinese domestic asset management industry. Earlier this year, we obtained our wealth management joint venture license. And last month we received our fund management company license. We are the first global asset manager firm to obtain this type of license. We are now well-positioned to extend the breadth of our investment solutions and insights to all our clients segments across China and help more people transition their savings to investments in China, including in preparation for their retirement. With more than half of BlackRock's assets linked to retirement, we are incredibly focused on innovating and helping our clients address the retirement crisis around the world. Client demand for our LifePath target date funds remain strong, with $17 billion of net inflows year-to-date representing a 10% organic growth and outpacing the entire industry. The need for retirement income and retirement is also accelerating. A recent study BlackRock conducted found that nearly 90% of the participants across every generation want a retirement income solution and 96% of plan sponsors feels responsibility for helping their participants generate and manage their income in retirement. BlackRock is developing LifePath Paycheck to address it global -- this growing need. And we're already seeing strong commercial demand with several initial client commitments and support from an institutional and an investment consultant. The incredible momentum we are seeing across our entire platform is a direct result of our dedicated employee base. I have never been prouder of BlackRock's nearly 17,000 employees. I have seen their commitment to our clients and to each other in incredible ways throughout this pandemic. And in recognition of this hard work and to have them share in BlackRock's growth and success, we are investing in our employees through an 8% raise in base salary compensation for all employees up to and including director levels as of September 1, 2021. We strive the cultivated environment at BlackRock where employees feel supported and have a diverse and inclusive environment where they can thrive and grow and build a career in life. After a period like no others in the firm's history, BlackRock has never been better positioned for the future. My recent trips to Europe and the Middle East to meet with our clients have only further validated our differentiated positioning and our approach to building deeper, broader relationships with our clients. We have always led by listening to our clients and hearing what they want, what they need, and through that -- through anticipation and embracing change and innovating and staying in front of our client's needs, that has what driven us going forward. Our fiduciary focus has guided the deliberate -- our deliberateness in terms of investments we have made to build a more resilient asset manager and a more resilient technology platform by anticipating and staying in front of our client's needs. And we will continue to deliver industry leading growth to benefit all our stakeholders for the long-term. With that, let's open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Ken Worthington with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Laurence Fink : Good morning, Ken. Kenneth Worthington : Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I'd love to dig in further into direct indexing and customized SMAs. So, maybe first, can you give us some additional color and how SpiderRock compliments customize SMAs in your direct indexing capabilities at Aperio? And then you highlighted in your prepared remarks number of times the importance of retirement solutions. So, should we see Aperio and SpiderRock capabilities permeating the retirement management part of your business? And if so, what does this mean for LifePath and its evolution over time? Laurence Fink : We'd have Rob start off and then -- Rob Rob Kapito : So, as you know more clients are looking for personalization and that's what we're seeing in direct indexing. And we are -- our combination with Aperio, which Larry had mentioned, actually enhances our ability to deliver personalized tax manage SMAs and gives us a two-plus-year acceleration in that space, while we continue to organically build additional capabilities for different client segments. So, BlackRock's core SMA capabilities historically were in actively managed equities, fixed income, and multi-asset. Aperio brings experience in building index-based highly custom investment solutions. So, these are our complimentary businesses and they enhance our value proposition for a whole portfolio SMAs across equity and fixed income in alpha factors and index solutions. So, with over $200 billion in SMAs, including Aperio BlackRock is a market leading whole portfolio sponsor. And with the prospect of higher income and capital gains taxes, we've now built a pipeline of over $6 billion in potential new Aperio mandates just since the transaction closed. So, this is an example of how we are getting more into the personalization and direct indexing. And of course, ETF and direct index compliment the tech that we are investing in and building it. Laurence Fink : Ken, on target date in LifePath and LifePath Paycheck, we put a great deal of energy on LifePath Paycheck. We are in a position now, working with many different plans and we see this revolutionizing the 401k DB plans, corporate plans. We are in discussion with many, many corporations. And I think we have a lot of future growth and a lot of future announcements in terms of our positioning there. This is actually quite separate from what we're doing in the customized side related to Aperio. But we believe this is going to change the retirement business. And we are -- we have worked with all the consulting firms. We have buy recommendations on this from across many of the consulting firms. We are in dialogue with many, many of the plans and we hope in the next few quarters to have some very significant announcements related to the success we are seeing in LifePath Paycheck, which will be changing, as I said. And this is BlackRock responding to the future needs of our clients. So, I think when we are able to announce this with the clients, this is going to really identify how retirement is going to be reshaped and why the need for more of a -- more certainty during retirement -- during the deep accumulation period of time, why that is so important, why there is such urgency around that.  And we are very proud of the R&D work that we did over the many, many years now. And now in these private conversations, we -- it is really resonating more than ever before with our clients across the United States. And hopefully this could be something that we could expand beyond the United States, but this is going to be some -- a significant part of our whole foundation. And the last thing I would just say related to the LifePath target date franchise, we're up to now $370 billion alone without even talking about the LifePath Paycheck. And so, this is going to continue to accelerate where we're taking market share. Operator : Your next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Laurence Fink : Hi, Craig. Craig Siegenthaler : Hey, good morning, Larry. I had a question on ETF adoption. I know you covered a lot of this in the Investor Day, but I had a follow-up here. Which client verticals do you think provide iShares the most one to three or upside? And have you seen any significant rise or decline in demand among any declined segments over the last six months? And I'm thinking some of the bigger ones like U.S. RAA, insurance and retail. Rob Kapito : So good question, Craig. You know that we have said over and over that we see significant room for continued growth in ETFs. And the penetration of the equity and bond markets is still very low. We expect generational shifts to unlock a lot of new growth, especially whole portfolios where ETFs in fee-based are around 11%, new investment capabilities like ESG and overall capital markets replacements where we're seeing ETFs that are about 5% of the total market and 1% of the bond market. We expect to give you a number to throw out by 2025 that ETFs are going to more than double to $15 trillion. And even at that level, we would still be a small part of the markets in which we compete, which is why we think there are decades of growth. And we fully intend to be the market leader in revenue growth and truly organic client driven flows and in total assets as this evolves. And we recognize that we have to offer choice in the vehicles that we show clients, but ETFs, I believe are going to lead in that. So, there are some key client segments. One is Europe, which is adopting very, very quickly. The wealth area through model portfolios of again, of which we are a leader is showing a huge growth. And certainly in institutional clients, primarily in fixed income is showing growth. And then another segment sustainable, which you heard about which we are -- the leader is also showing growth. So, what makes our ETF platform unique relative to any competitor is its diversity and broad client base. So, for example, our global client base is made up of self-directed investors, wealth managers, pensions, insurers, and active managers. We have the most diversified platform with $2.3 trillion in the U.S. and $650 billion in Europe. And $2.3 trillion in equity and $700 billion in fixed income. So you can see how this matches up against the client segments I talked about.  And most importantly, which may be overlooked, we provide the most secondary market liquidity. So, U.S. iShares traded almost $9 trillion in 2020 versus $7 trillion in 2019 and EMEA iShares traded $0.2 trillion in 2020 versus $1 trillion in 2019. So, this along with our precision exposures, which are often unique to us while that has been a drag in prior years, are actually a driver of our strong revenue growth this quarter. So, we're excited about the growth specifically in the segments that we are a leader in today. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Laurence Fink : Good morning, Alex. Alexander Blostein : Hey, good morning, Larry. Good morning, everybody. I was hoping you guys could flush out the expense dynamics a little bit in the quarter, as well as look out further in a year. Obviously, very strong revenue environment, revenues up 25% in the first half. But the comp rate is actually up, on a year-over-year basis for the first half as well. Now, I know performance fees tend to skew that upward sometimes. So maybe help us think through the rest of the year. And then just big picture, your framework around expense management and margins. Thanks. Gary Shedlin : Thanks, Alex. It's Gary. Good morning. So, let's break it down maybe individually. So, in terms of the comp side, we talked about comp being up about 34% and that primarily reflected higher incentive compensation. And you correctly pointed out that incentive compensation is very much tied to both profitability and performance. And so as we saw higher operating income and performance fees that that definitely ticked up. But we also saw higher deferred compensation year-over-year. That was up by about a $100 million year-over-year. And I'd say there's really two things there. One is, is more ongoing, which is the ongoing impact of additional grants associated with last year's compensation. Obviously, we defer a significant component of current compensation for retention. And last year saw a rather large level of deferrals, especially as it related to performance fees and the level of performance fees last year. That was -- I'd say that's probably about 60% or so percent of that increase. But there was also a one-time, what I would call a crystallization and acceleration of certain compensatory arrangements tied to the success of one of our historical acquisitions. That was probably about $35 million or about 70 basis points on the comp ratio that ultimately should migrate away. Now that that has been settled out. So that's it on comp as I would think about it. Obviously, Larry mentioned the base salary increases, which is more a function of going forward. And he talked all about recognizing the accomplishments of our tremendous employees over the last 18 months. I don't expect that to have a very significant impact on our financials this year, but it could be, given its effective date of September 1st, let's call it roughly 20 basis points or thereabouts on both comp and margin impact on a purely isolated basis for the rest of the year. In terms of G&A, we have -- I think we gave you some guidance at the beginning of the year. We've made no reductions to the discretionary investment spending plans in terms of G&A spend and hiring that we originally budgeted for the year and that we referenced on our call. I think, much as others are, I think we're probably hiring a little slower than we had anticipated. And we're working on that to make sure we can get the employee support to support our growth plans. But we would, as I think is somewhat customary for us anticipate our overall level of G&A spend to be higher in the second half, especially around such areas, like marketing, technology. And then as Larry mentioned, if people get back to traveling, obviously we haven't had a lot of T&E in the first part of the year, but the potential for that I think exists for next year.  And I think -- so broadly speaking, that's it on the comp. There was kind of that one-time issue and on the G&A side, again, our plans are generally exactly the same as we laid them out to you at the beginning of the year. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Laurence Fink : Hi, Patrick. Patrick Davitt : Good morning. Hey, hi everyone. It's obviously hard to handicap the chances of a change in the capital gains tax rate at this point, but are you guys seeing any change in either retail or institutional behavior change in conversations around that concern via specific gain harvesting, or just wanting to talk about options? Should it come through? Laurence Fink : So not really. I mean, look at, maybe that is one of the reasons that Rob Kapito talked about the personalization and customization of tax efficient strategies. I think across the board, the awareness of after tax returns are becoming more dominant in the RRA channels. But I don't think it's -- excuse me -- I don't think it's reflective yet, and I don't think people are motivated or seeing any real changes in behaviors related to the potentiality of these changes in taxes. But I think there is just a much greater awareness, as the ability now to create customized, personalized tax efficient portfolios. And I think that's what's going to be driven. Rob, do you have anything to add? Rob Kapito : No. I'd say it's another reason why people are moving towards ETFs, which are much more a tax efficient tool than the typical mutual fund is that they are in. So, actually it's another growth area for ETFs. Operator : And your next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open. Laurence Fink : Hey, Dan. Dan Fannon : Good morning. Larry, you mentioned that you were having some of the largest conversations or big mandates with clients in previous history. And I was just curious, are you used to give a backlog number on these calls and obviously you're much bigger and more diverse today, but hoping you can help us size you kind of more near term potential flow picture or those dialogues in the kind of size those mandates. So we can think about the potential there. Laurence Fink : Yeah. Well, you're right. We don't do that and we're not going to do that at this call. But I think when you think about -- and I -- when I referenced the British Airways CI [ph] mandate, we believe this is going to be -- this is just the beginning of more focus on the virtues and the value proposition of -- for these pension funds to rethink how it's organized. Should it be done under a platform like BlackRock and then do we create the efficiencies? And most importantly, are we -- can we have a better fiduciary outcome on behalf of their participants? All of this is about their participants and can we provide a better outcome for the participants? And I really do believe -- we are thinking of that. But we have had some very large wins with a few other clients in the last few quarters. We are in large dialogue with many more, but I want to underscore what the transformation of LifePath Paycheck could be too. These are going to be -- these could be some very large opportunities to, and having the defined contribution business being reimagined and rethought. And that is how we framed it. How can we reimagine and provide better certainty to the participants, how can we provide better outcomes, and how can that lead to a better closeness between the employer and the employees, and how can they build deeper bonds when the employees are retired during deaccumulation period of time. These are broad based solutions that we've been focusing on. No different than the broad based solutions we focus on the needs of focusing on climate in portfolios across the board. And so, I believe what we are -- what you're seeing in the past related to above trend line growth above 5% organic growth is because of these deepening relationships across the board. And as I concluded in my speech, I do believe we are going to continue to see this type of elevated opportunity. And it's because we are so relentlessly focused on how to think about our clients, and help them become better at what they're doing. And I truly believe whatever the outcome of British Air and the other measure that we talked about. And I would say with the strong performance that we've had in our active platform flows generally follow. And when you can have -- no firm can have this, when you could have a dialogue where you are agnostic about the role of index assets, like ETFs and active assets, and then focusing on whether it's tax efficient portfolio strategies, or focusing on a sustainability overlay, or now focusing on outcomes related to more certainty during deaccumulation periods of time. This is what's driving the flows. And this is what I think is differentiating BlackRock, that we are spending more time. We're investing -- as Gary talked about our investments in the future. These are the type of investments we're making and making sure that we are staying in front of the needs of client and providing something unique and differentiated. And I do believe that is resonating more and more. And let me just leave it at that. Operator : And then your next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup. Your line is open. Laurence Fink : Good morning, Bill. William Katz : Good morning everybody. Can you hear me okay? Laurence Fink : Yeah. Perfectly. William Katz : Okay. Wonderful. Thank you. So, thank you for taking the question this morning. Great update. Maybe a two part -- I'm sorry. That's two questions, but sort of interesting things going on. One, Larry, at what point do you start to think about upgrading your 5% organic growth rate? It seems like everything you're talking about here has just very powerful and long tail opportunity. And then somewhat unrelatedly, but just sort of following up on your last conversation on the Paycheck opportunity, where is that share coming from? Thank you. Laurence Fink : I'm going to let Gary answer that because Gary, as a CFO is the one who really -- is the tethering of our platform. And he is also our -- he provides the balance between me and him. And so, I love him, Gary? Gary Shedlin : Thanks, Larry. Greatly appreciate that thought. So, look Bill, I think that it won't surprise you to hear a lot of the same answers that I've traditionally given you on that. I think we feel very good about our organic growth potential going forward. I think it reflects the platform we've built. I think it reflects global reach, full range of investment capabilities, integrated risk, great performance. But as you know, growth is also somewhat tied to markets in particular. And I think some of the growth that we're seeing today, clearly as a result of the type of environment that we're in. And so, we try not to get too focused on a particular environment, but really look across cycles. And I think if you look at what we've done over the last five years, we've actually averaged the amount of 5% organic base fee growth over the last five years. And while we've actually -- I think really the more important piece of this is not how fast we necessarily grow in a more risk on environment, although I know Larry doesn't like that term. I think the reality is that when we see the markets fall back, we stay positive. And so even in tough markets, like 2016 and 2018 where the industry was roundly negative, we were still in positive territory. And I think I would also remind you that, look, the industry is basically right around 3% in terms of where everyone thinks the industry more broadly is going to grow. So at 5% we're already growing, if you will, at a 60%-plus premium to where we think the industry is. And we feel very comfortable with that, because of our breadth, because of our solutions orientation and our technology platform. I think we feel very good about both secular growth more broadly, and maintaining share in places like ETF. We feel like we have a ton of room to run in places like illiquid, where the market is growing and we're generally still low single digit share. When we think our investment performance positions as well to continue to play a major role in active. So, for the moment, until we get through this cycle and see where we come out the other side, 5% is the target and we feel very good about our performance going forward relative to that. Laurence Fink : LifePath Paycheck, as I try to frame, it is U.S. based so specifically -- but we're redefining defined contribution business in the United States. I think that's what it is. But globally it was -- retirement is a $70 trillion -- has a big gap. We need to rethink retirement as we moved away from DB, but we need to find better ways of creating more certainty in a defined contribution world. I think this is one of the big problems we have in our society today, the uncertainty of retirement. And this is one of the problems that we've been focusing on for years and years and years to try to find a way to have something closer to a defined benefit, but having it still being in a defined contribution way. And I think there's just great opportunities. And we're having robust conversations on this, Bill. And I think it's going to reshape or reimagine or redefine the defined contribution business. Operator : And your next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Laurence Fink : Hi, Michael. Michael Cyprys : Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just had a question here on Aladdin. I was just hoping you could update us on the pipeline. I recall in the past you had spoken about a slowdown in implementations, but given the recovery here, the reopening, just curious if you think we can see that accelerate? And then also on the technology services revenue, I think that was up about 14% in the quarter, but the ACV was up a bit higher than that. So, I was just hoping you could help unlock some of the moving pieces there between your ACV definition and the technology services. I think your ACV excludes some of the consulting fees and implementation fees, just hoping you might be able to quantify how much that is relative to the overall technology services line. Thank you. Gary Shedlin : Thanks Mike. So, again, we're not going to get very specific on pipelines, but we will give you some tonality on Aladdin growth rate. So, I think as we've talked about, there's clearly increased client demand accelerated by COVID for comprehensive whole portfolio solutions that involve greater systemization, fewer vendor relationships as a number of financial service companies and other insurers, asset managers, and funds try to minimize their costs. And more importantly, trying to basically take down the number of data sources that they're relying on. We feel that growth going forward is going to be a function of a number of things, but it's going to be primarily gaining new clients, expanding relationships with existing clients, expanding the platform through enhanced functionality and products, and obviously under -- expanding into under penetrated geographies, most notably, Europe and Asia. With that, what we've said at Investor Day, and we'll continue to reinforce is given all of that, that our pipeline is as strong as it's ever been. And we continue to reaffirm our low to mid teens growth rate for technology services revenue. As it relates to ACV, ACV was up 16%. And as you correctly note, we do have -- we're migrating a bunch of the eFront business over to Aladdin in terms of its hosted model, as opposed to its traditional model, that does, as you say, have different accounting ramifications. And so, we decided to put ACV out as a key performance metric, because we think it better reflects the overall momentum of the business, and takes away some of the timing and accounting changes from migrating models over. So, ACV was up 16%. And I think as you also correctly note, that's probably a little faster than we would expect the longer term to be given our target. And I think that's a function of some of the business coming through today at a more rapid rate, that was delayed from a year ago in the early days of the pandemic, as we highlighted a longer sales cycles and contracting periods. So, we're definitely seeing a little bit of an acceleration there, but again, reaffirming our low to mid teens growth outlook. Laurence Fink : I would just add one thing or two things. One is -- and there's a lot of this before my meetings in Europe last week, the demand for data and analytics on sustainability is going to grow exponentially. And this is why we've been so aggressive in terms of building out our analytics data across the board. And I do believe this is going to be a major sleeve and major opportunity for Aladdin. Aladdin Climate is going to be a major component of Aladdin, and we believe having the differentiating data and analytics is going to be further -- why clients are going to be looking to add on Aladdin across our portfolio. The way -- what we've witnessed since the acquisition of eFront to the need for data and analytics related to alternatives and across all the alternatives space integrated in a comprehensive data and risk analytic environment is really, really important. So, if you overlay the movement into capital markets and client demand and alternatives, if you overlay the demand for clients that related to sustainability and climate, that's going to be a major change and that's going to be a major component of it. And that's why some method tutorial [ph] is now having that role, and helping us drive Aladdin Climate. So, as you moves away from our client relationships. I'd leave it with that. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks? Laurence Fink : Thank you, operator. I want to thank everybody for joining the call this morning and your continued interest in BlackRock. Our second quarter results, again, are a result of the steadfast commitment of focusing on our clients first and importantly, thinking and investing and anticipating their needs in the future. I see a tremendous opportunity ahead and BlackRock's full focus remains on the long-term fiduciary commitment to all our clients worldwide. We will continue to invest in our business so we could deliver that long-term value for our stakeholders and lead the asset management industry and the many, many years ahead. Thank you again and have a great remainder part of the summer. And unless everybody hope to have a great third quarter, talk to you then. Bye-bye. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Javale (ph), and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time. I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink, Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin, President Robert S. Kapito, and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator instructions] [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference. Christopher Meade : Thank you. Good morning everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may of course differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC which list some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So with that, I'll turn it over to Gary. Gary Shedlin : Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present the results for the third quarter of 2021. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our adjusted results. BlackRock's proven track record of delivering to stakeholders reflects our ongoing commitment to anticipate change before it happens and continually invest for the long term. Our globally integrated investment in technology platforms enables us to construct resilient whole portfolios for clients. We rely on thought leadership, global investment insights, and state-of-the-art risk management tools to help clients navigate ever-changing and increasingly volatile market environments. Our approach is resonating more than ever. And is reflected in the continued strong momentum we're seeing across our entire platform. BlackRock generated total net inflows of $75 billion in the third quarter, $98 billion of long-term net inflows representing approximately 4% annualized organic asset growth were partially offset by net outflows from lower feed cash and advisory AUM. In addition, strong net inflows from ETFs and our active franchise once again contributed to this quarter's 9% annualized organic base fee growth. Over the last 12 months, our differentiated investment management platform, which pairs active and index capabilities across the entire range of traditional and alternative products has now generated over $450 billion of total net inflows, representing 13% organic base fee growth, well in excess of our 5% long-term target. Third-quarter revenue of $5.1 billion increased 16% year-over-year while operating income of $1.9 billion rose 11% and reflected the impact of approximately $96 million of fund launch costs primarily associated with the successful launch of a $2 billion closed-end fund in late September. Earnings per share of $10.95 were up 19% compared to a year ago. Also reflecting significantly higher non-operating income in the current quarter. Non-operating results for the quarter included $298 million of net investment income, primarily driven by non-cash gains related to our strategic minority investments in iCapital and Scalable Capital, as well as mark-to-mark gains in our private equity co-investment portfolio. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 24%. We continue to estimate that 24% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the fourth quarter of 2021, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of non-recurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation. Third-quarter base fee and securities lending revenue of $3.9 billion increased 22% year-over-year, reflecting the positive impact of market beta on average AUM and 13% organic base fee growth despite higher discretionary money market fee waivers and strategic pricing investments over the last year. Sequentially, base fee and securities lending revenue was up 5%. Our third-quarter annualized effective fee rate on a day count equivalent basis increased by 2/10 of the basis point from the second quarter as the positive impact of strong organic base fee growth driven by our higher fee active businesses and lower discretionary money market fee waivers more than offset the negative impact of diversion equity beta primarily associated with the accelerating decline in emerging markets during the current quarter. During the third quarter, we incurred approximately $130 million of gross discretionary yield support waivers. Lower discretionary yields support waivers in the current quarter were linked to the Fed's technically -- technical adjustment to the IOER and RRP in June, as well as outflows from U.S. government money market funds during the current quarter. Performance fees of $345 million reflected generally strong performance from our single strategy hedge fund platform over the last year. The decline in year-over-year fees reflected lower revenue from a single hedge fund with an annual performance measurement period that ends in the third quarter, which delivered truly exceptional performance a year ago, partially offset by higher revenues from illiquid products. Quarterly Technology Services revenue increased 13% from a year ago. Annual contract value or ACV, increased 16% year-over-year and continued to reflect strong growth from the third quarter of 2020, which was impacted by slower sales and extended contracting in the early months of the pandemic. We remain committed to low to mid-teams growth in ACV over the long term. Total expense increased 19% versus the year-ago quarter driven primarily by higher G&A, compensation, and direct fund expense. G&A expense was up $139 million or 30% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher technology and portfolio services expense in the current quarter, Third quarter G&A expense also included $96 million of fund launch costs primarily associated with our first ESG oriented closed-end fund, the $2 billion BlackRock ESG Capital Allocation Trust, and $29 million of contingent consideration fair value adjustments related to the estimated final payment on our successful Citibanamex acquisition in 2018. Recall that we exclude the impact of product launch cost from reporting our as-adjusted operating margin. Core G&A expense for the third quarter, which excludes the impact of product launch and transaction-related costs, was up 3% from the second quarter. We have made no changes to the discretionary investment spending plans we have previously outlined and would expect a sequential increase in our fourth quarter core G&A spends to be generally consistent with previous years, reflecting seasonal increases in marketing spend, additional costs related to return to office planning, and ongoing technology costs associated with the latent cloud migrations. Employee compensation and benefits expense was up $116 million or 8% from a year ago, primarily reflecting higher base compensation and higher deferred compensation related to the impact of grants associated with 2020 compensation.  Direct fund expense increased 38% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher average index AUM, and intangible amortization expense increased $11 million year-over-year due to our Aperio acquisition. Our third-quarter as an adjusted operating margin of 45.8% was down 120 basis points from a year ago. As operating leverage was more than offset by the impact of lower performance fees, higher contingent consideration, fair value adjustments, and higher intangible amortization expense compared to a year ago. We're seeing more opportunities to invest for growth than ever before. We reopened the closed-end fund market in 2019 by making it more efficient for investors to access products at NAV. By synthetically seeding these new funds. We've now raised $14 billion in ACV AUM, representing over $170 million in new revenue. Our strategic minority investments in iCapital and Scalable Capital are reinforcing our tech for flows strategy and simultaneously generating very attractive returns for shareholders. And we continue to build our best-in-class ESG capabilities, most recently by acquiring Rhodium models related to the financial risks associated with climate change. Effective use of our balance sheet to seed new products, co-invest alongside clients or makes strategic minority investments, both support our growth and drive value for our shareholders. And while our capital management strategy remains first to invest in our business, we also remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders and repurchase an additional $300 million worth of shares in the third quarter. As we discussed at investor day, we continue to invest in our highest growth franchises such as ETFs, private markets, and technology. And we are accelerating investment s to drive growth in our sustainable, traditional, active, and solutions capabilities. Each of these areas once again delivered strong results in the third quarter. Quarterly long-term net inflows of $98 billion were driven by continued momentum and our ETF and active platforms. Our ETFs generated net inflows of $58 billion in the third quarter, positive across each of our product categories, representing 7% annualized organic base fee growth. ETFs attributable to our strategic category drove over 50% of net inflows in the quarter, reflecting continued strength in fixed income and sustainably ETFs. Core equity and higher fee persistent exposure ETFs saw net inflows of $16 billion and $9 billion respectively led by U.S. equity exposures. Retail net inflows of $23 billion representing 11% annualized organic base fee growth were positive in both the U.S. and internationally and across all major asset classes. Retail multi-asset results included the impact of the previously mentioned $2 billion closed-end funds raised in late September. Inflows continue to reflect broad-based strength across our active platform and we remain well-positioned to meet investor needs for risk-adjusted alpha and yield in the current market environment. BlackRock's institutional active net inflows of $26 billion, representing 6% annualized organic base fee growth, were led by $25 billion of multi-asset net inflows. The growth included the impact of a significant outsourced CIO mandate from the Asia-Pacific client, continuing our momentum in an important growth area where we are providing cost-effective whole portfolio solutions to the world's most sophisticated institutional clients. We also saw continued demand for our LifePath target-date offerings, and Larry will update you about a recent milestone for our new LifePath Paycheck retirement solution. Institutional index net outflows of $8 billion broadly reflected equity net outflows, which were partially offset by fixed income net inflows, as clients continue to re-balance portfolios after significant equity market gains, or sort to immunized portfolios through LDI strategies. Overall, BlackRock generated approximately $45 billion in quarterly active net inflows across the platform, including our tenth consecutive quarter of positive active equity flows. Demand for alternatives also continued with nearly $7 billion of net inflows into liquid and illiquid alternative strategies during the quarter, driven by single strategy hedge funds, private credit, real assets, and private equity solutions. Fund-raising momentum remains strong and we have approximately $29 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of alternative strategies, representing a significant source of future base and performance fees. BlackRock's cash management platform experienced net outflows of $12 billion driven primarily by redemption from the U.S. government and offshore Sterling prime money market funds in line with the broader U.S. money market fund industry. BlackRock's diverse cash management offerings position as well to serve clients' needs and you'll hear more from Larry about how we're expanding our ESG cash offerings to enhance our competitive positioning even further.  Finally, third-quarter advisory net outflows of $10 billion were primarily linked to the successfully planned wind-downs of portfolios managed by our financial markets advisory group on behalf of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Recall that revenue linked to these assignments is primarily reflected in the advisory and other revenue line item on our income statement. BlackRock continued strong performance reflects our commitment to strategically invest in our business in anticipation of change and to lead the evolution of the asset management industry. Today, we see even greater opportunities to invest in our employees and our clients and in the communities in which we operate to ensure that we will continue to optimize organic growth, in the most efficient way possible. With that, I will turn it over to Larry. Laurence Fink : Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining the call. I truly hope that all of you are staying healthy and safe. Fortunately, I've been traveling again. And in recent months to see clients worldwide. It's great to be back on the road meeting face-to-face with our clients. And I found our clients actually more engaged, more interested in our conversations than ever before. As investors continue to navigate uncertainty in the markets and in the broader global economic outlook, BlackRock is partnering more closely with our clients to help them achieve long-term -- their long-term goals and helping them seeking new opportunities. BlackRock is providing insights into the global economy, guidance on how to navigate the market volatility, and providing solutions for their entire portfolio. Our comprehensive unified investment in technology platform combined with our steadfast client-centric approach is enabling us to deliver constantly and consistently strong results for our stakeholders. Long-term net inflows of $98 billion in the third quarter represented 9% organic base fee growth was driven by continued strength in our strategic growth opportunities that we spoke to you about in the past. Our consecutive quarters of strong growth are the direct result of these investments that we've made over time to enhance and evolve our business and to be more prepared for the needs of our clients. We have now delivered organic base fee growth in excess of our 5% target for six consecutive quarters, including 13% growth over the last 12 months. We also generated 30% year-over-year growth in Technology Services revenues, as more clients are turning to Aladdin to execute on their growth aspirations and helping them scale their business. At our promising global economic restart earlier this year, we saw certain countries and markets take a step back in recent months as they are confronted with the economic -- with the virus variance and economic issues. Concerns around slowing economic growth are increasing while policymakers evaluating the timing and pace of easing, whether it's rate hikes or reduction in bond purchases. And with interest rates still at historically low levels, investors need solutions that can earn a real yield and be resilient and in a higher inflationary world. Inflationary trends are appearing more than transitory, reflecting structural changes, including a shift from consumerism to job creation, rising wage growth, and the energy transition. As I said in a speech to the G20 in July, society needs to rapidly invest in innovation to offset inflationary pressures associated with the transition to a net 0 economy. We need to make sure that we are pushing Just as hard on the demand side as we are on the supply side. Otherwise, we risk supply issues that drive up the cost for consumers, especially for those who can least afford it. Against this backdrop, clients are turning to BlackRock more than ever before and we are using the full breadth of our capabilities to meet our client's needs. BlackRock, a top-performing active platform continues to outpace the industry, generating $45 billion net inflows in the quarter and nearly $200 billion over the last 12 months. Momentum and active equities continue and BlackRock's number 1 in year-to-date asset gathering in the U.S. active equity mutual fund industry is up from number 3 in 2020. These results reflect our investments over time to incorporate data science, integrate ESG considerations, and enhancing portfolio construction capabilities across the entire active business. And we remain. Committed to continuous innovation so we can deliver strong and durable alpha for our clients over the long term. In addition to our traditional active strategies, you're also seeing clients increase portfolio allocation to private markets. As they reach for yield, institutions are turning to BlackRock for private credit, real estate, and private equity solutions. And well, we're seeing advisors access the private market through our record. Are we to closed-end fund vehicle, which has up to 25% allocation to alternatives? and accredited investor solutions. In total, we raised about $5 billion of illiquid alternative flows and commitments in the quarter, and we continue to steadily deploy that capital for our clients. Portfolio construction and asset allocation decisions are critical in achieving desired returns, and more clients are adapting our ETFs as a building block in their portfolios. We generated 58 billion of ETF net inflows in the third quarter, with growth across each of our core, strategic, and precision product categories, including strong flows in fixed income as clients sought inflation protection in sources of income. We crossed $200 billion in ETF inflows year-to-date, exceeding our 2020 full-year flows. We are seeing this momentum across the entire ETF industry as more and more investors discover the convenience, efficiency, and transparency that the ETF vehicle has. We see opportunities well beyond the 30 million people who use our ETFs today and continue to believe in the long-term growth potential for ETFs. And we will remain confident in our ability to deliver strong organic base fee growth and lead the industry. In my conversations with clients, I hear about how they are looking to focus on their core business and partner with select investment managers that have the expertise, the technology, the scale, to navigate the increasingly complex markets. We see outsourcing portfolio management through OCIO for institutions and for model portfolios for wealth managers, both of which are fast-growing areas of the industry. BlackRock is well-positioned to capture this opportunity and partner with our clients across our whole portfolio. Few asset managers have to scale in the diversity of offering to do this and the consolidation we have seen in the industry is further validation of the business model that we've already built here at BlackRock. We're also innovating to expand clients' options for how they participate in proxy voting decisions, much like asset allocation and portfolio construction, where some clients now can take an active role while others outsource these decisions to us. More of our clients are interested in voting on their index holdings. This is another great example of one BlackRock effort to further democratize choice for our clients and is in line with our commitment to provide them with the broadest range of options. Client demand for more holistic and flexible technology-driven solutions is also increasing. Technology Services grew -- revenue grew by 13% year-over-year as Aladdin's capturing opportunity from industry shifts. And we are leveraging our user provider model to further evolve Aladdin. The combination of Aladdin and eFront has been well received by clients and we now have over two dozen clients using both across their entire whole portfolios. As we've done throughout our history, we continue to invest ahead of our client's needs and evolve BlackRock to lead in the biggest long-term opportunities of the future. And we are seeing meaningful progress in executing on these opportunities. In sustainability, momentum remains strong, and so we generated another $31 billion of net inflows across all regions. Active sustainable net inflows of 7 billion were led by the launch of our ESG capital allocation trust closed-end fund, which Gary mentioned earlier. As ETF -- in ETF iShares is leading sustainable provider, capturing nearly 50% of the industry category inflows year-to-date. In Europe, almost half of all industry flows are now going into sustainable ETFs, up from less than 10% just three years ago. Clients also want an impact-oriented strategy that seeks to deliberate targeted environmental or social outcomes. We recently repurposed one of our money market funds to seek positive social outcomes by supporting a diverse trading ecosystem. BlackRock will also be contributing 5% of our management fees, net revenues from the funds to support students in historically black colleges and universities and predominantly black institutions. This fund is already growing more than 40% -- 20% to 4.5 billion since its conversion in July. And we are proud to work together with our clients to help make a positive impact on the futures of many diverse students, on the futures of many diverse business owners, and in their own communities. BlackRock is also supporting clean energy solutions that change the demand curve for hydrocarbons, which is actually accelerating today and driving energy prices higher. The gap in costs between clean energy technologies and those that will emit greater amounts of greenhouse gases is still very large for most things, which is why BlackRock is supporting a range of initiatives to help bring down the green premium of clean energy. Building our partnership with Temasek earlier this year to advance a decarbonization solution, the BlackRock Foundation announced last month a $100 million grant to the breakthrough Energy Catalyst program. This grant will help speed the development and commercialization of Clean Energy Technologies and BlackRock will provide our investment expertise as the program deploys its financing around the world. We have a long history of innovating to help millions of people worldwide improve retirement readiness. And today we are the largest investment-only defined contribution provider in the industry with over $1 trillion of assets under management on behalf of over 7,200 defined contribution plans. -- excuse me, 72,000 defined contribution plans. Our targeted franchise LifePath has seen $23 billion of net inflows so far this year, representing a 9% organic growth rate far in excess and broader in the target date industry. And we continue to innovate ahead of the future needs of our clients. We recently announced a significant milestone in our retirement income solution; LifePath Paycheck, large plan sponsors whose plan together represents about 7.5 billion in target-date investments, have elected to work with BlackRock to implement our LifePath Paycheck solutions, as a default investment option and their investment retirement plans subject to necessary approvals and conditions. We remain committed to working alongside our clients and partners to help more people address the challenges of spending and income in retirement. We believe that globally integrated financial markets provide people, companies, and governments with better and more efficient access to capital that supports economic growth around the world. This conviction drives our long-term strategy in China as it has in every community, in every country where we operate. BlackRock's clients have benefited from our focus on the long term, and we will bring this perspective to help Global Client --Clients invest in China. And importantly, to deliver investment solutions to Chinese investors. After receiving our FMC and WMC license earlier this year, we launched our first two products in the third quarter, raising over a billion dollars in two weeks from more than 110,000 investors. This milestone demonstrates the value proposition of BlackRock's platform and the strength of our partnerships. It also highlights the start of BlackRock's living its purpose in China by helping more people secure in China a better future and investing in the long-term and retiring, hopefully in dignity. Just as we continue to evolve our business to meet client needs, we also evolve our entire organization. A key driver of BlackRock's success over the years has been our focus and deliberate talent processes, on delivering leaders with a broad range of expertise, a deep commitment to the firm, and a One BlackRock mindset. This commitment to the evolution also extends to our Board of Directors. We recently elected 2 new Directors to our Board, Beth Ford, President and CEO of Land O' Lakes, and Kristin Peck, CEO of Zoetis Beth and Kristin are recognized leaders in their respective industries and they bring a wide range of valuable perspectives and experiences that will help BlackRock and the board navigate our future on behalf of all our shareholders. Looking ahead, I am confident the investments we're making today will enable us to capture greater opportunities and to deliver industry-leading growth in the years to come. More immediately, I'm very excited to welcome our colleagues back to BlackRock's offices in certain parts of the world where we begin our future of work pilot. It's our a culture that can't be built or maintained remotely over the long term, that ensures we can never forget who we are, who we serve. It also helps us in our markets and our industry and most importantly, help us continue to evolve and experience the constant change of the world. Having togetherness and connection with all our employees is vital for our culture and vital for serving the needs of our clients. With that, let's open it up for questions. Operator : At this time I would like to remind everyone. [Operator Instructions] To limit yourself, please limit yourself to one question. If you have a follow-up, please re-enter the keys. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Michael Cyprys : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask about alternatives given prospects here for rising yields and interest rates. There is some fear in the marketplace that this could soften flows into alternatives products. So just would be curious to hear your perspective and how you see potential for investor allocations to alternative products to evolve in a rising rate scenario. And then as you look across your alternatives franchise today, maybe you could just touch upon some of your recent initiatives on illiquids and just any sort of views on which you think could be the largest contributor to growth at BlackRock amongst your illiquid products. Thank you. Laurence Fink : First of all, hi, Michael. I'm going to let Rob Kapito to answer that question. Rob Kapito : So my question, now that we have been involved in the alternatives business in one way or another for a pretty long time, especially in the retail sector since 1988, and our goal has been to access the retail area for alternatives by keeping our promises over a long period of time on performance. So to start with, the growth in retail alternatives is certainly compelling as part of our strategy to serve advisors ' whole portfolios. And what we chose to do is bring a diversified product line-up to the retail alternative investor. So our job is to bring the appropriate wrappers for those products to provide the solutions to help reshape their portfolio at a period of time when rates and returns have been very low. And what we've seen them do is move from 1% to 2% of their portfolio to allocations up to 20 %. So year-to-date, just in that sector, we've raised over 24 billion of net inflows. And that's at approximately 85 basis point average fee rate across what we'll call our retail liquid alternatives and credit vehicles, and our public-private closed-end fund offerings. So our recent launch of alternatives portfolio analytics for financial advisors on the web-based BlackRock Advisors center and the continued product expansion is going to help us grow with those clients. And in the recent years, we expanded our retail alternatives to include private credit and private equity per year-to-year access to growth equity through closed-end funds. And we're working to expand our retail alternatives offerings now across real assets, sustainable, and co-investment opportunities. So just in the closed-end funds alone, we provide a wrapper that will enable us to provide up to $3 billion in alternatives in them. And just in a summary form, in total, we manage about 180 billion across liquid and alter -- illiquid [Indiscernible]. 29 billion right now in dry powder to invest and deploy, approximately 210 million of future annual base fees. And including liquid and liquid credit, our platform is now over 310 billion, we're the top 5 manager in that. And we've built up alternatives platforms and raised another 100 billion of gross capital over the last five years and we expect to raise a 100 billion more in the next 3 years. Just for September year-to-date, we have raised 25 billion of gross capital and deployed 10 billion. And because there is some expectation that rates can rise, still, these are longer-term investments that have enough spread in it that I believe that the demand is going to continue for quite a long period of time. And I think Larry's rate scenario, which he said in the beginning, is rates low for longer, will only enhance the ability for people to want more alternatives. Operator : And your next question comes from Alex Blostein, with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Laurence Fink : Hi, Alex. Alex Blostein : Great. Good morning. Hi, Larry. Thank you for taking the question. SO inflation concerns are clearly everywhere and Larry, as you highlighted in your prepared remarks, that's something you guys are clearly focused on as well so maybe two-part question here. One, when it comes to BlackRock's own cost structure, where are you seeing expense growth and margins heading into 22. We, obviously, make changes on the salary from last quarter, but curious if this is becoming a bigger issue for total comp and G&A, as you think forward. And then secondly, from a product perspective, what are the strategies you're advising clients to lean into more aggressively into 2022 to protect their portfolios against the upside inflation risk? Thank you. Gary Shedlin : And I'll take the expense first. Hey, Alex, it's Gary, how are you? So we're obviously we have seen some expense growth, which I think is expected in the context of the outsized organic-based growth we're delivering on the top-line. For the third quarter, our margin obviously was down about a 120 basis points versus a year ago. And I'd say there were a couple of things there that clouded what would've been some operating leverage in the business, really three things in particular. One was lower performance fees year-over-year. If you recall, we had this discussion last year that performance fees in general hit the P&L at a much higher margin than the rest of the business because there's only really compensation associated with it and no other operating cost in the business. And so when we see performance fees decline, as they did year-over-year, that has an impact on the margin. Secondly, we had higher contingent consideration fair value adjustments or non-core expense this quarter, which was related to the Citibanamex final payment. And we have higher intangible amortization. So if you look at those three things, those three things really more than offset our margin on a year-over-year basis where you would have seen some operating leverage improvement. In terms of just looking at those individual costs, when you look at comp, comp is up about 8% year-over-year. Again, that was highly driven by base salaries, but not just the mid-year that you saw. And remember, comparing it to a year ago, we have normal base salary increases at the beginning of the year. We have the mid-year headcounts a little higher. We obviously have Aperio this year versus when we didn't have it last year, and FX has basically increased the dollar cost of some of that compensation also. So that's really the main driver was the base salary, but the midyear salary increase really didn't have that much to do on a year-over-year basis. On the G&A side that was up about 30% but again, a bunch of components there. Technology expense increased year-over-year and you will still continue to see that going forward. The primary driver there obviously is technology infrastructure, primarily the ongoing migration [Indiscernible] to the cloud, which we're probably about halfway through, but we'll be accelerating into next year. You're also seeing higher portfolio services costs, which again, is part of our success story in OCIO. So where you see us winning large outsourced wealth solution mandates, either in Europe or institutional mandates like the BA pension fund or the significant win we just announced this quarter in APAC and New Zealand, you're going to see higher portfolio services costs because not all of those mandates are managed in-house. We use third-party advisors and when we use third-party advisors, you're seeing those expenses reflected in that line item of the P&L. It's grossed up on revenues, but we also have to bear the expense. And obviously, there's always still some noise that we see a year-over-year in our non-core. Here, we talked about the Citibanamex and Hunter fund launch costs, which, again, are in both cases associated with higher revenue. Finally, on the direct fund expense side, I think that is purely variable. That is obviously tied in most part to our growth in our index AUM, which is fundamentally driven by our success in iShares. That number was up roughly 38% year-over-year, but there's always going to be some noise in that number as we try to effectively manage that expense on behalf of the fund shareholders. So in this case, this year, while there are always some timing issues, it did reflect some one-time expenses associated with moving indexes from one provider to the next to try and basically get those at lower costs. And when you exclude a little bit of noise, that number was probably up about 31% year-over-year versus average iShares AUM increased just close to 34%. So I would say, yes, there are some expense increase. I would say it's less tied to inflation for us than other players. It's really more tied to continuing to invest for growth. And obviously, if we're able to continue to deliver organic base fee growth well in excess of our 5% target, which we've done for the last 6 quarters in a row to 9% clip, 13% over the last 12 months, we're going to see some elevated expenses to be able to drive that success. Laurence Fink : And on the products in a more inflationary environment, I would just clearly tell you that our platform is large, it's diverse. We're having conversations with clients globally where they should be allocating. I do believe you're seeing higher allocation towards equities over the last year across our client's portfolios. As equities rally, they did less in terms of rebalancing. The bigger question is, how do you allocate across equities? What is a roll-up of emerging markets? But I don't think inflation is playing a dominant role in the conversations. Even in fixed thinking, we're obviously -- it's very obvious long-duration assets are going to be the impact ed the most. And so those clients in fixed income who are worried about their duration risk that could go down into a low-duration product, they could go into various different products with less convexity and less issues. They could go in some type of inflationary protected type of notes too. That's not going to be that large. But the resiliency of our platform really allows us to have that conversation, whether it's in a deflationary world or in an inflationary world. And I do believe the -- if you look at the geographic dispersion of our growth, The conversations worldwide represent these types of conversation, which, when we think about inflation, what role should we play? What is the role of alternatives in an inflationary environment? What is the role of equities across fixed income? So I actually believe it's the volatility of a global economy is allowing us to have these robust, deep conversations. And I don't think there's one global trend to going in and out of one product because inflationary fears and some clients don't believe in that, some people actually believe it's transitory. That's the -- I would look at this -- when there is uncertainty and when we're in a transition period, more clients come to BlackRock than ever before because they are asking those questions. And I think because of the robustness of our platform, whether it's an index-oriented strategies or active strategies across the spectrum. We have the ability to work with them across all economic environments. Operator : Your next question comes from Bryan Gadow with Deutsche. Your line is open. Bryan Gadow : Great. Thank you. Hey. Good morning everyone. Just switch gears to the sustainable investing growth. I think Larry, you made some comments at a conference on the path to net 0 that at the current rate we're not there yet. Maybe if you can talk about how you think the demand and the capacity for BlackRock to offer impact fund products, more [Indiscernible] from the readiness and the time to fix GV going forward. And is that going to be -- should we be thinking of that as a pretty strong -- Laurence Fink : Yeah. Bryan Gadow : -- organic growth path going forward? Laurence Fink : The flows in this COVID world that accelerated into sustainable products. Let me give you the context, I think, with global capital markets. Public institutions are moving very rapidly to adapt more disclosures related to sustainability. More clients, including our hydrocarbon clients, are looking to adapt how to continue to provide hydrocarbons to fit the current needs of our society, but also to slowly adapt in a more sustainable platform too. So across the board, we are having very deep conversations. I must say the conversations we're having with our hydrocarbon companies and the hydrocarbon, from chemicals to oil, they are more robust than ever. They're deeper, they're broader than any other time. And -- but our flows continued to grow and dominate where we continue to be a dominant leader. Year-to-date we had about $80 billion of sustainable inflows, we had $32 billion of those inflows in the third quarter. When I talked about the shift in finance, we're seeing that. Now, specifically on your question related to impact, this is one of the reasons why we wanted to be a partner in Breakthrough Energy. We want to learn more of the science and the new technology. This is why we partnered in our decarbonization fund with Temasek. The demand is growing precipitously in terms of clients interested in finding new -- being part of this transition. And so the capital is there. What is not as prevalent are projects or the opportunities. We are having conversations with the universities. We're having conversations with governments across the board on how can we provide capital? And one of the more dynamic conversation we're having with the traditional hydrocarbon companies across the board is, how can we partner with them in terms of moving -- helping them move forward on their sustainable strategies, on their de - carbonization strategies? And their strategies were around sequestering of their own carbons. So many of those big multinational hydrocarbon companies are building new dynamic technology so they can be the leaders in the sequestering of hydrocarbons, of carbons. At the same time, they may be using that to produce more energy at this time. But these are the types of solutions we're having across the board. You've heard the questions, but my view is we're not moving fast enough, yes. I think that movement toward sustainability is very fast and rapid related to public companies. I think regulators worldwide are asking public companies and banks to do more disclosure. My greatest fear and I spoke about this in my Venice speech 3 months ago, is we're creating a hybrid world, a bifurcated world. The pressure on public companies and banks and asset managers are enormous. We're not putting any pressure on private companies. And there was a great story today in one of the newspapers about as hydrocarbon companies divested some of their hydrocarbons, the buyers are private equity firms. That doesn't change the net 0 world, and that's why I'm saying we're never going to get to a net 0 world if we're not moving holistically together, public and private. And then I spoke about obviously -- in a editorial today it related about the need to invest in the emerging world. There is huge pools of capital standing by, but they are -- we are not able to evaluate the first lost piece in so many of the brownfield investing in the emerging world. And it is estimated the emerging world needs a trillion dollars a year to become more sustainable. As a backdrop, the emerging world minus China represents 34% of the hydrocarbon output. And so if we are going to continue at the pace of $150 billion of investments when there's a need of a trillion dollars, we're fooling ourselves, or we're going to get to a net-zero world. We're going to be fooling ourselves to getting to a net 0 world if we're only asking public companies. We are fooling ourselves if we believe by restricting supply with our traditional hydrocarbons companies, that only raises energy costs, which we're witnessing now. and that is creating not a just transition, which I spoke about in my last 2 CEO letters. We have to be vocal. We have to be forceful about it. BlackRock is a leader in this, and we're seeing the flows, and I continue to see this big shift in investor portfolios as they move away from traditional indexes to more sustainable types of indexes, as they're moving away from different types of strategies and they're moving into these other strategies. We need to accelerate this. We need to accelerate in a way that we're working with our great hydrocarbon companies, not against them. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup. Your line's open. Bill Katz : Okay. Thank you very much. Laurence Fink : Hey Bill. Bill Katz : Good morning, everybody and thank you so much for taking the questions today. I appreciate all the discussion. Maybe a two-part question, just keeping the line with that. One is, can you maybe peel back a little bit on why you're so successful in the retirement business and where you see the Paycheck opportunity gaining scale and share and then completely unrelated. But maybe for Gary, how do you think about the exit fee rate, base fee rate, just given the divergent beta versus the very strong flow mix dynamics? Thank you. Gary Shedlin : So Bill, the story is, we're able to look at a client's portfolio holistic over the long term and the focus is to have our clients be able to retire in dignity. It's not a one-off situation. It's a constant look at a portfolio over a period of interest rates and solve the problem with the appropriate wrappers and products. We have the scale of products, we have the performance, we have the wrappers. So honestly, it is the focus. A significant portion of all of BlackRock's assets are dedicated to retirement. This is what we do and when we dovetail that into the analytics that we could provide, Rob Kapito : we really can't fulfill the entire gamut of retirement. So it's product, performance, and technology, and focus on what we think is the most important business that there is in the world, is keeping our promises to clients so they can retire in dignity. Laurence Fink :  [Indiscernible] I would add one more thing that Rob is talking about. I think our consistency of messaging to our clients across many, many years, we've developed -- built a deep relationship with our -- with the clients and I don't believe our 9% growth rate is a one-time thing. I think we continue to be growing our presence in this market. We continue to try to be an innovator, whether it's the LifePath Paycheck or anything which, now LifePath Paycheck is about $340 billion. I'm sorry, that's our target date, and LifePath Paycheck, our most recent growth. I look -- I think conversations have never been broader, more robust, and we continue to drive these conversations. I believe more and more of the large plans are looking to BlackRock for that type of advice, that type of hand-holding. And I believe more than ever before, especially in this world of need for more employees, the need to build deeper relationship with your employees. I believe the conversations that every corporation now in how to create better connectivity with their employees is becoming a broader conversation than we've ever seen in the last 20 years. I think the companies that have deeper connections, a better retirement plan, better healthcare plans, are the companies that are driving more consistency with their employees, led to higher retention rates. So I truly believe this is going -- this is one of those transitory things that are happening. And I think it's catching a lot of organizations by surprise now, the fluidity of employees moving from one economy to another economy, moving to one business to another business. And I truly believe this refocus on the needs of the employees and retirement is a major component of that refocus is going to be a larger and more dominant theme. And I think this is the -- when I talk about this -- we're in this transition now, I think many corporations are surprised at this. I think COVID, and how we work remotely, people feel -- many people want to work remotely. They feel differently about their work-life balance. This is all transforming our society in many ways is a great way. But we're in this transition. And some industries are going to be huge winners in this and some industries are going to be losers of this. But most importantly, I think the common thing those companies that are working with their employees with purpose, building a deeper, broader connectivity with their employees, they retain their employees with greater regularity, and importantly, they are able to attract the best and the brightest and we're seeing that more and more. And our conversations about business purpose and stakeholder capitalism, I think it resonates with our corporate clients who have these defined contribution plans and they are asking us how to create that greater depth of robustness. And then you have overlay, what we're trying to do related to innovation. I think it really is a compelling story. Why BlackRock? Gary Shedlin : And Bill, on your second question, which I think was about fee rate going into the fourth quarter. We generally don't provide a lot of guidance on that; we'll leave that to you guys. But I will say a couple of things on that. Obviously, you will see that the spot rate entering the fourth quarter was moderately lower, but not a big deal in average assets for the third quarter. So I think we're probably about the same. But I would direct you towards page 5 of our supplement. I think obviously a lot of things go into the fee rate. And in fact, I would say that from an organic growth perspective, every month of the third quarter was generally was very consistent. So it wasn't like we saw a lot of volatility in terms of our organic growth. But clearly, you do see some differences in the spot rates in terms of markets relative to the average rates. And you'll clearly see there's that as we've talked about in terms of diversion equity data, we did see an acceleration in terms of the decline of certain emerging markets as we got to the end of the third quarter. And I think you'll see that on the supplement, where some of our higher fee markets in Asia, the emerging markets and commodities in particular are all down roughly somewhere around mid to high single digits with actually the BlackRock equity index on the spot basis down about 3%. So no question that we did see diversion beta accelerate into the end of the quarter. But again, given some of the other stuff, I think that might have a moderate, very moderate impact on the fee rate, but I don't think anything significant. Operator : Thank you. And last question comes from Robert Lee with KBW. Your line's open. Laurence Fink : Hey, Robert. Robert Lee : Good morning, everyone. Hope everyone's doing well. Maybe we'll produce those back to maybe alternatives business. And I was interested on the 50 billion [Indiscernible] is obviously about the strategy, but a big win. But can you maybe talk about what you're seeing and how you feel in their position in the insurance market in terms of [Indiscernible] a big clients, where you see more CIOs [Indiscernible]. And do feel you have the right products set as the insurance industry, as they look to expand their [Indiscernible] credit and whatnot. Just trying to get a better feel for how you're tapping into that upfront. Rob Kapito : So Gary and I will barbell this. We're saying that insurance portfolios have always had an allocation to what we're all calling alternatives. But as the alternative packages have become much more complicated, certainly the technology and the management of those has not really caught up. So we're being asked by insurance companies who have determined that in many cases, it would be better, cheaper, faster with the technology to outsource many of those investments. And of course, that's a very, very big part of our platform. And we are being called in more and more to be a partner with insurance companies on their portfolio overall and it's a huge growth area for us with Aladdin because the technology has not kept place. We're seeing a lot of interest from the insurance companies. And it spans the growth from private credit, especially real estate, and infrastructure. And those are 3 areas that we've spent a lot of time developing. And certainly in Aladdin, our ability there is second to none, so it's become a bigger opportunity for us in the last year or so. Gary Shedlin : I couldn't agree more. So our big business today obviously is in excess of $450 plus billion. You mentioned AEL, which is -- which will fund in the fourth quarter, very significant mandate. And I think Rob is right, portfolio resilience, diversification, portfolio construction, which takes advantage of our great performance in core fixed income are increasing momentum and capabilities across the breadth of private markets and leveraging technology. I think there's no question. I would say it's resonating well beyond just insurance companies because we're seeing yet -- obviously, we've seen the British Air Pension, we've seen a number of outsourced wealth solutions in Europe where I think all of these things has strong applicability and we're seeing them obviously increased momentum in our broad-based multi-asset capabilities figures did come through in our quarterly results. Thanks for the question, Rob. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks? Laurence Fink : Thank you, Operator. I want to thank all of you for joining us this morning and for your interest at BlackRock. Our third-quarter results, again, is a direct result of our steadfast commitment in serving our clients, listening to our clients, responding to our clients, and hopefully staying in front of our client's needs so we could be with them as they evolve and change. I see a large opportunity ahead of BlackRock than ever. And BlackRock 's focus remains on investing in our people, on our communities, where we operate across the world, and in our platform. Most importantly, as we continue to stay ahead of our client future needs, we will continue to be driving excellence on behalf of our -- all of our shareholders. With that, thank you. Hopefully, everyone have a safe and healthy fourth quarter. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Jerome and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Inc. Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today\u2019s call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference. Chris Meade : Good morning, everyone. I am Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock\u2019s actual results may of course differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock [Technical Difficulty] which was some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So with that, I will turn it over to Gary. Gary Shedlin : Thanks, Chris. Good morning and Happy New Year to everyone. I hope everyone and their families are remaining safe and healthy. It\u2019s my pleasure to present results for the fourth quarter and full year 2021. Before I turn it over to Larry, I will review our financial performance and business results, while our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as adjusted financial results. As always, I will be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. Throughout BlackRock\u2019s history, we have consistently and systematically invested in our business with a long-term focus and commitment to serving clients, employees, shareholders, and the communities in which we operate. As a result of these long-term investments in 2021, we grew organically at our fastest rate ever and continued to expand our organic growth premium versus the industry even as our assets under management reached new highs. We have continually invested to develop industry leading franchises in ETFs, private markets, technology, our active investment platform, and more recently in ESG and in China. These investments all reflect a singular focus on helping clients construct resilient whole portfolios and they are driving the record levels of growth we are seeing today. BlackRock generated net inflows of $540 billion in 2021, representing 6% organic asset growth and 11% organic base fee growth. Each of our strategic priority areas drove significant growth during the year. Importantly, despite fourth quarter volatility, we finished the year with strong momentum, generating $212 billion of total net inflows, reflecting annualized organic base fee growth of 9%. Continued strong flows from our entire active franchise along with record iShares flows, which benefited from typical year end rebalancing and tax management contributed to the fourth quarter\u2019s robust organic growth. We continued to build out our platform in 2021 as the strength and stability of our operating model allowed us to aggressively reinvest in our business, deliver record financial results, and returned approximately $3.7 billion of capital to shareholders. Full year revenue of $19.4 billion was up 20%. Operating income of $7.5 billion rose 19%, and earnings per share of $39.18 was up 16% versus 2020. For the fourth quarter, BlackRock generated revenue of $5.1 billion and operating income of $2.1 billion, up 14% and 11% respectively from a year ago. Quarterly earnings per share of $10.42, was up 2% versus a year ago, reflecting a higher effective tax rate and lower non-operating income in the current quarter. Non-operating results for the quarter included $86 million of net investment income, driven primarily by mark-to-market gains in our private equity total investment portfolio. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 25%, driven in part by discrete items. We currently estimate that 24% is a reasonable projected tax rate for 2022, though the actual effective tax rate may differ because of non-recurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation. Fourth quarter base fee and securities lending revenue of $4 billion was up 17% year-over-year, primarily driven by 11% organic base fee growth and the positive impact of market data on average AUM, partially offset by higher discretionary money market fee waivers versus a year ago and strategic pricing investments over the last year. Sequentially, fourth quarter base fee and securities lending revenue was up approximately 1%. Our fourth quarter annualized effective fee rate decreased by 0.2 basis points from the third quarter as the continued positive impact of strong organic base fee growth was more than offset by the negative impact of divergent equity beta, which accelerated into quarter end and lower securities lending revenue in the current quarter. We incurred approximately $135 million of gross discretionary yield support waivers in the fourth quarter, essentially the same as the third quarter bringing total waivers to approximately $500 million for the full year. Given the current prospects for higher rates in the near term, we now anticipate most of these waivers would cease shortly after the first 25 basis point increase in the Fed Funds rate, resulting in a one-half basis point increase to our annualized effective fee rate. Recall that approximately 50% of these gross fee waivers are generally shared with distributors, reducing the impact on operating income. For the year, we generated record performance fees of $1.1 billion, which were increasingly diversified compared to a year ago and reflected strong alpha generation across our platform. Notably, since a year ago, performance fees from liquid alternatives have increased more than 150% and our unrecognized deferred carry balance has more than doubled to over $1.4 billion as our private markets platform continues to scale. Quarterly technology services revenue was up 11% year-over-year, and full year revenue of $1.3 billion increased 12%. Annual contract value, or ACV, increased 13% year-over-year, and we remain confident in our ability to continue delivering low to mid-teens ACV growth as demand for Aladdin\u2019s end-to-end, cloud-based SaaS solution is stronger than ever. We are heavily investing to scale Aladdin for its next leg of growth in order to extend our capabilities in high demand areas such as the whole portfolio, private markets, wealth, and sustainability. Total expense increased 20% in 2021, driven primarily by higher compensation, G&A, and direct fund expense. For the full year, compensation expense increased 20%, reflecting higher base salaries and higher incentive compensation driven by growth in operating income and higher deferred compensation expense. Recall that year-over-year comparisons of fourth quarter compensation expense are less relevant because we determine final full year compensation in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter G&A expense increased 15% year-over-year, reflecting higher marketing and promotional expense, which included higher T&D expense, higher occupancy expense partially driven by higher COVID testing costs and higher portfolio services and technology expense. For the full year, excluding approximately $350 million of non-core G&A expense, which included $274 million of aggregate fund launch costs, core G&A expense was up 15% compared to 2020. Recall that we exclude the impact of fund launch costs when reporting our as-adjusted operating margin. The year-over-year increase in core G&A was largely attributable to technology, data, and portfolio services expense, all of which drive revenue growth. Increased technology and data spend was driven by our Aladdin cloud migration, market data investments to support our index and ESG franchises, and broader tech spend to support productivity improvements. Approximately two-thirds of the increase in our 2021 portfolio services expense related to sub-advisory cost associated with significant OCIO wins and are offset by associated base fees. 2021 direct fund expense increased 24% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher average index AUM. Sequentially, quarterly direct fund expense declined despite higher average index AUM due to higher rebates that seasonally occur in the fourth quarter. Finally, full year intangible amortization expense increased $41 million year-over-year due to our Aperio acquisition, which closed in February 2021. Our full year as-adjusted operating margin of 45.2% was up 30 basis points versus 2020. Our business has never been positioned to take advantage of the opportunities before us and we remain deeply committed to investing responsibly and aggressively through market cycles, so we can continue to generate differentiated organic growth over the long-term. Consistent with this growth ambition, we are once again targeting record investment in our people, strategic priorities and platform infrastructure during 2022. At present, we would expect headcount to increase by as much as 10% with a continued focus on optimizing our talent pyramid for more junior roles and growing our footprint and iHub innovation centers. We would also expect core G&A to increase by 15% to 20% as we continue to invest in technology to scale our operations and support future growth, including completing Aladdin\u2019s cloud migration, delivering new Aladdin capabilities and continuing to open the platform to promote client innovation. We are also investing through prudent use of our balance sheet to best position BlackRock for continued success. During 2021, we allocated $1.5 billion of new seed and co-investment capital to support our growth and our year end portfolio now approximates $3.7 billion. Our strategic minority investments are reinforcing various elements of our strategy and simultaneously generating very attractive returns for our shareholders. And we continue to invest inorganically when we see opportunities to accelerate our organic growth in key strategic growth areas, as we did through our acquisitions of the physical climate and transition risk models of Rhodium and Baringa, which will be critical to building best-in-class ESG capabilities within Aladdin. We also remain committed to systematically returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases and returned an aggregate $3.7 billion to shareholders in 2021. Since inception of our current capital management strategy in 2013, we have now repurchased over $11 billion of BlackRock\u2019s stock, reducing our outstanding total shares by 11% and generating an unlevered compound annual return of 20% for our shareholders. At present, based on capital spending plans for the year and subject to market conditions, including the relative valuation of our stock price, we are targeting the repurchase of $1.5 billion of shares during 2022. In addition, our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $4.88 per share, representing an increase of 18% over the current level. Finally, in early December, we completed the debt issuance to take advantage of current low interest rates and pre-refinance our $750 million 3 and 3/8 notes to June 2022. We successfully raised $1 billion of new 10-year notes with a 2.1% coupon, the second lowest U.S. dollar coupon in BlackRock\u2019s debt stack. As you will hear more from Larry, BlackRock\u2019s strategy has always been guided by our clients\u2019 needs. We relentlessly focused on helping them meet their financial objectives and our deeper and broader relationships with more clients are driving growth across our entire platform. Fourth quarter total net inflows of $212 billion, representing 9% annualized organic AUM and base fee growth, were led by flows into ETFs and our top performing active franchise. Record full year net inflows of $540 billion were positive across all client types, investment styles and regions and reflected records for both ETFs and active strategies. ETFs generated $306 billion of net inflows in 2021, representing 11% organic asset growth and 9% organic base fee growth. Record fourth quarter ETF flows of $104 billion reflected some seasonality, but also reflected the diversity of our product and client segments and accelerating secular shifts occurring in the market. We saw continued strength in core, but our strategic product segments, particularly sustainable and fixed income were the largest contributors to our fourth quarter flows. Sustainable ETF AUM of $150 billion nearly doubled during the year and our $750 billion fixed income ETF platform grew organically by double-digits, even in one of the most challenging macro environments for fixed income in several years. Clients also continued to use our broad-based precision exposures to express risk on sentiment during the year. BlackRock generated full year retail net inflows of $102 billion, representing 12% organic asset growth and 14% organic base fee growth, significantly outperforming the broader mutual fund industry. Retail flows were positive in both the U.S. and internationally, reflecting broad-based strength across our active platform. Fourth quarter retail net inflows of $22 billion reflected similar trends, but also included the seasonal impact of capital gains and dividend reinvestment. We remain well positioned to meet investor needs for risk-adjusted alpha and yield and our diversified fixed income platform with top performing strategies across total return, unconstrained, high yield and credit offers choice to investors in any rate environment. Institutional index net outflows of $118 billion in 2021 reflected equity net outflows, including the previously disclosed $58 billion low fee institutional redemption in the second quarter, partially offset by fixed income net inflows as many large clients rebalanced portfolios after significant equity market gains or tactically shifted assets to fixed income and cash. BlackRock\u2019s institutional active franchise generated a record $169 billion of net inflows in 2021, reflecting broad-based strength across all product categories and the funding of several significant OCIO mandates. We are seeing strong momentum in our OCIO business, evidenced by another significant core fixed income funding in the fourth quarter. We also saw continued growth in our LifePath target date franchise and remain committed to helping investors around the world plan and invest for retirement. In the aggregate, strong growth across active strategies led to 7% organic base fee growth for our institutional channel in 2021. Across retail and institutional client types, BlackRock generated a record $49 billion of active equity net inflows for the full year, led by top performing franchises in technology, health sciences and U.S. growth equities as well as quantitative strategies. We remain well positioned for future growth in our active platform, with over 75% of our fundamental active equity, systematic active equity and taxable fixed income assets performing above their respective benchmarks or pure medians for the trailing 5-year period. Overall, demand for alternatives also continued, with $27 billion of net inflows into illiquid and liquid alternative strategies during the year driven by credit, infrastructure and our multi-strat and global event-driven hedge funds. Total alternatives fundraising notched a record in 2021 and we have approximately $36 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of strategies, representing over $230 million of future annual base fees and significant potential performance fees. Finally, BlackRock\u2019s cash management platform generated $44 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter and $94 billion of net inflows in 2021 as we continue to grow market share in a persistent low rate environment by leveraging our scale, product breadth, technology, and risk management on behalf of clients. It has been another strong year for BlackRock. Our global scale and diverse platform allow us to continue investing for the future, whether in good markets or more challenging ones and our differentiated business model remains incredibly well-positioned to sustain industry-leading organic growth and deliver long-term shareholder value. Our commitment remains to optimize organic growth in the most efficient way possible and we will do so responsibly to meet the needs of all stakeholders. With that, I will turn it over to Larry. Laurence Fink : Thank you, Gary. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining the call. I hope you all have had a healthy and happy holiday season that all of you are staying safe. Throughout BlackRock\u2019s history, we have relentlessly focused on helping our clients meet their investment goals and solve their most complex challenges. We have continually invested and reinvested in our business to meet and anticipate our clients\u2019 evolving and changing needs and to deliver the most comprehensive global investment and technology platform. Our 2021 results truly demonstrated the benefits of those investments. BlackRock delivered the strongest organic growth in our history even as our assets under management reached new highs. We generated $540 billion in net inflows in 2021, representing a record 11% organic base fee growth. We also ended the year with strong momentum with $212 billion of fourth quarter net inflows, reflecting our seventh consecutive quarter of organic base fee growth above our 5% target. And we have steadily expanded our organic growth premium relative to the industry, relative to our competitors as our clients continue to entrust us with more of their portfolios. Importantly, our growth is more diversified than it\u2019s ever been. In 2021, our active platform, including alternatives, contributed $267 billion of inflows representing nearly half of our total net inflows. ETFs remained a significant growth driver with record flows of $306 billion. And our technology services revenues grew by 12%, reaching $1.3 billion. This strong momentum across our entire business drove record financial results. For the year, BlackRock delivered 20% revenue growth, 19% operating income growth, 16% ETFs growth and at the same time, we expanded our margins. Two years into the pandemic, we continue to confront new virus strains. We\u2019re confining divergent restriction approaches country by country and even an uneven economy worldwide. Meanwhile, inflation has reached a 40-year high as we see several structural changes take hold. Consumer demand has shifted from services to household goods as people are spending more time at home and benefiting from higher levels of savings. Labor shortages are causing supply chain bottlenecks as people have more choice in the gig economy. The quit rate in the United States has ever been higher reflecting the confidence of employees. And we will need to recognize that the energy transition is inherently inflationary given the significant cost differential between clean and traditional technology today. And that is why we are so optimistic about investing in green technology to move the energy transition forward. BlackRock has always focused on evolving and staying ahead of our clients\u2019 needs as they navigate change, and they are coming to BlackRock more than ever before. They value BlackRock\u2019s insights, they value the breadth of our solutions. They certainly value our global footprint. As a result, BlackRock is building deeper partnerships with more clients across their whole portfolio throughout the world. We have strong conviction in our ability to continue generating differentiated organic growth over the long-term because we have built a platform to help our clients as a fiduciary to meet their objectives in all market environments. And we continue to invest ahead of their evolving needs and are swiftly and aggressively trying to embrace new market opportunities. Our long-term strategy remains to be \u2013 remains to keep up and performance at the heart of BlackRock to accelerate growth in iShares to build out our illiquid alternatives that continue to differentiate our technology to deliver a whole portfolio solution and become a global leader in sustainable investing. BlackRock is a $2.6 trillion active manager and our multiyear investment in incorporating data science, sustainability and new tools for portfolio construction is resulting in stronger growth than at any time in our corporate history. We generated a record $267 billion of net inflows from active strategies in 2021, including a second consecutive year of record active equity inflows. Active strategies contributed over 60% of our annual organic base fees, and our growth is significantly outpacing that of our peers and the broader industry as we take market share in this fragmented landscape. BlackRock\u2019s active mutual fund captured the number one share of industry flows in 2021, and our organic growth rate has tripled the industry. As Gary discussed, our investment performance remained strong with 88% of retractable fix system and 78% of our fundamental active equity funds above benchmark or peer median for a 5-year period. And in the U.S., nearly 80% of our active mutual funds are rated either a Morningstar 4 or Morningstar 5, positioning us well for future growth. Clients are increasingly \u2013 increasing their allocation to alternative strategies as they search for diversification and higher returns. BlackRock has built a broad platform across infrastructure, private credit, real estate and private equity to meet that demand. We raised a record $42 billion in client capital in 2021 and are confident in our ability to accelerate our growth as a leader in private markets. Infrastructure, for example, has significant secular tailwinds, driving growth and will be an important engine of fiscal stimulus for economies looking to build for their future. BlackRock is incredibly well positioned to capture opportunity in this area. We are one of the largest infrastructure managers in the industry with over $35 billion of client assets, including one of the largest renewable power platform. We have grown our platform fourfold in the last 5 years and look forward to partnering with more clients as we raise new vintages in our flagship funds and launched new innovative strategies in this asset class. iShares also had a record year as the global ETF industry crossed $1 trillion in annual inflows for the first time. Growth was driven by greater adoption globally from asset owners, asset managers, wealth managers and more recently, for many of the approximately 40 million first-time investors who opened self-directed investment accounts over the last 2 years. BlackRock and iShares ETFs generated a record $306 billion of net inflows in 2021. We saw strength across each of our product categories including over $100 billion of net inflows into our core ETFs for the first time and nearly $80 billion in our fixed income ETF and more than $50 billion into each of our sustainable and precision ETF categories. We saw strong client demand for fixed income ETFs despite a challenging macro environment for fixed income more broadly. Our growth benefited from the diversity of our product range across inflation rate bonds, municipal bonds, sustainability and emerging market exposures and the diversity of our client base, many of whom are increasingly using ETFs are part of their active portfolio construction. Worldwide ETFs are increasingly becoming the vehicle of choice for accessing a broad range of investment exposures, both in a passive way and in an active way. And as barriers for ETF adoption comes down, it is enabling a new generation of investors to access markets and more and more of them are looking to ETFs as a default investment vehicle. For those wanting to create more customized indexes, our Aladdin technology has long provided this capability to institutions. And through our recent Aperio acquisition, we can now provide custom index capabilities to U.S. wealth advisers. Following a breakout in 2020, momentum and sustainable investments continued, and we generated a record $104 billion of net inflows in 2021 as client demand for sustainable strategies accelerated. We now manage $509 billion in sustainable AUM, more than double from a year ago and remain committed to innovating and expanding choice for our clients. One of the biggest opportunities of this generation will be helping our clients navigate the global transition to a net zero economy. We have already seen $4 trillion of capital move from traditional investments to sustainability ones in the last 2 years alone and this is just the beginning. The transition will not happen overnight and it will require significant investment in technology. BlackRock is working with companies across a wide range of carbon-intensive sectors that are proactively transforming their businesses and whose innovation will be critical to the world\u2019s decarbonization agenda. We believe these companies will present an important investment opportunity for investors. BlackRock is intently focused on helping our clients participate in these opportunities and understand the impact of the transition on their portfolios through better data and analytics. Our ambition is to move more capital into transition than anyone else. Our multi-decade investment into Aladdin technology platform continues to differentiate BlackRock both as an asset manager and a leading fin-tech provider. We generated $1.3 billion in annual technology revenues, up 12% year-over-year. We remain focused on continually evolving Aladdin for the next decade and beyond. We are innovating and extending our capabilities into areas of high client demand, including whole portfolios, wealth and sustainability. The combination of Aladdin and eFront for example, which allows a client to bring together their whole portfolio in one place and customized at scale has already been embraced by over two dozen clients, and the pipeline is the strongest it has ever been and growing. The breadth of BlackRock investment strategies, our technology capabilities and our one BlackRock culture are truly, what differentiates us in providing global portfolio solutions to our clients. In my conversations with clients around the world, I\u2019m hearing about the challenges they are facing and their desire to consolidate the number of partners that they work with. They are increasingly choosing BlackRock as their partner of choice for those large strategic complex relationships. This is resonating, especially in our work with insurance clients. Our strong fourth quarter inflows included a previously announced $49 billion of active fixed income mandate from a large strategic insurance client. Our role at BlackRock is to leverage our insurers expertise and our diversified global platform across asset management, technology, sustainability, advisory solutions to deliver fully and completely to our clients. We see significant opportunity to work more closely with our insurance and broader OCIO clients in 2022 and beyond. Our ability to address client challenges enables us to fulfill our purpose and drive long-term performance that benefits all our stakeholders. Over the last 5 years, clients have entrusted us with $1.8 trillion of net new assets. That\u2019s our organic growth for the last 5 years. We crossed $10 trillion in AUM in the fourth quarter. As with every milestone we reached over the decade, we are incredibly humbled by our client support and their incredible trust they have placed on us. All of us at BlackRock feel and take this deep responsibility in managing every dollar our clients awarded us, whether it is an individual investor using one of our ETFs is their first portfolio or investment account or a very large pension fund entrusting us with their whole portfolio. It is truly an honor that we recognize every moment and every day. BlackRock\u2019s consistent results are possible because of our dedicated employees. I often talk about the importance of putting a company\u2019s purpose at the foundation of a relationship with all stakeholders. Our purpose is resonating with our employees more than ever. BlackRock employee base has remained stable over the last 2 years amidst its turbulent environment. And I\u2019m extremely proud of how passionate our 18,000 employees are in helping more and more people experience financial well-being. I want to take this moment to thank each and every one of our employees and every one of them individually for their continued partnership resilience and hard work and dedication through another difficult year. Everything BlackRock does is rooted in our culture of focusing on the long-term, and we will continue to innovate. We will continue to be using our scale and contributing to a more equitable and more resilient future to benefit more clients to benefit our employees, and to benefit our shareholders and the people and communities worldwide where we operate. I firmly believe that the efforts of 2021 will position BlackRock to deliver value over the long run for all our stakeholders.  With that, let me open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Laurence Fink : Hi, Alex. Happy New Year. Alex Blostein : Hi, good morning, everybody. Happy New Year to you as well. So maybe we could start with a question around just the active dynamics for BlackRock in 2021. Clearly, a great year, record year in active flows across the board, equity, fixed income etcetera. How sustainable do you think this trend will be, I guess, into \u201822. And then I also was hoping you could expand on how faster increases in interest rates could also impact asset allocation decisions over the next 12 to 18 months? Laurence Fink : Sure. Excuse me. I\u2019m getting over a cold from my grandchild. Our results in our active investment strategies is really one of the core transformations of BlackRock over many years of work. The history of BlackRock was an active fixed income manager, our acquisition of BGI with our fantastic quantitative approach to both fixed income and equity active strategies, our development in our illiquid space where we built out that platform, our recommitment and fortifying our fundamental equity teams over the last 5 years, which led to great performance. In addition, over the last 5 years, Alex, and you\u2019re aware of this, our build-out of our distribution team, our build-out in the RIA channel, having $102 billion of inflows from retail globally, the large portion of that was active. So it\u2019s not just building out our investment teams and fortifying them, but it was building out also our distribution side of our businesses, too. That\u2019s all built -- led to a well-positioned as active strategies continue to be a choice with more and more investors worldwide. And let\u2019s be clear, many of our flows in ETFs were from active strategies too. So, across the board, the $267 billion of inflows represented from great performance, well positioned, and I think that will continue to build in 2022. I would say the other major thing is, and I talked about this quite a bit in my prepared remarks was our whole portfolio approach. We believe more and more organizations are going to be looking to outsource large components of their balance sheets, whether it\u2019s in insurance company, a pension fund and endowment, and we are looking for an organization that can position that quite well because of our business model of having both active and index products across having the technology to interface with our clients, whereas we are probably the best positioned organization in the world to meet those types of opportunities. And so if anything, I think that momentum in active is going to accelerate going forward, especially in the OCIO area and whole portfolios. This is going to be driving more and more of our success. Obviously, we saw flows in sustainability that continues to be driven our success in illiquids has really been a cornerstone of our 2021 results. So, I am extremely optimistic on our positioning for \u201822 and beyond. In terms of rising rates, it really depends on how rising rates are going to be resulting in. Are we going to see a flattening yield curve with rising rates, are we going to see a steepening yield curve? I tend to believe we are going to have more of a flat there on. If central banks raise rates 8x to 10x, which the forward curve suggests, we did have a 2.25-year, 2.5-year, let\u2019s say, short-term rate. The real question is what does that mean for the 10-year rate. Those questions and how that plays out is going to be very important. The biggest opportunity that we have is how BlackRock is positioned in the opportunities we have. I really do believe whether we have rising rates, a flattening yield curve, a steepening yield curve, we will be part of the conversation with all our investors worldwide. Gary Shedlin : Yes, Larry, maybe I can just jump in on the rates, just one thing for Alex. I think obviously, the dynamic between rates going up and our level of AUM, I think is well known. But I would just highlight a couple of things. One is \u2013 our $2.8 trillion is primarily institutional for sure. And obviously, those are very sticky assets that are both strategic and matched for liability. So, we think we have very sticky assets. Two is we are obviously very well positioned in terms of our broad-based fixed income platform. So, whether it\u2019s unconstrained, high yield, total return or short duration, I think we have got that. So, we are ready for a rotation. And more importantly, I think really is if rates go up, a bunch of cash is likely to come off the sidelines, and so that will enable us to basically move that cash into other asset classes. And as I mentioned in my remarks, very importantly, we waived $500 million of fees last year in our cash business, that first 25 basis point move by the Fed, and as many people think that could come as early as the first quarter. We think that will free up almost all of those waivers. That will have about a 0.5 basis point increase on our annualized effective fee rate. And obviously, we have talked about while we share roughly half of that with our distributors that will drop a significant amount of incremental profitability to the bottom line. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Your line is open. Laurence Fink : Hi Craig. Happy New Year. Craig Siegenthaler : Hi, good morning Larry, Rob, Gary, Hope you are all doing well. First, I just want to congratulate you on being the first asset manager to reach $10 trillion. Laurence Fink : Well, it is just a number. Thank you. Craig Siegenthaler : So, my question is on the ETF business. We saw that the New York State insurance regulator just published an update on the capital treatment of fixed income ETFs as bonds instead of equities. I know this has been a focus for a while, but do you think this could open the door to larger ETF allocations from your insurance company clients? Laurence Fink : Let me give that to Rob. Robert Kapito : That\u2019s a great question, Craig. As to catch everybody up towards the end of 2021, you saw the New York Department of Financial Services published a rule which permits insurance firms to treat diversified liquid bond ETFs like bonds for the purpose of risk-based capital. And this puts bond ETFs on a level playing field with bonds in an insurance portfolio. So, so far we are really excited by the initial client feedback and interest to ETFs. Because of this rule, we are very optimistic as how this could lead to future growth. And this is just another sign of an unlock to come as ETFs are gaining increased understanding. And you know in the past, we have said that we expect by 2025 that ETFs are going to reach $15 trillion from $10 trillion today. We still believe that. And even at that level, ETFs would still be a small part of the capital markets, which is why we think there are decades of growth ahead. And so, we are very excited about the fact that insurers now will use more ETFs to represent their bond portfolio, but a good question and a good insight by you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Michael Cyprys : Hi, good morning everyone. Happy New Year. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask on Aladdin, I was just hoping you could update us on your number of a lot of initiatives. You guys have a lot going on there from migrating to Microsoft Azure to the Snowflake partnership, Aladdin Climate. Maybe you could just expand upon the progress on those different initiatives where they stand. Some of them earlier stages than others. What\u2019s been built out? What\u2019s left and that sort of early feedback from clients, maybe you could talk a little bit how you see that unlocking the revenue growth ahead? Laurence Fink : Let me tackle the scale of Aladdin Climate, and I will have Gary comment on the progress with Azure and Snowflake. As I said in my prepared remarks, client demand for Aladdin has accelerated, especially with more and more remote working, having a comprehensive platform, a whole portfolio solution platform is really highlights the opportunities and the strength of Aladdin and more and more investment firms, asset owners and insurance companies are looking for Aladdin as an opportunity to expand their ability to navigate markets. As we built out on Aladdin, as you suggested Michael, the whole space of where Aladdin is growing out, whether it is Aladdin provider, connecting every Aladdin user to its custodial relationship, intersecting that. Aladdin Wealth, connecting Aladdin to wealth managers and having them more connected. And we are in the beta sites right now of rolling out with some of our airline users already on Climate. And that will continue to be, in my mind, one of the principal drivers for Aladdin utilization going forward. And then the greater utilization of alternatives, the combination of Aladdin and eFront really extended Aladdin across the entire investment ecosystem end-to-end. And so with Aladdin provider with Aladdin Wealth and now Aladdin Climate across all the portfolios, I do believe it is going to drive accelerated growth for Aladdin going forward. I am incredibly optimistic about the opportunities we have. And I truly believe as more and more regulators are asking questions related to Climate and how do you quantify Climate as a risk, the need for Aladdin is essential in terms of understanding that risk as one measurement. I mean there are many other tools that people could use, but it will be one of the measurements that people can utilize. And I would also add one of the great strengths for Aladdin over the last 2 years and why greater utilization is open to Aladdin. We are now allowing every user of Aladdin to put their own models in that are proprietary to them. So, Aladdin as a risk management system is not a monolithic system, what Aladdin has become is more an operating ecosystem and helping the owners of money, the asset managers of money to really navigate across asset categories, communication to client, communication to the custodial bank and having your own proprietary risk system. And that has been one of the great transitions of Aladdin and then dovetailing that, the infrastructure of Aladdin related to Azure and Snowflake. And I will allow Gary to talk about what we are doing in the infrastructure to create a more resilient Aladdin. Gary Shedlin : Thanks, Larry. So, Mike, I think you were specifically asking about cloud, I will give you just a couple of comments. We are obviously migrating Aladdin from BlackRock managed data centers to the cloud. And we think that, that partnership with Microsoft, in particular, brings a number of enhanced capabilities to both ourselves and Aladdin clients. I mean the big four for us are to localize data hosting. As Larry talked about, really unlocking growth as a key part of our strategy to open Aladdin, where clients are really looking to use both data and APIs in ways that differentiate them and help to express their own competitive advantage. We are looking to accelerate innovation and finally, migrating to the cloud is going to help us support greater computing scale and elasticity at our clients as we see client demand to use data clearly increasing. More importantly, though, it\u2019s beyond just the cloud. I mean we are making investments really to address the needs of what we consider the investor for the future. Obviously, a focus on whole portfolio solutions. You know about our acquisition of eFront, where we bring public and private capabilities together in one platform, sustainability data and analytics, which will be very critical. We talked about flexible tech solutions and connectivity that we just talked about, but also integrated data ecosystem that will allow clients to combine both Aladdin and non-Aladdin data, which I think is going to be important. We are about two-thirds complete with our client migrations. That is ahead of our initial plan and we anticipate completing the remainder of those client migrations likely in the first half of 2022. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks. Good morning. Happy New Year. Maybe just to circle back on sustainable investing. It looks like that continues to be about nearly 20% of your organic growth. And you are now at over $500 billion, you are well on your way to making that $1 trillion mark well before the end of the decade if this type of pace continues. But maybe, Larry, if you could talk about how you are seeing recent trends in demand momentum in the U.S. versus Europe. Obviously, Europe has been more of the growth engine over the long-term on sustainable investing. But maybe you can just talk about that differentiation. And then also just on carbon transition as well. This is such a developing market. I don\u2019t know if you have a view on what a longer term market opportunity for investment product could be from AUM size in that area? And what sort of products you are targeting to do? Laurence Fink : Great question. Thanks, Brian. Well, in 2020, we made a large statement related to the tectonic shift that we have seen is going to occur in the investment world. And we continue to see rising interest in sustainability worldwide. And I think just by evidence of 2021, we saw $31 billion of flows in the U.S. and sustainability. $65 billion of flows from EMEA, which you suggested more in Europe, $8 billion from APAC. And we went from about $100 billion in 2019 to $500 billion today. I think that we are in different spots as evidenced by those flows, as you suggested. In Europe, if you do not have a sustainability lens, you will not be awarded any mandates today. It is a component of all. I want to \u2013 we are all investing in Europe today. In the United States, it\u2019s still quite mixed depending on the institution, but it\u2019s growing. It\u2019s growing because, a, we are able to create a customized portfolios, and this is the power of Aladdin for us. Customized portfolio for those clients are looking to \u2013 start looking at sustainability as an investment opportunity and an investment risk. And I believe this will continue to be driving flows in the coming years. The big opportunity and the greatest opportunity in this area is investing in new is a new technology. As I said in my prepared remarks, if we move to a green economy tomorrow without new technology, it\u2019s going to lead to an unfair and unjust transition. And as we witnessed in so many places already with rising energy prices, we have seen governments capping energy costs to the consumer. Even the European countries that are so focused on sustainability like France and Spain have caps and heating and other things like that. So, this is going to be a very long as I discussed over the years, a very long transition and very \u2013 and it\u2019s not going to be a straight line. The opportunity then is to be working with traditional hydrocarbon companies who are going to be part of the solution. It\u2019s going to be working with agricultural companies who are part of the solution. It is investing in new start-ups whether it is to create blue or green hydrogen or blue or green ammonia to find new solutions for green cement and steel for investing in new opportunities and sequestering of hydrocarbons. So, we believe climate transition opportunities for renewable power for this new technology is going to be \u2013 are going to be great. And I do believe there is going to be huge investment opportunities going forward. So, it\u2019s a combination of navigating your current portfolio as it lends, but also the opportunities in investing in side-by-side with hydrocarbon companies or investing in new technologies and new start-ups. Gary, why don\u2019t you carry on and talk about sustainability, too, please? Gary Shedlin : I think you got it, Larry. I think you hit on all the key parts of the question in terms of just flows. I mean unless Brian, there was anything specific you wanted additional color on the flows. I think Larry captured it. EMEA was basically 65% of flows sustainability for the year. Larry mentioned the U.S. being about $30 billion. I think importantly, the U.S. was up 50% year-over-year, notwithstanding that it\u2019s still only about a third of those flows. But otherwise, I think Larry, you captured it. Laurence Fink : Thank you. Brian Bedell : Okay. Operator : Alright. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached a lot of time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks? Laurence Fink : Thank you, operator. I want to thank all of you for joining us today and your continued interest in BlackRock. Our fourth quarter and full year performance is a direct result of our commitment to serving our clients, investing for the long-term anticipating their needs. And hopefully, you could hear from Gary and I and Rob, we see tremendous opportunities ahead. And BlackRock\u2019s focus remains on investing in our people, investing in the communities where we operate and to stay in front of our clients\u2019 needs. If we do all those well, our shareholders are going to be the biggest beneficiary. And I do believe this is what has enabled us to continue to deliver strong, durable, long-term returns for all of our shareholders. Thank you again, and let\u2019s hope we have a great start in the New Year, and we all stay healthy and safe. Talk to you in a few months. Bye-bye now.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated First Quarter 2022 Earnings Teleconference. Our hosts for today\u2019s call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference. Christopher Meade : Good morning, everyone. I\u2019m Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock\u2019s actual results may, of course, differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Gary. Gary Shedlin : Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to present results for the first quarter of 2022. Before I turn it over to Larry, I\u2019ll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as adjusted financial results, I\u2019ll be focusing primarily on our as adjusted results. As many of you know, beginning in the first quarter of 2022, we updated our definitions of as adjusted operating income, operating margin, and net income to exclude the impact of intangible asset amortization, other acquisition-related costs, and contingent consideration fair value adjustments. We believe that excluding the impact of these expenses provides investors and management with a more useful understanding of our financial performance over time, while also increasing comparability with other asset management companies. BlackRock regularly reviews our disclosures with the goal of providing helpful information to our investors, and we may consider additional non-GAAP adjustments in the future. To provide consistent comparisons to historical results, we recast quarterly as-adjusted metrics to account for these changes for 2020 and 2021. This recast was posted on BlackRock\u2019s Investor Relations website in late March and also has been included on Pages 12 and 13 of our earnings release, while year-over-year and sequential financial comparisons referenced on this call will relate current quarter results to these recast financials. BlackRock\u2019s performance in the first quarter once again underscores the strength of our platform and our ability to serve clients in a variety of market conditions. We\u2019ve invested for years to diversify our platform and to develop industry-leading franchises in ETFs, private markets, technology, active management, and sustainable investing. These successful multiyear investments have enabled us to deepen our solutions-oriented relationships with clients and have strengthened and diversified our organic revenue growth profile. BlackRock generated total net flows of $86 billion in the first quarter, representing 3% annualized organic asset growth with $114 billion of long-term net inflows, partially offset by $27 billion of generally seasonal cash management outflows. Quarterly long-term net inflows were positive across all asset classes, investment styles, and regions. Annualized organic base fee growth of 2% reflected the impact of two sizable institutional index mandates and strong flows into core equity ETFs during the quarter. First quarter revenue of $4.7 billion increased 7% year-over-year, while operating income of $1.8 billion rose 14%, reflecting the impact of approximately $185 million of closed-end fund launch costs in the first quarter of 2021. Earnings per share of $9.52 was up 18% compared to a year ago, also reflecting a lower effective tax rate and a lower diluted share count, partially offset by lower non-operating income in the current quarter. Non-operating results for the quarter included $29 million of net investment losses, driven primarily by mark-to-market declines in the value of unhedged seed capital investments. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the quarter was approximately 17% and included $133 million of discrete tax benefits, including benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in the first quarter of each year. We continue to estimate 24% as a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2022, though the actual effective tax rate may differ because of nonrecurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation. First quarter base fee and securities lending revenue of $3.8 billion was up 7% year-over-year, primarily driven by 8% organic base fee growth over the last 12 months. Sequentially, base fee and securities lending revenue was down 3%, reflecting in part the impact of a lower day count in the first quarter. On an equivalent day count basis, our effective fee rate was essentially flat compared to the fourth quarter as the negative impact of divergent equity beta was offset by lower discretionary money market fee waivers. We incurred approximately $75 million of gross discretionary yield support waivers in the first quarter. However, waivers for our flagship funds were essentially removed following rate hikes by the Bank of England and Federal Reserve in March. Recall that approximately 50% of gross fee waivers are generally shared with distributors, so the benefit to base fees is partially offset by higher distribution expense. Performance fees of $98 million decreased from a year ago, primarily reflected lower revenue from liquid alternative and long-only products, partially offset by higher fees from illiquid alternatives. Recent market volatility could result in reduced ability to earn performance fees from certain liquid alternative and long-only products during the remainder of 2022. Quarterly technology services revenue increased 11% from a year ago. Annual Contract Value, or ACV, increased 13% year-over-year and we remain confident in our ability to continue delivering low-to-mid-teens ACV growth as we see strong demand for Aladdin\u2019s end-to-end cloud-based SaaS capabilities. Total expense increased 3% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher compensation expense. Recall that expense in the first quarter of 2021 included $185 million of closed-end fund launch costs, which are excluded when reporting our as-adjusted operating margin. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up 7% year-over-year, reflecting higher base compensation, partially offset by lower incentive compensation, driven in part by the lower mark-to-market impact of certain deferred cash compensation programs. G&A expense was down 17% year-over-year, reflecting the previously mentioned closed-end fund launch costs in the first quarter of 2021. Excluding these costs, G&A expense increased 19% from a year ago due to ongoing strategic investments in technology, including the migration of Aladdin to the cloud along with increases in marketing and promotional expense, including higher T&E expense associated with our return-to-office strategy. Sequentially, G&A expense decreased 12%, primarily reflecting seasonally lower marketing and promotional expense and lower professional services and occupancy expense, partially offset by higher technology expense. Disclosure enhancements introduced this quarter include the addition of a separate G&A expense line item for sub-advisory expense, which historically was included within portfolio services expense. We hope this will provide more transparency into costs associated with the successful growth of our OCIO business, which are more than offset by associated base fees. As Larry will discuss in more detail, momentum in our OCIO business is accelerating as the trend towards outsourcing increases, and BlackRock is well positioned to capture this opportunity. Direct fund expense increased 3% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher average index AUM. Sequentially, quarterly direct fund expense increased despite lower average index AUM due to higher rebates that seasonally occur in the fourth quarter. Our first quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 44.2% was down 160 basis points from a year ago, primarily reflecting the ongoing strategic investments we are making in technology and our people. As we stated in January, our business has never been better positioned to take advantage of the opportunities before us. We are increasingly seeing clients looking for ways to optimize portfolio returns at a lower cost by forging deeper relationships with fewer managers, including fully outsourced relationships. These trends favor global, comprehensive and scaled platforms like BlackRock\u2019s as evidenced by several such wins over the recent quarters, and we see more opportunities ahead. As always, we remain committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible. We have deep conviction in the stability of our diverse business model, which has demonstrated strong resilience in a variety of markets and our ability to proactively manage our cost structure. In the near term, we remain focused on the opportunity set ahead of us and are continuing to invest responsibly to support our growth and to drive our strategic initiatives. We continually focus on managing our entire discretionary expense base, and we will continue to be prudent in reevaluating our overall level of spend, if market conditions necessitate us doing so. Our capital management strategy remains, first, to invest in our business and then to return excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We continue to invest through prudent use of our balance sheet to best position BlackRock for continued success through seed and co-investments to support organic growth and through strategic investments to further accelerate our efforts. As Larry will discuss in more detail, earlier this week, we announced the minority investment in Circle, the operator of the market infrastructure for USDC, a dollar-based fully reserved stable coin and one of the fastest-growing digital assets with more than $52 billion in circulation. Circle\u2019s technology currently enables the frictionless and real-time transfer of payments and is being explored for other applications across the financial ecosystem. We previously announced an 18% increase in our quarterly dividend to $4.88 per share of common stock and repurchased $500 million worth of common shares in the first quarter. At present, based on our capital spending plans for the year and subject to market conditions, including the relative valuation of our stock price, we still anticipate repurchasing at least $375 million of shares per quarter for the balance of the year consistence with our previous guidance in January. As you\u2019ll also hear from Larry, BlackRock relationships with our clients have never been stronger, and they continue to turn to BlackRock to help them meet their long-term investment needs. BlackRock\u2019s first quarter and total net inflows of $86 billion were positive across client, channels and regions highlighting the breadth of our platform. ETFs generated net inflows of $56 billion, representing 7% annualized organic asset and 4% annualized organic base fee growth. Results once again highlight the unique diversity of our ETF product segments, supported by particularly strong equity, sustainable and commodity ETFs. The diversity of our ETF franchise enables us to generate durable, industry-leading organic revenue growth in varying macroeconomic environments. For example, as inflation expectations persisted, investors turn to our commodity ETFs, where we are now the clear category leader, and as Larry will highlight, our bond ETFs gathered net inflows in one of the most challenging quarters for fixed income in recent history. Retail net inflows of $10 billion were positive in both the U.S. and internationally and reflected strength in equities, liquid alternatives and active multi-asset funds. BlackRock\u2019s institutional franchise generated $47 billion of net inflows as our global scale, investment expertise and world-class technology and risk management enable us to increasingly serve as the partner of choice for institutional clients. BlackRock\u2019s institutional active franchise generated $16 billion of net inflows, led by continued growth into our LifePath target date, alternatives and systematic active equity offerings. Institutional index net inflows of $31 billion included approximately $70 billion from two large institutional clients with whom we have deep relationships, spanning multiple investment strategies. Demand for alternatives also continued, with $6 billion of net inflows into illiquid and liquid alternative strategies during the quarter driven by private credit, infrastructure and liquid alternative offerings. Fundraising momentum remains strong, and we have approximately $36 billion of committed capital to deploy for clients in a variety of alternative strategies, representing a significant source of future base and performance fees. Our $330 billion alternatives and liquid credit platform has gained significant momentum over recent years. And to provide increased visibility, starting this quarter, we\u2019re including additional detail in our earnings supplement on AUM and committed capital managed by our alternatives team. Overall, BlackRock generated approximately $20 billion of active net inflows during the quarter and has now generated positive active flows in all but one quarter since the beginning of 2019. Finally, BlackRock\u2019s cash management platform saw net outflows of $27 billion, driven by redemptions from offshore prime and U.S. government money market funds, in line with the broader money market fund industry. BlackRock has steadily grown our share of the cash management industry by leveraging our scale and delivering innovative distribution and risk management solutions for clients. We are an existing manager of the cash reserves that underpin USDC, and we look forward to partnering with Circle to expand that relationship and become their primary manager in the future. In summary, our first quarter results once again highlight the benefits of the investments we\u2019ve made in high-growth areas to diversify and strengthen our platform. Many of the areas in which we are generating strong growth today, such as alternatives and ESG, were not significant contributors just a few years ago. As a result, we are better able to deliver resilient organic growth and develop deeper client relationships today, than at any point in BlackRock\u2019s history. Our commitment remains to optimize organic growth in the most efficient way possible, and we will do so responsibly to meet the needs of all stakeholders. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry. Laurence Fink : Thank you, Gary, and good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining the call. As I wrote to shareholders last month, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has created a humanitarian tragedy and is impacting not only geopolitics, but also the global economies. It\u2019s going to fundamentally alter the path of globalization that we\u2019ve seen over the past 30 years. The flow of goods and people across borders will still be critical to economic growth and new technologies will continue to shrink geographic distances, but countries and companies are reevaluating their interdependencies in a way that we have not seen since the end of the Cold War. As a fiduciary, BlackRock is working to understand how these structural changes will impact our client portfolios, and we will help them pursue their long-term financial goals. The breadth and scale of BlackRock\u2019s platform enables us to serve clients in all market environments. We invested over many years to build a comprehensive investment platform, industry-leading technology and a global footprint with local expertise. By evolving ahead of the needs of our clients, we have grown as a trusted partner to all our clients. We constantly work to provide our clients with that type of insight, but close connectivity becomes even more important during periods of market volatility and uncertainty. Over the last two months, following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, BlackRock held over 200 client engagements and hosted market update calls attended by more than 4,600 clients. I also recently visited clients in Japan and the Middle East and here in the United States, many of whom are trying to understand how geopolitical and macroeconomic shifts might impact their investment outcomes. I remember the same heightened level of connectivity with our clients during the initial weeks of the pandemic in spring 2020. I believe our relationships with clients have never been stronger. Our clients appreciate our voice and our consistent advocacy for long-term investing on their behalf. Our first quarter\u2019s result demonstrates these strengths. BlackRock generated $114 billion in net long-term inflows in the first quarter, demonstrating the breadth of our asset management platform and positive flows across all product types all investment styles in all regions. Organic growth in the quarter included two significant client mandates, reflecting our ability to deepen partnerships and build a comprehensive relationship with clients globally. We also saw a 13% ACV growth in technology services as more clients recognize the benefits of Aladdin. I\u2019m incredibly excited about the opportunities ahead of us, and we will continue to invest for the future. Throughout our 23-year history as a public company, we have demonstrated that we are intentional about our investment spend and focused on our margins. I have found that often, in times of market uncertainty, that is the greatest opportunity that we could find. BlackRock\u2019s breadth and resilience enables us to play offense when others may be pulling back. Our agility in responding to opportunities and continued investments across market cycles have driven our industry-leading growth, our consistent growth and generated value for our shareholders. Our investments are closely aligned with our strategy to keep alpha at the heart of BlackRock, accelerated growth in iShares, in private markets and Aladdin to deliver a whole portfolio advice and solutions to our clients and be the global leader in sustainable investing. Our clients are trying to understand the implications of the rapidly changing investment environment. The Russian invasion of Ukraine marks a profound geopoliticalship that is accelerating a reassessment of global supply chains. It also creates a supply shock in commodities that is further increasing inflation. Even before the war, inflation was already top of mind for many investors as the effect of the pandemic, including the shift in consumer demand from services to capital goods, labor shortages and supply chain bottlenecks, broad inflation in the United States, in Canada and the United Kingdom, across European Union to the highest level in decades. Central Banks are in a difficult position as we look to carefully raise rates to contain inflation without harming economic activity and employment. They may eventually have to live with a supply-driven inflation rather than take policy rates above neutral levels. However, they may be forced to be more aggressive policy stance of inflation expectations become unchartered. Bond markets have been quick to price in the Fed\u2019s rate projections and saw one of the worst quarters on record for the US bond market. The market was down or the US aggregate index was down more than 5%. Equity markets, on the other hand, has shown some resilience. Following significant market volatility in the first quarter, US and European broad market indexes regained some of their losses and ended down the quarter around 5% and 6%, respectively. As always, BlackRock remains guided by our clients\u2019 needs, and we constantly evolve so we could be better serving them. Clients increasingly want to work with fewer partners who could provide more, and BlackRock is uniquely positioned to capture opportunities as clients consolidate their investment providers. We have the investment expertise. We have the operational excellence and the technology capabilities work with clients of all types and sizes, and we are well positioned to help them meet their objectives and to serve all of their own stakeholders. The global insurance industry, for example, is undergoing significant transformation as insurers optimize their operating model and leverage outsourced investment management solutions. We have built a leading insurance platform compromising fixed income investment specialists, insurance advisory expertise and added analytical capabilities to deliver the best of BlackRock to our insurance clients. We are also seeing the results of these investments through deeper relationships with all our clients, and significant opportunities are in front of us today. Last month, we announced the significant assignment with AIG, spanning asset management and Aladdin. BlackRock will manage up to $150 billion of AIG and its life and retirement company\u2019s investment portfolio. This is another great example of one BlackRock effort, to bring together our platform, to serve our clients in a way that no other asset manager can do. All of us here at BlackRock take a deep responsibility in managing every dollar for every client who awards us money. From institutions entrusting us with their whole portfolios to that individual investor using one of our ETFs in their first investment account. In the first quarter, we once again saw investors using ETFs to quickly allocate capital and the managed risk during periods of volatility. In the US, iShares\u2019 secondary trading volumes were up nearly 40% compared to 2021 levels providing clients worldwide with the liquidity they needed in volatile markets. We generated $56 billion of ETF net inflows in the first quarter with growth coming from each of our major product categories, including core strategic and precision ETFs. In fixed income ETFs, we generated $8 billion in net inflows for the quarter. Similar to equity ETFs, we are seeing more investors adopt and use fixed income ETFs to gain market exposure and for tactical positioning within their fixed income exposures. We saw demand for treasury, short duration, inflation-linked, sustainable munis and broad-based market exposures would more than offset risk-off sentiments in areas like high yield and emerging markets. Our growth in fixed income ETFs highlight the diversity of our fixed income ETF product range and our ability to deliver the market qualities clients expect in stressed markets. The liquidity, the transparency and lower transaction costs of fixed income ETFs present a more efficient way for investors to access the entire bond market. We believe that our fixed income ETFs will benefit from more long-term secular tailwinds that play a significant role in the modernization of the $100 trillion bond market. BlackRock generated $20 billion of active net inflows across our active equities, multi-asset and alternative strategies. Investment performance remains strong over the long-term, positioning us well for future growth with 86% and 81% of our taxable fixed and fundamental active equities above benchmark or peer medium for the three-year, respectively, and for the five-year period. 90% of our taxable fixed income, 83% of our fundamental active equity AUM is above benchmark or peer medium. In the U.S., 75% of our active mutual funds are in a Morningstar four or five rated fund, and we continue to generate growth and capture market share across the U.S. active mutual fund franchise in the first quarter. In alternatives, $6 billion of net inflows across liquid and illiquid strategies led by private credit and infrastructure. And we\u2019re continuing to steadily deploy assets on behalf of our clients, including another $5 billion in the first quarter. Deployment activity was led by our climate finance partnership strategy that we announced last year, which seeks to accelerate the flow of capital into climate-related investments in the emerging markets. One of the biggest opportunities in alternatives in the years ahead will be the intersection of infrastructure and sustainability. In response to the energy shocks caused by the war in Ukraine, many countries around the world are reevaluating their energy dependencies and are looking for new sources of energy. This may mean increasing production of traditional energy sources in the near term. But I believe recent events will accelerate the shift towards greener sources of energy in many parts of the world over the long-term, and we will see a tremendous changes in the energy transition. This presents a significant long-term opportunity for investments in infrastructure, renewable, clean tech on behalf of our clients. BlackRock has one of the largest renewable power platforms in the industry, managing over $8 billion of assets and client commitments. And we are expanding our transition-focused investment strategies. BlackRock is committed to be helping clients navigate this energy transition. We are working with energy companies throughout the world, who are essential in meeting society\u2019s energy needs. It will play a critical role in any successful transition. To ensure the continuity of affordable energy prices during the transition, fossil fuels like natural gas will be important as a transition fuel. BlackRock is also investing on behalf of our clients in natural gas pipelines. For example, in the Middle East, we invested in one of the largest pipelines for natural gas, which will help the region utilize less oil for power production. These investments are a great example of helping countries go from dark brown to lighter brown as a substitute oil with a cleaner base fuel like natural gas. Client demand for sustainable investments, more broadly also continue to be strong. We saw a $19 billion of long-term net inflows into both our active and index sustainable strategies in the first quarter. Our ability to partner with clients across the whole portfolio and quickly adapt to rapidly shifting market environments continues to drive demand for Aladdin\u2019s integrated end-to-end technology platform. BlackRock remains focused on investing in Aladdin to support its areas, such as chapters of growth, and extending its capabilities into areas like whole portfolio, private markets, wealth and sustainable investment solutions. We see the value proposition of Aladdin deeply resonating with clients, and we generated a 13% technological service ACV growth over -- year-over-year. Clients are increasingly combining Aladdin with our newer offerings such as eFront or Aladdin accounting, highlighting the benefits of our continuous innovations and investments to stay ahead of our clients\u2019 needs. Our Aladdin client relationships are long term in nature, and we will have historically seen industry-leading contract renewable rates. The recent market environment has also reinforced the need for offerings like Aladdin Wealth. Usage of Aladdin Wealth by financial advisers at our clients has increased by more than 40% during the first quarter as financial advisers look to assess portfolio risk, to assess market exposures across every one of their clients across their entire business. We have over two dozen global client -- Aladdin Wealth clients and expect further growth to come from expansion into different wealth segments and in markets around the world. We are increasingly interest -- seeing interest from our clients that BlackRock is also studying digital assets and their associated ecosystem, including crypto assets, stable coin, tokenization and permission blockchains, where we see a potential to benefit our clients and capital markets more broadly. Earlier this week, we announced that BlackRock made a minority investment in Circle, a global Internet payment firm and the sole issuer of USD coin, a dollar-based fully reserved stablecoin, which is one of the fastest-growing digital assets in the world. BlackRock is already the manager of USDC cash reserves, and we look forward to begin expanding our relationship to become the primary manager of the cash reserves. Over the past year that we have worked with Circle, we have been so impressed with their mission, their management team, their technology and their thoughtful approach to growth. BlackRock has always led by listening to our clients, by anticipating and embracing change and investing in ahead of their future needs. Let me say again, we are very honored by the deep trust our clients place in us. My recent meetings with our clients around the world have only strengthened my conviction in the opportunities that BlackRock has in front of us. I believe we have never been better positioned for our future. As always, I\u2019m incredibly proud of our employees who live our principles, who are staying true to our purpose and are focusing on the long-term needs of our shareholders, the long-term needs of our clients, the needs of our colleagues and the needs and long-term issues that are impacting the communities where we work every day. With that, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Laurence Fink : Hey, Craig. Craig Siegenthaler : Hey. Good morning, Larry. Hope, you and the team are doing well. Laurence Fink : We are healthy and safe. Thank you. I hope you too are feeling too. Craig Siegenthaler : That\u2019s great. Larry, my first question is on fixed income demand and the inflationary backdrop. And we know there is some reaction to lower bond prices in the quarter, but iShares bond ETF flows are still positive. But given your wide product breadth in fixed income, and I\u2019m thinking about unconstrained SIO, I wanted your perspective on future client demand trends in fixed income just given the likely fast ramp in Fed funds over the next 12 months, although we\u2019re probably likely going to see a flatter year growth, too. Laurence Fink : Well, as I\u2019ve been saying, I think we\u2019re going to have an inverted yield curve for some time, but let me get into the specifics of your question. Obviously, fixed income is a broad universe of different products, different maturities or durations. During market volatility, like we\u2019ve witnessed, you would see outflows from retail as they move into different products, maybe in the cash, maybe in the equities. But if anything, in fixed income institutionally, you see it very stable. And if we have rising 10-year and 30-year rates , you\u2019re going to see a huge movement in defeasing of pension fund liabilities, which is going to create a huge demand. That is why I believe we\u2019re going to have an inverted yield curve, which I\u2019ve been talking about for quarters. But tactically, investors can move out of longer durations to lower duration or shorter duration. Obviously, if cash and money market funds begin yielding 2%, 2.5%, you\u2019ll see movement away from maybe longer-dated funds into shorter-dated funds. So let\u2019s be clear, movement within fixed income is quite large. As I talked about, 40%, greater turnover in our fixed income ETFs, some of that is repositioning across a portfolio, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re witnessing. And I think that just highlights the resiliency of fixed income ETFs that is able to really help investors worldwide with that type of liquidity. But I think clients around the world are going to be navigating this. You mentioned SIO. SIO, obviously, with an unconstrained duration, depending on the investors\u2019 wishes and how they think they should be positioned, is a great example of innovation within fixed income that investors can now give our investment team, under Rick Rieder in this case, the ability to navigate around that duration. They\u2019re not stuck to the duration of the aggregate index. And I believe that\u2019s -- we did see flows there. We\u2019re going to continue to see real opportunities unconstrained. This is why we\u2019ve developed SIO. So I think across the board, you\u2019re seeing portfolios are being navigated around fixed income, but we basically broadly saw clients are reevaluating where they should be across the yield curve. We continue to see broad-based demand from municipals in this country. And so across the board, we\u2019re not seeing any real panic at all in the fixed income market, despite the worst performance in fixed income in 30-plus years in one quarter. So, I would say rising rates is an opportunity, not a problem. I would tell you clearly that this is where the conversation and deep partnership is really helping us with our clients and helping them navigate how should they think about duration, and how should they think about inflation, how can they -- can they create a return that\u2019s above long-term inflation rates. So, these are all the issues that we are in dialog with. But I think we\u2019re very well positioned for working with our clients on a rising rate environment. And let me open it up to Rob to give you a little more tactical information. Robert Kapito : Yeah. So just to follow-up on Larry\u2019s comments, we typically are helping clients assess their duration and maturity risk, especially in their core bond portfolios. And we help them rotate within fixed income depending upon what they\u2019re seeking protection from, which could be rising rates in different parts of the curve. And that is why we saw $1.5 billion of net inflows into SIO and FIGO, as Larry described, that are less constrained. But more importantly, we see this in the ETF market, because it\u2019s the ability for people to gain market exposure and tactical positioning very quickly within fixed income. A lot of times, you have to accumulate the positions over a period of time. It\u2019s much faster, quicker diversified if you do that through ETF fixed income. So we\u2019re seeing flows across the board. The performance has been good, but certainly clients are concerned how do we position in a rising rate environment. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. Laurence Fink : Hi Dan. Dan Fannon : I was hoping you could talk about the outsourced CIO opportunity. You guys have had several large wins. Maybe discuss the dialog that you\u2019re having with prospective clients and how you see, I don\u2019t know the size or opportunity of that over time? Laurence Fink : So, we are having dialog with pension funds worldwide on this, with insurance companies worldwide. Because of comprehensiveness of our investment platform, because of Aladdin, we provide a unique position with all these companies in terms of outsourcing whether it\u2019s part of a general kind of an insurance company or the entire pension fund. We announced last year what\u2019s our big win with British share in the UK. We\u2019re having many conversations right now with other pension funds. We\u2019re looking to see what -- how BlackRock can help them achieve their long-term goals and aspirations. We\u2019re working with many insurance companies and see can we provide them with better support, better investment opportunities, and they can leverage our team with maybe their existing team and manage a part of their portfolios together. So, the conversations are probably more robust. There\u2019s probably more opportunities across pension funds, and insurance comes at any time in our history, and we look at we\u2019re as well-positioned as any firm in the world on it. Rob, do you have anything more to say on that? Robert Kapito : Yes. I think the business of managing money has gotten very complicated, very expensive. Firms have not invested in the technology that they need, and the scale and size of what we can do can help them get better investment performance at a better price and certainly sourcing with the scale and size the BlackRock has can help them. So we actually can go in, have a dialogue, work together with the company and the people that they have there. And do it faster, better, cheaper and handle the operations and technology as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Katz from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Bill Katz : Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate the disclosure this quarter as well. Maybe a question for Gary. On one hand, I sort of heard you talk a little bit about we were willing to reevaluate the expense growth guide given the market backdrop, but I also heard sort of a high level of commitment to spending. So in that light, can you triangulate between prior guidance in terms of year-on-year expense growth, particularly for G&A and the run rate pacing for first quarter? And then was there anything unusual in the comp this quarter that would suggest some upward bias into the second quarter? Thank you. Gary Shedlin : Thanks, Bill, and good morning. So I think your question is about spend for the year, and then I\u2019ll come back to your more detailed questions on G&A and comp. I think just echoing on what both Larry and Rob said, we\u2019ve obviously invested for years to focus on developing industry-leading franchises in many high-growth areas that we\u2019re doing incredibly well in. And I think as we talked about back in January, last year, we grew organically at our fastest rate ever, and we continue to expand that growth premium relative to the industry, and we were able to increase our margin. And I think, importantly, as I mentioned in my remarks, many of the areas in which we\u2019re generating strong organic growth today, whether it\u2019s alternatives, traditional active, ESG, were simply not significant contributors to our business just a few years ago, and we continue to see very significant opportunity. Again, as Larry and Rob just talked about, particularly as clients are optimizing their operating models, they\u2019re looking for these deeper relationships with fewer managers, and we\u2019ve talked about a number of those wins. So our overall goal here has not changed. We remain committed to optimizing that organic growth in the most efficient way we can. And I think as we\u2019ve done in the past, we\u2019ve shown in the past, we have deep conviction in the stability of our model and our ability to manage our cost structure. And we\u2019ve done that throughout our history, whether it was in 2016 or 2018, both years where we increased our margin. We\u2019ve been agile, but we\u2019ve also continued to invest. And I think we are very focused for the near term on continuing to support that growth at both historically and future. And in that regard, we have made no major change to our discretionary spending plans that we laid out to you in January. But as we said, we will be prudent in reevaluating that level of spend if market conditions suggest that we do so. As it relates to comp, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything there. Obviously, there is, which is in the overall -- environment. There was some benefit attributed to mark-to-market on deferred cash comp. But if beta doesn\u2019t go down, and we don\u2019t get that benefit. In some respects, those are correlated. And in terms of G&A, I would just say that, as a copy out to what I just said, which is that we\u2019ve made no major changes, we tend to spend a little slower in the first quarter than we do towards the rest of the year as it relates to our G&A spend. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Michael Cyprys : Great. Thanks. Laurence Fink : Hey, Mike Michael Cyprys : Thanks for taking the question. Hi, good morning, Larry, Gary. We\u2019ve seen a lot of money flow into the private markets over the past couple of years and a very low interest rate backdrop. And now that interest rates are rising, a lot of concerns around inflation and where the end game may be in rates. I guess how do you think about that will impact client demand for private assets? Are there certain parts of the private markets that you think will hold up better and see better growth? And how is this evolving -- how are these evolving trends influencing your strategy within the private market space? And where do you see the biggest opportunity for BlackRock? Robert Kapito : Huge demand, Mike, from -- for private credit and loans. Those are the two areas. And as you know, a couple of years ago, we did an acquisition in the loan area because the performance of that product has been great during various cycles. And these are good mom-and-pop type companies that don\u2019t have access necessarily to the public markets, and it\u2019s very expensive. And due diligence is required, so you have to have the team to do that. But certainly, in the private markets, both in credit and in loans, we\u2019re seeing increased demands. And I think that\u2019s also a function of rates because they give you much more of a cushion for rising rates than the more obvious liquid credit products. There\u2019s also a huge demand for real assets, and that has been an area of growth for us, as you know. And a lot of people are using that for an inflation hedge. So the textbook says when you see inflation, you sell growth, you buy value, you buy tips and you buy real estate. And all of those, including infrastructure, make for good investments. So we\u2019re pretty well positioned. You know that we take a multi-asset approach to build portfolios that are going to be resilient. That\u2019s what people are expecting for us. And that is why you see the unconstrained bond funds get money. And as I mentioned before, $1.5 billion into SIO and FIGO, equities, inflows into equities. And our dividend growth offerings can also be tools to help thread the needle between generating income and growth that could potentially outrun inflation. And traditionally, real assets like commodities, infrastructure, real estate will insulate a portfolio against higher inflation. So we\u2019ve seen some clients tactically allocate to commodities. And in that area, we had about $7 billion of net inflows. Laurence Fink : Let me just add one more point. As I said in my prepared remarks, the interconnectivity between sustainable investing and infrastructure is going to be enormous, whether it is a pipeline in Saudi Arabia, or a pipeline from Texas to Mexico, or investing in the sequestration of hydrocarbons and H2O in the Midwest of the United States. The building out of new renewable platforms of charging stations. Across the board, the conversations we\u2019re having with new innovative companies in technology and the robustness of our conversations with the largest energy companies in the world, our connectivity in this space has never been greater. And I would say with high confidence and high conviction, the opportunities to place a lot of money in very unique investment opportunities in this interconnectivity, sustainability and infrastructure is going to be large and it\u2019s going to be multiple years of investing. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks. Good morning folks. Laurence Fink : Hi, Brian. Brian Bedell : Hi. Good morning. Maybe just to tag on to the last part of that question to expand that and sort of put that into another question. So the -- obviously, the increasing demand for energy transition that you\u2019ve alluded to on several conference calls now, I guess, first of all, do you see the geopolitical situation accelerating that trend on a more permanent basis, even if things do ease up? And then looping that in with the products that you\u2019re able to come out with, which do tend to have higher fee rates in the alternatives area, if you can comment on just the confidence of continuing to generate faster organic base fee growth versus AUM, putting aside, of course, these lumpy mandates that can really influence that? Laurence Fink : As I said, we\u2019re in large dialogues with the traditional hydrocarbon companies, energy companies. We\u2019ve had numerous conversations with the leaders of every energy company in the world about how they\u2019re moving forward. I think the geopolitical issues, as you framed the question, is going to spur a huge amount of investing, huge amount of investing in the exploration and development more oil, but at the same time, elevated energy prices is going to accelerate decarbonization technology. And I think what you\u2019re seeing, whether it\u2019s the $1 trillion investment in infrastructure that the United States voted for last year and now the real commitment out of Europe to build LNG plants to have less dependency on one supply chain Russian gas, I believe in our conversations, even at country levels are very large and how can they create multiple supply chains for energy. And that is a combination of decarbonization technology and a combination of insurances, of having energy to meet the needs of society. So all of this is going to be -- it\u2019s just a long-term project. It\u2019s not going to be a straight line as my lenders wrote about. Any energy transition has to be fair and just or it doesn\u2019t work. We are witnessing that now, the supply shocks and now excess demand and so all of this is playing out that it\u2019s going to create an investment boom, the combination of fiscal spending on the US part, the European part. We had -- as in every country, we have conversations about decarbonization or the utilization of hydrogen. I was in Japan last week, a lot of conversations on hydrogen and what role can that play in Japan. Two trips to the Middle East, more conversations about -- as they move with a lot of sun and solar moving more towards more renewables, the movement away from oil as they utilize a lot of oil for power production in Saudi Arabia to move to gas, so moving from dark brown light brown. All of this is just going to stimulate a lot of excess demand for product and supply of product. And I would have said, for the last few years, a bigger issue is supply of product, not demand. Then I do believe the supply quotient over the next few years is going to be larger which just means more and more opportunities. And we are -- in our forecast for new growth in these areas, we\u2019re forecasting the build-out of three large infrastructure funds to meet these needs. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken from UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just had a question on ESG and maybe what you\u2019re hearing. There\u2019s been an emerging debate amongst investors around some of the lagging performance in ESG. We\u2019ve seen commodities strengthen. A lot of your comments around commodity strength certainly would point to some support behind some of those commodities producers. Are you hearing any shift in dialogue early on around that component and that may be a consideration of making some shifts in defining energy as rigidly as they have in the past? And are you seeing any early signs of demand shifting in that product, albeit clearly a secular shift? But maybe we see some cyclical weakness in the near term here. Any color would be appreciated. Thank you. Laurence Fink : Well, first of all, great question, very timely, especially with the rising energy prices and all the issues of supply shocks in hydrocarbons. In all my letters, I said an energy transition is not a straight line. It\u2019s a 30 to 50-year time frame for us to move that forward. It\u2019s not today. It\u2019s not tomorrow. And the key is making sure that we have energy transition that fills the needs of all societies, and higher energy prices really crushes emerging markets and harms -- the poor in every country that is dependent, a higher percentage of their disposable income that goes to energy. And obviously, you couple that with food inflation, it has a severe impact. Does that change the long-term nature of ESG or as I think you\u2019re framing it more or on the sustainability side? Not really, because we\u2019re going to -- we always said we\u2019re going to have to invest in new technologies to bring down that green premium. Well, the green premium obviously is reduced with higher energy cost today, but we still have that green premium in a lot of the technologies. A lot of this is just going to take quite a bit of flow at the time. But if you just look at the evidence of our first quarter, we had about $19 billion of sustainable flows. Obviously, that\u2019s down from prior quarters but certainly up from two years ago. Much of it was an active strategy. So as I talked about, what we\u2019re trying to do in the alternatives space, $8 billion was in ETFs. So, I\u2019m not going to respond to any one quarter valuation. Of course, in quarters where you have rising energy prices, energy companies, and we would -- they\u2019ve done fantastically well as they should be. They were cheap, they were undervalued. They were trading below book in many cases and how the market has come to appreciate much of that. As you know, also, I\u2019ve always said, I don\u2019t believe in divestiture. BlackRock has over $180 billion in investments in this. So we are working with all the companies about how to move forward. And so in terms of a one quarter return on one product versus another, let me be clear, most investors are not doing this for a quarter or even a year. These are long-term views on the movement towards more of a decarbonization future of the world, and that doesn\u2019t change anything now. We have rising energy prices from energy shocks. It\u2019s very harmful for society, and governments are responding. In Europe, you\u2019re seeing many governments putting caps on energy prices, because it really harms their populate. So, this is a really complex difficult issue, but I don\u2019t think it changes anything in the long-term. And let me be clear, BlackRock is the largest investor for pension funds and retirements than anyone. We have a long-term responsibility in making sure over the long run, that our beneficiaries to achieve their long-term aspirations and goals. And so, there\u2019s no question this energy transition is real. But it\u2019s going to be not a straight line. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks? Laurence Fink : Thank you, operator. Once again, I want to thank everybody for your continued interest in BlackRock. I strongly believe our first quarter performance is a direct results of our commitment and our deep commitment to our clients, as I said just a minute ago, and our desire investing for them over the long-term ahead of their needs. We see tremendous opportunities ahead of us, and BlackRock has focused to be remaining and working with all our people, working with all the communities where we operate and working in a comprehensive way as we try to stay in front of the clients\u2019 needs. If we continue to stay in front of the clients\u2019 needs, if we continue to be a voice of long-term investors, I believe we will continue to deliver those durable returns that all of you, our shareholders, expect from us, and that is our commitment to you. Everyone, have a good quarter. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today\u2019s call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference. Christopher Meade : Good morning everyone. I am Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock\u2019s actual results may, of course, differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So with that, I will turn it over to Gary. Gary Shedlin : Thanks, Chris and good morning everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to present results for the second quarter of 2022. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I will review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing today primarily on our as-adjusted numbers. As a reminder, beginning in the first quarter of 2022, we updated our definitions of as-adjusted operating income, operating margin and net income, year-over-year financial comparisons referenced on this call will relate current quarter results to these recast financials. Global equity and debt markets delivered their first \u2013 worst first half returns in decades as investors reacted to uncertainty associated with rising recession fears, surging inflation, interest rate hikes and geopolitical tensions. In total, these market declines, along with significant dollar appreciation against major currencies, reduced the value of BlackRock\u2019s assets under management by $1.7 trillion since December 31. Despite this challenging backdrop, BlackRock\u2019s comprehensive platforms still generated industry leading organic growth of over $175 billion of net inflows in the first half of 2022. BlackRock\u2019s second quarter results once again demonstrate the resilience of our platform and validate the investments we have consistently made to build the most comprehensive range of investment management and technology solutions in the industry. I cannot think of a time when the value of our diversified platform and our commitment to continuously investing for the long-term ahead of client needs has been more evident. Over the last 12 months, BlackRock\u2019s broad-based platform has generated over $460 billion of total net inflows, representing 5% organic base fee growth, providing a strong foundation to help immunize our base fees from the impact of double-digit market declines on our assets under management. During a tumultuous second quarter, BlackRock delivered total net inflows of $90 billion representing 4% annualized organic asset growth. Flows were positive across all product types and regions, demonstrating the diversification of our differentiated platform, even in the face of macro and industry headwinds and an ability to quickly adapt to changing client needs. Importantly, second quarter flows did not reflect the funding of any significant AIG-related assets, which will now occur in the second half of this year. Second quarter annualized organic base fee decay of 1% reflected client portfolio repositioning, favoring lower fee index and cash products and higher redemptions in active fixed income and equity mutual funds. Second quarter revenue of $4.5 billion was 6% lower year-over-year, primarily driven by the impact of significantly lower markets and dollar appreciation on average AUM and lower performance fees. Operating income of $1.7 billion was down 14% year-over-year, while earnings per share of $7.36 was down 30%, also reflecting meaningfully lower non-operating income compared to a year ago. Non-operating results for the quarter included $200 million of net investment losses, driven primarily by unrealized mark-to-market declines in the value of our unhedged seed capital investments and minority stake and investment. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 25%. We continue to estimate that 24% is a reasonable projected tax run-rate for the remainder of 2022 though the actual effective tax rate may differ because of non-recurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation. Despite double-digit declines in equity and fixed income indexes year-over-year, second quarter base fee and securities lending revenue of $3.7 billion was down just 2% year-over-year. The negative impact of approximately $1.5 trillion of market beta and foreign exchange movements on AUM over the last 12 months was partially offset by 5% organic-based fee growth over the last year and the elimination of discretionary yield support money market fund waivers and higher securities lending revenue versus a year ago. On a constant currency basis, we estimate second quarter base fees and securities lending revenue would have been flat year-over-year. Sequentially, base fee and securities lending revenue was down 4%, reflecting the impact of continued market declines on average AUM. On an equivalent day count basis, our effective fee rate was up approximately 0.3 basis points benefiting from the elimination of discretionary money market fund fee waivers and higher securities lending revenue. As a result of significant global equity and bond market declines during the quarter, including the impact of excess related dollar appreciation, we entered the third quarter with an estimated base fee run-rate approximately 5% lower than our total base fees for the second quarter. Performance fees of $106 million decreased from a year ago, primarily reflecting lower revenues from alternative and long-only products. Our Aladdin business delivered record sales in the first 6 months of 2022 and demand for our technology solutions has never been stronger. Quarterly technology services revenue increased 5% from a year ago, reflecting this increased demand, but also reflected the currency impact of significant dollar appreciation on Aladdin\u2019s non-dollar revenue. Annual contract value or ACV increased 10% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, we estimate ACV would have increased 13% from a year ago. We remain committed to low to mid-teens growth in ACV over the long-term, especially as periods of market volatility have historically underscored the importance of Aladdin and generated increased demand from clients. Total expense was flat year-over-year, reflecting lower compensation and direct fund expense partially offset by higher G&A expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was down 6% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower incentive compensation due to lower operating income and performance fees and lower deferred compensation expense, driven in part by the mark-to-market impact of certain deferred cash compensation programs partially offset by higher base compensation. Direct fund expense decreased 5% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower average index AUM. G&A expense was up 12% year-over-year primarily driven by higher T&E expense and other costs associated with return to office and ongoing strategic investments in technology, including the migration of Aladdin to the cloud. Sequentially, G&A expense was up 7%, primarily reflecting higher T&E expense. Our second quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 43.7% was down 320 basis points from a year ago, reflecting the immediate negative impact of markets and foreign exchange movements on quarterly revenue and the ongoing longer term strategic investments we have been making in technology and our people. While we can\u2019t control near-term market volatility, we are always prepared for it. We have strong conviction in our strategy, our clients\u2019 increasing needs for whole portfolio and technology solutions, the growth of global capital markets and the strength of our proven operating model. The diversification and breadth of our business positions us to serve clients in a variety of environments and we continue to believe that our growth engines, including ETFs, alternatives, technology, and whole portfolio solutions are well-positioned to increase market share. Whether it was during the financial crisis of 2008 or in the early days of the pandemic in 2020, BlackRock has always capitalized on market disruption and emerged stronger, because the stability of our business model enables us to responsibly invest for the long-term and continue playing offense when many others are forced to pull back. We have navigated these choppy waters before and are well prepared for what may lie ahead. As always, we remain committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible. We are continually focused on managing our entire discretionary expense base and we will be prudent in reevaluating our overall level of spend in the current environment. Our capital management strategy remains first to invest in our business and then to return excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We repurchased approximately $1 billion worth of shares in the first half of this year, including $500 million in the second quarter. Our repurchases exceeded our planned run-rate as we took advantage of what we viewed as attractive relative valuation opportunities in our stock. At present, based on our capital spending plans for the year and subject to market conditions, including the relative valuation of our stock price, we still anticipate repurchasing at least $375 million of shares per quarter for the balance of the year, consistent with previous guidance. BlackRock\u2019s second quarter net inflows of $90 billion, once again demonstrate the stability of our diversified platform to adapt to changing markets and client needs. ETF market share has increased as investors use them as vehicles of choice for strategic and tactical portfolio reallocation. Illiquid alternatives continue to provide clients with higher income and uncorrelated returns, as the traditional hedge between stocks and bonds has weakened and demand for cash management offerings is increasing amid rising rates. BlackRock was the beneficiary of each of these industry trends during the second quarter, enabling us to capture money in motion as investors recalibrated their portfolios. BlackRock\u2019s second quarter ETF net inflows of $52 billion were positive across each of our product categories, core, strategic and precision representing 7% annualized organic asset growth. Our strategic category drove nearly 70% of net inflows in the quarter led by continued demand for our diversified fixed income offering as clients utilize bond ETFs to reposition portfolios given the major shifts in the fixed income market. Core equity and higher fee precision ETFs also saw net inflows of $15 billion and $1 billion, respectively. We have invested for years to support the growth of fixed income ETFs both to create a diversified bond ETF platform and to deliver the liquidity and price transparency our clients expect, especially during times of market stress. And another challenging quarter for fixed income markets, our bond ETFs once again delivered for clients and generated $31 billion of net inflows. Retail net outflows of $10 billion reflected industry pressures in active fixed income and world allocation strategies, partially offset by strength in index SMAs, municipal bonds and our systematic multi-strategy alternatives fund. Gross sales in U.S. active mutual funds have remained strong, but were offset by elevated redemptions from long-duration fixed income, high-yield and growth equities. BlackRock\u2019s institutional franchise generated $26 billion of net inflows as we continued to partner with institutional clients to deliver investment expertise, greater customization, industry leading risk management and the benefits of our global scale. BlackRock\u2019s Institutional active net inflows of $5 billion were led by growth in systematic active equity, illiquid alternatives, LifePath target date funds and outsourced CIO solutions. We see continued demand for our outsourcing capabilities and are increasingly engaging with the world\u2019s most sophisticated institutions to partner with them on whole portfolio solutions. In March, we announced an assignment with AIG, where BlackRock will manage up to $150 billion of AIG\u2019s investment portfolio and execute an Aladdin mandate, roughly $400 million from this assignment funded during the second quarter. At present, we expect the Aladdin contract to be executed and the majority of the remaining AIG assets to be funded during the second half of 2022. BlackRock\u2019s institutional index business generated net inflows of $21 billion led by continued strength in LDI solutions. Across institutional and retail clients, demand for alternatives continued with nearly $5 billion of net inflows across liquid and illiquid alternative strategies during the quarter driven by private credit, infrastructure and private equity. Fundraising momentum remains strong and we have approximately $36 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of alternative strategies, representing a significant source of future base and performance fees. Finally, with cash becoming a more attractive asset class as rates rise, BlackRock\u2019s cash management platform generated $21 billion of net inflows in the second quarter, benefiting from the investments we have made to build this business in recent years. Net inflows were driven by U.S. government mandates and included inflows from Circle as we became the primary manager of their U.S. DC cash reserves. In a rising rate environment, BlackRock is well-positioned to grow market share by leveraging our scale, product breadth, technology, and risk management on behalf of liquidity clients. As BlackRock has demonstrated throughout our history, challenging environments create unique opportunities for future growth and we have always emerged stronger and more deeply connected with our clients. While we are not immune to market headwinds, the last few months have only given us more conviction and our strategy and ability to deliver differentiated growth over the long-term. The diversification and breadth of our platform enables us to serve clients across market environments and we believe BlackRock is as well positioned as ever to meet the needs of all stakeholders. With that, I will turn it over to Larry. Laurence Fink : Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining the call. The first half of 2022 brought on a combination of macro financial and economic challenges that investors haven\u2019t seen in decades. Rising energy prices disrupted supply chains in hawkish pivots of central banks to confront inflation has sparked the real assessment of growth, profitability and risk across financial markets. Central banks are trying to rein in supply-driven inflation running at multi-decade highs without triggering a deep recession. Demand in the economy now is about the same as it was in pre-COVID. But as pandemic restrictions have lifted, we are seeing that it\u2019s easier to restart demand than it is to restart supply. Countries and companies were already reevaluating their interdependencies following supply chain disruptions during the pandemic. And the Russian invasion of Ukraine has only intensified the prioritization of supply chain resiliency and security over cost of these supply chains and efficiencies of these supply chains. In the United States, the Fed\u2019s effort to fight inflation through faster rate hikes helped push the U.S. dollar to a 20-year high in the quarter, impacting consumers companies, portfolios in the United States and around the world. U.S. companies with international businesses, including BlackRock, are facing foreign exchange headwinds impacting the value of their overseas earnings. Markets are reflecting investor anxiety as investors evaluate the potential impact of these pressures. 2022 ranks as a worst start in 50 years for both stocks and bonds, with global equity markets down 20% and the aggregate bond index down about 10%. While BlackRock is not immune to these markets and foreign exchange headwinds, we see it as an opportunity to strengthen our relationship with all our clients worldwide. And it is during these uncertain times like these that the resiliency and diversification of our platform is most evident. BlackRock generated $175 billion of total net inflows in the first half of 2022, including $90 billion in the second quarter. And these flows do not yet include any funding of the significant portion of the large client mandate we announced last quarter. The substantial organic growth demonstrates our ability to deliver industry leading flows even in these most challenging environments. Even after the worst first half declines in decades, BlackRock\u2019s assets are up over $2.5 trillion since the beginning of 2019. And what I am most impressed with \u2013 at the same period, we generated $1.5 trillion of AUM through organic growth alone. No one else in the industry has come close to that. Our strategic investments over the years, including iShares, ETFs, private markets, active whole portfolio solutions at Aladdin, have allowed us to build a comprehensive platform to solve our clients\u2019 needs across market environments. Cannot think of a time when BlackRock\u2019s strategic focus has been better aligned to the market and the needs of our clients than it is today. We see more and more clients looking for a partner who can provide a truly whole portfolio approach across index, across active in cash, across private markets, but all underpinned by global insights and our industry-leading risk management technology. Only BlackRock can offer that. That is why clients are entrusting us with more of their portfolios. That is why BlackRock has seen such a substantial increase in OCIO mandates. That is why we had record Aladdin mandates this year. Connectivity with clients is even more important in a volatile and uncertain environment. Our clients more than ever are turning to BlackRock to help them navigate uncertainty. There have been incredible demand for clients for insight from BlackRock. During the recent months of volatility, we have hosted numerous large-scale events to share our market outlook, in addition, our direct connectivity with our clients. In the first half of the year, the BlackRock Investment Institute had hosted calls reaching a record number of clients, providing unique global insights, further amplifying our connectivity and reinforcing our voice with our clients globally. This connectivity enables us to better understand the challenges our clients are facing. And our comprehensive solutions have enabled us to help clients reallocate risk, rebalance, increase liquidity and capture opportunities in response to market moves. Our iShares business is one of the examples where our continuous innovation has allowed us to deliver new solutions for clients and for growth for the firm. 20 years ago, in December of 2002, iShares launched the first U.S. domiciled bond ETF, innovation that went on to break down many barriers in fixed income investing. Today, both individual investors and large institutions are using bond ETFs for convenient, efficient exposures to thousands of global bonds and to make quick specialized recalibrations to their portfolio. In other words, they are using bond ETFs for active investing. The challenges associated with high inflation to rising interest rates are attracting more first-time bond ETF users and prompting existing investors to find new ways to use ETFs in their portfolios for active investing. In the second quarter, we generated $31 billion of fixed income ETF net inflows led by a record flows in the month of May. Fixed income ETFs once again delivered the market quality that clients expected from us in stressed markets, providing liquidity, providing price transparency, U.S. fixed in ETF trading volume reached new records. In fact, the second quarter average volumes was up over 50% compared to last year. Our growth this quarter highlights the diversity of our fixed income ETF product range and our ability to serve clients as their needs change. As we still see this is the early days of a major transformation of how people invest in fixed income, we expect the bond ETF industry will nearly triple and reach $5 trillion in AUM at the end of the decade, driving significant growth in the broader ETF industry. When you consider that we build our fixing ETF platform in an extremely low yield environment, it is particularly exciting to consider how rising rates will bring a whole new set of investors into these funds. Beyond liquidity and market access, investors also turned to iShares ETF for long-term investments. We saw growth in each of our ETF product categories in the quarter for $52 billion of total ETF net inflows. BlackRock\u2019s active platform demonstrated continued momentum in systematic equities LifePath target date, alternative strategies and great opportunities in our industry-leading fixed income platform like SIO. We believe we will outpace industry flows and active management due to our strong long-term investment performance and our diversified platform. While market volatility impacted shorter-term performance in some funds, long-term performance remains strong with approximately 85% of our active taxable fixed income and fundamental equity AUM above medium and benchmark here for the 5-year period. The diversity of our broad investment management platform enables us to capture changes in demand within active or as investors change our allocations to index or private markets. We saw this phenomenon in fixed income during the quarter where active fixed income net outflows were offset by inflows in fixed income ETFs and index LDI strategies as certain clients look to reallocate or immunize their portfolios. We also saw it as client demand shifted to cash as the interest rate environment improved, and we continue to see strong demand for illiquid alternative strategies with clients growing their allocations to private markets to improve portfolio diversification and the seek sources of yield and uncorrelated returns. In alternatives, we raised nearly $8 billion through committed and net flows across liquid and illiquid strategies. In liquid flows were driven by private credit and infrastructure and liquid flows were led by our systematic multi-strategy funds, which takes a credit-oriented approach. Since 2021, BlackRock raised over $55 billion of gross capital across our entire alternatives platform. One of the biggest long-term opportunities in alternatives will be the intersection of infrastructure and sustainability. Recent supply shocks have only increased the focus on energy security and compounded the need for infrastructure investments. Last month, we announced it a perpetual infrastructure strategy that will partner with leading infrastructure businesses over the long-term to help drive the energy transition from shades to brown to shades of green. This will help address the historic long-term investment opportunity presented by the global transition to a low-carbon economy. By 2050, an estimated $125 trillion of investments is needed globally to reach a net-zero. That applies an annual investment needs to grow to over $4 trillion compared to the $1 trillion a year \u2013 that is being achieved this year. As a fiduciary, we\u2019re working with clients to help them understand, to help them navigate and for clients to choose and help that transition. BlackRock\u2019s cash management platform reached record AUM levels in the quarter and generated $21 billion of net inflows. Surging short-term rates, flattening yield curves and now an inverted yield curve has made cash not just a safe place, but now also a more profitable place for investors a wait as they evaluate how to optimize their portfolios for the future. Even during low-rate environments, we invested in our cash business and have grown our share positioning us well to benefit from the reassurgence of client demand as rates rise. BlackRock\u2019s diverse cash management offerings, including governments, prime municipals, ESG strategies allow us to serve all our clients\u2019 cash allocation needs. Market volatility, growing cost pressures and increasing complexities and optimizing whole portfolios have only underscored the need for robust enterprise operating and risk management technology. The value of Aladdin\u2019s integrated end-to-end technology platform and leading risk analytics became particularly evident in these market conditions. When portfolio managers needed real-time information, sophisticated tools to manage risk exposures and make investment decisions. We saw record Aladdin Climate mandates in the first half of 2022, expanding our range of technology solutions with strong demand for our newer capabilities, including Aladdin accounting, eFront and whole portfolio view. The market environment has also reinforced the need for offerings like Aladdin Wealth. Users of Aladdin Wealth by financial advisers at our largest clients have increased by more than 40% since the onset of market turbulence this year as financial advisers look to assess portfolio risk for all their clients for their entire business. BlackRock\u2019s technology and risk management capabilities are also supporting the growth of our OCIO business. Since the beginning of 2019 and with the anticipated funding of the $150 billion AIG mandate later this year, we all have raised over $430 billion for major OCIO and fixed income insurance outsourcing assignments. As the trend towards outsourcing increases, BlackRock is well positioned to capture this opportunity and be a trusted partner for our clients. Another major trend defining our industry over the past several years has been interest in sustainable investing. And we continue to see strong client demand for sustainable strategies. BlackRock manages nearly $475 billion in dedicated sustainable AUM on behalf of our clients, and we saw over $20 billion of net inflows across active index and cash management in the quarter. One note \u2013 particularly noteworthy strategy we announced in May was an $800 million commitment raised for the BlackRock Impact Opportunity Fund. This fund is first of a kind a return-seeking multi-alternative strategy then invest in businesses and projects owned and led by serving people of color. The topic of sustainable investing has sparked a lot of debate in recent months. In many ways, it reminds me my early days being in the mortgage market. When I started my career working as a mortgage trader in the 1970s, shocking? Mortgage loans were first being securitized into bonds. There were lots of questions from investors, lots of questions from policymakers, lots of questions from regulators alike. While the mortgage market has since had many ups and downs, it is today a $10 trillion market. And with the appropriate underwriting standards, it has played a vital role in delivering attractive returns to investors and making homeownership affordable for millions. Just 2 years ago, the sustainable investing was not a priority for many clients. It is now one of the fastest-growing segments of the asset management industry. And one of the topics our clients are asking more questions than in any part of our business. I continue to believe that we are in the early days of this trend. 2 years ago, I said, I believe it will fundamentally reshape finance. I still believe that. But as in the early days of the mortgage market, there are a lot of questions. And with the mortgage market, the key to avoiding excesses and missteps is through better data and through better analytics. That\u2019s why BlackRock is so focused on leveraging and creating better ESG data and analytics to help our clients better understand risk and opportunities in their portfolio, including those related to global transition to a low-carbon economy. ESG data indexing is still an evolving area. And we are working with our partners to assess and refine the best available data to help our clients meet their investment objectives in alignment with ESG preferences. We have long encouraged companies to report on sustainability issues so that investments better analyze how companies are navigating the transition to a low-carbon economy and other critical investment considerations. We believe that common taxonomy and coordinated high-quality disclosure framework will allow investors to more effectively compare data across companies and geographies. We must also recognize that the energy transition itself is a journey and will not occur overnight. It is not going to be a straight line. It can only work if the energy transition is fair and just. To ensure that the continuity of affordable energy during the transition, companies will need to invest in both fossil fuels like natural gas and renewable sources of energy. That is why we are working with energy companies throughout the world who are essentially meeting society\u2019s energy needs, and we will play a critical role in helping any successful transition. Another area that has been increasingly interested with our clients as digital assets. BlackRock has been studying the ecosystem, particularly in areas that are relevant to our clients, including StablePoint, crypto acids, tokenization, permissional blockchains, last quarter we announced our minority investment in Circle, a global Internet payment company and issue our USD Coin, a stablecoin that is one of the fastest growing digital assets in the world. As part of our relationship, we became their primary manager of their U.S. DC cash reserves with assets invested entirely in short-term U.S. treasuries. The digital asset space is a developing area that has attracted increased attention from investors and policymakers, and we are encouraged by the discussion of the debate that is occurring about the creation and implementation of an appropriate regulatory approach and framework. The crypto asset market has witnessed a steep downturn in valuations over recent months, but we are still seeing more interest from institutional clients about how to efficiently access these assets, using our technology and product capability. This is a space that we are continuing to explore to help our clients who want to learn more and to help them who wanted to participate in these assets and to do it in a transparent and an efficient way. BlackRock continues to innovate in a variety of areas to expand the choices we offer clients to help them achieve their goals. Last fall, we announced the BlackRock Voting Choice initiative, which uses technology to help eligible institutional clients participate and proxy voting decisions. In the second quarter, we further expanded the opportunities for eligible clients, including public and private pension funds, insurance companies, endowments, foundations, sovereign wealth funds to participate in proxy voting decisions. Following years of work on technology and regulatory barriers, nearly half of our clients\u2019 index equity assets including pension funds representing more than 60 million people have simple and efficient options to vote their preferences if they choose. The client assets currently available for voting choice nearly 25% are held by clients who have so far elected to exercise their own voting preference, and we\u2019re working to expand choice even further. We\u2019re committed to a future where every investor, even individual investors can ultimately have the option to participate in proxy voting processes as they choose. Over the course of BlackRock\u2019s 34-year history, and in the years since the financial crisis and our acquisition of BGI, markets have experienced various periods of volatility and uncertainty. BlackRock has always come through stronger. It is through periods like this, clients more deeply connected with BlackRock\u2019s platform, and we have more opportunities to work with our clients to continue to differentiate ourselves, and we are working with more and more of our stakeholders worldwide. We have always emphasized the connection between BlackRock taking a long-term view of our business and delivering differentiating growth for our shareholders. Many of BlackRock\u2019s biggest successes have grown out of times of uncertainty and disruption. I see more opportunities for BlackRock today than ever before and I am incredibly excited about our future. As we look to realize those opportunities, we will continue to invest for the future and evolve ahead of our clients\u2019 changing needs. The diversification, the resiliency of our platform allows us to pursue critical investments while maintaining our focus on expenses and on our margins. We will continue to manage what we can control, bringing together the entire firm to serve every one of our clients, big or small, to strategically invest in the highest growth opportunity in the future, leveraging our scale to deliver benefits to our clients and operating more efficiently. We will continue to drive forward on our commitments to our clients, to our shareholders, to our employees. And as I said earlier, I believe that BlackRock\u2019s position has never been stronger. With that, operator, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Michael Cyprys : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the \u2013 Hi, Gary, Laurence. Just a question on the OCIO mandate wins. I was just hoping you could update us on some of the dialogue and conversations that you\u2019re having with asset owners there. Maybe you could talk a little bit about the opportunity set that you see over the next couple of years. And how does this macro environment impact the sort of pendulum swinging between in-sourcing and outsourcing? Thank you. Laurence Fink : Well, I would say that dialogue is becoming more robust than any time in our history. And much of it has to do with the uncertainty in the world, the complexities of markets. And no organization can bring the resources, the scale, the Aladdin technology, the completeness of investment platform than we can. I think the conversations we are having are because of that. And we are showing more and more clients the benefits that what we can provide to them. And I think this is we are going to see an acceleration of OCIO mandates because we can provide our services cheaper than in-house. We can provide as a fiduciary to their needs, a more systematic approach using the investment technology, the breadth of our investment scale across all products from obviously, from cash to alternatives gives us a very unique advantage. And we see this as a real huge opportunity for us. Obviously, it\u2019s been noted about AIG. We had another big U.S. pension fund where we were \u2013 it was announced this week that we are now going to manage their entire defined contribution platform. We are working with other companies right now with more opportunities. I am incredibly excited because this is probably the greatest example of One BlackRock. The uniqueness of our platform by having a one culture that interconnects areas of active investing, index investing, investment technology, having the ability to provide alternatives, whether that may be some decarbonization investments across the board to other sites to private credit. But having the ability to work with these clients in a One BlackRock comprehensive way has really shown to our clients that no firm can provide this, and this is the virtue of having one \u2013 a one connected organization. We are not a multi-boutique organization. We are \u2013 our enterprise is interconnected across the board and we are able to provide that dialogue across the whole organization. And it shows up in these client conversations, whether that is the General Dynamics conversation or whether that is the British Air, these previously announced mandates. And as I said, the dialogues in OCIO has never been greater. And I am very excited about these opportunities. But let\u2019s be clear, you cannot underscore the need for One BlackRock and culture to make this work. Then you overlay our technology, you overlay the completeness of our investment platform. It\u2019s a pretty compelling story. Operator : Now we will take our next question, and that will come from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Laurence Fink : Hi Craig. Good morning. Craig Siegenthaler : Hi, good morning Larry and Gary. I hope you guys are doing well. Laurence Fink : We are doing fantastic. Craig Siegenthaler : Great. So, we have a question on client rebalancing. So, from your recent conversations with investors, is there a general trend for how they are thinking about portfolio rebalancing? And I also want to hear how the ETF vehicle, which is still in flowing nicely fits into that dynamic? Robert Kapito : So, Craig, it\u2019s Rob here. As you know, so far, the volatility has disrupted all of the traditional portfolio allocations. It\u2019s a rare moment when both equities and bonds have declined in value. So, the traditional 60-40 allocations are very out of balance and the hedge between stocks and bonds has certainly weakened. So, portfolio liquidity profiles have been impacted. And what I mean by that is many institutions have gone to their maximum in alternative or private equity allocations, hoping to fund that from the liquid portion, meaning the equity side and the bond side. And now with that liquid portion declining, they are short in the demands to draw down for private equity allocations, which are also probably declined this quarter. So, they are going to have to rebalance and they are going to have to get closer to their target allocations. And this means that there is a lot of money that\u2019s going to be reallocated and clients are going to need a partner with the comprehensive capabilities that Larry was just discussing to rethink their target allocations and to rethink the models that they are using. And BlackRock today, I believe, is the only global asset manager that can meet those client demands in every reallocation scenario whether moving to fixed income, equity cash or private markets or indexed or active on a diversified platform that could reposition this portfolio. And what they are looking for is inflation protection. They are looking for solutions for a rising rate environment. They are looking for cash solutions. They are looking for more private equity and in some point, liquidity in private equity and they are looking for outsourcing partners because not only is this complex, but the operational cost and efficiencies play a very, very big role in that. Now during the last several years, keep in mind the market structure has changed. And it\u2019s changed that reallocations are not being done in individual stocks and bonds, but they are being done in indexed and ETFs because they are cheaper, better, faster, and more liquids. And that plays exactly into the strategy that we have outlined. And that is one of the reasons why during this volatile period, we have seen inflows into the ETF and index markets. So, I hope that answers the question, and we are predicting that this volatility and this reallocation is only going to increase as rates continue to rise, we see volatility in equity markets and these portfolio reallocations have to occur. Operator : We will now move to our next question, which will come from Brennan Hawken, UBS. Laurence Fink : Good morning. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just curious, Gary, you indicated that you would be assessing the environment and being focused on managing the discretionary expense base. So, I am curious maybe to drill into that a little bit. Does that mean we should be rethinking the core G&A expense growth previously indicated? How should we think about that specifically when we are considering how to update a forecast for you? Thanks. Gary Shedlin : Good morning Brandon. Thanks for the question. So, just looking at expenses in terms of where they came in for the quarter, as we mentioned, the operating expense year-over-year comparison was essentially flat. I think as expected, we saw Flex in our what I would call our more variable related expense or asset-related expense and incentive compensation. And when you look at what optically happened to the margin year-over-year, effectively all of that decline was associated with what I would call our historical discretionary investments, which are both in people, technology growth initiatives and a return to office. So, we talked about salary increases. We have been growing some headcount and trying to get our people back to the office. We are actually getting out to see clients more, so T&E is up. We are trying to ensure that we had an incredibly safe work environment for our employees. So, health and safety protocol costs are up and obviously higher tech costs, which are primarily tied to that \u2013 to the cloud migration for Aladdin that we have talked about. We have long had a philosophy of what I would call a growth and higher model. We are coming off effectively 2 years, but obviously, last year, in particular, our fastest growth rates ever and we are continuing to invest to support that embedded growth as well as the significant near-term opportunities that you have heard both from Larry and Rob on the call, especially in places like OCIO. But we are mindful of the current environment, and we are proactively managing the pace of what I would call certain of our discretionary investments. So, we just give you an idea of some of the things we are doing. We are delaying certain senior hires into next year. We are also trying to juniorize a number of other roles where appropriate. And while I would say these actions will not materially impact our 2022 results, I think they clearly position us well for next year should some of these market headwinds persist. Now, that\u2019s not to say we are cutting back. Let me be very clear, I wouldn\u2019t say that our estimated headcount growth for the year will be generally consistent with the earlier guidance we gave, but roughly 100% of that growth will be at the more junior levels of the organization and something like 40% or so of that growth will be in our iHub locations. We are also, as you mentioned, we are continuing to evaluate the pace of our core G&A spend. And while there is no material change to the plans we communicated in January, we would clearly expect the year-over-year increase to come in closer to the bottom end of that previously communicated 15% to 20% range in terms of core G&A. And I would just say, at the outset, we said this in a couple of our comments. We have invested for years to develop industry-leading franchises in a number of these growth areas. And I think this quarter is yet another example of how those investments are allowing us to deliver differentiated growth going forward. And I think that we have shown throughout our history that we are pretty pragmatic and agile and being able to both manage our expense, but also to continue executing on critical investments. Operator : Your next question will come from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Laurence Fink : Hey Dan. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to follow-up on just the fixed income commentary. You have talked a lot about iShares and some of the dynamics there, but obviously, active is a big portion of your business in the market and performance there has just come under some pressure. So, how are you thinking about allocations or kind of trends within the broader active fixed income product set for you guys? Laurence Fink : Well, I would say the shape of the yield curve is going to play a big role in that. It is my view that we are going to continue to see Fed tightening. So, if the market expectations for another 75. First of all, that\u2019s over a period \u2013 a short period of time, you would see money market rates funds providing about a 2% return. You are going to see money run into that. It\u2019s going to be \u2013 you are paid to keep your money in the short end. I expect to see a further steepening of an inverted yield curve and where we are going to see short rates higher than the 10-year treasury. And I do believe funds like SIO readers industry-leading fund will continue to have industry-leading inflows. So, across the board, I think we are going to see, on the active side, quite a bit of opportunities. And then as I said in my prepared remarks related to fixed income ETFs, we will continue to drive more and more fixed income flows, whether that may be in a pathway way. But what I really do believe and what we have been saying now for the last 5 years, 6 years, 7 years was the utilization of fixed income for active investments and exposures. What we have already witnessed with the rise even in the 10-year area, we are seeing more and more insurance companies looking to put money to work especially in the credit side. So, we are going to continue to see more and more interest in private credit. Obviously, spreads have widened. There is some view that we are going to continue to see even further rising credit spreads. This presents huge opportunities for a lot of long liability insurance companies. And so in the institutional space, we are going to see money moving across the yield curve. Well, we are going to see movements both in and around from private to public. Rob, did you want to add anything from that point? Robert Kapito : Yes, I do. I know that people that are long fixed income don\u2019t like to see rising rates. However, with this environment, it\u2019s actually going to be a good thing for many institutions who need fixed income in their portfolios to meet their long-term goals. So, we expect to see a lot of allocation and it\u2019s not only going to go to fixed income ETFs. It\u2019s going to go the top performing and diversified fixed income funds that have been consistently performing. So, what I would expect is that people that use large cap dividend paying stocks as a surrogate for fixed income during this period of very, very low rates, will now reverse that and be able to get some yield into that portfolio that they desperately need for the long-term. And I expect to see some flows out of what was called high yield and certainly high yield over the last couple of years wasn\u2019t necessarily high yield. And I think there will be the demand for treasuries for U.S. investment grade, munis and tips and a lot of that is going to come through ETFs, but it will also come through individual bonds and issues that are being offered by companies going forward. Operator : Your last question will come from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Laurence Fink : Good morning Brian. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks. Hi. Good morning. I apologize I entered the call a little bit late, but just curious, just a couple of follow-ups. Rob, your commentary on the reallocation plan that was really in depth, thanks for that. Do you see the net result of that being higher fixed income allocations from pension plans over the long-term versus sort of intentional 60-40. I know that\u2019s antiquated 60-40. And then longer term, I mean you talked about pension plans revisiting the private allocations as well. Naturally, they have hit their targets now. Do you see them raising their thresholds to alternatives? Robert Kapito : So, I think it\u2019s going to be hard until we assess where the marks came out on alternatives at the end of this quarter. But it\u2019s hard for me to believe that they are going to be up. So, I think just because of the market movement, it\u2019s going to be hard for them to enter into new private equity. And also, there is still a lot of powder dry in the private equity space. But I do think that it\u2019s going to \u2013 the reallocations are going to drive more money into fixed income than ever before because the 60-40 mix is pretty simplistic. And within that fixed income space, there are many more flavors today that people have the opportunity to buy and some of those are going to provide some really good inflation protection and just overall good yield that they haven\u2019t been able to get for a long time. So, I think the mix of that 40 is going to be different, and it\u2019s going to ultimately be better for the long-term for our clients. And therefore, there will be more going into fixed income. And secondly, when you see the volatility of equities, there are people that are afraid of that. And they really don\u2019t need it. So, that could also drive more money into fixed income now that it will have a yield. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks? Laurence Fink : Thank you, operator. I want to thank everybody for joining the call this morning and for your interest in the firm BlackRock. Our second quarter performance, as I said, is a direct result of our commitment in serving our clients, staying close to their needs, our commitment in serving them, focusing on their long-term needs. Hopefully, you could see why we are so excited, so excited about the opportunities ahead of us. Our differentiating strategy is producing industry-leading flows and our expectation of industry-leading flows in the future. So, everyone, please have a great summer, try to get rested up. We are going to have very exciting times the latter part of this New Year. So, everyone have an enjoyable quarter and stay safe. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s teleconference.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Jake and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today\u2019s call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference. Christopher Meade : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I am Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock\u2019s actual results may of course differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So with that, I will turn it over to Gary. Gary Shedlin : Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to present results for the third quarter of 2022. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I will review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. As a reminder, beginning in the first quarter of 2022, we updated our definitions of as-adjusted operating income, operating margin and net income. Year-over-year financial comparisons referenced on this call will relate current quarter results to these recast financials. Market conditions remained very challenged in the third quarter, with global equity and debt markets ending down 25% and 14%, respectively, for the first 9 months of 2022. In total, these market declines, along with significant dollar appreciation against major currencies, reduced the value of BlackRock\u2019s assets under management by over $2 trillion since December 31. Inflation, rising rates, liquidity, market volatility and geopolitical uncertainty remains significant concerns for clients, but more of them are turning to BlackRock for comprehensive solutions to help build more resilient portfolios. They increasingly value our unparalleled breadth of investment products, styles and exposures which allows them to customize portfolios to address the investment policies, return targets and unique needs of their stakeholders. Our ability to deliver this customization at scale is a unique advantage and it is during times of market uncertainty that the power of our platform becomes most evident. Despite the most challenging market backdrop in decades, BlackRock generated industry-leading long-term net inflows of $248 billion during the first 9 months of 2022, demonstrating the strength and stability of our globally integrated multi-asset solutions-oriented platform. We have invested for years to develop leading franchises in high-growth areas such as ETFs, private markets, outsourced solutions and technology. And importantly, we have worked tirelessly to fully integrate these capabilities into our One BlackRock business model and culture. This connectivity and collaboration is more important than ever before as we bring together the entire firm to deliver better outcomes for our clients and differentiated growth for our shareholders. And while we can\u2019t control near-term volatility or the specific client risk preferences that may result, BlackRock\u2019s platform has been purposely built over time to help clients meet their objectives, regardless of the market environment. Over the last 12 months, BlackRock\u2019s broad-based platform has generated approximately $400 billion of total net inflows, representing positive organic base fee growth of 2%. During a tumultuous market environment, BlackRock generated third quarter long-term net inflows of $65 billion, representing approximately 3% annualized organic asset growth. Quarterly long-term net inflows were partially offset by net outflows from cash and advisory AUM. However, total quarterly annualized organic base fee decay of 4% reflected outflows from higher fee precision ETFs, the continued impact of elevated redemptions in active equity and fixed income mutual funds and outflows in institutional money market funds. Third quarter revenue of $4.3 billion was 15% lower year-over-year primarily driven by the impact of significant lower markets and dollar appreciation on average AUM and lower performance fees. Operating income of $1.6 billion was down 22% and reflected the impact of approximately $96 million of closed-end fund launch costs in the third quarter of 2021. Earnings per share of $9.55 declined 16% versus a year ago, also reflecting a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by lower non-operating income compared to a year ago. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 19%, reflecting $93 million of discrete tax benefits. We continue to estimate that 24% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2022, but the actual effective tax rate may differ because of non-recurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation. Non-operating results for the quarter included $219 million of net investment income and reflected a $267 million non-cash gain related to our strategic minority investment in iCapital. Third quarter base fee and securities lending revenue of $3.5 billion was down 10% year-over-year, broadly in line with the decline in our average AUM. The negative revenue impact of approximately $1.9 trillion of market beta and foreign exchange movements on AUM over the last 12 months was partially offset by positive organic base fee growth over the same period and the elimination of discretionary yield support money market fund fee waivers versus a year ago. On a constant currency basis, we estimate second quarter base fee and securities lending revenue would have been down 8% year-over-year. Sequentially, while base fee and securities lending revenue was down 4% on an equivalent day count basis, our effective fee rate was approximately flat. As a result of continued global equity and bond market declines toward the end of the quarter, including the impact of FX-related dollar appreciation, we entered the fourth quarter with an estimated base fee run rate approximately 7% lower than our total base fees for the third quarter. Performance fees of $82 million decreased from a year ago, primarily reflecting lower revenue from liquid alternative products, including lower fees from a single hedge fund, with an annual performance measurement period that ends in the third quarter. Our Aladdin business delivered record sales in the first 9 months of 2022 and demand for our technology solutions has never been stronger. Quarterly technology services revenue increased 6% from a year ago, reflecting this increased demand, but also reflecting significant headwinds associated with the FX impact on Aladdin\u2019s non-dollar revenue and market declines on Aladdin\u2019s fixed income platform assets. Annual contract value, or ACV, increased 7% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, we estimate ACV would have increased 10% from a year ago. Total expense decreased 10% year-over-year, reflecting lower compensation, G&A and direct fund expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was down 12%, primarily reflecting lower incentive compensation due to lower operating income and performance fees, partially offset by higher base fee compensation. Quarterly G&A expense declined 6% versus a year ago and reflected the impact of $96 million of closed-end fund launch costs in the third quarter of 2021, which are excluded when reporting our as-adjusted operating margin. Excluding these costs, G&A expense increased 13% due to higher marketing and promotional expense, including the impact of higher T&E expense and ongoing strategic investments in technology, including cloud computing costs. Sequentially, G&A expense was up 5%, primarily reflecting higher marketing and promotional expense. Direct fund expense was down 10% year-over-year driven by lower average index AUM. Our third quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 42% was down 560 basis points from a year ago, reflecting the immediate negative impact of markets and foreign exchange movements on quarterly revenue and the ongoing longer-term strategic investments we have been making in technology and our people. BlackRock\u2019s industry-leading organic growth is a direct result of the purposeful investments we have consistently made through market cycles. The diversification and stability of our platform has allowed us to pursue critical investment when others have been forced to pull back. But we also recognize that this market environment may require a different playbook. While we continue to have deep conviction in our strategy and the long-term growth of the global capital markets, we have begun to more aggressively manage the pace of certain discretionary spend. We are continuing to pursue critical hires that support our near-term growth, but are pausing the balance of our hiring plans for the remainder of 2022. In addition, we now expect our full year increase in 2022 core G&A to be in the range of 13% to 15% lower than our previous guidance of 15% to 20% that we communicated in January. While these steps will not materially impact our 2022 results, they will better position us going into 2023, should market headwinds persist. Throughout our history, we have demonstrated that we are pragmatic and agile in managing our expenses. As always, we remain committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible and will be prudent in continuing to assess our overall level of spend in the current environment. Our capital management strategy remains to first invest in our business and then to consistently return excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We repurchased nearly $1.4 billion worth of shares in the first 9 months of this year, including $375 million in the third quarter. At present, based on our capital spending plans for the year and subject to market conditions, including the relative valuation of our stock price, we will \u2013 we still anticipate repurchasing at least $375 million of shares in the fourth quarter consistent with our previous guidance. BlackRock\u2019s third quarter long-term net inflows of $65 billion once again demonstrate the stability of our diversified platform and the strategic alignment with clients. We are increasingly looking for partners who can provide them with global insights and whole portfolio solutions tailored to their future goals. Third quarter ETF net inflows of $22 billion were led by surging demand for our bond ETFs partially offset by sentiment-driven outflows from commodities, broad emerging markets, exposures and small-cap equity precision ETFs. As we have seen repeatedly in periods of market volatility, investors turn to iShares precision exposure ETFs to express risk and tactical asset allocation preferences. Bond ETFs generated $37 billion of net inflows, the second best quarter in our history. We are not only leading the bond ETF industry in terms of AUM and net new business market share, but we are working with all stakeholders to grow the bond ETF industry itself. It took 17 years for the industry to reach $1 trillion in 2019. It is now closing in on $2 trillion. And we believe that the industry will be at $5 trillion before the end of the decade, with BlackRock leading that significant growth. Retail net outflows of $5 billion reflected ongoing industry pressures in active fixed income and world allocation strategies, partially offset by strength in index SMAs and our systematic equity income and multi-strategy alternatives funds. Institutional active net inflows of $71 billion were led by fixed income and multi-asset net inflows and included the impact of several previously announced significant outsourced CIO mandates, including the funding of approximately 45% of the AIG Corebridge fixed income assignment. Institutional index net inflows of $23 billion \u2013 net outflows of $23 billion primarily reflected equity net outflows as clients sought to derisk or rebalance in the current environment. Demand for alternatives also continued, with $2 billion of net inflows and $4 billion of new commitments raised across our liquid and illiquid platform during the quarter. New illiquid commitments were driven by private credit and infrastructure. We now have approximately $37 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of alternative strategies, representing a significant source of future base and performance fees. Our cash management platform experienced net outflows of $40 billion, primarily driven by redemptions from U.S. government money market funds as reduced debt issuance in a higher rate environment, coupled with ongoing capital management and a general reduction in corporate cash levels, contributed to industry-wide institutional outflows. As rates stabilize, BlackRock is well positioned to grow market share by leveraging our scale, product breadth, technology, and risk management on behalf of liquidity clients. Finally, third quarter advisory net outflows of $9 billion were primarily linked to the successful transition of the last remaining assets managed in connection with our assignment with the New York Federal Reserve Bank. Throughout our history, BlackRock is led by listening to clients. This connectivity has been foundational to our growth over the last 34 years and our relationships with clients have never been deeper. We have always capitalized on market disruption to emerge stronger by continuing to innovate, to work collaboratively and to deliver the full power of our platform. While challenging, this market environment is no exception. With that, I will turn it over to Larry. Laurence Fink : Thank you, Gary and good morning to everyone and thank you for joining the call. Today and throughout our history, we have focused on providing our clients with choice in how they pursue their long-term investment goals. Over the last 34 years, we have built the industry\u2019s most comprehensive and integrated investments in technology platform. Our diverse solutions provide clients with more choice to address their unique priorities. It is our job to deliver them the best financial returns based on our clients\u2019 own preferences. Our comprehensive platform allows us to serve clients around the world of all types and sizes whether you were looking for a broad-based index exposure, private markets or fully outsourced solutions. For many clients, market-weighted portfolios will suit their needs. Others may want to access to precise exposures in certain regions or sectors, whether that\u2019s Latin America or Southeast Asia or healthcare or agriculture. So others will want their investments to reflect their values or contribute to environmental priorities or pursue opportunities in the energy transition. BlackRock provides investment choice to our clients and our clients decide how they invest their money. Because of this, clients are turning to BlackRock more than ever. Our broad investment product capability, our leading technology platform, our whole portfolio approach and global insights are strongly resonating worldwide with our clients. I cannot think of a time when we have \u2013 we are having more comprehensive conversations with more clients than we are today. First 9 months of 2022 have brought on a complex economic environment, consumers, companies and portfolios remain impacted by the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which reached a record high against the pound in the quarter, following a holistic plunge in the U.S. gilt markets. Central banks continue to prioritize bringing down inflation as they should. At the same time, increased government stimulus is creating a disconnect between fiscal policy and monetary policy. While central banks are tasked with bringing down inflation, governments are injecting stimulus into the economy, making the central bank\u2019s jobs even harder. The speed at which central banks are raising rates to rein in inflation alongside slowing economic growth is creating extraordinary uncertainty, increased volatility and lower levels of market liquidity. After an early summer rally in equities, markets again came under pressure in the third quarter, with equity markets ending down 25% for the first 9 months and the aggregate bond index is down over 14%. While of course BlackRock is not immune to the impact of markets and currency moves, we remain focused on what we can control. We are bringing our capabilities and insights to clients to help them navigate the opportunities and challenges presented by this environment. Even when much of the industry has experienced outflows, clients entrusted us with more than $248 billion in net new business in the first 9 months of 2022, including $65 billion in the third quarter. And our voice continues to resonate in every region where we operate. In the U.S. alone, during the third quarter, clients awarded us $84 billion of long-term net inflows. BlackRock is uniquely positioned in this environment because of our integrated investment management, integrated technology and our advisory expertise, something no other asset manager can provide. Even with these historical difficult market conditions, BlackRock\u2019s AUM is still up $2 trillion since the beginning of 2019. And during that period, we also added over $1.6 trillion in assets under management from organic growth alone. No one else in the industry has done this. And let me be clear, this is not by an accident. For years, we strategically invested in our platform both organically and inorganically in anticipation of our clients\u2019 evolving needs and preferences. What made our investment so successful was our steadfast commitment to integrate our capabilities onto one platform, onto one culture, onto one technology platform. That is what One BlackRock is about, and this is why we connect to our clients worldwide. They have one organization to come to. That culture and approach is just as relevant today, maybe even more so, while others are talking about change and challenges in the asset management industry that we have long anticipated long prepared for, and we are spending our time delivering solutions to our clients. Our long-standing commitment to reimagining our business to innovate ahead of the needs of our clients is translating into industry-leading organic growth we\u2019re generating today. BlackRock\u2019s whole portfolio approach is resonating more than ever against this market backdrop, as clients look for partners with comprehensive capabilities and a global outlook to help them rethink their portfolio allocations. It is especially central to the momentum we are seeing in these major outsourcing mandates. BlackRock anticipates a growing need from insurance companies, pension and wealth distribution partners for more comprehensive outsourced solutions, as they are increasingly looking to focus on their core business. We invested to align our investment expertise, operational expertise and technology to address these clients\u2019 needs. The movement towards outsourcing accelerated even faster than we anticipated. And BlackRock has been in the forefront, working with clients of all sizes that help them meet their investment objectives and to better serve their own stakeholders. Just in the last 2 years, we are honored that BlackRock has been entrusted to lead several significant outsourced mandates totaling over $300 billion in AUM, spanning existing but also entering new client relationships and new capabilities. Third quarter results included some of the flows that these outsourced relationships that we have, and we see strong momentum going forward. Aladdin is not only the operating system that unites all of BlackRock. It is a key component of many of our largest clients\u2019 relationships. Driven by our continued innovation and the power of our user provider model, demand for Aladdin has never been stronger. We\u2019ve seen record new mandates in 2022 and see strong momentum going forward. We have invested to expand Aladdin\u2019s value proposition to a clients\u2019 \u2013 to addressing our clients\u2019 needs across investment life cycle. Aladdin\u2019s integrated offerings are resonating with clients, with about half of this year\u2019s mandate spending multiple Aladdin products. This includes clients using the Aladdin whole portfolio view, which grew out of our own acquisition of eFront, to seamlessly manage portfolios across public and private asset classes on one single platform. It includes clients leveraging Enterprise Aladdin and alongside Aladdin Accounting or the Aladdin Data Cloud. The success of our expanded Aladdin offerings demonstrates how clients value our innovation and our integrated capabilities. Just as Aladdin is transforming the operating system of the asset management industry, bond ETFs are revolutionizing fixed income investing with iShares leading industry growth and industry innovation. iShares bond ETFs generated $76 billion of net inflows in the first 9 months in 2022, even as a generational rise in inflation and tighter monetary policy resulted in sharp price declines in the bond markets. Flows in 2022 highlighted the unique diversity of BlackRock\u2019s Bond ETF platform. Flows were led by U.S. Treasury ETFs, but also saw strong growth in investment grade in municipals and international government bonds. Today, BlackRock\u2019s ETF platform stands at $700 billion in AUM across 300 ETFs, serving millions of investors globally. We also saw more opening of the bond ETF ecosystem, such as the CME\u2019s announcement that it would accept certain bond ETF for collateral management and continued adoption from U.S. insurers, giving changes to the bond ETF capital treatment announced earlier this year. Beyond fixed income, we are partnering with clients to deliver benefits of ETS to their portfolios across each of their major product categories. Investors continue to turn to iShares ETF for long-term investments, active and for passes. And we also saw growth across core equity, sustainable ETFs in the third quarter and throughout the year. Across our ETF platform, BlackRock generated inflows of $22 billion in the third quarter and $131 billion year-to-date. ETF flows for BlackRock were particularly impacted by high utilization of iShares precision exposures ETFs by institutional clients for their own exposure management. The tactical asset allocation tools are unique to BlackRock, and high utilization of ETFs reinforce the value proposition across the iShares strong secondary market liquidity and unique options and lending market ecosystem to allow our portfolios and investors to either go long or short using iShares as a vehicle to express their market views. BlackRock\u2019s leading performance and innovation in the ETF industry is another testament to the integrated nature of our model and our platform. Aladdin enables us to handle complexity and precision with scale. iShares products diversification and innovation offers clients the widest choice in the industry. Globally, we have over 1,000 ETFs, nearly 6x the number of our next largest player. In 2022 alone, we launched 75 new ETFs, nearly double [indiscernible] launches by the next three largest providers combined. The breadth of this platform also enables us to capture changes in client demand and help our clients nimbly reposition as market conditions evolve. ETFs are increasingly the first place investors go to make tactical asset allocations and updates, manage liquidity or position for compelling long-term opportunities. And in particular, clients have been turning to us to help them navigate rapidly rising rates and capitalizing on generational opportunities in fixed income. BlackRock\u2019s top-performing diversified fixed income platform across ETFs and active and across duration, across credit and high yield is uniquely positioned to help clients in line with our specific needs and goals, whether it will \u2013 to lock in a risk-free yields or to generate more income or to hedge against inflation. In addition to significant funding from outsourcing relationships, BlackRock\u2019s active platform demonstrated continued momentum and systematic equities in LifePath target date funds and alternative strategies. We believe we will benefit from money in motion as clients recalibrate and build portfolios with high-performing active alongside ETF and private markets. While market volatility impacted shorter-term performance in some funds, long-term performance remains strong, with approximately 89% of our active fixed income and 82% of our fundamental equity are above our peers and medium for the 5-year period. We continue to see demand for alternatives, especially in private credit and infrastructure. As investors seek additional sources of yield or uncorrelated returns amid this more challenging public market alpha, we raised $6 billion through commitments and net inflows in the third quarter and $23 million in the first 9 months of 2022. BlackRock has built comprehensive private market capabilities that provide exposure across illiquid alternative asset classes and importantly, are integrated as a part of the One BlackRock platform. This is unique in the industry and offers us a tremendous leverage, alternatives at BlackRock benefiting from the firm\u2019s global footprint, our network of clients and distribution relationships, access to differentiating high-quality deal flow, understanding our clients\u2019 whole portfolios and leading data analytics and technology. In addition to our investment and technology capabilities, our Financial Markets Advisory group, continues to play a critical role in advising financial and official institutions. In the third quarter, we announced that our FMA group will be working Pro Bono with the Government of Ukraine to provide advice on designing and investment framework, with a goal of creating opportunities for both public and private investors to participate in the future of a reconstruction and recovery of the Ukrainian economy. BlackRock continues to innovate in a variety of areas to expand the choices that we offer to our clients. Last fall, we announced BlackRock\u2019s Voting Choice Initiative, which leverages our technology to help eligible institutional clients participate in proxy voting decisions. Following years of work on technology and regulatory barriers, nearly half our clients\u2019 index equity assets, including pension funds representing more than 60 million people, have simple and efficient options about their preferences, if they choose. We\u2019re going to expand choice even further, and we\u2019re committed to a future where every investor \u2013 every individual investor can have the option to participate in the proxy voting process, if they choose. Of the client assets currently available for voting choice, nearly 25% are held by clients who have so far elected to exercise their own voting choice and voting preferences. For other clients, BlackRock investment stewardship team serves as an important link between them and the companies they invest in. Over the past few months, I\u2019ve been energized by the surge in people and activity in our offices around the world. Our people across all levels of our organization are being \u2013 are more motivated, they are more engaged and more focused on the future than ever before. Just as we continually innovate and evolve our business to stay ahead of our clients\u2019 needs, we also evolve our organization and our leadership team, key to delivering the full power of One BlackRock to our clients and having our senior leadership team, having deep experience, knowledge and connectivity across the entire firm, with a desire of building deeper and broader horizontal leadership. We make organizational leadership changes every few years because we believe these changes bring the best benefits to our clients, our shareholders, our firm and to our leaders themselves. These changes not only keep us more tightly connected. They stimulate fresh thinking and helping us better anticipate all our clients\u2019 needs. Part of the changes to our leadership that we announced last week reflected Gary\u2019s desire to take on a new role, once again working directly with clients. He will be with us as CFO for the next quarter\u2019s earnings and through our year-end reporting. But I want to take a minute to recognize and thank you. Thanks, Gary. He\u2019s a great friend and has helped drive strong growth for BlackRock and our shareholders in the last 10 years as the CFO and for many years before that as our true trusted adviser. I\u2019m glad he\u2019ll continue with us at BlackRock as the Vice Chairman focusing on a number of our strategic client relationships. And I know that Martin, who has been named as our new CFO, will hit the ground running. With deep knowledge, deep experience from his 16 years at BlackRock across a varieties of different roles, Martin is a true example of stellar and pursuit horizontal leadership with many different experiences within the firm. He will be working very closely with Gary and the entire finance team over the next few months to ensure a smooth transition. BlackRock is fortunate to have a diverse and engaged Board of Directors, who act as stewards on behalf of all our shareholders and stakeholders in overseeing BlackRock\u2019s management and our operations. It has always been important that our Board functions as a key strategic governing body that advises and challenges our management team that guides BlackRock into the future. Beth Ford has been the kind of a Director we seek out, someone who bring new perspectives and new expertise to the Board. She has been an invaluable, valued member of our Board. But because of her spouse\u2019s new position as CIO of the Minnesota State Board of Investments, she decided that it would be inappropriate for her to step down \u2013 it would be appropriate for her to step down from our Board. And we\u2019re grateful for the many contributions that Beth has made as a member of the BlackRock Board. We built BlackRock because we believe in the power of the capital markets, the power of what they have done in transforming economies for their long-term growth and the importance of being invested in them. The money we have managed \u2013 that we manage belong only to our clients. Over many years, we have been built \u2013 we have built the most comprehensive platform to help them meet their investment objectives and deliver better outcomes for the portfolio. We provide them choice so that their portfolios can be tailored to mask their preferences, and their goal is unique to them. Our clients hold many different views. They operate in vastly different regulatory and cultural environment. And in this politically polarizing world we\u2019re living in today, we think that the model of client choice that we built during the last 34 years is more important than ever. In the last few months, especially in the United States, our industry and BlackRock itself has been the subject of increased political dialogue. We\u2019ve seen and heard a lot of misinformation about BlackRock. We\u2019re engaging more with our stakeholders than ever before. We\u2019re telling our story so that people can make decisions based on facts, not on misinformation, not on politicization by others. I do believe that the vast majority of our clients, our voice is resonating as strong as ever. We hear it in our dialogue with them, and we see it in our flows. Again, in the United States alone, we have had positive net term inflows of $133 billion in the first three quarters of the year. And as I noted earlier, in the third quarter alone, we had 40 \u2013 excuse me, $84 billion in long-term net inflows awarded to BlackRock by U.S. clients. The majority of our clients are investing to fund the retirement of teachers, of nurses, of firefighters, of factory workers who are saving for their future. They are entrusting BlackRock with more of their portfolios because they know we are here to serve them today and all tomorrows in the future and have a track record of helping them achieve their goals. They remain \u2013 our clients remain our North Star. As markets change and as our clients need for more of us, we will stay true to our fiduciary mindset, our innovation instinct and our One BlackRock culture that has defined us and enabled differentiating growth and differentiating relationships with our clients. I believe the best of BlackRock is ahead of us. And we are all committed to delivering the power of our unified platform to benefit our clients; to benefit our employees; and most of all, to benefit our shareholders.  With that, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Craig Siegenthaler : Hey, good morning, Larry. I hope you and the team are doing well. Laurence Fink : Hi, Craig. Craig Siegenthaler : And Gary, also just wanted to congratulate you on the new role, but I think you got one more earnings call with us. Gary Shedlin : Thanks, Greg. Look forward to it. Craig Siegenthaler : So my question is on the potential for client rebalancing into fixed income, just as rates and markets eventually stabilize. And arguably, nobody has better perspective on this topic than you guys just given the breadth of the BlackRock platform. But what is your outlook for fixed income given higher yields and also some of the sector themes like the benefits of demographics, including the retirement of the baby boomers? Laurence Fink : Craig, let me turn it over to Rob. Robert Kapito : Craig, thank you for the question. The markets in 2022 have certainly disrupted their traditional portfolio allocations from the past. Traditional 60-40 allocations are certainly at a balance and portfolio liquidity profiles have also been impacted. And now for the first time in years, investors can actually earn very attractive yields without taking much duration or credit risk. Just a year ago, the U.S. 2-year Treasury Notes were yielding 25 basis points. And today, they are earning 4%, corporate bonds are over 5% and high yield is above 9%. So, let me give you a little helpful context. If we go back in 1995, to get a 7.5% yield, which is what many institutions were looking for, a portfolio could be in 100% bonds. If you fast forward 10 years, in 2005, it had to be 50% bonds, 40% equities and 10% alternatives. Then move another 10 years. And in 2016, you needed only 15% bonds, 60% equities and 25% alternatives. This describes the growth of several markets. Now today, to get that same 7.5% yield, a portfolio could be in 85% bonds and then 15% equities and alternatives. And as you know, over the last several years, most of our clients, both institutional and retail, have been underweighted in fixed income. Today, infrastructure and sustainability stimulus in the U.S. is going to create significant opportunities for long-term investors and infrastructure to add returns to portfolios. So, the combination of bonds and infrastructure is going to present some great fixed income outcomes for our investors. And over the last several years, BlackRock has built some great teams that have great performance in these particular areas. So, clients are coming to BlackRock to help them pursue what I would call generational opportunities in the bond market, both institutional and individual. And we are helping those clients to navigate recalibrations of their fixed income portfolios. And just to reiterate a couple of comments from Larry. We saw $37 billion of net inflows into bond ETFs, which is the second best quarter we have had in history, and then an additional $1.5 billion into private credit and active fixed income inflows of where we have significant good performance for the long-term. So, I think we are going to see dramatic and large inflows into fixed income over the next year as interest rates rise. The breadth, diversification and performance of BlackRock\u2019s fixed income and alternative capabilities over time across unconstrained, high yield, total return, duration, private credit and infrastructure positions us to capture those fixed income client flows as they look to lock in yields, rebalance back to target allocations or execute on opportunities for additional yield and certainly inflation protection in infrastructure. Back to you. Operator : Our next question will come from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Laurence Fink : Good morning, Alex. Alex Blostein : Yes. Good morning, Larry. Thanks everybody for taking the question and congrats both to Gary and Martin as well. So, maybe just to build on Craig\u2019s question, but zooming out a little bit and thinking about BlackRock\u2019s organic base fee growth holistically, clearly, the firm is not immune to the macro challenges that we see in the space today. But given Rob\u2019s comments around the attractiveness of fixed income markets and sort of other initiatives that you have at the firm, do you expect BlackRock to get back into sort of this mid-single digit organic base fee growth over the near to medium-term? And what are some of the other building blocks that will help you get there? Laurence Fink : Gary? Gary Shedlin : So, thanks, Alex, for the question. I think just looking back, we \u2013 when we set our 5% organic base fee growth target, it was never intended to be a quarter-to-quarter measure of our success, but really to think about what we can do to differentiate our growth and be more consistent over market cycles and the long-term. And I think we have proven that. Obviously, in the last 12 months, we have delivered 2% organic base fee growth. And I think that\u2019s really a reflection of two things. One is our broad-based platform and its relevance to clients across a variety of market conditions. But more importantly, if you really see where our growth is coming from today, it\u2019s coming from areas where we have invested to build newer franchises, in particular, places like alternatives or sustainability that are frankly new parts of our growth paradigm. If you look over a longer period of time, 5% organic growth over 7 years of the last 9 years. And I think, obviously, there is some pro cyclicality to that in terms of stronger markets. But I think we have shown our ability to generate positive organic base fee growth in years marked by market volatility. Obviously, we did it in \u201816. We did in \u201818. This is a little bit of a different environment. But we absolutely believe that, over time, we will be able to continue to maintain that growth. And why do we feel so confident about that, a, because I think we bring to the table a number of things : one, global reach to a full range of investment strategies across active index, alternatives and cash, a strong perspective on integrated risk management, where we have talked about an integrated business model today and obviously, unique performance, which in the long-term is still very, very strong for us. But it\u2019s this ability to bring together all of these things to address client problems and their goals of objectives in the long-term through whole portfolio solutions, which I think is really the difference for us. So, I mean Rob Kapito mentioned a number of items. But whether it\u2019s private markets, whether it\u2019s ETFs, whether it\u2019s fixed income or broadly, sustainability, technology leading position in cash and ability to bring it all together, whether to using technology to generate revenue itself or using technology to generate increased flows, whether in wealth or an institutional world, I think we still feel really, really comfortable that there is room to grow. But obviously, we need some stable markets to be able to do that. I think we cautioned everybody in very, very bold markets like we saw in basically \u201820 and \u201821 that 7% and 11% was probably a little bit above our punching rate. But it\u2019s looking basically on an average over these cycles, I think we feel very comfortable with 5%. And I think once markets stabilize, clients are going to get right back to their focus on long-term needs and solutions, and we will be right there with them to basically help them address those problems. Operator : Your next question will come from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Ken Worthington : Hi good morning. Laurence Fink : Hi Ken. Ken Worthington : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. The financial press has reported that BlackRock is caught in the middle of the ESG debate by those who think you are doing too much and those who think you are doing too little. So, maybe how would you characterize the cost here to BlackRock in terms of either reputation or lost business from the leadership position that you have taken on ESG issues? And have these costs been growing more recently as the financial press suggests? And then maybe looking forward, are you thinking about adjusting or repositioning the message on ESG, so you can better maximize the benefits and minimize the costs? Robert Kapito : Great question, Ken. Thank you. Well, I think our flows for the year and our flows for the quarter here in the United States speak volumes about what\u2019s really happening. Once again, U.S. flows in the third quarter, around $85 billion, $133 billion for the year, $258 billion over the last 12 months. And importantly, I think what it\u2019s resonating is that we are providing clients, from any views, choice. So, there are clients who have used one side of the conversation related to sustainability. We allow them to have a choice, and we help them design their portfolios. And clients who have views, whatever those views may be, we provide them with product choice and product ideas. And I really do believe that\u2019s resonating in almost every circumstance. And I do believe that has been the foundation of BlackRock, providing choice. We are giving clients that choice and access. And there are many clients who still believe that investing in sustainable strategy is the right long-term strategy. And that is giving them the choice to invest, and other clients may have different views. And so our message has been about choice. Our message has always been about whatever the client is looking to do and moving forward. And we have enlarged choice like no other asset management firm in the world by providing even voting choice now. And as I have said about a large component of our institutional clients have chosen now to bring back that vote. And we hope we have the ability to expand choice, as I said in my prepared remarks, across the entire universe of investors from small investors to all investors. And I believe if this is where we are going, we are going to provide that. I think this resonates very well because we are staying in front of the needs of the clients, and I think that is resonating in our flows this quarter. It is \u2013 we designed voting choice. Actually, we announced it over a year ago. And it\u2019s now playing into a very good \u2013 it\u2019s a major part of the dialogue today. So, I am aware of \u2013 obviously, of the articles, pretty \u2013 and we are addressing that. We are trying to tell our story. We are telling our story with Saks, and I am here to tell our shareholders today that choice is resonating. Operator : We will now take our next question, which will come from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Michael Cyprys : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Laurence Fink : Hi Mike. Michael Cyprys : Yes. So, I was hoping you could elaborate a bit around the pacing of your investment spend. I know in the past, you have mentioned that you would look to invest through the cycle. And clearly, you updated your core G&A guide here, this morning on the call, to more tightly manage that spend. So, I was hoping you could talk about how you prioritize where to invest at this point in the cycle versus where to slow down versus where to really pull back. And what does this all mean as you think about overall expense growth into 2023 compared to the 13% to 15% guide on core G&A for this year? Thank you. Laurence Fink : Good question, Mike. Gary, do you want to\u2026 Gary Shedlin : Sure. Thanks Mike. So, look, we are obviously trying to be very mindful on our margin. On the one hand, we know that shareholder value is clearly driven by continuing to invest to optimize organic growth. And we also know that historically, in markets like these, we have very much expanded our competitive moat because we can invest and others can\u2019t. On the other hand, Mike, we are also mindful that we continue to grow \u2013 while we continue to grow organically, our overall revenue, run rate is down, again, primarily driven by factors outside of our control like FX and beta. And our level of discretionary spend is higher than it was a year ago. We had the same discussions as a management team post the onset of the pandemic in early 2020 when market \u2013 equity markets were down about 30%-plus. We faced that similar conundrum. And thankfully, we made the correct decision to kind of solder on top rates, but ultimately solder on. And as a result of that decision, we posted the two best years of organic growth in our history. But we are also mindful that these markets are not only a little different, but the time of recovery may similarly be \u2013 have a longer duration. And so while we do have that deep conviction in the strategy, we have talked about that on a number of the questions this morning, and not only that, but also the long-term growth of the capital markets, we do think it\u2019s appropriate at this time to more aggressively manage the pace of certain of those investments. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we are going to really pause the balance of our discretionary hiring plans for the remainder of the year. We tightened up some of the discretionary spend in our G&A. And we will be using those as key placeholders and observations as we begin our discussions for our spending plans next year. I think that we have talked many times together about \u2013 you guys asked about margins of our individual business. And I can tell you that our highest margin business is beta. The good news is that\u2019s both true on the way-up, but also on the way-down. And as markets hopefully recover, I am very confident that we are going to expect to see our revenue growth to meaningfully outpace growth in our discretionary spend and be accretive to our operating margin over time. But going into this year, our focus at a minimum will be on aggressive reallocation to a number of the areas that we have talked about, again, whether it would be private markets, ETFs, technology supporting whole portfolio solutions and making some tough calls in terms of how to make sure that we are balancing that organic growth in a way that benefits not only our clients, but also our employees and our shareholders. Operator : And our last question will come from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Laurence Fink : Good morning Dan. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to follow-up on the headlines around LDI and what\u2019s been going on in that market. And if you could please size your AUM and even potential revenue associated with that strategy. And how you might think there could be or what you think about repercussions from either clients or regulators given what\u2019s going on? Laurence Fink : Let me start with the context of LDI first. LDI has been a 20-year market. It\u2019s been transparent. Regulators have proved strategies. Consultants were the ones who really approve the strategies on behalf of the individual funds. It is our estimate the LDI market in the UK is about $1.7 trillion. We have about 20% of that, $250 billion. So, let\u2019s describe what happened. These products were built with the idea that will create \u2013 to create these strategies. You had risk corridors of 100 basis points to 125 basis points. That corridor worked for over 20 years because of a fiscal policy announcement by the UK government. Markets fell over 100 basis points in one day. And many of the corridors were penetrated. Now what does that mean, it means the clients have to post margin in their total return swaps. Many clients did not have the ability to rapidly post margin in a single day. And that created the market setback. The Bank of England comes in and steps in and stabilizes it. And during the stabilization period, for those who have needed to be stabilized for many of the funds, they posted the margins. For many of the other funds that could not do it, there is we had a creator, and other firms had to create different types of corridors, broadening the corridors, should the corridors be not 100 basis points, but a 200 basis point corridor. And that by the announcement by the Governor of the Bank of England yesterday, it indicated to me that much of the reconstruction of these products have been done. They have the intelligence of every player in this. And so some \u2013 as I said, some of the pension funds did not have the collateral. And in doing so, they may have to sell other assets to meet margin calls. Some clients were easy to provide the margin call and some clients needed to have some form of restructuring. By the actions this morning, the market \u2013 the GILT market have been \u2013 I don\u2019t know the GILT market since we have \u2013 on this call. But as of this morning, GILT market was stable. And so it appears much of the reconstruction of these products may have been done and the market may be just should be a little more normalized. I am not here to tell you I know the intelligence of has everybody done it, will there be more volatility starting in Monday on this, I don\u2019t know that. What I do believe that we should do like BlackRock was a leader in terms of money market reform, we want to work with the regulators, be a part of this to try to say if volatility is going to continue to be this large, maybe there has to be whole redesigning of some of the products, whether it is \u2013 whether that is in a commingled fund or in separate accounts. But we are going to be part of the solution to move this forward and as we always are. But I think this is a specific event to the UK pension market. And it was a major component of the UK pension market. And so it had a very deliberate issues that impacted that market. But as of now, there has been adequate time in most cases, not all. I am not here to suggest it\u2019s over of changing the corridors, widening that, obviously, at a cost and then importantly putting up the necessary margins that were necessary in the severe market moves in the UK GILT market. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks? End of Q&A: Laurence Fink : I do. Thank you everyone for joining us this morning and for your continued interest in BlackRock. Our third quarter results are a direct result of our commitment towards serving our clients and providing choice to our clients and in the backdrop of a very severe market downturns in both bonds and equities. But I believe the organic flows, the position we have had, the ability to provide choice to our clients resonated with the outcomes of the third quarter. And I believe they will be resonating in the quarters to come. So, I am excited about the opportunities ahead of us, and I see real opportunities that BlackRock\u2019s position has never been stronger than ever. I want to thank everybody and have a good quarter.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you, Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference. Christopher Meade : Good morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which was some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So with that, I'll turn it over to Gary. Gary Shedlin : Thanks, Chris. Good morning and Happy New Year to everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the fourth quarter and full year 2022. Before I turn it over to Larry, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as adjusted results. As a reminder, beginning in the first quarter of 2022, we updated our definitions of as adjusted operating income, operating margin and net income. Year-over-year financial comparisons referenced on this call will relate current quarter results to these recast financials. Throughout BlackRock's history, we have consistently invested in our business with a long-term focus and commitment to serving clients across market environments. We have established leadership positions in high-growth areas such as ETFs, private markets, outsourced solutions and technology. And we have integrated industry-leading capabilities into our One BlackRock business model and culture to create a distinct and differentiated value proposition for clients. As a result of these investments, we grew organically at our fastest rate ever in 2021. And while 2022 was one of the most challenging market environments in over 50 years, clients around the world once again turned to BlackRock for advice and assistance to construct more resilient portfolios. In good times and bad times, whether adding or reducing risk, our continued industry-leading organic growth demonstrate that clients are increasingly consolidating more of their portfolios with BlackRock for long-term solutions that solve their most challenging investment needs and address their unique risk preferences and priorities. During 2022, BlackRock generated industry-leading total net inflows of over $300 billion and delivered positive organic base fee growth. Importantly, we ended the year with strong momentum, generating approximately $114 billion of total net inflows in the fourth quarter representing 3% annualized organic base fee growth and reflecting continued momentum in iShares and significant outsourcing mandates. Full year revenue of $17.9 billion was down 8%. Operating income of $6.7 billion and earnings per share of $35.36 both declined 13% compared to 2021. For the fourth quarter, revenue of $4.3 billion was 15% lower year-over-year primarily driven by the impact of lower markets and dollar appreciation on average AUM and lower performance fees. Quarterly operating income of $1.6 billion was down 25%, while earnings per share of $8.93 was 16% lower versus a year ago, also reflecting higher non-operating income and a lower effective tax rate in the current quarter. Non-operating results for the quarter included $159 million of net investment income driven primarily by mark-to-market gains in our private equity co-investment and seed investment portfolios and our strategic minority investment in Envestnet. Our as adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 23%, driven in part by discrete items. We currently estimate that 25% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for 2023 primarily due to an increase in UK tax rates, though the actual effective tax rate may differ because of non-recurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation. Fourth quarter base fee and securities lending revenue of $3.4 billion was down 14% year-over-year, in line with the corresponding decline in average AUM, primarily reflecting the negative revenue impact of approximately $1.7 trillion of market beta and foreign exchange movements on AUM over the last 12 months. Sequentially, fourth quarter base fees and securities lending revenue was down 4% despite positive organic base fee growth in the quarter. Our fourth quarter annualized effective fee rate decreased by approximately 1.5 basis points from the third quarter, reflecting the previously discussed impact on our fourth quarter entry rate, continued mix change favoring lower fee mandates and lower securities lending revenue. Fourth quarter and full year performance fees of $228 million and $514 million, respectively, decreased from a year ago. The decline primarily reflected lower revenue from liquid alternative and long-only mandates, partially offset by higher fees from illiquid alternatives. Notably, as our private markets business continues to scale, full year performance fees from liquid alternatives increased 42% year-over-year and our unrecognized deferred carry balance, which represents a portion of our potential future carrier fee revenue exceeds $1.4 billion. Our Aladdin business delivered record net new sales in 2022, and demand for our technology solutions has never been stronger. Quarterly technology services revenue increased 4% year-over-year and full year revenue of $1.4 billion increased 7%. Both periods reflected significant revenue headwinds associated with the FX impact on Aladdin's non-dollar revenue, and market declines on Aladdin's fixed income platform assets. Annual contract value, or ACV, increased 8% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, we estimate ACV would have increased 10% from a year ago. Total expense decreased 4% in 2022, reflecting lower compensation, direct fund expense and G&A expense. For the full year, employee compensation and benefit expense was down 5%, primarily reflecting lower incentive compensation due to lower operating income and performance fees and lower mark-to-market impact of certain deferred compensation programs, partially offset by higher base compensation. Recall that year-over-year comparisons of fourth quarter compensation expense are less relevant because we finalize full year compensation in the fourth quarter. 2022 direct fund expense decreased 7% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower average index AUM. The sequential decline in quarterly direct fund expense also includes the impact of higher rebates that seasonally occur in the fourth quarter. Excluding product launch costs, fourth quarter G&A expense increased 2% year-over-year, reflecting ongoing strategic investments in technology and the impact of higher foreign exchange re-measurement expense, partially offset by lower occupancy and sub-advisory expense. For the full year, we estimate that core G&A expense was up 11% compared to 2021, primarily driven by higher technology spend associated with our Aladdin cloud migration and a return to more normalized levels of T&E expense. Our full year as-adjusted operating margin of 42.8% was down 400 basis points from a year ago, primarily reflecting the negative impact of markets and foreign exchange movements on revenue and the ongoing longer-term strategic investments we have been making in technology and our people. BlackRock's industry-leading organic growth is a direct result of the disciplined investments we have consistently made through market cycles. As we've shown throughout our history, it's often in times of greatest uncertainty where BlackRock's differentiated model enables us to continue playing offense and we emerged even stronger. Since July, we have been aggressively managing the pace of our discretionary spend, so we would be better prepared for 2023, a year in which we will need to increasingly focus our resources on areas of greatest opportunity. In order to continue investing in our people and critical strategic priorities during the year, we recently restructured the size and shape of our workforce to free up investment capacity for our most important growth initiatives. By taking a targeted and disciplined approach to how we shape our teams, we not only increase investment capacity for these initiatives but also create opportunities for our incredible talent. This resulted in a fourth quarter restructuring charge of $91 million primarily comprised of severance and accelerated amortization of previously granted deferred compensation awards for approximately 500 impacted employees or 2.5% of our global workforce. This charge appears as a single line expense item on our 2022 GAAP income statement and has been excluded from our as adjusted results to enhance comparison to prior periods. Our business is incredibly well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities before us, and we remain deeply committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficiently possible. At present, we would expect our head count to be broadly flat in 2023. We optimizing the shape of our talent pyramid and growing our footprint in iHub innovation centers will continue to be central to our talent strategy, allowing us to continue to support growth at scale. In addition, we would also expect a mid- to high single-digit increase in 2023 core G&A expense driven by the upcoming move to our new Hudson Yards headquarters, continued investment in technology to scale our operations and support future growth, and the annualized impact of migrating Aladdin clients to the cloud, which is now substantially complete. We are also investing through prudent use of our balance sheet to best position BlackRock for continued success. During 2022, we allocated $1.2 billion of new seed and co-investment capital to support our growth, and our year-end portfolio now approximates $3.9 billion. Our strategic minority investments are reinforcing various elements of our strategy and simultaneously generating very attractive returns for our shareholders. During the year, we invested in Circle and became the primary manager of the U.S. DC cash reserves, and we recently made a minority investment in human interest, a tech-enabled, end-to-end retirement plan solutions provider, which is helping Americans employed by smaller businesses access easier ways to save for their retirement. We also remain committed to systematically returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases and returned a record $4.9 billion to shareholders in 2022, including $1.9 billion of share repurchases, an increase of over 30% from 2021. Since inception of our current capital management strategy in 2013, we have now repurchased over $13 billion of BlackRock's stock, reducing our total outstanding total shares by 13% and generating an unlevered compound annual return of approximately 15% for our shareholders. At present, based on capital spending plans for the year and subject to market conditions, including the relative valuation of our stock price, we are targeting the repurchase of at least $1.5 billion of shares during 2023. As you will hear more from Larry, BlackRock's strategy has always been guided by our clients' needs. We are relentlessly focused on providing choice, delivering strong investment performance and executing our fiduciary duties with excellence. This enables us to build deeper and broader relationships with more clients and drive differentiated growth across our platform. Fourth quarter long-term net inflows of $146 billion, representing 8% annualized organic asset growth, were led by flows into strategic growth areas, including ETFs, outsourced solutions and illiquid alternatives. Full year long-term net inflows of $393 billion were positive across all regions, led by net inflows of $230 billion from clients in the United States. BlackRock generated industry-leading ETF net inflows of $220 billion in 2022 and representing 7% organic asset growth and 3% organic base fee growth, including a record $123 billion in demand ETFs. Fourth quarter ETF net inflows of $90 billion reflected some seasonality but also reflected the diversity of our product and client segments. Surging demand for our bond ETFs, which saw $47 billion of net inflows, represented the second best quarter in our history. We also saw continued strength in core equity ETFs as well as precision exposures as clients reassessed tactical asset allocation changes during the quarter. Full year retail net outflows of $20 billion reflected ongoing industry pressures in active fixed income and world allocation strategies partially offset by strength in index SMAs and our systematic equity income and multi-strategy alternative funds. Fourth quarter retail net outflows of $15 billion reflected similar trends. BlackRock's institutional business generated record net inflows of $192 billion in 2022 representing 4% organic asset and 3% organic base fee growth paced by approximately $170 billion of active net inflows, reflecting broad-based strength across all product types and the funding of several significant outsourcing mandates. Fourth quarter Institutional active net inflows of $76 billion were also positive across all product types and included the funding of the substantial remainder of the AIG Corebridge fixed income mandate. We remain well positioned to meet investor demand for risk-adjusted alpha and yield and our diversified active fixed income platform with strong three- and five-year performance records across total return, unconstrained, high yield and credit is especially well positioned for growth as interest rates stabilize in the latter part of the year. Demand for private markets also continued with $16 billion of net inflows into illiquid strategies during the year driven by private credit and infrastructure. In addition, as our private markets business continues to grow, we also raised significant new client commitments in 2022. We now have approximately $34 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of strategies, representing approximately $260 million of future annual base fees and significant potential performance fees. Finally, BlackRock's cash management platform experienced $32 billion of net outflows in the fourth quarter and $77 million of net outflows for the year. Despite a particularly challenging year for the broader institutional liquidity industry, BlackRock became the number one international money market provider. And as rates stabilize, we are well positioned to grow market share by leveraging our scale, product breadth, technology, and risk management capabilities. Before I hand it over to Larry, one last time, I'd like to take this moment to thank him for giving me the opportunity to be CFO of this amazing organization for the last 10 years. It's truly been a highlight of my career, and I'm deeply grateful for the feedback, advice and wisdom I have garnered from our shareholders, our sell-side analysts, our Board, my BlackRock colleagues and, most of all, the amazing finance team I've had the privilege to work alongside. BlackRock is incredibly well positioned to continue generating differentiated growth and delivering for clients, employees and shareholders. And I look forward to continuing the journey in my new role. I'm even more excited for lies ahead with Martin Small as our next CFO. I know we will be in great hands. With that, over to you, Larry. Laurence Fink : Gary. Thank you. Excellent job. Good morning, everyone, and Happy New Year. Thanks, everyone, for joining this call. Today and throughout BlackRock's history, we have focused on delivering the best financial returns for each and every client. In line with our objectives and goals, we remain relentless about staying ahead of their needs of all our clients' needs, providing them with more choice, innovating to help them achieve financial well-being. We serve clients of all types, large, small, individuals and institutions in all parts of the world. So providing them choice is critical in helping each of them achieve their unique financial goals. We have built the industry's most comprehensive and integrated investment and technology platform to provide them with solutions that fit their unique objectives. Our job is then to deliver the best financial returns based on their individual preferences. It is this differentiating platform that drives our differentiating results. BlackRock generated $307 billion in net new assets and positive organic base fees in 2022. These industry-leading results reflected the decision by thousands of organizations and investors that continually place their trust in BlackRock. The consistency of our results across both good and bad markets, markets up and down, comes for our clients' confidence in BlackRock's performance, our guidance and our fiduciary standard. In the United States, we generated $230 billion of long-term net inflows, and flows were positive across all regions throughout the world. We generated organic growth across index and active and across all long-term asset classes from fixed income to equities to multi-asset to alternatives as science turned BlackRock for more solutions across their entire whole portfolio. We ended the year with very strong momentum with $114 billion of fourth quarter net inflows representing 3% annualized organic growth based fees. We estimate that BlackRock captured over 1/3 of the long-term industry flows in 2022, leading the industry and delivering positive organic base fees for the year. Over the past five years alone, BlackRock has delivered an aggregate $1.8 trillion in net inflows or 5% average organic asset growth compared to flat or negative industry flows. Over this five-year period of time have been both rallies and contractions, but BlackRock has always delivered growth reflecting the power of our connectivity to our clients, our fiduciary standards and a diversified platform. 2022 was a year of transition and a complex market environment for every one of our clients. We witnessed transformation in the geopolitical world order that rewired globalization and supply chains, upending assumptions about inflation and drove the normalization and eventually tightening of monetary policy. Production constraints, labor shortages in energy and food price disruptions and price increases followed the Russian invasion of Ukraine, causing inflation to hit a 40-year high, sparking a cycle of rate hikes by central banks. Inflation continues to be a top concern. Despite recent cooling we saw at the end of this year and the beginning of this year, global growth continues to slow. The challenges society has experienced not just in the past year but since the pandemic has eroded hope and reinforced pessimism in many parts of the world. We've seen a decline in birth rates, an increase in aging populations, a rise in nationalism and populism. And I fear that we are entering a period of economic malaise. To correct this, the role of business becomes even more critical than ever. Leaders must continue to invest in technology and research and development to improve long-term prospects and to provide a vision that offers hope about the future. Fundamentally, investing is also an active hope, hope that the future will be better than the president. If people do not have hope, they will not take money out of the bank account and invest it in a 30-year retirement outcome. Today, the financial narrative is so often about the near-term market moves, the topic of the day, flock the latest meme stock or media headlines about political polarization. Throughout our history, BlackRock has taken a long-term approach to investing. It is BlackRock's roll to show people the benefits of investing for the long term to give them hope that, over time, their returns with a balanced portfolio can deliver long-term financial security. Against the current backdrop, BlackRock has an even greater obligation to help our clients wade through the uncertainty and give them the confidence to invest in the long term. We see many opportunities for our clients to capitalize on market disruption, to rethink portfolio construction, to consider the renewed income generation potential of bonds or to reallocate the sectors that may be more resilient in the phase of elevated inflation. BlackRock is uniquely positioned to help clients navigate opportunities in this environment because of our diversified platform and integrated investment management technology advisory expertise. Our whole portfolio approach is resonating more than ever before and underpins the record $192 billion of long-term net inflows from institutional clients in 2022. Institutional clients are choosing BlackRock because of our scale, our resources and the expertise to take on the challenges of each and every market. Clients select this because we take and invest for them in the long term and in alignment with their beneficiaries whose time horizon span decades. In an increasingly complex investment environment, we're seeing strong demand from clients looking to partner with BlackRock for outsourced solutions and expect this to continue in 2023. Just in the last two years, BlackRock has been entrusted to lead several significant outsourced mandates totaling over $300 billion in AUM, spanning existing and new clients. And I'm proud to say our pipeline remains very strong. In 2022, BlackRock helped millions of investors plan for their financial futures as they continue to turn their ETFs for long-term investments. iShare has led the industry with $220 billion of net inflows. We are proud that iShares offers the most choice in our industry. In 2022 alone, we launched over 85 new ETFs globally. And as a testament to our scale, the demand from our clients and our diversification, we had over 70 different iShares ETFs with annual net inflow surpassing $1 billion. Our growth was well diversified across our core equity, our fixed income, factors, sustainable and thematic ETF product categories, and we have seen repeatedly in periods of market uncertainty investors turned to iShares' precision exposure ETFs to make those tactical asset allocation decisions into year-end. iShares bond ETFs generated a record $123 billion of net inflows. We again led the industry, and six of the top 10 asset-gathering bond ETFs in 2022 were iShares. When I started my career a long time ago as a bond trader, it was much more difficult for individuals to assess the bond market. Their options were high-cost mutual funds or paying large markups to brokers to buy bond directly. 20 years ago, iShares launched the first four U.S.-listed bond ETFs. And today, we provide over 450 ETF choices across our $760 billion iShare fixed income platform. In an uncertain rate and credit environment this year, iShare I shared bond ETF benefit for having the most diverse product offerings in the industry, spanning governments, investment grade, high-yield emerging markets, municipals, innovations like buy rights and iBonds. The diversification means we can meet our clients' demands as it evolves. Earlier this year, investors used iShares bond ETF to express preference for short treasuries and more recently, our high yield, our corporates, long-duration ETFs have been leading the flows. The role of bonds in the portfolio is increasingly relevant. For the first time in years, investors can actually earn very attractive yields without taking much duration or credit risk. Just a year ago, the U.S. two-year treasury note was yielding approximately 90 basis points, and today, they're earning over 4% with corporate bonds earning over five and high-yield earning eight. Clients are coming to BlackRock to help them pursue generational opportunities in the bond market, and our leading $3.2 trillion fixed income and cash platform is well positioned to capture accelerating demand. In addition to our industry-leading bond ETF flows, clients turned to BlackRock's high-performing active platform, where over 80% of taxable fixed income assets are performing above benchmarks at a bare medium for the three- and four-year period. There will be more money moving around. And as investors recalibrate, we believe we will benefit as clients build portfolio with high-performing active investments alongside ETFs and, of course, private market strategies. The need for income and uncorrelated returns against the backdrop of higher inflation and a more challenged market for public equities will continue to drive demand for private markets. We raised $35 billion in client capital in 2022 led by private credit and infrastructure. We're successfully scaling successor funds, delivering larger funds through -- raises of subsequently fund vintages. In 2020, our third Global Energy and Power Fund raised a total of $5 billion surpassing the total assets of Vintage I and II combined. In 2022, the fourth fund raised $4.5 billion in investor -- in initial investor commitments at first close, achieving over half of our targeted $7.5 billion raise. Our diversified infrastructure funds are providing social and economic benefits to communities in the United States and around the world. We recently announced an agreement to form Gigapower, a joint venture with one of our diversified infrastructure funds and AT&T, which upon closing will provide fiber networks to customers and communities outside AT&T's traditional service area. The network will advance efforts to bridge the digital divide and ultimately help spur local economies and the communities in which Gigapower operates. One of the largest opportunities in infrastructure investing over the coming years will be the renewable infrastructure. In the United States, the inflation Reduction Act contains a range of measures to spur greater investment in demand for renewable energy, infrastructure and technology. In Europe, the energy supply shocks in 2022 have only sharpened the focus on energy security and given rise to the European Commission's REPowerEU plan for renewal energy investment. Client demand for income and uncorrelated returns also resonated in our multi-asset and fundamental active equity platforms, where we saw in our tactical asset allocation and equity dividend franchises we see great opportunities for clients in our income and dividend growth equity offerings. We can be tools to help thread the needle between generation income and growth that could potentially outrun inflation. Aladdin is foundational to how we serve clients across our platform. It helps us deliver precise tracking for our iShares ETFs. It allows us to onboard and service increasingly large complex mandates, and it has consistently demonstrated its value in proceeding and processing high trading volumes and providing transparency into portfolios in volatile markets. Our multi-decade investment in Aladdin continues to differentiate BlackRock and continues to differentiate Aladdin, both as an asset manager and as a leading fintech provider. Periods of market volatility have historically underscored the importance of Aladdin. And in 2022, we saw record net sales of Aladdin contributing to 10% growth in our annual contract value on constant currency basis. We see clients doubling down on technology and leveraging fewer providers to do more with less. This is evidenced by our mandate this year about half spanning multiple Aladdin products. We continue to evolve and enable clients to further simplify their operating infrastructure with Aladdin. Clients increasingly want to tailor how they use Aladdin to meet their own unique and specific needs, and we are providing them with choice and flexibility. We are creating deep integration with ecosystem providers and third-party technology solutions. Our partners include asset servicers, cloud providers digital asset platforms, trading systems and others who can work with clients in their Aladdin environment to provide a more customized and seamless end-to-end experience. We continue to innovate in a variety of areas to expand the choice we offer clients. We're transforming on how clients can engage with companies they are invested in through our voting choice technology. BlackRock was the first organization to build and launch technology empowering institution clients in BlackRock separate accounts to nearly 650 pooled vehicles to choose how to vote the shares of the companies they own through our own index capabilities. Nearly half of our clients' index equity assets under management are now eligible. This includes all public and private pension plans we manage in the United States as well as retirement plan serving more than 60 million people around the world. And in just the last six months, the number of index equity clients nearly committed to voting choice has more than doubled. We are also working to expand this capability to individual investors in markets like the United Kingdom and in funds where it's possible. The majority of BlackRock's clients are investing to finance retirement. And BlackRock has been in the forefront of innovation and advocacy for retirement solutions throughout our entire history. We recently made a minority investment in the human interest, which is helping small and medium-sized businesses provide affordable, accessible retirement plans to their employees so more American can serve and save for a secured financial future. We believe human interest vision aligns closely with BlackRock's mission of helping more people experience financial well-being by making retirement plans accessible to more Americans. We've always believed in being agile in how we manage BlackRock. That is how we built our industry-leading position and generated value for shareholders over the long run. The uncertainty and the opportunity around us makes us even more important that we stay in front of the changes in the market and focus on delivering for each and every client. To extend our market leadership, we must invest in our people, invest in our platform for the long term by allocating resources where they are needed most in ways that are cost-effective and support our ability to scale. As Gary mentioned, our restructuring effort resulted in a number of valued colleagues and friends leaving the firm. We greatly appreciate the contributions they have made to BlackRock and wish the best for them. BlackRock remains a growth company. Even with this restructuring, our head count will still be 6% higher than a year ago. Looking ahead, we have deep conviction in our strategy and ability to execute with scale and with expense discipline. We are honored that our clients have entrusted us with over $300 billion of net assets in 2022. We see similar clients' needs reshaping and shaping the opportunity set for 2023, being a large insurance company seeking outsourced partnership with scale and expertise pension funds looking for attractive yields and less duration in credit risk, our financial advisers using our models and iShares to build better portfolios to meet the challenges, the long-term challenges of our clients. The investments we have made over the years have also positioned us to capture emerging opportunities and bond ETFs, huge opportunities in the rebuild out of infrastructure in the United States and the world and opportunities in transition finance. Our momentum in Aladdin has never been stronger, and our advisory capabilities continue to play a critical role in our dialogue with clients. I've spoken frequently over the years about the need for CEOs to effectively articulate the value their companies deliver to shareholders, clients, employees and other stakeholders. Similarly, as the CEO of BlackRock, I have a responsibility to articulate the BlackRock story, and it has never been more critical to do that than now. Over the past year, BlackRock has been the subject of a great deal of political and media discourse. It is my duty to address the questions being asked of us, a responsibility that I take very seriously. Some of these people have suggested we are either too progressive. Some of them suggested we're too conservative in how we manage our clients' money. I'm going to just tell everybody, we're neither. We're a fiduciary. We put our clients' returns first. We offer every client investment choices and then pursue their objectives that they choose and the performance they seek. I want to make it clear to our clients, our shareholders and all our stakeholders that we will be deterred in pursuing the outcomes that our clients desire. This steadfast focus has not only enabled us to deliver for clients but also to drive growth for each and every one of our shareholders. Since our IPO, in 1999, BlackRock has delivered a 7,700% total return to our shareholders. And this is the strongest return of a financial services company and the S&P 500 over that period. I thank BlackRock employees for the commitment to upholding our culture and living every day our purpose. They're always striving to better serve each other and each of our clients and finding new and innovative ways to be helping our stakeholders achieve a financial well-being. I really do want to call out and thank Gary once more for his last earnings call. He's been a friend way beyond his term at BlackRock. He's been an adviser. Sometimes he's been tough. Sometimes he's been lovely, but Gary has been an important part of driving our growth over these last 10 years and driving the success of our share price for our shareholders. I am thrilled personally and professionally he will continue to be with us at BlackRock as a Vice Chairman, and I look forward to having Martin Small join us as the CFO for our next call in April. Thank you, everyone, and let's open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Daniel Fannon with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Daniel Fannon : I wanted to follow-up on your comments around asset allocation. And thinking about conversations you're having with clients here into 2023, clearly, fixed income is an area that you've talked about. Can you talk about you need to see rates peak before you start to see that demand? Are you seeing it now? And then also, what other kind of assets outside of fixed income or products that you see really incremental demand as we think about this year? Laurence Fink : Rob? Robert Kapito : I'll take that one, Dan. Rob Kapito here. Clients have, as you know, experienced a very difficult market in 2022. There were joint double-digit declines across both global equities and bonds. I don't think we have to wait to actually call rates where they're going to top or not to know that the traditional 60-40 portfolio has been challenged. And right now, they need a partner to help them rethink their allocations, which are going to have to be much more nimble because of the change in market structure and specifically how each asset class is going to be managed. We find that they are turning to BlackRock more and more for both insights and solutions. And the three areas that are more common are inflation protection because of the uncertainty of where rates are going to go. They're looking for income both from the products they have and from cash, and they're looking at how to navigate the private markets, which continue to grow in size. We have built, over the years, a platform that is allowing us to address these client needs both in good markets and in bad ones. And I think the results that Larry described in 2022 demonstrate how we have been able to participate significantly for our clients. But now to answer your question even more directly, we see a lot of tailwinds that I think are going to support our growth trajectory into 2023. The first one is certainly fixed income because, for the first time in years, insurers and pension funds can actually earn very attractive yields without taking much duration or credit risk. And our $2.5 trillion fixed income platform is strong. The performance across our flagship franchises are excellent, and we are well positioned to help clients add back to their allocations as the rate environment stabilizes. So our fixed income teams, both in active and in passive, are ready. A lot of that will come through ETFs. And we expect that the industry is going to reach $15 trillion in the next few years with iShares leading the growth as it did in 2022, whether it's through fixed income, core or precision, we have the most diversified lineup of ETFs. And as you know, in the U.S. ETFs only represent 2.3% of the bond market. So, we have a lot of runway here. On the private market side, I would emphasize infrastructure and private credit. And one of the largest opportunities will be in renewable infrastructure, and that will benefit even more from the Infrastructure Reduction Act that has been passed in the U.S. And an example Larry gave in his remarks was the recently announced infrastructure JV with AT&T called Gigapower, which is an example of this momentum, which we think there will be many other JVs available to us with other companies in renewable infrastructure. And private credit continues to expand as public financing retreats and more companies seek capital. And there are a couple of others that I think should be highlighted especially as growth areas for BlackRock. One is outsourcing, and we have seen this trend over the last several years. And our recent successes with significant sized mandates are going to position us well to execute on a strong 2023 pipeline. One that has been overlooked is models. There is a shift in wealth management from individual stock fund selection to a whole portfolio-based approach, and that is accelerating demand for models. More importantly, BlackRock managed models are only a fraction of the opportunity. The biggest growth potential comes from other model managers using iShares and other index products as building blocks in very large size in their asset allocation. And then, of course, lastly, is Aladdin, because you know that, in periods of market volatility, it has historically increased the importance of Aladdin to our clients as we saw in our record net sales in 2022. So, all of these position us for continued growth in the years ahead. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alex Blostein : Gary, congrats again on your next move. And maybe in the spirit of this being your last CFO earnings call, we'll get an expense question in there. So, I heard you on the core G&A guide mid- to high single digits for 2023. Maybe help us frame sort of the market conditions that this guide contemplates. And I guess how are you thinking about the expense base, more broadly, including compensation, compensation rate, things like that for the year? Gary Shedlin : Thanks, Alex. So maybe just some context, right, and I think we've spent the last couple of calls talking about our philosophy of really trying to drive organic growth because we know that, that is obviously a critical driver of our PE multiple. And I think we are also mindful that we come through these periods of volatility generally better positioned than our competitors because of our diversified model that gives us the ability to continue to invest going forward when others simply can't do it. And I think as we've talked about this, there's this conundrum, right, which is, on the one hand, we know that our PE multiple is driven by growth. And on the other hand, just understand that in the context of the overall market, our revenue run rate is down, and there is a little bit of a misalignment between our expense base and our revenue capture rate versus where it was a couple of years ago. But I think as we saw coming out of the pandemic, we continued to invest in our business, and that resulted ultimately in the two best years in BlackRock's history in 2021. And in 2022, we've once again delivered by generating over $300 billion of net inflows while most of the industry has been in outflow. So our challenge today really remains to ensure that we can continue to invest in our highest growth opportunities. And we're obviously committed to doing that by trying to relentlessly reallocate resources across the organization. We obviously don't go -- we don't go into a year predicated on any beta assumptions. We try to take beta out of it. I think Rob Kapito did an amazing job of explaining where we think most of the growth potential are on the revenue side. And so it's with that in mind that, in July, we really began to more aggressively manage the pace of our hiring and our discretionary spend and more recently determined to effect a broader restructuring of the size and the shape of the workforce to really free up that investment capacity to ensure that we can continue to basically drive our most important growth initiatives and obviously create opportunities for our talent to develop and prosper. So, I think you've seen that and we talked about that. For next year, we expect our head count will be broadly flat. We are going to continue to optimize our talent pyramid and grow our footprint in iHub innovation centers globally in the U.S., EMEA and APAC. And as I mentioned, we would expect a mid- to high single-digit increase in our core G&A expense. That's coming off a lower base because, as you know, we initially had given you guys, 13% to 15% increase. We actually came in closer to 11%. So we'll be growing off a lower base, and that will continue to be driven by the variety of things that I mentioned on the call, Hudson Yards, technology to scale ops and, obviously, the annualization of a number of expenses, including our Aladdin cloud migration costs. But I really want to remind everyone that our highest margin business is beta. And obviously, we've seen that both on the way up and we also see it on the way down. And as markets hopefully recover we are very confident to see -- to say that our revenue growth over the long term should meaningfully outpace our growth in any of these discretionary expense items and ultimately be accretive to our operating margin. Operator : We'll take our next question from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Michael Cyprys : And Gary congratulations on an amazing 10-year run as CFO, I wish you all the best in your new role. Just a question on Aladdin. Hoping you could unpack a bit of that you're seeing in Aladdin with the record wins? And how you think about extending the platform to other use cases and verticals and how you're thinking about the drivers of growth over the next several years? Laurence Fink : We have been incredibly focused in broadening the capabilities of Aladdin, as you know, over the last 10 years, whether it's Aladdin provider or the work we are doing related to the trading platforms. So on top of that, Aladdin accounting, using Aladdin for private markets through eFront. And then I would say probably a little more interesting directions is using a lateral whole portfolio reviews and views. All of this is just leading to more and more conversations. On top of that, as we built up deeper and deeper expertise in different products, the clients who have historically hired us years ago who are only, let's say, in a fixed income platform are now looking at Aladdin across privates, across equities, across other areas. So let's be clear. A lot of the growth is with existing clients, but also a lot of growth is now with the new clients. So, we're not only just seeing clients in the old geographic footprint. We're seeing new clients expanding geographically. More and more clients flows now in Europe, much more in the Middle East. We won our first client in Africa. Over the years, we've become one of the leading technology platform for the pension fund community in South America and Mexico. So Aladdin is becoming one of the key enterprise components of the ecosystem in various parts of the world. And I do believe when you have market shocks, when you have dislocations and volatility, it truly underscores the need for a more fulsome connected enterprise operation. Historically, people thought of Aladdin as risk management. Most people are not hiring Aladdin for risk management as much as its flow-through enterprise operating system. Having that connection with the custodial bank, having the ability to have accounting, having a whole portfolio analysis and helping them truly drive a whole portfolio analytical understanding. And so, all of this is just leading to more and more opportunities whether it's a focus on sustainability or a focus on operations or focusing on, again, risk management, Aladdin is just very well positioned to meet the needs of the clients, and we're more focused than ever on enhancing the Aladdin value proposition. Let's be clear, in declining markets, clients are worried about their expenses. And yet, what we proved in '22 with declining expenses, Aladdin enterprise system can actually lower expenses in a holistic way. And so, what we're trying to do is show the true ability to clients worldwide about how can Aladdin be a component to drive greater and greater success in terms of operational success, investment success. But over time, Aladdin can drive down expenses, too, for any operation. Operator : We'll move to our next question with Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Craig Siegenthaler : And Gary thanks for your help over the last nine years. I'm sure you're going to really miss these quarterly earnings calls. Laurence Fink : I could tell you he's going to be sulking. Gary Shedlin : I'll miss you, Craig. Craig Siegenthaler : So just a follow-up to Rob's comments on the first question for the potential for fixed income rebalancing, do you think passive will win the majority of inflows like we've seen in equities for the last decade? Or do you think active will grab a healthy split of share as we've seen in fixed income really up until just this last year? Laurence Fink : Great question. So the majority of investors in fixed income ETFs are not passive. They're active. We've been talking about this -- actually began talking about this in 2012 where we believe the simplicity, the liquidity, the operational abilities to use fixed income ETFs to get your factor exposures, the duration, the convexity, the credit exposures you're looking for, you could do that through investing in these index instruments, but you're certainly not passively navigating or managing them. And I truly believe what we saw in 2022, movements out of mutual fund into ETFs provides much greater precision expertise to manage your fixed income exposures through ETFs. And I believe this is going to become one of the most important transformations in the entire capital markets, that more and more bond exposures are going to be utilized through ETF purchases, and it is not passive. It is highly active, and that's where people get confused because they think about ETFs as a passive instrument, both bonds and stock. And what we have been trying to identify over the years and now, most certainly, we saw that in 2022 in bonds that is far from a passive instrument. It is an index liquid investment to allow you to get your exposures that you're seeking, and you're able to navigate those exposures. Look, I believe in how investors are going to use it. They're going to use it side-by-side with their true active bond investing. So I'm not trying to suggest bond active investing. Buying individual bonds is going away, it's not. But for the bulk of most fixed income portfolios, you do not need to have all individual bonds. You can express a large component of that through ETFs. And then if you have the great credit expertise, mortgage expertise where you could really find true value in individual bonds, you're going to do that. But let's be clear, most organizations can't do that in totality in their entire fixed income universe. And so, I believe ETFs are going to continue to grow, especially in fixed income. Rob talked about how we believe this is the beginning of a major expansion of bond ETFs as a component of the entire bond market. And we believe this is going to simplify investing. It's going to make investing in bonds easier with more liquidity, and it's going to be cheaper. And I believe this is only the beginning, using index-like instruments like bond ETFs to actively invest to actively express your exposures that you're seeking, alongside side-by-side in individual bond selections. And we are seeing that with every, if not all -- but I'm going to say every active bond investor is now using ETF as a component of their active expression of exposures. Robert Kapito : I would just add, Craig, one thing is I believe we are going into a period of time in fixed income where you can add alpha in your individual bond selection or where you are on the curve. And you can do it through both active and passive, as Larry is saying, but it will all come down to the ability to add alpha. I can give you an example now in the short end of the curve, which a year ago was very low-yielding. Today, we can find opportunities to earn a 5.5% to 6% in a very short duration. That is going to be active. So it is a combination of both, but it will depend on where our clients can find the most output to determine the split between both ETFs, index and active as you call active. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks? Laurence Fink : I do, operator. I want to thank everybody for joining this morning and for your continued interest in BlackRock. Our fourth quarter and full year performance is a direct result of our commitment in serving our clients each and everyone individually, providing them choice and helping them through guidance with our fiduciary standards that help them evolve and build their needs for the long term. I'm incredibly excited about 2023 and the opportunities ahead of us. And I believe BlackRock is in a position unlike any other time in our history, I want to thank all of you and everyone, please have a great start to our new year. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated First Quarter 2023 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Martin S. Small; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. [Operator Instructions]  Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference. Christopher Meade : Good morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ from the statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.  So with that, I'll turn it over to Martin. Martin Small : Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the first quarter of 2023. Before I turn it over to Larry, I'll review our financial performance and business results. Our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as adjusted financial results. I'll be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we updated our definitions of as adjusted operating income, operating margin, non-operating income and net income. They now exclude the compensation expense impact of mark-to-market volatility associated with certain deferred cash compensation plans and the non-operating impact of an economic hedge, which the company began in 2023. We believe this change provides investors and management with a more useful understanding of our core financial performance over time and increases comparability with other asset management companies. BlackRock regularly reviews our disclosures with the goal of providing helpful information to our investors and streamlining where appropriate. To this end, we also simplified our disclosure of distribution revenue and expense beginning in the first quarter. I'm excited to be presenting for the first time as CFO. As many of you know, most of my first 17 years at BlackRock were spent in client-facing roles. And I can tell you first hand, BlackRock was built for clients. Financial cracks and economic damage from this rapid rate hiking cycle burst into view over the last few weeks, 20 years of easy money is definitely behind us. The world is adjusting to higher rates and tightening credit conditions. BlackRock's platform has been built over time to help clients in all market environments. Market dislocations present significant opportunities for BlackRock and most importantly, for our clients. Asset management firms connect investors to capital markets, and we see these recent dislocations driving more economic activity and growth to markets. We've spent 35 years creating more access, creating more connections among long-term investors, capital markets and the real economy. We've unlocked new markets through iShares and personalized SMAs. We pioneered unconstrained bond strategies, and we put Aladdin on the desktops of thousands of investors and advisers, leading the industry, leading our clients on this journey with world-class investment capabilities, market insights, advice and technology, that's the center of BlackRock's growth strategy. We're a partner. We have long-term perspective. We have the ability to move quickly in times of stress. We're a whole portfolio adviser, providing end-to-end technology and investment portfolio servicing. Clients use BlackRock as a scale enabler. They use our platform as a service. They use it to streamline and support the growth and commercial nimbleness of their own business. Our unique platform combination of ETFs, advisory, outsourcing technology alongside with active and private markets capabilities, that's what's driving BlackRock's differentiated organic growth. Whether adding or reducing risk, our continued industry-leading organic growth demonstrates that clients are consolidating more of their portfolios with BlackRock. And in the first quarter, BlackRock generated total net inflows of $110 billion, representing 5% annualized organic asset growth and 1% organic base fee growth. First quarter revenue of $4.2 billion was 10% lower year-on-year, primarily driven by the impact of significantly lower markets and dollar appreciation over the last 12 months on average AUM as well as lower performance fees. Operating income of $1.5 billion was down 17%, while earnings per share of $7.93 was lower 17% versus a year ago, also reflecting a higher effective tax rate partially offset by higher non-operating income. Non-operating results for the quarter included $60 million of net investment gains driven primarily by mark-to-market gains and the value of our private equity co-investment portfolio and unhedged seed capital investments. Our as adjusted tax rate for the quarter was approximately 25%. This reflects lower discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vest in the first quarter of each year compared to the first quarter of 2022. We continue to estimate that 25% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2023. The actual effective tax rate may differ because of nonrecurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation. First quarter base fees and securities lending revenue of $3.5 billion was down 9% year-over-year. This reflected the negative revenue impact of approximately $800 billion of market beta and foreign exchange movements on our AUM over the last 12 months and was partially offset by the elimination of discretionary money market fund fee waivers and higher securities lending revenue. Sequentially, base fee and securities lending revenue increased 3%, reflecting higher average AUM and securities lending spreads, partially offset by the impact of a lower day count in the first quarter. On an equivalent day count basis, our annualized effective fee rate was modestly lower compared to the fourth quarter, mainly due to changing client risk preferences. Performance fees of $55 million decreased from a year ago, primarily reflecting lower revenue from alternatives. In 2022, our Aladdin platform delivered record net sales and we continue to see strong client interest for our technology solutions. Quarterly technology services revenue was approximately flat compared to a year ago, reflecting this continuing strong demand but also significant headwinds associated with the foreign exchange impact on Aladdin's non-dollar revenue and market declines on Aladdin's fixed income platform assets over the last 12 months. Sequential Technology Services revenue was impacted by onetime fees in the prior quarter and the timing of implementations. Annual contract value, or ACV, increased 6% year-over-year. We remain committed to low to mid-teens ACV growth over the long term, especially as periods of market volatility have historically underscored the importance of Aladdin and generated increased demand. Total expense decreased 5% year-over-year, reflecting lower compensation and direct fund expense partially offset by higher G&A expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was down 6% and primarily reflecting lower incentive compensation due to lower operating income and performance fees. G&A expense increased 6% due to higher marketing and promotional expense, including the impact of higher T&E expense and higher occupancy expense as a result of our moving to our new headquarters right here in Hudson Yards, New York. Sequentially, G&A expense decreased 10%, primarily reflecting seasonally lower marketing and promotional expense. Direct fund expense was down 4% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower average index AUM. Sequentially, quarterly direct fund expense increased due to higher average index AUM in the current quarter and higher rebates that seasonally occur in the fourth quarter. Our first quarter as adjusted operating margin of 40.4% was down 380 basis points from a year ago. This primarily reflects the negative impact of markets and foreign exchange movements on quarterly revenue. Although markets have improved since the end of 2022, we will continue to be disciplined in prioritizing our hiring and overall investments with the aim of delivering organic growth and a differentiated operating margin. The diversification and the resilience of our platform allow us to pursue critical investments while maintaining focus on expenses in our margin. BlackRock's industry-leading organic growth is a direct result of the disciplined investments we've consistently made through market cycles. Our business is well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities before us, and we remain committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible. In line with our guidance in January, at present, we'd expect our headcount to be broadly flat in 2023, and we'd also expect a mid- to high single-digit percentage increase in 2023 core G&A expense. Our capital management strategy remains, first, to invest in our business and then to return excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We continue to invest through a prudent use of our balance sheet to best position BlackRock for continued success. This is primarily through seed and co-investments to support organic growth. We will make inorganic investments where we see an opportunity to accelerate growth and support our strategic initiatives. BlackRock's stable and differentiated business model enables us to invest and remain opportunistic. Our acquisition philosophy focuses on extending our product capabilities and our distribution reach. Prior examples of this strategy are the acquisitions of eFront to extend Aladdin's whole portfolio coverage, Aperio to scale direct indexing and First Reserve to enrich energy and infrastructure investing at BlackRock for our clients. As previously announced in January, we increased our quarterly dividend by 2.5% to $5 per share of common stock. We also repurchased $375 million worth of common shares in the first quarter. At present, based on our capital spending plans for the year and subject to market conditions, we still anticipate repurchasing at least 375 million of shares per quarter for the balance of the year, consistent with our previous guidance in January. BlackRock's $110 billion of total net inflows evidence our strong ongoing connectivity with clients, which only grew as market and liquidity stress events unfolded in the quarter. First quarter ETF net inflows of $22 billion were led by demand for our bond ETFs. This was partially offset by seasonal tax trading and sentiment-driven outflows from U.S. equity style box exposures in precision ETFs. As we've seen repeatedly in periods of market volatility, investors use iShares to implement tactical asset allocation preferences in their portfolios. Our bond ETFs again delivered for clients and generated $34 billion of net inflows. We've invested for years to support the growth of bond ETFs, both to create a diversified bond ETF platform and to deliver the liquidity and price transparency our clients expect, especially during periods of market volatility. Retail net inflows reflected strength in index SMAs through Aperio and broad-based net inflows into active fixed income. BlackRock's institutional franchise generated $81 billion of net inflows as we continue to partner as a scale enabler, a platform for institutional clients seeking turnkey access to investment expertise, greater customization, industry-leading risk management, technology and investment servicing. Institutional active net inflows of $72 billion were led by multi-asset and fixed income net inflows, which included fundings from several significant outsourcing mandates. Demand for private markets also continued with $4 billion of net inflows, representing 16% annualized organic base fee growth led by private credit and infrastructure. We continue to source unique deals for our clients through our global network of relationships. They're underpinned by data, analytics and technology. Examples include our agreement to form Gigapower, a joint venture with one of our diversified infrastructure funds and AT&T. We have approximately $33 billion of committed capital to deploy for clients in a variety of alternative strategies, and this represents a significant source of future base and performance fees. In aggregate, BlackRock generated approximately $68 billion of active net inflows during the quarter, and we've now generated positive active flows in all but two quarters since the beginning of 2019. Finally, BlackRock's cash management platform saw $8 billion of net inflows in the first quarter. Flows were driven by surging demand for our cash management solutions in March as clients look to diversify away from deposits and enhance cash yields. March net inflows offset net redemptions in the first two months of the quarter that were primarily due to client-specific activity such as SPAC unwinds. We're actively working with clients on their liquidity management strategies, providing technology, market and operational insights and, of course, delivering a full range of cash management capabilities. BlackRock's first quarter results highlight the benefits of the investments we've made to build a diversified and resilient investment technology platform. Throughout our history and in its most recent crisis, BlackRock's led by listening to clients. I'm excited about our future and the growing opportunities for BlackRock, for our clients, for our employees and our shareholders.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry. Laurence Fink : Thank you, Martin. And congratulations on your first earnings call as CFO. And good morning to everybody. Thank you for joining the call. BlackRock is a source of both stability and optimism for our clients. We are helping them navigate volatility and embed resiliency in their portfolios while also providing insights on the long-term investment opportunities to be had in today's markets. In 2022, BlackRock generated $307 billion in net new assets and captured over 1/3 of long-term industry flows. Strong momentum continued into 2023, and we once again led the industry with $110 billion of net inflows in the first quarter. The consistency of our results across both good and bad markets across from our clients' confidence in BlackRock's performance, BlackRock's guidance and our fiduciary standards. As I wrote in my Chairman's Letter last month, recent market volatility and stress in the regional banking sector are the consequences of prolonged periods of aggressive fiscal and monetary policy coming to an end. These policies contribute to a sharp rise in inflation with the Federal Reserve responding with the fastest pace of rate hikes since 2000 -- excuse me, since 1980s. The cost of these hikes is now materializing, including through shocked to regional banks. Fears of impairment and held-to-maturity portfolios and bank balance sheet and a crisis of confidence in regional banks set off a wave of shutdowns, seizures and regulatory interventions that we haven't seen at this scale in a long time. As these historic events were unfolding, we marked the 35th anniversary of the founding of BlackRock. Throughout our history, moments of dislocation and disruption have been inflection points for BlackRock. This is where opportunity arises for both BlackRock and for our clients. From times like this, we have always emerged stronger more differentiated in the industry and much more deeply connected to each and every client. We founded BlackRock based on our belief in the long-term growth of the capital markets and the importance of being invested in them BlackRock has grown as the role of the capital markets has grown over the past 35 years. I believe the current crisis of confidence in the regional banking sector will ultimately fuel another round of growth in the capital markets. BlackRock will be an important player, and there are going to be more opportunities for clients as people, companies and countries increasingly turn to markets to finance their retirement, their businesses and the entire economies. Blackhawk operates from a position of strength. While others may be consumed by near-term pressures, we are at the forefront of trends and opportunities that will shape our growth as a firm and deliver the best outcomes for our clients. The powerful simplicity of our business model is that when we deliver value for our clients, we also create more value for all our shareholders. We have stayed hyper-connected with our clients, offering them the first -- the firm's best thinking on what's happening in the markets, anticipating their questions and concerns and acting as their trusted partner and adviser in times of need. Leading with empathy, being at the front foot, putting our collective experience at our clients' disposable moving fast, linking globally, that's BlackRock at our best. Investors are looking to BlackRock for insights and thought leadership on the economy on markets, on geopolitics and asset allocation. Within the first week following the SVB collapse, we reached thousands of clients, providing them with real-time information and our views on the unfolding events. Our BlackRock Investment Institute has hosted dozens of calls for institutional investors and financial advisers. Senior business leaders and investors at BlackRock have met over 100 CEOs, CIOs, executives and public officials. BlackRock's Financial Markets Advisory Group advises financial and official institutions as well as other public and private capital markets participants. FMA recently was awarded a mandate by the FDIC to advise and support asset dispositions related to SVB and Signature Bank resolutions. We are honored to have been selected and approached this with all of our FMA assignments with a great sense of discretion and a deep, deep sense of responsibility. BlackRock is partnering with clients to navigate immediate concerns around market volatility and liquidity while also staying focused on their long-term goals. Through this connectivity, we're having richer conversations with clients than ever before, about their whole portfolios, in many cases, deepening their relationships with them. Our Aladdin technology and integrated asset management platform enables us to help clients quickly understand their portfolio exposures to help them manage liquidity and express changing risk preferences and capture opportunities in response to market events. The horizontal connectivity and responsibility and constant open line of communication requires at this most recent crisis continue to be exemplified across the firm. In the first quarter of 2023, clients entrusted BlackRock with $110 billion of total net inflows, driving positive annualized organic base fee growth. Organic growth this quarter was led by ongoing momentum in our long-term strategic priorities, including bond ETFs and outsourced CIO mandates. Clients also came to BlackRock for immediate liquidity and tactical allocation needs. Whether it was through our diversified cash management offerings, our short-duration fixed income products, precision ETFs or exposures in valuational tools in Aladdin. We were there for our clients providing advice options and swift execution. BlackRock ETFs once again prove their value as critically important tools for active management and in providing liquidity, transparency and price discovery declines during stressed markets. Across our ETF platform, BlackRock generated net inflows of $22 billion in the first quarter. Industry-leading flows into bond ETFs were particularly offset by outflows from our precision ETFs. These tactical asset allocation tools are unique to BlackRock and are used to express risk-on or risk-off use, as they were in this past quarter. In periods of weaker equity markets, we see investors leverage this ETF segment to actively reduce their exposures and for tax loss harvesting trades. As a result, in markets like the first quarter, you'll see outflows from our Precision segment and the opposite in risk-on markets. We have seen this pattern play out following the equity sell-off in 2018, in December and in the first quarter of 2020 and most recently in the third quarter of 2022. In each of these prior periods, inflows follows when risk-on sentiments return.  The high utilization of Precision ETF reinforce the value proposition associated with iShares strong secondary market liquidity and unique options and lending market ecosystems. BlackRock led the industry with $34 billion of bond ETF net inflows and we're representing over 60% of total fixed income ETF trading volumes during the quarter. Especially as the U.S. Treasury market experienced large and historic moves, investors turn to bond ETF access treasury markets and manage interest rate risk. BlackRock's U.S. Treasury ETF ranges over $180 billion of assets, providing exposures across the entire yield curve. Investors use BlackRock's leading platform to manage their risk to quickly shift to safe haven assets and to manage their cash. I've often talked about how ETFs have been modernizing the bond market by contributing real-time information about pricing and market conditions. Notably, ETF liquidity remains strong even as the underlying market liquidity became more challenged. Trading costs in iShares U.S. Treasury ETFs remained low despite moving higher in the underlying bonds. For example, iShares 20-year-plus year treasury bond ETF, bid-ask spread held at 1 basis point, while the underlying bonds at many times traded far wider. BlackRock Fixed income ETFs are increasingly being used for active management. BlackRock's own active managers pioneered the use of fixing ETFs for many years ago, for liquidity management for hedging and for efficient tactical allocation. Today, we see most of the world's leading asset owners, wealth managers and active asset managers as clients of BlackRock fixed income ETFs. We are evolving these client relationships from single-use cases to broader adoption, including active applications for a more holistic view of fixed income portfolio allocations across fixed income ETFs, actively managing strategies and for individual bonds. iShares performance under extreme conditions continue to unlock sources of client demand and expand our opportunity set. Investors of all types are turning to iShares bond ETFs, both in normal market environments and particularly during times of market stocks. Liquidity has also become paramount for our clients. Cash is the lifeblood of individuals and organizations, especially in times of stress. And our teams have been partnering with clients as they reevaluate where they put their cash and how to balance holdings assets and traditional bank deposits alongside other options like money market funds or ultra-short bond strategies. In the month of March, BlackRock saw over $40 billion of net inflows into our cash management strategies. We expect to shift from deposits to money market funds to be a longer-term trend and are actively working with clients to help them diversify and enhance the yields they're earning on their cash. Cash often gets overlooked. Now that yields are back after a decade of -- a lost decade of near zero rates, we're excited to help clients put their cash to work at BlackRock. Through our Cachematrix and Aladdin technology, our risk management and product innovation and collaboration across the $3.3 trillion fixed income and cash platforms, we are positioning BlackRock to be a partner of choice for our clients' liquidity and cash management needs. Asset owners and investment in wealth managers are increasingly looking to focus on core competencies and outsource more of their investment process. As they do this, they want a partner that can provide seamless integration solutions better, faster and more efficiently. Our notable success is on onboarding and executing outsourcing mandates over the past several years have catalyzed dialogues with more and more clients. Early in 2023, two large pension funds chose BlackRock for significant OCIO engagements. In the United Kingdom, Royal Mail announced it selected BlackRock to manage its over $10 billion of defined benefit scheme, trusting BlackRock to look over the pensions of its 118,000 members. In the United States, we are honored to have been selected by a named fiduciary for a pension covering more than 350,000 union workers and retirees. These mandates and other outsourcing assignments underpinned $81 billion of institutional net inflows in the first quarter and are yet more examples of how BlackRock's range of resources, our experiences and our deep connectivity in local markets are resonating with more and more clients and supporting more and more clients. In the last three years, BlackRock has been entrusted to lead outsourcing mandates totaling $400 billion in AUM, including $200 billion in the last 12 months alone. And just yesterday, it was announced that we have been appointed as a primary asset manager partner to LV, the UK mutual insurer. During this time of historic market volatility, clients globally are increasingly interested in how we can help them with outsourcing. We are hearing with all types of clients, not only pension and insurers, but also now endowments and foundations, health care organizations and actually larger family offices. We expect the trend towards outsourcing to continue with BlackRock driving investment management and technology transformations for our clients. Technology outsourcing is similarly on the rise as companies look to replace multiple loosely connected systems with a single strategic partner who offer a complete solution. Aladdin enables clients to operate horizontally to share consistent data and to build and manage whole portfolios. While there's been tremendous ups and downs in the broader market and operating environment, the need for digitization and efficiency through technology remains a constant. Market volatility and the growing demand for immediate precise information on direct and indirect exposures is only underscoring the need for robust technology, operating and risk management technology offered through Aladdin. In the week following the collapse of SVB, we saw significant increases in usage of Aladdin's exposure and interactive modeling tools as our clients sought to understand their exposure to specific securities, to sectors and to their yield curve. They leverage Aladdin capabilities to manage interest rate risk and portfolios and set enterprise-level broker and trade restrictions. Similarly, Aladdin Wealth clients turn to the platform to better understand their clients' exposures as they have in other significant market events like the start of COVID and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Usage following failure in the U.S. regional banks more than doubled at many of our wealth client platforms. Aladdin was designed, Aladdin was built for these type of times, and we are proud that our technology is enabling all our clients to act quickly and with clarity and with much greater confidence during these market shocks. Our results this quarter and amid the most recent crisis are only the latest example of BlackRock doing what it does best. Stay in front of the clients' needs, helping them to see challenges as opportunities and providing hope for what comes next. In 2023, is presenting an incredible opportunity for long-term investors. There's more yield to be earned in cash. Infrastructure and private credit are offering attractive returns. Bonds can be a major component in portfolios and equities are at much better valuations. BlackRock is connecting our clients to these opportunities and providing them with the confidence to continue investing for the long term. Especially in periods of dislocation, our willingness to reimagine our business and to be nimble and seizing emerging opportunities have bolstered our growth and generated differentiated value and returns for our shareholders. Our stable and differentiated business model enable us to remain opportunistic, and we will continue to be deliberate and systematic in our investments. We are constantly looking at opportunities as we assess possible accelerators of growth support of strategic initiatives and test the boundaries of how we think about BlackRock's business.  At our founding 35 years ago, when BlackRock was as much of a concept as it was a company, there was one thing we knew we had to get right, and that was all we start with a client. We've listened to them. We learned a lot from them. We put their needs first. Since then, we have developed leading franchises in ETFs and advisory outsourcing, and in technology. And we worked tirelessly to integrate these capabilities into our One BlackRock business model and culture. It is this combination of capabilities that make BlackRock truly unique. And we're opening new channels for growth by scaling our alternative franchise by expanding the market for bond ETF, providing clients access to emerging opportunities in area like transition finance. Our momentum is a result of many years of thoughtful investments in the infrastructure needed to support complex global mandate at the whole portfolio level. The power of BlackRock's integrated platform enables us to deliver better outcomes for our clients and differentiating growth for you, our shareholders. Over the past five years, BlackRock has delivered an aggregate of $1.8 trillion of total net inflows or 5% average organic asset growth compared to flat or negative industry flows. Over this five year time period, the markets have been both -- have both rallied and have had contractions. But BlackRock has consistently generated organic growth, reflecting the resiliency of our diversified platform and the investments we made towards that platform. Clients are entrusting more of their portfolios with BlackRock in an endorsement of the platform, performance we offered, guidance we provide and the fiduciary status we uphold to each and every client. As we look forward, our success in what we will achieve comes down to our people. Everything we have accomplished and will accomplish is because of how we have all worked together to put our clients first. I'm so incredibly proud of how our employees rallied together in a time of crisis to support our clients, to support their fellow colleagues, and to making sure we are supporting every one of our stakeholders. Looking back at the last 35 years, it is our people who have enabled us to achieve all that we have as an organization. And we are just getting started. BlackRock is still in the early chapters, and I'm more excited than ever about the potential and the promise that we have lying ahead.  Thank you. Operator, let's open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]Your first question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Michael Cyprys : So a question on cash management. Since COVID, the banking system has seen a massive influx of deposits, I think, worth about $4 trillion of added deposits, yet the banks today aren't offering much in terms of yield on those deposits. So the question is, how do you think about accelerating money fund flows and capturing a greater share of deposits? And might there be a structural shift if rates are going to remain higher for longer. So just curious how you're thinking about that? Martin Small : Thanks, Mike. Appreciate it. I hope you had a good holiday. It is an incredibly dynamic time for the cash and liquidity markets. This has historically been a stable value, low or no expected return asset class where people do lots of operational things. But we've obviously entered into this period that started with kind of rates and inflation and has been supercharged essentially by banking sector tremors. And as you correctly flagged, we've seen an extraordinary amount of inflow into money market funds. And clients, I think, paying very close attention where they keep their operating cash and where they keep cash where they can earn a yield premium over deposits. And in every single cycle, deposits obviously tend to lag where money market rates are and deposit betas are just lower.  So I think there is absolutely a structural shift in the marketplace that's driven by two things. One, just rates inflation, but also just clients paying a lot more attention about where they're going to keep their cash balances for purpose of what they do. We're really well positioned here. We had $40 billion-plus of flows in March. We had some outflows in January and February that were really resulting from SPAC unwinds. But we feel very good about our positioning. We have a $683 billion cash platform. We've grown at 50% over the last five years. And I think uniquely, as is with most things at BlackRock, we have a tech-first distribution strategy with assets like Cachematrix and Aladdin. And we also have a very global business that has real diversity of offering across money funds, ETFs, separate accounts.  The last thing I'd just say about that is, I would think about the structural shift that you proposed is not just being about money funds or seg accounts, but being about all of the cash and cash surrogates. I mean there are so many things you can go throw a dart at that yield 5% now. And I would look at a lot of what's happening in the bond ETF world is also being about picking up a yield premium over cash. And so we expect to be really well positioned as clients do a lot of that work to use the ETF markets, to use money funds as well as a whole array of active fixed income solutions. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Craig Siegenthaler : So we're still very focused on the potential for sizable fixed income reallocations. The rates are now looking to plateau. And it seems like the most -- the largest migrations may come from retirees in the U.S. in the pension plan channel. So I wanted your updated perspective on this topic, given your conversations with large institutions and wealth management platforms. And I'm also curious to see if you have any updated thoughts on the reallocation mix between passive and active because of the flow mix [Indiscernible] BlackRock could be a real big winner on this. Robert Kapito : So Craig, it's Rob Kapito. I'll take that one. So you know that we're coming off of the highest inflation in 40 years, the fastest increase in rates in 40 years, the tail end of an endemic, the war in Europe, a lot of geopolitical tensions, and last year, the S&P down 19%, and of course, we're in the midst of Fed tightening. And the result of all of this is yields are back. And for the first time in years, investors can actually earn very attractive yields without taking much duration or credit risk. And this is a pretty remarkable shift. This is really a once in a generation opportunity in fixed income and clients have been over the last many years, because of low rates, underweighted in fixed income. So at BlackRock, we are very well positioned with our $3.3 trillion fixed income and cash platform. But in order to capture these assets, we have to have performance. And our one year in the fixed income is in the 70th percentile and 3-year and 5-year in the 90th percentile. And our active funds are 4 and 5-star Morningstar rated. So we have the performance. We also offer over 450 bond ETF choices, which is more than 5x the next largest issuer across the entire yield curve. We also have the most diversified client base, and that is looking each quarter to have more and more allocations in ETFs and in active fixed income, especially in this environment. We have expanding capital markets group and obviously, a lot of expertise in the capital markets to be able to extract the most value for our clients in using fixed income instruments. And now our cash and alternative platform are also attracting clients in this environment, seeking yield and alpha. So the bottom line is we expect the interest rate environment to continue until the Fed sees this signals, it's looking for an inflation and growth. And what this means is that money will be in motion as clients build portfolios with high-performing active investments alongside ETFs and private market strategies. And this is really important because we will be the beneficiary of the fact that clients are using both. And in fact, 9 of the 10 top global asset managers use iShares for liquidity management, hedging and efficient tactical allocation. So it's no longer active or index, it's active and index and ETFs. And even when the markets stabilize, fixed income is going to be back in demand in a significant way. And I think we're going to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of that active movement into the asset class. Operator : Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : So I know we've talked many times in the past, but if you look at the last 12 months, you have 3% organic asset growth and flat base fee growth. I mean I think that's a function of where the flows are going, but I wonder if you could talk about index and ETF in versus active equity out and more of what your outlook is on the core underlying pricing? Martin Small : Hi, Glenn. It's Martin. Thanks for the question. In 2022, we delivered positive organic base fee growth despite the most challenging market environment our industry has ever seen. As Rob mentioned, the S&P was down 19% on the year, the [Ag] (ph) was down 13% on the year and we still drove industry-leading organic growth and positive base fee growth. And I'd say the first quarter here of 2023 was no different. You had a stressed market, you had a lot of volatility and BlackRock still delivered $110 billion of total net flows and 1% organic base fee growth.  Our mission, our aim, our strategy is not to be the fastest grower in any quarter. Our aim is to deliver organic growth that's more differentiated, more consistent through market cycles over the long term. Glenn, we've done that. We've had 5% organic base fee growth on average over the last five years, '18 to '22. We had over 5% organic base fee growth in seven of the last 10 years. And I think what's really important to look at is in these years that have been marked by exceptional market volatility, like '16, '18 and 2022, we still were able to deliver positive base fee growth. And I think when you sort of look at the flows going forward, the first quarter always has the seasonal element to it that has ETF tax trading, where we have precision exposures that are really important growing asset bases over time. But we tend to see inflows into precision exposures in the fourth quarter related to ETF and mutual fund dynamics and then we tend to see some reversals of those flows in the first quarter from precision exposures. Those tend to come at higher fee rates and a lot of the flows that come from outsourcing on fixed income come at slightly lower fee rates. And I think that's some of the impact that you saw this quarter, which is really just about changing risk preferences. We don't manage to a fee rate and we don't manage to a particular set of products with the clients. It's about obviously winning mind share in portfolios. And so I think over time, you'll continue to see good solid growth there. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : I was hoping we get a little bit deeper into how the events in the banking space over the last several weeks changed the opportunity set for BlackRock. There's a number of benefits. As you mentioned, there are some obvious things like cash management, but what does that mean for Aladdin? What does it mean for advisory? What does it mean for all? Just I was hoping to get more perspective on what are the opportunities you look to lean into more on the back of this dislocation? Laurence Fink : Well, let me start on a more holistic response to that. And that is our fundamental belief that more and more economic activities in a flow through the capital markets. And we certainly witness that in February, in March and continue in April. As more and more deposits are leaving and they're going into ETFs and into any form of cash and money market funds. And this type of dislocation is just going to create more and more opportunities for us. And in my talk, I spoke about what this means for Aladdin, the need during market uncertainty, the need for having a single base technology platform to help you navigate instantaneous with the market is more and more necessary. I think, again, our FMA advice is another good example of us working with regulators, policymakers working with our clients and helping them in terms of advising them. So just more and more opportunities. But I would also say on a more holistic basis, over the first 35 years, we've used market dislocations as a mechanism to relook at our own footprint, to review how we should be positioned for the future. We will continue to be very opportunistic on that and look for opportunities in a very disciplined way. I've talked about repeatedly expanding our footprint, expanding our product offerings, having better and deeper and more extensive technology utilization. So all of those things are something that we are looking at across the board. But I look at the issues that we are seeing today, the market dislocations as enormous opportunities for BlackRock. And yes, our relationship with our clients, the depth of the conversations we're having and the consistency of conversations and I think it's pretty imperative to talk about having $1.8 trillion over the last five years of asset growth. This is happening during good markets and bad markets, the consistency in which clients are looking for BlackRock to play a deeper and broader role because of our fiduciary standards, our advice, our discipline. But I would just say that the uniqueness of our platform, Alex, resonates -- resonated so loud in the first quarter, having Aladdin having, having FMA, having the iShares platform integrated with our active platform across the board that we can deliver a more holistic, a deeper, a broader response to our clients to our policymakers, to our regulators. No firm can provide that. And it's -- and the conversations that we had as a firm with our clients, with our regulators, with our policymakers worldwide was more frequent, more resilient than ever before. All of this is an opportunity for us an opportunity to build those deeper relationships and opportunity for more and more clients to see how their business can become more resilient if they took on Aladdin, opportunities for us to help them redesign their portfolios using FMA or helping out a regulator during times of stress. So I'm constantly reminded the depth of a range of products, the range of our abilities is so differentiated, which leads to these very unique and more fulsome conversations that we have with clients worldwide. Operator? Operator : We'll go next to Bill Katz with Credit Suisse. William Katz : Martin, congrats on the new role. Larry, could you talk maybe expand a little bit more in terms of the capital market opportunity with maybe greater specificity as it relates to the private markets. And then also, as you think about your money market platform or your cash management platform, my sense has always been more institutional skewed. Where are you in terms of the retail opportunity? And in both the private credit and the money market side, are you scaled enough organically? Or could this be an opportunity to sort of expand the inorganic opportunity as well? Laurence Fink : I'm going to let Rob talk about the organic and then I will talk about some of the inorganic. Robert Kapito : So we have, over the years, as you know, built up a huge credit effort with analysts and teams that are pursuing opportunities. Our large reach because of our ownership of many of stock of our clients and other entities gives us some pretty good insight and we need to follow these credits. We think that working closely together with them as they're expanding their businesses gives us insight and opportunities to work with them on the private credit side. And also, it gives us opportunities to work with them as they build out either the infrastructure that they have as they transition their businesses into new opportunities, we can be right there with them, helping them to finance that. So we think we're going to see and be able to source opportunities for our clients both retail and institutional, but other global asset managers are not going to see. So that spans not only the private credit universe, the investment-grade credit universe, but it also expands new asset classes that will be in infrastructure which are great long-duration assets that have a yield for our retail clients and then as well as other private investment opportunities. So we're really well positioned for this, and we're looking to take advantage of that and we have to clients. When it comes to inorganic, I'll turn it over to Larry to comment on that. Laurence Fink : Inorganic, I look at the things that we've done in the past by expanding our products in a range, whether it was eFront and transformed Aladdin into a platform that is both unique and differentiated because it's both public and private markets. I look at what we did with Aperio in terms of wealth management and the opportunity we have in tax strategies and direct indexing. I look at Cachematrix and how that played a role with our money market funds in the last few months. And so it is through inorganic opportunities that we look at if we can expand our footprint. As I said in my prepared remarks, we are asking ourselves to reimagine BlackRock. What are the other big opportunities? Should there be a big opportunity as more and more organizations use technology, how can we double down on what we're doing with Aladdin technology? How can we build out our footprint globally at this time? And so we're looking across the board as there are issues. We -- I believe BlackRock can play a role in some of these opportunities. And I think there was a quote sometime in the last few weeks about something I said to our team, I don't know where it came from. But indeed, I did say it, I said to be in the game, we must play the game. And so we're in the game. We're across the board working with our clients across the board. We're working with policymakers across the board. We are working with regulators worldwide. And we're here to help. We're here to advice. We're here to navigate. And through all that, there is an opportunity for something inorganic and transformational. We're going to be prepared to do something like that, but I'll just leave it at that. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the amount of time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks? Laurence Fink : Yes. Thank you, operator. I'm going to thank all of you for joining us this morning. I know today is a really busy day, especially with all the other banks and financial institutions reported today. So I'm very, very happy that you've taken this time and your interest in BlackRock. Hopefully, you heard from Martin and Rob and I, how proud we are, the way BlackRock came together and supporting our clients in the most recent quarter. But the consistency of BlackRock now over the last 35 years, clients have been central to everything we do. And I see I just a tremendous opportunity for us, probably I see more opportunities now for BlackRock than I have in the last few years. As Rob talked about, opportunities in fixed income. Our investments that we've made, the huge investments we made in technology, the huge investments we made in bond ETFs, the huge investments we are making in alternatives and private credit. All of this is allowing us to have a differentiating opportunity. And if you overlay that with what we have done with our technology in Aladdin overlaying what we have done with FMA and our unique position with ETFs, it just gives us a tremendous opportunity ahead of us. And I would double down on the idea that we're going to be focus on delivering the power of our platform to our clients. And that power of working with our clients will translate totally directly to you, our shareholders. And I want to thank everybody for all the support.  Being at Hudson Yards is invigorating. I must tell you the 4,000 employees we have in New York are invigorated by our new space to light the energy, the opportunity. Hopefully, that's translating into how we do our business with our clients every day. Thank you, everyone. Have a good quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

I'd like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Martin S. Small; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference. Christopher Meade : Good morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may of course differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So with that, I will turn it over to Martin. Martin Small : Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the second quarter of 2023. Before I turn it over to Larry, I will review our financial performance and business results. Our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as adjusted financial results. I'll be focusing primarily on our as adjusted results. As a reminder, beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we updated our definitions of as adjusted operating income, operating margin, nonoperating income, and net income. The adjustments exclude the compensation expense impact of mark-to-market volatility associated with certain deferred cash compensation plans and the non-operating impact of an economic hedge, which the company began in 2023. Clients entrusted BlackRock with an industry-leading $190 billion of net inflows in the first half of 2023. Our $9.4 trillion in assets, 9.4 trillion units of trust are up over $830 billion since year end. This increase reflects continued strong organic growth and ongoing client confidence in the work that BlackRock is doing on their behalf as markets evolve. Clients choose BlackRock for performance. We delivered durable long-term investment performance by executing on alpha opportunities, sourcing unique deals and managing risk. The foundation of a market-leading asset management platform is comprehensive, high-quality investment products, with strong long-term investment performance. Investors and asset owners choose portfolio goals and BlackRock enables them through our investment products and solutions. This is BlackRock's platform as a service and action. We bring together the entire firm to combine investment technology and portfolio servicing capabilities to meet client's specific business needs. Our diversified platform strategy backed by strong performance is powering our differentiated industry-leading organic growth. It's widening our gross premium as clients choose to do more with BlackRock, while much of the Asset Management sector faces continued outflows. Clients are coming to BlackRock for performance in scale, using our platform as a service to streamline and support the growth and commercial agility of their own businesses. This is leading to clients consolidating more of their portfolios with BlackRock and both first half and second quarter net inflows were positive across regions, client types, and active and index. In the second quarter, BlackRock generated total net inflows of $80 billion, representing 4% annualized organic asset growth and 2% annualized organic base fee growth. Second quarter revenue of $4.5 billion was 1% lower year-over-year, primarily driven by the impact of market movements over the last 12 months on average AUM mix. Operating income of $1.7 billion was down 3% year-over-year, while earnings per share of $9.28 was up 26%, reflecting meaningfully higher non-operating income compared to a year ago. Non-operating results for the quarter included $158 million of net investment gains, driven primarily by non-cash mark-to-market gains in the value of our private-equity co-investment portfolio. Our as adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 25%. We continue to estimate that 25% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2023. The actual effective tax rate may differ because of non-recurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation. Second quarter base fee and securities lending revenue of $3.6 billion was down 2% year-over-year and reflected the impact of underperformance on non-U.S. equity markets and fixed income market movements on our average AUM, partially offset by higher securities lending revenue. Sequentially, base fee and securities lending revenue was up 3%, reflecting higher average AUM and securities lending revenue and the impact of one additional day in the second quarter. On an equivalent day count basis, our annualized effective fee rate was 0.2 basis points lower compared to the first quarter, mainly due to divergent equity beta and changing client risk preferences. Performance fees of $118 million increased from a year ago, primarily reflecting higher revenue from illiquid alternatives. Business momentum remains strong across our technology platform with clients turning to Aladdin for business transformation and scale enablement. Clients are increasingly partnering with BlackRock for integrated technology solutions and approximately half of our year-to-date mandates have been across multiple technology offerings such as combining eFront with core Aladdin. Quarterly technology services revenue was up 8% compared to a year ago, reflecting this demand but also the impact of negative fixed income market movements over the last 12 months on client positions on Aladdin. Sequential Technology revenue reflected the successful completion of integrations for several large clients that went live on Aladdin in the second quarter. Annual Contract Value or ACV increased 8% year-over-year. We remain committed to low-to-mid-teens ACV growth over the long-term driven by demand for Aladdin's broadening technology capabilities and the growing value proposition it represents for clients. Total expense was modestly lower year-over-year. Lower incentive compensation and distribution and servicing costs were partially offset by higher direct fund expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was flat year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower incentive compensation due to lower operating income, offset by higher base compensation. Direct fund expense increased 13% year-over-year and 9% sequentially as a result of higher rebates in the prior year quarter and higher average index AUM. G&A expense was flat year-over-year, partially due to timing of planned investment spend. Our second quarter as adjusted operating margin of 42.5% was down 120 basis points from a year ago, reflecting the negative impact of market movements on quarterly revenue. Our platform strategy has delivered scale and operating leverage through time with 240 basis points of margin expansion in the last 10 years. Markets have improved since the end of 2022 and we aim to be disciplined in driving profitable growth by prioritizing investments to propel our differentiated organic growth and operating leverage. In line with our guidance in January at present, we would expect our headcount to be broadly flat in 2023. We would also expect a mid-to-high single-digit percentage increase in 2023 core G&A expense. Our capital management strategy remains first to invest in our business and then to return excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We continue to invest through prudent use of our balance sheet to best position BlackRock for sustained success, primarily through seed and co-investments to support organic growth. At times, we may make inorganic investments where we see an opportunity to accelerate growth and support our strategic initiatives. Consistent with this inorganic strategy last month, we announced the private markets acquisition and a minority investment as part of a technology partnership. We expect our acquisition of Kreos Capital to close in the third quarter of this year, adding venture debt capabilities and further bolstering BlackRock's Global Credit franchise. Through our technology partnership with Avaloq, we aim to link Aladdin Wealth and Avaloq's core banking system, which will ultimately scale both businesses and better serve joint clients. We repurchased $375 million worth of common shares in the second quarter. At present, based on our capital spending plans for the year and subject to market conditions, we still anticipate repurchasing at least $375 million of shares per quarter for the balance of the year, consistent with our previous guidance in January. In May, we capitalized on the improved conditions for debt issuance, issuing $1.25 billion of 10-year debt at a coupon of 4.75%. We expect to invest the proceeds of the offering at substantially the same rate as the cost of borrowing, effectively eliminating incremental cost of carrying additional debt in 2023. Our ambition is to be the cloud of investment management and technology We organized around three key principles, access, expertise, and service, to deliver value to our clients. Our platform strategy backed by these three principles drove $80 billion of total net inflows in the second quarter. Broadening adoption of iShares ETFs by asset managers, insurance companies, and wealth managers fueled net inflows of $48 billion in the second quarter, led by fixed income ETF net inflows of $35 billion. Our iShares range to unlocking client demand by providing efficient and expanded access to broad swaths and finer slices of the bond market. Retail net inflows of $4 billion were led by strength in index SMAs through Aperio and broad-based net inflows into active fixed income. BlackRock's institutional franchise generated $5 billion of net inflows in the second quarter. We're partnering with clients across their whole portfolio and our clients are leveraging our scaled advisory asset allocation, OCIO, and technology services. Institutional active net inflows of $9 billion included demand for customized LifePath Target-date mandates and illiquid alternatives. Private markets continue to scale in the quarter. Net inflows of $3 billion represented 10% annualized organic asset growth and were led by private credit and infrastructure. We have approximately $30 billion of non-fee paying committed capital to deploy in a variety of alternative strategies, representing a significant source of future base and performance fees. Finally, cash management net inflows of $23 billion in the second quarter were led by U.S. government money market funds. We're actively working with clients on their liquidity management strategy, providing technology, market and operational insights, and of course, a full range of cash management capabilities. Looking ahead, we see significant opportunity to grow our market share and consolidate our position with clients as they choose to do more with BlackRock. We're the only asset manager delivering platform as a service. We believe our platform strategy will continue to deliver for both our clients and shareholders resulting in sustained market-leading organic growth and differentiated operating leverage over time. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry. Laurence Fink : Thank you, Martin, and good morning to everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Throughout our history BlackRock has been serving clients, we listen to them, we deliver to them as a fiduciary, and we evolve our capabilities to help them achieve their long-term outcomes across market regimes. We bring together the entire firm as a platform to deliver client outcomes. That's the defining factor of BlackRock's differentiated and industry-leading leadership. As many of you have heard at our Investor Day last month, we are building the sole platform strategy in asset management that brings together product, services, and technology to solve our clients' investment in technology needs. We envision BlackRock to be the Investment Manager Cloud for asset managers and for asset owners. BlackRock's industry-leading results reflect our clients continued confidence in our long-term performance. We are delivering sustained organic growth and base fee growth even as the traditional asset management industry logs persistent outflows. BlackRock generated $190 billion of total net inflows in the first half of 2023, including $80 billion in the second quarter, reflecting positive flows from wealth and institutional clients across regions. We grew technology services revenues and ACV as clients leverage Aladdin to support our investment processes fees. And we again delivered strong margin for our shareholders. Our scaled platform and technology allows us to invest for future growth, while maintaining a differentiated margin, which we expanded in seven of the last 10 years. Organic growth combined with positive markets and foreign exchange movements had led to an over $830 billion increase in BlackRock's AUM in the first six months of 2023. And as I speak with clients, I hear all their expectations of asset managers are expanding. It's why clients are doing more business with fewer managers. Clients are seeking a broad range of integrated services alongside a strong performance track record to help them achieve their desired outcomes. Clients value BlackRock's unparalleled breadth and investment strategies, which span regions, index, and active in both public and private markets, and are confident in our ability to deliver the investment performance they need through durable alpha and active proprietary deal flow in private markets or proper index tracking of ETFs. Through our diversification and strong performance, we can help clients better match their long-dated liabilities, achieve their operational objectives, and streamline their processes. This better enables them to address the needs of their own stakeholders. Today, client conversations more often move beyond products, they're about portfolios, they're about business transformation, and how they could benefit from BlackRock's platform scale. That evolution from product to portfolio to platform creates enormous growth potential for BlackRock and we are intentionally organizing ourselves around our clients, which helps ensure the one BlackRock we deliver is greater than any one part of the organization. Investors are facing a complex landscape of competing fiscal and monetary policies, with a number of structural forces shaping returns now and over the long-term, these forces include a fragmented geopolitical landscape, causing rewiring supply chains, a transition to a lower carbon economy, and the aging population in the developed world, all of which are likely to be inflationary over time. This year U.S. equity market rally has been fueled by just a few technology firms and hope that artificial intelligence will gain widespread adoption. I believe AI has a huge potential to enhance productivity and transform margins across sectors. It may be a technology that could bring down inflation, but in the meantime, potential banks continue to face a sharp tradeoff between living with some inflation and/or damaging economic activity. Against this backdrop, clients are turning to BlackRock to provide insights to help them manage risks, to capture new opportunities, and to implement enterprise technologies. Clients are choosing BlackRock for our platform, combination of technology, and advisory alongside ETF, active investing, and private market capabilities. Our ETF platform and franchise cuts horizontally across client's products in the market ecosystem to provide access to the expanding world of investments. BlackRock captured the number one share of ETF industry flows in the second quarter of 2023, generating $48 billion of net inflows. These industry-leading net inflows was led by continued demand for iShares bond ETFs and we aim for our bond ETF AUM to more than triple to $2.5 trillion by 2030. This is not just because of the generational opportunities in fixed income, but because bond ETFs are also delivering benefits such as access, transparency, and liquidity to both institutional and wealth clients at an accelerating pace. BlackRock will continue to drive bond ETF innovation and growth as the bond market modernizes and as investors moved to capture significant opportunities in fixed income. Our ETF business is evolving to increase access to all kinds of markets more efficiently with more transparency and more conveniently than ever before. We recently completed the largest global ETF launch in history with two transition focus ETFs. The launch is another example of our commitment to provide choice and access to our clients through the breadth of our leading transition and ETF capabilities. The ETF launch was nearly $3 billion in seed capital as we connected with BlackRock to execute on innovative client solution. Our clients are also focused on outcomes and this manifests in the portfolio blending active index private markets and cash. We often talk about how index ETFs are being used actively by all types of investors and active managers are increasingly leveraging the many benefits of ETF wrapper. In May, we launched two active ETFs led by Rick Rieder and Tony DeSpirito. These ETFs will be great tools for clients and to advisors to gain access to our active insights within our ETF structure. Clients choose BlackRock for performance. This is across multiple dimensions, including investment performance, client service and operational excellence. Across our active franchise, BlackRock has delivered durable investment performance with 81% and 90% of our fundamental equities and taxable fixed income AUM above benchmark or peer medium for the last five years. Our global connectivity, our scale, our technology, our market access position, possesses us to deliver the alpha our clients need. Our expertise in portfolio construction and asset allocation, combined with strong investment performance has as differentiated BlackRock in the market. We saw $73 billion of active net inflows in the first half of 2023 compared to active industry outflows. We're also unlocking opportunities for clients in private markets, where we have $30 billion of committed capital and we're growing in private markets organically through new launches, scaling of our successor funds, and at times, we will execute our inorganic transactions to further expand our capabilities and global reach. To this end, we recently announced our planned acquisition of Kreos Capital, a leading provider of venture debt financing in Europe. When we talk to clients about their private market allocations, the number one thing they're looking for is, they select the manager's proprietary differentiated deal flow. BlackRock's global network of relationships, our data and analytics, and flexible adaptable capital means we could source unique deals for our clients. In doing so, we deliver value for our clients and our fund portfolio companies. Our long-term private capital team acquisition of Creed in May 2020 is excellent example of the outcomes that can be achieved due to the strength of our proprietary sourcing, our proprietary underwriting, and value-creation capabilities. LTPC acquired Creed during the depths of the COVID lockdown, and last month we announced that they had entered in agreement to sell the company to a strategic buyer, Kering Beaute. The LTPC team had the conviction that Creed was an extraordinary business with multiple levers for value-creation that would help accelerate growth even during the pandemic. And with the last month's agreement, the fund is expected to realize significant offer for our clients. I find more often than now that company is one BlackRock as a trusted investor and a trusted partner. BlackRock is a long-term friendly capital with global client relationships. We invest early and we can stay invested through cycles whether it's debt or equity or a pre-IPO through post-IPO. Companies recognize the uniqueness of our global reach, our brand, and our expertise across markets and industries. We are a valued partner to these clients and companies want to work with BlackRock and this enables our proprietary origination. We are tapping into our deal flow across our private markets asset classes and especially focusing on credit and infrastructure. Our connectivity across the real economy is bringing benefits to both clients and the communities in which our underlying investment projects operate. As I meet with clients around the world. I hear how our profile is strengthening in local markets as a result of our leadership in infrastructure investing. In the United States, we partnered with AT&T and GigaPower JV and invested in Jupiter Power, which operates one of the largest battery storage fleets in Texas. And our relationships around the world continue to expand our reach in new ways, this is evident from our most recent investments, whether it's FirstAir in South Korea or Akaysha Energy, which is building the world's largest grid-scale battery storage facility, the Waratah battery in Australia. These are just a few examples. Our growing profile from these investments is leading to more and larger deal opportunities, which will deliver growth for BlackRock clients and to you, our shareholders. The portfolio of the future is outcome-oriented, customized, and seamlessly combined public and private markets. BlackRock is the only company that can offer both the portfolio investments in technology through eFront and Aladdin. Aladdin is bringing the portfolio of the future to life by providing technology in a digital-enabled and customized way. Combining risk management, the investment book of record, performance, accounting, and data, all in one place. Market volatility and growing cost pressures and complexities in optimizing whole portfolios underscore the need of enterprise operating and risk management technology. The value of Aladdin's integrated end-to-end technology platform is resonating. In the same way that clients are consolidating their portfolios with fewer asset managers, clients are looking to do much more with Aladdin. And over the last 12 months, 40% of our new annual contract value came from the expansion of existing relationships. And I'm pleased to say that our retention rates remain very high at 98%. We're not only expanding Aladdin's capabilities, we're also tackling bigger addressable markets by extending into adjacent offerings. We're enabling a whole portfolio ecosystem, empowering clients through data and opening Aladdin to drive even more innovation. We are creating deep integration with ecosystem providers and third-party technology solutions. Our recently announced partnership with Avaloq is the latest example. We are engineering Aladdin for the future and as clients look to do more with fewer partners, our SaaS technology business will enable greater agility for clients in delivering higher recurring revenues for our shareholders. Aladdin and Aladdin Wealth are increasingly core components of outsourcing relationships. Our success across a number of significant outsource solutions over the past several years are catalyzing a dialog with more and more clients. I recognize the headline multibillion-dollar mandates get much of the attention, but we're bringing our expertise to clients in all segments, not just large pension funds or insurers, but also wealth managers and charities and endowments and family offices. Second quarter results including continued momentum in institutional and wealth outsourcing, particularly in family office models, NSA -- SMAs, and last week, Quintet Private Bank announced, they selected BlackRock to provide an expanded set of investment solutions, advisory solutions, and risk management and technology. This is another example of how clients are turning to BlackRock as they scale and they grow their own business and we help them do that. Whether it's asset management or technology with a multitude of other industries, clients are consolidating their relationships and moving to platforms that provide strong performance and integrated services. BlackRock intentionally invested and built our business model to be in the forefront of this trend and this is resonating in our results, as clients increasingly turn to BlackRock for performance and for our platform services. Prior entity leading results and momentum are a direct result of our dedicated employees and leadership team. Our success over the last 35 years has been built on the steadfast commitment to operate as one BlackRock, fully connected to our clients on one platform with one culture using one technology. It is our leadership team that is delivering the power of this hyper-connected platform to our clients. We have leaders make us a hyper-connected team. The collaboration and their horizontal leadership are essential to our success and growth. As I said at our Investor Day, I'm not planning to leave BlackRock anytime soon, but my goal as always been to ensure that when Rob Kapito and I move on, the future is even in better hands than it is today, and I am confident we are going to achieve that. In building this company, we have always taken a long-term view and our approach in developing our leadership talent is no different. BlackRock's Board and I are highly focused on identifying and developing our next generation of leaders. We also seek to align their long-term interest with those of our shareholders, our clients, and one another who shared incentives that reward long-term value-creation. A key part of this ongoing initiative is the recent issuance of a one-time long-term equity incentive grant for a small group of leaders. Featuring extended vesting periods, these awards represent a key long-term strategic investment in the success and stability of BlackRock's leadership plans and as we execute our platform as a service strategy. Our goal is that these grants will help promote in continued collaborative long-term performance culture between our leaders across our horizontal leadership capabilities and for many years to come. To close, I want to underscore that we are in the very early days of a long-term shift in client consolidation, other investment managers, the technology requirements towards a more comprehensive platform. In the same way that organizations have traditioned from on-site data to hardware to cloud providers, many clients are now transitioning from in-house investment in technology models to BlackRock. For years, we have focused on delivering one BlackRock to our clients with horizontal connectivity, integrated services, and a strong performance. I truly believe this is the future of investing and BlackRock is the forefront. I believe we're in one of the most exciting times in BlackRock's history. I can say very clearly that both Rob and I are energized by these new examples that we see every day and how we are delivering value for all of our BlackRock stakeholders. Thank you, and let's open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Laurence Fink : Hi, Craig. How are you? Craig Siegenthaler : Hi, good morning, Larry. I'm good, hope everyone is doing well. Laurence Fink : Yes. Craig Siegenthaler : So I have a two-parter on the potential for large bond reallocation. We actually haven't seen any big reallocations yet outside the money market fund business and bond ETFs, so do you expect these two products see the most dominant drivers of flows sales? And then also from your recent conversations with large institutions and retail platforms, do you believe most investors are waiting just given that the Fed will likely still raise rates a couple of times? Laurence Fink : Craig, let me have Rob answer that one. Robert Kapito : So, Craig, the two answers are yes and yes. And that is because, currently yields are back, but I think in general, most people think that yields are going to continue to rise. So they are preparing for, what I would call, a generational change in the fixed income market. Because you can actually earn attractive yields without taking much duration or credit risk. And if you go back clients shifted towards illiquid investments over the last decade to get those returns, but while there is still demand for the private markets to diversify and pursue outperformance, investors as you know, can get most of that yield and their liabilities and meet them through bonds and we are so well-positioned for that both with our $3.4 trillion fixed income and cash platform. So to give you some numbers, 80% of all fixed income is now yielding over 4%. This is a pretty remarkable shift in our history. We're calling this a once-in-a-generation opportunity. There is finally income to be earned in the fixed-income market and we are expecting a resurgence in demand. Now, you touched on something very important, the cash market, this is not the last stop for that cash and there are trillions now. I think the number is around $7 trillion in money market accounts that is ready when people feel that rates have peaked to flood the fixed income market and we need to position ourselves to capture that. How do you do that? One is by product and the other is by performance. And we saw positive fixed-income mutual fund flows in the quarter, led by our high-yield total return and muni franchises, we have strong long-term investment performance with 90% of taxable fixed-income AUM above the benchmark or peer median for the five-year period. So with strong performance, a diversified product offering, we're just in the right spot to take active fixed-income share as investors look to capitalize on these opportunities for alpha in the bond market. I wanted to add one other point about fixed income. We anticipate that bond ETFs are going to be used alongside of our top-performing active offerings. And I know that, because in the first half of the year, we saw $12 billion in active fixed-income net inflows alongside of $68 billion from bond ETFs. So, on the active side, we believe there is finally an opportunity for alpha and that hasn't been there as much as it is in many years. So keep in mind, bond ETFs are also increasingly being used by active managers for liquidity management, hedging, and efficient tactical asset allocation. And in fact, nine of the top 10 global asset managers now use iShares. And then lastly, we have over 450 bond ETF choices, which is more than five times the next largest issuer diversified across exposures and the yield curve. We also have the most diversified client base, including Wealth Advisors, Active Managers, Insurance Companies, Pensions, and other institutions. And lastly, through the capital markets expertise here, we're advising clients on new use cases for bond ETFs, such as replacing more expensive futures or swaps as cash and liquidity instruments and as tools for large-scale portfolio transitions. So the answer is yes and yes. In the iShares fixed-income ETFs, we had leading industry flows now $35 billion in the second quarter. So this is one of the biggest opportunities that we have in front of us and we believe we're going to be able to capture those opportunities. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Laurence Fink : Good morning, Michael. Michael Cyprys : Hi, good morning. Question on private markets. If we go back to Investor Day, you guys spoke about doubling base fees in private markets over the next five years, so I was hoping you might be able to help unpack the drivers of that and where might there be scope for upside such as with new products at a more meaningful scaling up your existing strategies? Laurence Fink : I want to give that to Martin. Martin Small : Great. Thanks, Michael, how are you? I'd start with clients, which is the client need for income and uncorrelated returns in a higher inflation world with more volatile public equities, we think that will continue to drive demand for alternatives. And most definitely, we saw that in our BlackRock Global Private market survey that we recently completed, over half the clients said that they expect to increase their allocations to private markets and alternatives. We think we're really well-positioned there. We've built a comprehensive platform As you heard from Edwin on Investor Day, provides exposures across all our liquid alternative asset classes, and we're really well-positioned as a multi-alternatives provider. Larry talked a bit about some of the differentiated sourcing and access to high quality opportunities that we've had, our ability to integrate private markets investing with technology with eFront and Aladdin, we really think that that's a great opportunity for us as we move forward. Our platform is over $150 billion in private markets today. In the second quarter, we had 10% organic growth on illiquid, which we think is good strong growth. We talked to you about adding nearly $2 billion of base and performance fees in 2022 and our fundraising has actually held up pretty well since 2021. We've raised over $85 billion of gross capital. And I think, where some of the upside is, is really I think, one in private credit and infrastructure. We've built really strong leading franchises and we see good growth there in the next three to five years in private credit as banks potentially become more constrained in lending. We think investors will turn more to private credit for financing, and if you like those yields in the low-interest rate environment, I think investors will find them even more compelling in a more normalized rate environment. And then also some of these extraordinary government stimulus and tax incentives that I think are following the Inflation Reduction Act, similar moves I believe coming in Europe are going to be, I think strong secular tailwinds for infrastructure. Last thing I'd just say is, there's upside on product innovation, which is, one, we've already done some really compelling innovating in decarbonization, both in sourcing deals and in raising assets in this space. We've launched a number of non-traded products across private credit, real-estate debt, and 40 Act private equity into retail and wealth channels. And I think the next horizon for us is to think about how to integrate these things in positions of strength in BlackRock like model portfolios. How do you really build that portfolio of the future that Larry referenced that's public, private, digital, tax managed, those are the places where we see real, real upside for BlackRock. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Mike Brown with KBW. Laurence Fink : Hi, Mike. Michael Brown : Hi, good morning, everyone. I just wanted to talk about the expectation for expenses this year, so obviously, equity markets have been up year-to-date, S&P is up over 17%, and that's provided a nice boost for AUM. How do you guys think about the earnings power today in the context of BlackRock's expense base and your investment priorities? Have you already planned to allocate more dollars towards investment in the platform and other people tanker capabilities? Laurence Fink : Martin. Martin Small : Thanks, Mike, appreciate it. So let's start with our industry-leading organic growth, it's been the result of exactly what you flagged. I think really disciplined investments that we've consistently made through market cycles and we tried to obviously be financially flexible, so that even in sort of the most uncertain markets we continue playing offense and come out even stronger. We have a really strong track record I think of making good investments and deliberating -- delivering a differentiated operating margin. We obviously had a 42.5% operating margin over the longer-term. We've expanded our as adjusted margin in the last seven to 10 years. And even in 2022, as I talked about on Investor Day, Mike, we expanded our margin by 240 basis points over the last decade. Those results I think are really well above the large-cap peers. We've seen a good amount of margin contraction over the same period. But as you're flagging, in the first half of the year, here we've seen $830 billion increase in AUM. We're now at $9.4 trillion, and obviously, the move in markets has an impact or can have an impact on our operating margin in a meaningful way. And as markets recover, I think we expect to see our revenue growth outpace growth in discretionary expense items and be accretive to operating margin. I think some of the real actions are investing for growth in the most efficient way possible. Like we're going to continue to drive more fixed-cost scale through technology. Rob Goldstein talked about at Investor Day, our opportunities for Aladdin icing offs with eFront, which we think can drive more scale. Larry talked a bit about sourcing. I think we can drive more systematized and efficient differentiated sourcing through our BlackRock Capital Markets team. And then when you think about some of these technology integrations that we've done, whether it's Avaloq, Envestnet, those drive a lot of scale and their investments that really drive differentiated operating organic growth. So, we see great opportunities. We have no change in our expense guidance. We expect to finish the year, as I said, broadly flat in headcount and with G&A. up mid-to-high single-digits. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Laurence Fink : Hi, Ken. Ken Worthington : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Good morning. Cash management flows were strong this quarter, so maybe two questions here. First, the SEC launched updated money market rules this week, any reaction to the new rules and the implications for the U.S. Money Fund business? And then second, how enthusiastic are you about the longer-term growth prospects for cash management? Your response to Craig's question earlier suggested that cash in some cases is a placeholder for assets that are going to move to fixed income products when the shape of the yield curve changes, can cash management grow as that transition is taking place? Laurence Fink : Rob? Robert Kapito : So, you know, we're supportive of any efforts to improve the resiliency and transparency of U.S. Money Market Funds, but non-government institutional money market funds which were really the main focus of the rules are a very small part of our cash business, ours is U.S. government funds and separate accounts, that's really the bulk of our assets. And of course, we have a diverse set of cash offerings including money market funds and separate accounts, ETFs. ETF is another short-duration strategy. So we're going to work together with our clients as they consider the best tools for their liquidity management and we will continue to review the regulatory rules to see what impact that could have on our business, which I think is quite limited. But remember, in asset allocation and when there's money in motion, it moves to cash, it moves to longer-term assets, it's something you must have as a liquidity tool to do all the things that clients need to do. And since we're going to be I think a beneficiary of the long-term assets, going after corporations and treasury management and other institutions for their cash, puts us in the game in a much better way than if they're just coming into our products from the outside. So it's an important business for us. It also is a business which has to do with performance and it also has to do with quality. And as you've seen issues in the banking industry and other issues in the markets, people look for the high-quality and they look for the brand, and we have that. So we're very optimistic and we will continue to really build our sales force to continue to be a leader in the cash management business, knowing that it's also going to lead to other opportunities for us. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Laurence Fink : Hi, Brain. Brian Bedell : Hi, good morning. Maybe just to focus a little bit on transition management, you talked a lot about this at Investor Day and I just wanted to sort of think about the timing in organic growth potential. I mean, you definitely have one of the most unique capabilities across multi-product areas in this endeavor, and obviously, we're going to see the pace of global spending on this almost double to nearly $4 trillion per annum between the debt part of it, in particular, direct lending and venture debt and your Kreos acquisition, how quickly do you think you can put all of that together and significantly expand I think the $17 billion that you have right now in transition private markets? Is it a build that can happen as early as sort of in the next couple of quarters or is this more like '24, '25? Robert Kapito : Well, first of all, thanks for the question. I think the transition investing is probably one of the greatest opportunities in the world today. The dialogs that we're having with governments worldwide. Very unique. There's not a government that is not focus on this, especially for countries that are dependent on importation of power. They're all looking for different ways across-the-board in terms of how do they successfully navigate their economy. Energy and power is becoming one of the dominant conversations and then through the United States, IRA. We are seeing just huge interests with. U.S and non-U.S companies. Coming into the United States and take advantage of the opportunities that present to us in terms of elevated returns because the IRA. And so we look at this as a multi-year growth opportunity. We are working. We announced. As I said earlier, my talk about the Acacia energy the largest. Battery storage capability in the world. And that just has set us. And the conversations we're having with other countries related to that type of activity, it's becoming. Is becoming much conversational component of what we're doing. So we look at this, is it a significant, we're talking 10s and 10s of trillions of dollars. Market opportunity. Now if you overlay. More-and-more issues around debt to GDP in more-and-more countries, more-and-more countries are going to have to look to private capital. It cannot be funded by the public sector. And that is one of the great positioning opportunity for BlackRock relationships worldwide. We have that unique opportunity. Present with us. Two, as I talked about proprietary origination. We're having more-and-more conversations with more-and-more corporations and how do they think about their platform related to decarbonization and that we are we have deep and broad conversations with traditional energy companies and how are they going to be focused on sequestration of carbon, they own the geology. BlackRock already has one of the largest. Sequestration projects in the United States in Navigators CO2. And that is another good example and it is those type of reference investments that are giving us greater and greater opportunity and. I do believe our positioning of our global platform, working with more-and-more governments talking about public-private types of investments. At the same time, working with corporations and how do they move forward, really gives us our unique opportunity for many-many years ahead. To be partnering with them. In terms of corporations, many shareholders are questioning how corporations should move forward some shareholders don't think they should move forward in that area. And then in that case some of the companies are asking us, can we co-invest with them. Some companies are looking to expand in various different ways and they did they just don't happen generation of capital to doing that to the speed in which they are looking-forward to doing that and so between our relationships. Companies with our broad relationships with governments, gives us a real opportunity to be one of the leaders in the transition, and I believe this is this is going to be a multi-year global opportunity for BlackRock. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks. Laurence Fink : Thank you, operator, and I want to thank all of you for joining us this morning. Continued interest in BlackRock. I am proud of what we've done as a firm and delivering value for our clients. Obviously, delivering value for our shareholders. The power of our connected platform and the collaboration and creativity of our leadership team. Will enable us to continue to deliver differentiating growth into the future for you, our shareholders. I want to thank you again for being part of the call and. I wish everyone have a very pleasant summer and a great quarter. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So with that I'll turn it over to Martin. Martin Small : Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the third quarter of 2023. Before I turn it over to Larry, I'll review our financial performance and business results. Our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I'll be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. Rate hikes over the last 18 months mean that for the first time in nearly 20 years, clients can earn a real return in cash. In the short-term, this has benefited many portfolios. Investors have been able to generate positive returns while waiting for inflation to cool and for more policy certainty from central bankers. This weighting has weighed on industry flows, including here at BlackRock, consistent with prior periods of policy uncertainty like 2013, 2016 and 2018. At September's Federal Reserve meeting, central bankers decided to pause, keeping the policy rate steady, but communicated forward guidance that interest rates will stay higher for longer. We think this is good news. It begins to offer investors more clarity about time frames and entry points into fixed income and equities and a path to re-risking global investment portfolios. At BlackRock, we never pause. We've used this period of investor portfolio redesign to stay close to our clients. We're providing insights, advice, and solutions to help clients prepare to deploy assets following greater certainty on markets, terminal rates, and the shape of the yield curve. Clients entrusted BlackRock with $193 billion of total net inflows in the first nine months of 2023, representing 3% annualized organic asset growth. While our clients' decisions to take advantage of safe haven cash as they redesign portfolios are reflected in our third quarter flows, clients are actively engaging to do more with BlackRock. We believe the long-term trend of clients consolidating business with fewer managers will be accelerated as a result of this period. Third quarter gross fund sales were 95% of average levels over the last 12 months, and flows would have been meaningfully positive excluding a $19 billion single client index redemption and $13 billion of market-related precision ETF net outflows, so client momentum remains strong. Today, we manage $9.1 trillion in assets for our clients. These units of trust are $1.1 trillion higher than a year ago. Revenue is 5% higher, operating income is up 7%, and earnings per share increased 14% over this time period. Powering these numbers are clients' increasing use of BlackRock as a platform and staying within our ecosystem of capabilities, combining investment, technology, and portfolio servicing to meet their specific business needs. This platform approach is driving our industry-leading organic growth over the long-term. Market fluctuations and client risk appetite may temporarily lift or lower our AUM and revenues. But our focus remains on delivering BlackRock's platform to clients, through access to unique opportunities, expertise, and world-class client service. Our strategy is working, and clients are choosing to build bigger relationships with BlackRock. We've grown our asset base over the long-term with over $1 trillion of net inflows since the start of 2021 and over $300 billion of that in just the last 12 months. We know our shareholders and clients have high expectations of BlackRock. We believe in our 5% organic base fee growth target over the long-term, and we challenge ourselves to envision what it takes to rise above that target. We've said before that we don't strive to be the fastest grower in any given quarter, but we continue to drive durable, consistent organic growth, well above our peer group over the long-term. Third quarter total net inflows were $3 billion and included $49 billion of lower fee institutional index equity redemptions driven by client-specific index allocation changes. Institutional index equity represents less than 3% of BlackRock's total base fees. These lower fee strategies are often only a portion of our clients' overall relationships with BlackRock. For example, results included in the $19 billion redemption from a single client, but the clients working with us to extend its mandates and active strategies. Total quarterly annualized organic base fee decay of 2% reflected net outflows from higher fee precision ETFs and redemptions in active equity and retail liquid alternatives offerings. Third quarter revenue of $4.5 billion was 5% higher year-over-year driven by organic growth, the impact of market and foreign exchange movements over the last 12 months on average AUM, and higher technology services revenue. Operating income of $1.7 billion was up 7% year-over-year. Earnings per share of $10.91, increased 14%, also reflecting a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by lower non-operating income compared to a year ago. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 12%, reflecting $215 million of discrete tax benefits associated with the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters. We continue to estimate that 25% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2023. The actual effective tax rate may differ because of nonrecurring or discrete items, or potential changes in tax legislation. Non-operating results for the quarter included $127 million of net investment gains, driven primarily by non-cash mark-to-market gains in the value of our private equity co-investment portfolio. Third quarter base fee and securities lending revenue of $3.7 billion increased 4% year-over-year, reflecting the positive impact of market beta and foreign exchange movements on average AUM, positive organic base fee growth, and higher securities lending revenue. Sequentially, base fee and securities lending revenue was up 2%. On an equivalent day count basis, our annualized effective fee rate was approximately two-tenths of one basis point lower compared to the second quarter. This was due to lower securities lending revenue, underperformance of non-US equity markets, and changing client risk preferences favoring risk off lower fee exposures. As a result of continued global equity and bond market depreciation toward the end of the third quarter, including the impact of FX-related dollar appreciation, we entered the fourth quarter with an estimated base fee run rate, approximately 3% lower than our total base fees for the third quarter. Performance fees of $70 million decreased from a year ago, primarily reflecting lower revenue from liquid alternatives. Quarterly technology services revenue was up 20% compared to a year ago, driven by sustained demand for our technology offerings. Current quarter technology services revenue also benefited from the impact of several large client renewals of their eFront on-premises licenses, for which accounting treatment recognizes a majority of the revenue at time of renewal. Approximately half of the year-over-year technology services revenue increase resulted from these eFront contract renewals. Annual contract value, or ACV, increased 10% year-over-year. We remain committed to low- to mid-teens ACV growth over the long-term, driven by demand for Aladdin's broadening technology capabilities and the growing value proposition it presents for clients. Total expense was 4% higher year-over-year. Higher compensation and direct fund expenses were partially offset by lower distribution and servicing costs and G&A. At present, we expect full year 2023 core G&A to fall on the low end of our previously communicated guidance of a mid- to high-single-digit percentage increase. In line with this outlook, we would also expect fourth quarter core G&A to reflect seasonal increases in marketing spend and execution of planned technology investment spend. Our third quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 42.3% was up 30 basis points from a year ago, benefiting in part from the favorable impact of market movements on quarterly revenue over the last year. Our platform strategy has delivered scale and operating leverage through time, and we aim to be disciplined in driving profitable growth. We're prioritizing investments to propel our differentiated organic growth and drive operating leverage. We'll look to find more opportunities to variabilize expenses, generate fixed cost scale through technology and automation, and align investment spend with organic revenue growth potential. Our capital management strategy remains consistent. We invest first, either to scale strategic growth initiatives or drive operational efficiency, and then return excess cash to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. During the third quarter, we closed our acquisition of Kreos Capital, adding venture debt capabilities to our credit and private markets franchises. And earlier this week, we announced a minority investment as part of a strategic partnership with Upvest. Our M&A focus is on extending our capabilities in technology and private markets, tapping into revenue pools of adjacent industries, and building scale. We repurchased $375 million worth of common shares in the third quarter. At present, based on our capital spending plans for the year and subject to market conditions, we still anticipate repurchasing at least $375 million of shares in the fourth quarter, consistent with our previous guidance in January. BlackRock had $3 billion of total net inflows in the third quarter, which were impacted by $49 billion of low fee institutional index equity redemptions. BlackRock was not immune to an overall slowing of investor activity, but we once again outperformed in what has been a challenging industry environment. Momentum in our ETF business continued with $29 billion of net inflows in the third quarter, led by core equity and fixed income ETF net inflows of $34 billion and $12 billion, respectively. Overall, ETF flows were impacted by redemptions concentrated in certain market-driven precision and fixed income products. The fourth quarter has historically been the strongest quarter of ETF flows for BlackRock when we've seen on average 35% of our annual ETF net inflows. BlackRock typically has been a large beneficiary of ETF industry seasonality related to year-end rebalancing and tax planning. In line with these historical results, we'd expect to see an acceleration in iShares ETF flows as we get closer to the end of 2023. With safe haven cash providing positive returns, retail net outflows of $4 billion primarily reflected industry pressure in active equities and liquid alternatives, partially offset by continued strength in SMAs through Aperio. Institutional index net outflows of $36 billion reflected the previously mentioned low fee index equity redemptions. Our institutional active franchise experienced $1 billion of net outflows, primarily from active fixed income, which was impacted by a handful of client-specific partial redemptions, including reinsurance activity. These outflows were partially offset by continued demand for our target date, illiquid alternatives, and outsourcing capabilities We've built our private markets capabilities across multiple years and we continue to see strong demand for our illiquid alternative strategies. We generated nearly $3 billion of net inflows in the third quarter, driven by infrastructure and private credit. We're only seeing bigger and better private markets opportunities for BlackRock and for our clients. BlackRock's relationships across the world drive our differentiated deal flow. Deal flow alongside great teams with great tech and great data mean we can deliver differentiated investment performance and grow vintage over vintage. We're investing as we scale our private markets platform by using our financial strength to bridge successor funds, facilitate growing co-investments activity and seeding new fund launches. These investments can unlock future revenue and earnings potential for our shareholders. Finally, cash management net inflows were $15 billion in the quarter. Money market funds have returned to earning yields not seen in nearly two decades. We're leveraging our scale and integrated cash offerings to engage with clients who are using cash not only to manage liquidity, but also to earn attractive returns. The current macro environment is causing some clients to pause, slowing overall activity in the asset management industry. Nevertheless, BlackRock has delivered positive organic asset and base fee growth over the last 12 months. We see significant opportunity to deepen relationships and consolidate our share with clients as they resume actively allocating assets. We're staying connected with our clients and positioning for what we believe can be massive growth unlocks. Looking ahead, we believe our platform strategy will continue to deliver for both our clients and shareholders, resulting in sustained market-leading organic growth, differentiated operating leverage and earnings and multiple expansion over time. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry. Laurence Fink : Thank you, Martin. Good morning, and thank you, all, for joining the call. I'd like to begin saying that our thoughts are with everyone who has friends, family, or loved ones impacted by terrorist acts in Israel. The violence and the loss of innocent lives has been shocking and truly heartbreaking. We at BlackRock will continue to do everything we can to support our colleagues and all our clients in the region. Turning to our results. Clients have always been at the center of BlackRock's growth strategy. I believe that BlackRock is better positioned today than ever before to help our clients achieve the long-term outcomes they need. We are having comprehensive conversations with clients globally on how we can partner with them to navigate on a new market regime and capitalize on investment opportunities. BlackRock is uniquely positioned in this environment to serve our clients with an integrated advisory, investment management and technology expertise, something no other asset manager can provide. Sustained organic growth and market appreciation has led to a $1.1 trillion increase in BlackRock's AUM, alongside margin improvement and 14% growth in earnings per share over the last 12 months. Clients have entrusted us with over $300 billion in net inflows over the same time period. Technology service revenues increased 20% year-over-year, reflecting sustained demand for Aladdin and eFront renewals from several large clients. We remain committed to delivering differentiated organic growth and margin. We've invested ahead of major opportunities for BlackRock in private markets, technology and whole portfolio solutions. Through disciplined execution, we aim to both grow client assets and drive profitable growth, unleashing financial success for our clients alongside revenue and earnings power for our shareholders. Structural and secular changes in business models, technology and most of all monetary and fiscal policy have made the last two years extremely challenging for traditional asset management, with a majority of industry players seeing outflows. BlackRock's differentiated business model has enabled us to grow consistently with our clients and maintain positive organic base fee growth since 2022. Investors face continued uncertainty. The S&P saw its best start to July in 26 years, but retreated in August and September. Central banks are being forced to keep policies tight as they lean against inflationary pressures. Two and 10-year treasuries climbed to 16-year highs as investors anticipated rates remaining higher for longer. Rapid advancements in technology and artificial intelligence, the rewiring of globalization, the transition to a low-carbon economy, aging populations, and a fast-evolving financial system are all macro trends clients are evaluating. As market dynamics shift and uncertainty increases, clients are pausing to think about the future, assessing their options, and seeking out BlackRock to take action. BlackRock's quarterly net inflows were not immune to an overall industry slowdown, as Martin discussed. Of course, I'm disappointed when we have softer flow quarters, but the long-term trends of clients consolidating more of their portfolio of BlackRock is only accelerating. Rate hikes over the past year and a half, the fastest in the US since the early 1980s, have made cash not just a safe place, but now a very profitable place for investors to wait for the time being. In short, investors are being paid to wait, something we haven't seen to this degree in years. Investors can earn 5% to 7% from conservative cash and bond portfolios. This dynamic reduces the near-term incentive to implement portfolio changes, resulting in temporarily slower client activity inflows. The degree to which investors have hunkered down in cash is shown by nearly $7 trillion in money market funds AUM across the industry. Investors will eventually put that money to work. We've seen this dynamic before, as recently as 2016 and 2018, when policy uncertainty and the ability to earn yields and cash resulted in temporarily slowing in activity. Through these times, BlackRock stayed connected with our clients, connected across our businesses, and what immediately followed those periods in the past were new records for BlackRock client flows and organic base fee growth at or above 5% target. We expect that investors will begin redeploying assets once there's a conviction in a terminal rate and the shape of the yield curve. We've seen that effect play out in prior cycles, most recently following the Fed pause in 2019, when flows rebounded, particularly in fixed income. BlackRock's integrated platform and deep, long standing relationships with clients position us to be a major beneficiary once flows return. We are the only asset manager delivering our platform as a service. Clients entrust us with $9.1 trillion in assets and we are serving them with excellence. We lead our industry in delivering accessibility, affordability and innovation. Times of uncertainty are often when transformational opportunities emerge. Moments in our history like this have led to new ideas, led to new partnerships and acquisitions. BlackRock has a strong track record of successful transformational M&A. Most people think of BGI and MLM when I say that, but I also think of acquisitions like eFront and Aperio. They have been smaller in size, but were also transformational in their own way. In both, we anticipated and delivered on our clients' needs. We scaled strong existing technologies and built new revenue streams for our shareholders. Organic growth in Aperio has been over 20% since our acquisition, and eFront revenues have grown nearly 50%, while also strengthening our value proposition and positioning in Aladdin and private markets. BlackRock has been a successful acquirer and today advancements in tech and AI, scaling of private markets and more attractive valuations means BlackRock is once again becoming increasingly engaged in M&A trend discussions. What made our acquisition so successful was our enduring commitment to fuse the best of the acquired companies into a stronger and faster-growing one BlackRock, fully connecting all parts of the firm to our clients. We have a proven history of realizing long-term benefits in areas of expansion. Today, we're similarly connecting with our partners across markets to lay the groundwork for future growth. In July, we announced an agreement to form Jio BlackRock, a 50-50 joint venture with Jio Financial Services, an entity carved out of Reliance Industries. India has been an integral part of the global platform and BlackRock is one of the largest international investors in India today. And almost 15% of our colleagues are located across multiple offices in the country. India offers enormous opportunities. Jio BlackRock represents a powerful new partnership in a fast-growing market where we see the potential to revolutionize India's asset management industry. We look forward to expanding our footprint with the ambition to improve the financial futures for millions of investors in India. BlackRock is working in India and markets around the world to lower the barriers to investing through accessible, affordable and transparent solutions. Another example of the new growth opportunities is our partnership and agreement we announced last month for BlackRock to be the asset manager partner of Monzo. Monzo is the UK's leading digital bank and we are launching a new investment offering for their eight million customers. Since launch, more than 250,000 Monzo clients have joined the waiting list for this new offering. And just earlier this week, we announced our partnership with Upvest to drive innovation in how Europeans access markets and make it cheaper and simpler to start investing. What we have seen in the markets after markets is that we can make investing easier and more affordable and we could quickly attract new clients. For first-time investors, the preferred way of investing is often through ETFs, and specifically iShares. Through investment and innovation, we've evolved our iShares ETF franchise to meaningfully increase access to global markets. This includes access for tens of millions of new investors. It also includes access for our most seasoned clients to use our ETF technology to actively allocate across all types of markets. BlackRock's ETF platform delivers industry-leading performance, choice and scale. With growing use cases, diversification and customization, ETFs and indexes are often and increasingly an important component of active management. Across our ETFs, BlackRock generated net inflows of $29 billion in the third quarter and nearly $100 billion year-to-date. Flows in core equity and fixing ETFs were partially offset by redemptions in precision ETFs in August and September, something we expect and have seen before in risk-off environments as clients use our ETF to actively manage their portfolios. These tactical allocation tools are unique to BlackRock, and their high utilization reinforces the value proposition associated with iShares' strong secondary market liquidity, its unique options, and lending markets. BlackRock's market-driven, long-duration fixed income product were also an important tool for investors to rotate at a longer duration position. The breadth of our ETF platform enables us to capture changes in client demand, keeping investors within BlackRock. For example, iShares treasury funds were three of the top-five grossing bond ETFs in the industry as investors shifted duration preferences in the quarter. Our market-leading levels of performance and liquidity helped our clients nimbly reposition as market conditions evolved. As we approach peak interest rates, we expect a resurgence in fixed-income flows, with clients capitalizing on higher yields. BlackRock is well-positioned to benefit from this reallocation with our comprehensive $2.6 trillion fixed-income platform. Going back to the periods immediately following the taper tantrum in 2013, or the Fed pause in early 2019, the industry saw a quick rebound in fixed income flows following rate stability. Both BlackRock ETFs and our active fixed income funds were large beneficiaries at that time. Our conversations with clients aren't about just active and just index, we work with clients to understand their investment challenges, helping them shape and execute strategic portfolio construction decisions. BlackRock is the only asset manager that can deliver outcomes in the context of clients' whole portfolios across market classes, asset classes, investment styles and in public and in private markets. Organizations are turning to the private markets with greater frequency for their capital and financing needs, leading to bigger and better investment opportunities for BlackRock and our clients. BlackRock's worldwide network of relationships with corporations and governments sourcing capabilities and a rigorous selection process helps us deliver unique solutions and drive performance for our clients across private market asset classes. In the third quarter, we announced that BlackRock is partnering with the New Zealand government to launch an over $1 billion climate infrastructure strategy. BlackRock's Decarbonization Partners joint venture also reached $1 billion in committed capital for its first round and has now invested in five portfolio companies. These initiatives are a real example of BlackRock's long-standing relationship with clients and how we deliver the entirety of our platform to pioneer solutions and meet our clients' evolving needs. We're also effectively scaling successor funds in private markets, delivering larger funds through raises of subsequent fund vintages. For example, we're on the 10th vintage of our flagship US Private Lending Fund. And we're in the market with a fourth vintage of our global diversified infrastructure equity fund series. Infra IV already raised $4.5 billion in initial investor commitments at close -- at the first close last year, achieving over half its targeted size. This is the next phase of successful scaling of the franchise. In 2020, our third fund in the series raised a total of $5 billion, surpassing the total assets of vintages one and two combined. Strong investment performance is critical to this momentum. Our flagship private equity fund currently stands at more than a 35% net IRR. We've seen double-digit net returns this year in our flagship private credit strategies. BlackRock's proprietary differentiated deal flow is what drives long-term investment performance and outcomes for clients. BlackRock's global network of relationships, data and analytics, and flexible, adaptable capital needs we get sourced a unique deal for our clients, and we are increasingly finding that opportunity seek us as much as we seek opportunities. Companies want BlackRock as an investor and a partner, recognizing the uniqueness of our global reach, our brand, and our expertise across markets and industries. Our growing profile from investments around the world in the US and Europe and Asia is leading to more and larger deal opportunities. BlackRock's global relationships and expertise in sourcing and underwriting, portfolio and risk management and technology and analytics allow us to unlock unique deals for clients. At the same time, our growing momentum in private markets is delivering value for our shareholders through organic growth and less beta-sensitive revenues. Years ago, we anticipated how clients would benefit from alternative investments being evaluated inside a portfolio level of risk management framework. This led to the combination of eFront and Aladdin, which has set a new standard in investment and risk management technology. The acquisition of eFront opened up a new segment of alternative GPs and asset services, and most importantly, enabled us to help clients across their whole portfolio. Our acquisition and integration of eFront continues to be transformational for clients. And we're seeing strong demand both as a stand-alone basis and for whole portfolio solutions across public and private assets. We now have a data platform and business that covers 13,000 funds and over 150,000 assets, a significant portion of the private market fund universe. We're redefining the industry expectations of transparency in private markets. Nearly half of Aladdin's clients are leveraging our newer offerings, including eFront, which is a true competitive advantage in the tech market. And as Martin spoke to, you saw eFront's contribution reflecting in this quarter's tech results. Investors and advisors are increasingly choosing a small number of scale technology platforms that offer everything in their ecosystem in one place. Aladdin worked seamlessly alongside other aspects of client investment processes and tech stack, serving as a foundation while enabling clients to create custom solutions to meet their specific needs. To get here, we also have developed deep integration with custodial banks, with fund accountants, broker-dealers, and other leading ecosystem partners. This flexibility and choice are just some of the reasons clients are entrusting us with the growing numbers of their portfolios. Going forward, we are confident that clients will continue to turn to Aladdin to unify their investment management process. BlackRock's willingness to reimagine our business, our ambition to partner comprehensively with our clients, and our drive to innovate ahead of their needs is translating into broader, into deeper relationships, and we see an incredible opportunity for us in front of us. We remain intensely focused on staying close to our clients, especially, during periods of market volatility and rising uncertainty. Clients are coming to us for advice, for solutions tailored to this macroeconomic environment, wanting to do more with BlackRock. Horizontal connectivity is critical. And our leadership team and an entire organization are coming together to differentiate ourselves in delivering for clients today and preparing to capture the money in motion we anticipate in the near future. As I've always done, I'm challenging our teams to continue to innovate and stay perpetually neurotic about staying in front of our clients. BlackRock will continue to lead in creating more access and connections between long-term investors, capital markets and the real economy. I'm incredibly excited about the opportunities I see for our clients, and especially for BlackRock, which will then lead especially for you, our stakeholders. Let us now open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Laurence Fink : Hello, Craig. Craig Siegenthaler : Hey, good morning, Larry. Hope everyone is doing well. Laurence Fink : Absolutely. Craig Siegenthaler : So my question is on the organic growth outlook. There were several low fee redemptions in the quarter. And also given that we're in year three of a bond bear market, your flows are arguably depressed versus a longer-term run rate. So, how do you think about the four organic growth trajectory and the potential money in motion? And specifically, do you expect to see a pickup in fixed income flows once the Fed is done raising, which could be very soon here? Martin Small : Thanks, Craig. It's Martin. Let me just say a few things about organic growth and the outlook. So, just last 12 months, we've delivered positive organic asset and revenue growth, $300 billion in flows over the last year, $193 billion year-to-date. We, as I mentioned, have conviction in our 5% base fee target over the long-term. We've reached it on average over the last five years and met or exceeded it in seven out of the last 10. Our 5% organic growth target is better than 3% industry estimates. And we still feel we underwrite that number all the time together. We feel it's reasonable, it's attainable based on our product breadth, our solutions orientation, our technology capabilities. And when the management team looks at our client engagement and sales measures, we really do -- we see good momentum. As I mentioned in my comments, our Q3 gross fund sales were at 95% at average levels over the last 12 months. So we see those as good measures of engagement and our activity with clients. On the flows, we see them as just marked by this offsetting activity across our platform with some very specific client moves. The way I look at it, Craig, is, on the one hand, we had a combined $60 billion in net inflows. That's $29 billion from ETFs, it's over $13 billion in institutional multi-asset and target date in OCIO and it's $50 billion of cash. That right there, I think, is sort of right at a lot of the consensus or higher numbers. On the other hand, this was offset by the $50 billion of institutional index equity redemptions, with $19 billion from one non-US client. So, just in assessing how we're doing, the conversations with our clients, the momentum we have, we think the flows would have obviously been very positive, but for these re-balancings. As Larry mentioned, they happen from time to time, and they have very little impact to base fees. It's a low-single-digit point basis business. It's sub-3% of our revenue. But what I'd say is we managed close to $2 trillion of institutional index equity. We think it's a good business. These large AUM index relationships, they have meaningful franchise value for us beyond fee rates. A large mandate of index assets, Larry mentioned, it's typically only part of our overall relationship with a client, which has active alternatives, ETFs or advisory. And you've got to be a scaled player to be in this large index market. So, this is the business we're in, and from time to time, it can impact the flow number, and that's something that we don't manage quarter-to-quarter. We look at over the long-term. On organic base fee growth, I also think it's good to simplify this, Craig. Q3 base fees were impacted by mix. And I think those really come from two areas. We had $13 billion of redemptions from precision ETFs, which Larry mentioned, are unique to BlackRock and important vehicles for clients and also part of our platform strategy in terms of how clients stay with iShares and move from EM to DM to high yield to treasuries, and we had $2.5 billion of outflows from retail liquid alternatives. And you'll remember, Craig, because I know you love the page, from our Investor Day that we showed the average fee rates across different segments of our products and services. And if you were to take those average fee rates and the fee rates available on our public website for '40 Act alternatives, just for illustration purposes, the order of magnitude of base fee decay would be $60-plus million. So, I hope that gives you a sense of what weighed on base fee growth this quarter. It's largely in those things that we know have long-term franchise value, have grown over time and added to earnings. But in any quarter-to-quarter, they may weigh on the fee rate and on the base fee growth. Over a cycle, Craig, we still see a really clear path to 5% plus organic base fee growth with our platform strategy. We keep growing and scaling private markets, the re-risking of global investment portfolios. We're continuing to see high-teens growth in tax-managed direct indexing with Aperio. Rob will talk a little bit, hopefully, when I'm done, about the generational opportunity in active fixed income and bond ETFs, model portfolios and iShares, where we think half our ETF growth will come through models. So, we still see big opportunities to continue to hit those targets and beyond. Rob, do you want to say a couple of things about fixed income? Robert Kapito : So I think most of the questions are going to concern the why, the where, and the when. And so, the yield curve is the most inverted that it's been since the 1980s. So, maybe, Larry and I can add a little value since we were there at that time. And investors are really getting paid to wait. And money market funds have nearly $7 trillion in assets under management. So that's $7 trillion. And as we approach the peak in interest rates, we expect that there are going to be some very, very large allocations to fixed income. And I'm sure someone will call it the great reallocation. And the reason is, today, there are better opportunities to invest in bonds than have been in the years. Over 80% of the bond market is yielding over 40%, enabling investors to derive a large part of their liability needs from owning bonds and access returns with less risk. So, as Martin just said, we are so well-positioned to benefit from this reallocation with our comprehensive $2.6 trillion fixed income platform, which spans unconstrained total return, municipals, and actually the entire yield curve. So with more money in motion, and it will be in motion, BlackRock will benefit as clients build fixed income allocations with higher-performing active, alongside of ETFs and private market strategies. In particular, right now, clients are focusing their opportunity in the short end of the curve, and of course, in private credit. So when? Well, we have historically seen a rebound in fixed income following rate stability. And this year's yield spikes have been mostly from market re-pricing and policy rate expectations. There is a lot of concern over US debt levels and large treasury issuance, and investors are demanding a higher premium. So, if we go back to the periods immediately following the taper tantrum in 2013 that Larry mentioned, or the Fed pause in early 2019, the industry saw a very quick rebound in fixed income flows. Both ETFs and active fixed income funds were the beneficiaries. So when? Well, once there's more certainty on a terminal rate and the shape of the yield curve, then we expect more deployment into fixed income. And I'll recap it. A slowdown in short-term issuance and more balanced term structure of interest rates are the indicators we're looking for in anticipation of accelerating demand for immediate and longer duration fixed income. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Laurence Fink : Good morning, Michael. Michael Cyprys : Hey, good morning. Question on M&A. Larry, you've suggested that you're open to large transformational M&A. I was just hoping you can articulate why that is the case. What's changed versus a couple of years ago, as I don't recall you mentioning large transformational M&A couple of years ago? Maybe you could talk about some of your objectives and aspirations there. And if you could help clarify what might be the focus area versus maybe what's off the list completely. Laurence Fink : So, obviously, the foundation of the firm and the -- was Milliman, the BGI transaction. But we've been quite active in deals and partnerships, whether it's Jio BlackRock partnership that we're working on, which I think will be transformational. That's not an M&A deal. But our Aperio deal, our eFront deal, are great examples of execution, precision, with 20% and 50%, respectively, increase in revenues in both those businesses. I would look back and say, we spent about $4 billion on M&A over the last five years. And I'm now challenging all of us, including myself, about what are the ecosystem changes that are around today. And I -- if you look back when we did the big transactions, there was a lot of market on settlement, and I think there is quite a bit going on now, big shifts. And so, we are looking at different opportunities related to technology, private markets. We're always engaged in conversations. But I'm challenging the team and myself to really -- to think more broadly and more openly about the opportunities we have. And we're engaged. We're engaged in a large way across the world, across the opportunities. That is not going to be displacing the opportunities of partnerships like the partnership with Monzo, the partnership with Reliance Industries and Jio Financial. We see those going to be additive. They inform us. They help us be more connected. We see different opportunities. And so, we're challenging ourselves. We are engaged in a lot of conversations right now, probably more than we have been in many, many years. And we'll see how this all plays out. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Laurence Fink : Good morning, Alex. Alexander Blostein : Hi. Good morning, Larry. I appreciate the comments earlier. Maybe just another one around M&A. So, it sounds like you have a pretty wide lens through which you're considering different targets or partnerships. Can you remind us about financial targets for a potential deal for BlackRock from an EPS accretion? And any other kind of framework you could put around what a potential deal could look like? Thanks. Laurence Fink : I'm going to hand it off to Martin. Martin Small : Hi, Alex. It's Martin. How are you? So, the centerpiece and hallmark of the M&A strategy here has always been about accelerating organic growth. It's been about developing capabilities that we don't have and or de-risking capabilities that we're building. And I'd say when you look at eFront, when you look at Aperio, when you look at many of the transactions Larry has talked about, that's really been the center of the strategy. It's about accelerating organic growth and delivering for clients. And as Larry said, in the last five years, we've spent about $4 billion on M&A. We're not capital-constrained. We have ample debt capacity. And so our goal is to be able to drive earnings acceleration and also deliver more for our clients through M&A. Laurence Fink : I would just add one more thing related to that. Martin, I just want to double-down. We have a lot of debt capacity. We have a lot of opportunities. And we're really refocusing on where can we be additive. The one thing that I could tell you, when we do integrations of firms, we are not going to be a boutique. We are going to be organizing it and building it out. We love the opportunity of having Aperio, but it's a part of a big organized firm. We love eFront. It's organized around the whole Aladdin ecosystem. But it is not -- we're not building a boutique of different fragments. We're building a unified organization. As Martin said, to be additive in revenues, additive in client connectivity, and additive in reach, reach in technology and reach in product. Operator : Your next question comes from Daniel Fannon with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Laurence Fink : Hi, Dan. Daniel Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. Hi. Another question on flows, active equities and alternatives, both higher fee segments and, I think, key contributors to you hitting your long-term base fee target. Can you talk about the trends in those businesses outside of maybe just the seasonal stuff for 3Q? But really, as we think about the next 12 months, 24 months, the kind of funds and growth outlook you think for both, obviously, alternatives, but then also the active equity segment? Martin Small : Thanks very much for the question. So, when I think about the active equities business at BlackRock, we had continued to see a very strong active equity business over the last three years. We've generated over $30 billion in active equity net inflows, while our average AUM has grown by 34%. And so, while, again, quarter-to-quarter and year-on-year, we'd fully expect to see, particularly in this environment, some rotations out of equities and into cash, which has been the main theme, I think, of this call and the many others, we still see really strong growth in the business. And we think it's fundamentally a big part of client portfolios. I do think over time, in our product strategy, you've seen we've been adding, for example, transparent active ETFs, through which we'll be growing our active equity business and our other active businesses. And so, we think about these over time as being delivered through multiple rampers and an integral part of our base fee growth strategy. Robert Kapito : And let me just add to that. Because we have to be a little bit careful about what we call active, because people are active with both their index and their ETFs through models and I would prefer to say it's active as we originally knew the definition alongside of all of our ETF products. And when is active going to continue to have more flows? When you can add outflow? And we're going into an environment where I believe active flows will be greater because there are now more opportunities to add alpha than there has been before. So we've seen $65 billion of active net inflows in 2023 year-to-date, which compares to industry outflows. And part of that is coming from some of the different pockets that we have created that require more active than passive management. So, we continue to see strong demand in the private markets and in LifePath. These are the strength in income-oriented equities total return in core bond strategies. So just to give you an idea, since 2019, positive active flows have been in 16 out of the 19 quarters. And a lot of that also depends upon performance. And that's what we've been able to keep our promise to with our clients and will drive active inflows going forward. Laurence Fink : One more last thing on this, Dan, I would just say, we have committed enlarging our iShares platform globally. I think that's going to be an integral part of what we're doing in India. But if you look at the trends of ETFs in the year-to-date, in Europe, ETF flows are up 70%. In the US, the ETF flows are actually a little lower than they were last year. But as we continue to build out our platform globally, we become a very large beneficiary. And what is happening in Europe, the rise of its capital markets and the utilization of ETFs as an instrument of active and an instrument of exposures and an instrument of passives, we're winning big market share in that business. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Laurence Fink : Good morning, Brian. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks. Good morning. Maybe, Rob, if we could just go back to institutional fixed income, a different angle of this being the prospect of pension plans immunizing their portfolios given how much longer-term bond yields have improved. What do you sense as sort of, I guess, first of all, the potential magnitude of that switch, of that reallocation to immunizing the plans as you talk with your clients and then sort of the timing of that? Are they also waiting for yields to peak to do that or is it more seasonal or something that might actually do by year end? Laurence Fink : Great question. I mean we've consistently large-scale immunization in the UK pension fund world, a major component of the entire UK market, to find benefit plans have been immunized already. Over the last five years, about another $4 billion to $6 billion that have moved out and been -- and more and more immunized. I don't see that happening yet at a 5% or a 4.5% environment yet. But if we peak long rates at 5.5%, 6%, if the yield curve becomes more steep instead of flat or inverted, that's when you're going to see it. I think it's more of the shape of the yield curve where you're going to start seeing more and more people thinking about immunization. Unquestionably, on the margin, you're going to see some pension funds immunize. And it will -- depending on that type of flow, it is going to put some pressure on the equity market as money moves out of equities and permanently go into long-dated bonds. We're having conversations with a lot of organizations on that. And so I can tell you there are a lot of -- there are quite a few pension funds now because our liability rate has been reset at a higher rate. They are getting closer to their -- to matching. This is more corporate plans, not state plans. And that occurs you're going to see a significant de-risking. Instead of that, we are actually seeing more and more companies looking to earn higher returns in credit and infrastructure right now. They're trying to lock at higher returns that way. But we haven't seen a major shift of duration extension in the treasury market. And I think that's very evident right now. And that's why I think the yield curve is flattening out right now. But we are seeing significant interest level with a lot of pension funds to take -- bring down their -- I would say, their exposure in equities, to bring down their exposure in some components of alternatives and focus on income-oriented alternatives to really get an 8%, 9%, 10% type of coupon return. Rob, do you want to follow up on that? Robert Kapito : Yeah, I'd just add a couple of things. That's a really great question, because I think I'd speak for Larry. We haven't heard the word immunization for a very, very long time and we've been visited by several pension plans to talk about that. Obviously, it's rate-driven. I think the number is going to be 7% plus that they're going to have to get. And if you want to do a little history, in 1995, you can have a portfolio of all bonds and get a 7.5% return. So when you add that together with the environment I described before that might be coming. Now, there's a step before that. And we have been the beneficiary of a lot of these plans, finding that it's too complicated, they were very barbelled. They're not sure what the reallocation could be. It's hard to find the people to do this in the locations that they are and they don't have the technology. So we've been the beneficiary through what we call the OCIO business. And we have had a significant amount of large wins in that business to help them with the appropriate reallocation. I think the next stage of that in the future might be more institutions may be going into immunizing the portfolio. But as Larry said, it's really rate-driven. We're not that far away. But a lot of things have to happen before then. And a lot of that, of course, will be done in the bond market, which, in my previous answers, really adds fuel to the fire where we could be a very big participant in that. Operator : Your next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please, go ahead. Laurence Fink : Hi, Brennan. How are you? Brennan Hawken : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just kind of curious about -- thinking about expenses here. Martin, you spoke to coming into the low end of the range on the core G&A, which is certainly encouraging. But right now, it's probably a time when you all are beginning to sharpen your pencils on the budgets here into next year. The environment -- BlackRock is incredibly well-positioned, as you all have hit on several times here today, but the environment is challenging. And so how are you thinking about 2024? And how should we be thinking about that as we refine our models today? Thanks. Martin Small : Thanks, Brennan. Just -- I will reiterate, we expect full year G&A to fall on the low end of our previously communicated -- committed guidance of mid to high-single-digit percentage increase, still accept to keep our headcount broadly flat for this year, as we've said in the last two quarters. And just on outlook for expense, and I suppose, margin, again, our strategy for driving values to deliver organic growth, differentiated in premium operating margin and consistent capital management policy. We're focused on investing for profitable growth. When I think about operating leverage in a higher for longer rate environment, you've heard on our last few calls that we're looking to make more concentrated investments in places that can drive higher organic growth, deliver more operating efficiency, but we're also looking to add flexibility to the cost base. But most importantly, Brennan, we're looking to drive more fixed cost scale that comes through technology, automation, organizational design and foot-printing. There are so many exciting things happening at BlackRock on that front. We launched our BlackRock AI Lab back in 2018. We've been using artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing in our systematic business going back 20 years. And we have teams all over these things for how we can scale trading, pricing, operations, client service and even automation to make our software engineers most productive. So if you ask me where are we going to focus investments going forward with a particular sharp eye, I look at our total annual operating expense of about $11 billion and our largest fixed investments by dollars and importance, that's our really talented BlackRock employees. So giving them more tools to enhance productivity, from large language models to better CRM, tools that help clients customize and self-service, like our BlackRock Advisor Center, those are going to be some of our best opportunities to deliver, I think, long-term profitable growth and where we'd be looking towards our expenses. But also, we've got great investments that I think Larry alluded to that are in commercial partnerships. Those are with TAMPs, neo brokers, digital wealth platforms, other distribution venues. So we'd invest some of that. It will be fixed M&P. Some of it will be variable distribution and servicing, which gives us some more resilience. That's some of the variablizing of expenses that I've talked about. But they all have the potential to accelerate outsized growth for iShares and other BlackRock investments. And our budget for 2024 is going to look to optimize organic growth in the most efficient way possible and expanding our premium margin over time. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks? Laurence Fink : Thank you, operator. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today and your continued interest in the organization. BlackRock's underlying business momentum remains incredibly strong. And we believe there are more money being put to work as investors glean clarity on the path, the path of rate movements, related to geopolitical issues and more people are seeking opportunities with BlackRock. I do see great opportunities ahead for our clients and look forward to delivering more opportunity for you, our shareholders, our investors. And I want to thank you for your continued interest. Have a good quarter. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Teleconference. Participants for today's call will include Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Martin S. Small; President, Robert S. Kapito; General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade and Global Infrastructure Partners, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Adebayo Ogunlesi. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference. Christopher Meade : Good morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So with that, I'll turn it over to Larry. Laurence Fink : Thank you, Chris, and good morning to everybody, and Happy New Year. Thank you for joining us today to discuss BlackRock's fourth quarter and full year results. We're also very excited to announce our agreement to acquire Global Infrastructure Partners, and I'd like to welcome all our new partners from GIP and their Chairman and my friend and founder Bayo Ogunlesi is here with me, alongside with Rob and Martin, we're all here today to answer your questions after our prepared remarks. Adebayo Ogunlesi : Thank you, Larry. My fellow founders and colleagues across GIP and I are very excited about the opportunity to join BlackRock. Our combination will drive even better opportunities for our clients. All of us at GIP sharing the vision of delivering better outcomes with clients and leading critical global investments that drive economic growth. Thank you. Laurence Fink : Thank you, Bayo. This is another truly transformational moment for BlackRock. Our firm is what it is today because we've taken a long-term view on what market forces will drive outsized growth for our clients and for our firm. We're doing that again today, guiding us always by the needs of our clients. Growing public deficits, a modernizing digital world, advancing energy independence and the energy transition are driving the mobilization of private capital to fund critical infrastructure. Infrastructure investment is a fast-growing market. In a higher rate environment, the ability to drive operational enhancements will be critical to investment performance. Today, we are announcing two transformational changes in anticipation of the evolution we see ahead for the asset management industry and for the entire global capital markets. Our strategic re-architecture of our organization will simplify and improve how we work and deliver for our clients. And the acquisition of GIP will propel our leadership in a fast-growing market for a hard asset infrastructure. These transformations in total are the largest at BlackRock since we acquired BGI nearly 15 years ago. The planned combination of BlackRock's infrastructure platform in GIP will provide clients access to market-leading investments and operating expertise across infrastructure, private markets. The integrated platform will deliver clients substantial scale as the second largest private markets infrastructure manager in the world with over $150 billion in client assets. In addition, GIP will bring dedicated investment in operational improvement teams with track records of delivering deep value enhancements, which have led to impressive returns throughout its existence. With a strong common culture of serving clients with excellence together, we will deliver for our clients or holistic global infrastructure manager across equity, debt and solutions. We will provide the full range of infrastructure sector exposures and will offer unique originations across developed and the emerging markets. BlackRock has developed a broad network of global corporate relationships through many years of long-term investments in both debt and equity. These long-term relationships will help us lead critical investments in infrastructure that will improve outcomes for communities around the globe and generate long-term investment benefits for our clients. I know I speak for the entire BlackRock Board of Directors, BlackRock's leadership team and all of our employees when I say we could not be more excited about the prospects of a BlackRock family with our colleagues from GIP. We similarly look forward to welcoming our new clients and deepening our relationships with those clients who already worked with both of us. BlackRock's industry leadership comes from delivering sustained performance innovating and staying ahead of the needs of our clients. Today, we announced several organizational changes to simplify and improve how we work and how we deliver for clients. In anticipation of the major calls we are making on the future of the capital markets and the entire asset management industry. The strong senior leaders taking on new and expanded roles will keep us more tightly connected, stimulate fresh thinking and help us better deliver for all our clients. Let me now turn on to Martin to cover our 2023 results and take you through the specifics of the transaction, our quarter before I offer further context. Martin Small : Thanks, Larry. Good morning, and happy New Year to everyone. Before I pass it back to Larry, I'll review our financial performance and business results. and provide more detail on the GIP transaction. We plan for a longer call today so that we have plenty of time for questions. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I'll be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. The last two years have been a character building an inspiring time for investors, for clients and certainly for us at BlackRock. The monetary policy shock of a rapid rate rising campaign upended 10 years of asset allocation practices and spurred repositioning of portfolios into cash and money market funds at the expense of risk assets. At BlackRock, our business is to serve clients with excellence and help them design portfolios for the future. We built BlackRock to be a structural grower by having a platform of investment, technology and product capabilities that go beyond investment outcomes. They deliver client scale, they deliver clients' business efficiency. Whether clients are making wholesale portfolio allocation changes or just executing on tactical adjustments, they're doing it all within the BlackRock platform. We've spoken throughout the year about what conditions we'd expect to bring investors out of cash and into risk assets. It's generally unfolding as we described, with greater clarity on terminal rates in the fourth quarter we saw evidence of portfolio re-risking and we expect this trend to accelerate in 2024. BlackRock is a share winner when there\u2019s an asset in motion and clients continue to consolidate more of their portfolios with us. In 2023, BlackRock generated $289 billion of total net inflows and delivered 1% organic base fee growth. Importantly, we finished the year with significant momentum in the fourth quarter generating approximately $96 billion of total net inflows. In November and December, we saw surge in flows resulting in 6% annualized organic base fee growth for the last two full months of the year. Full year revenue of $17.9 billion was relatively flat year-over-year. Operating income of $6.6 billion declined 2% from 2022, while earnings per share of $37.77 increased by 7%. For the fourth quarter, revenue of $4.6 billion was 7% higher year-over-year, driven by the impact of higher markets on average AUM and higher performance fees. Quarterly operating income of $1.7 billion was up 9%, while earnings per share of $9.66 was 8% higher versus a year ago, also reflecting higher non-operating income in the current quarter. Non-operating results for the quarter included $122 million of net investment income, driven primarily by mark-to-market gains in our private equity co-investment portfolios. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 24%, driven in part by discrete items. We currently estimate that 25% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for 2024, though the actual effective tax rate may differ because of nonrecurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation. Fourth quarter base fees and securities lending revenue of $3.6 billion was up 6% year-over-year, driven by the positive impact of market beta on average AUM, 2% organic base fee growth and higher securities lending revenue. Sequentially, base fee and securities lending revenue was down 2%. On an equivalent day count basis, our annualized effective fee rate was approximately three-tenths of a basis point lower compared to the third quarter. This was primarily due to lower securities lending revenue, underperformance of non-U.S. equity markets and client preferences favoring lower fee fixed income and cash. As a result of accelerating organic growth and global equity and bond market appreciation toward the end of the quarter, we entered the first quarter with an estimated base fee run rate approximately 6% higher than our total base fees for the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter and full year performance fees of $311 million and $554 million, respectively, increased from a year ago, reflecting higher revenue from liquid alternatives and long-only mandates. Quarterly technology services revenue increased 7% year-over-year, and full year revenue of $1.5 billion increased 9% and reflecting the successful on-boarding of new clients and large e-Front on-premises licenses renewals in the third quarter. Annual contract value, or ACV, increased 10% year-over-year as clients increasingly partnered with BlackRock for integrated technology solutions to drive business transformation and scale. We remain committed to low to mid-teens ACV growth over the long term. Total expense increased 1% in 2023, reflecting higher compensation, G&A and direct fund expense. We effectively managed our discretionary spend in 2023 and we'll continue to be disciplined in focusing our resources in areas with the greatest opportunity. Our fourth quarter operating margin of 41.6% increased by 40 basis points year-on-year as we continue to drive operating leverage and profitable growth after the market shock of 2022. Our full year as-adjusted operating margin of 41.7% was down 110 basis points from a year ago. The decline primarily reflected the negative impact of markets and foreign exchange movements on our 2023 entry rate revenue as well as critical investments in our people and technology. During the year, we reorganized two of our fastest-growing businesses, private markets in Aladdin to stay ahead of our clients' evolving needs and build on our past successes in these areas. These specific groups further simplified their structures, resulting in a fourth quarter restructuring charge of $61 million, comprised of severance and accelerated amortization of previously granted deferred compensation awards. This charge appears as a single line expense item on our 2023 GAAP income statement and has been excluded from our as-adjusted results to enhance comparison to prior periods. In addition, we made resourcing decisions to free up investment capacity for our most important growth initiatives. This resulted in a onetime compensation expense of $28 million in the fourth quarter, which is included in our as-adjusted results. Overall, these two actions impacted approximately 3% of our workforce by taking a targeted and disciplined approach to how we shape our teams and evolve our skill sets to meet changing market and technology environments, we increased investment capacity, we enhance organizational expertise, and we create opportunities for operating leverage and career growth. Looking forward, we're prioritizing investments to propel our differentiated organic growth and operating leverage. We'll aim to align investment spend with our highest conviction structural growth areas, find additional ways to variabilize expenses and generate fixed cost scale through technology, automation and optimization of our footprint through our innovation hubs. Excluding the impact of the GIP transaction at present, we'd expect our headcount to be broadly flat in 2024. Also excluding the impact of GIP and related transaction costs, we'd expect a low to mid-single-digit percentage increase in 2024 core G&A expense. Most core G&A growth should come from continued investment in technology as we look to operate more efficiently and better serve our clients. One of our biggest long-term advantages has been scale. Our ability to add significant assets managed with excellence without growing expenses linearly. Our platform strategy has delivered scale and operating leverage over time and we're committed to delivering a premium operating margin. Our capital management strategy remains consistent. We invest first either to scale strategic growth initiatives or drive operational efficiency and then return excess cash to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. In 2023, we returned over $4.5 billion to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Share repurchases have been a consistent element of our capital management strategy. Since 2013, we've repurchased close to $15 billion of BlackRock stock, which generated an unlevered compound annual return of 14% for our shareholders. Over this time period, we reduced our share count by nearly 23 million shares or 13%. For the trailing five years, we've lowered our share count by 10 million shares completing $7.8 billion of share repurchases at an average price of $563 for an IRR of over 15%. BlackRock's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $5.10 per share, representing an increase of 2% over the 2023 level. At present, based on capital spending plans for the year, and subject to market conditions, including the relative valuation of our stock price, we're targeting the purchase of $1.5 billion of shares during 2024. Full year total net inflows of $289 billion were positive across active and index as well as regions, led by $156 billion of net inflows from clients in the United States, and we had 70 products across our ETF and mutual fund ranges with over $1 billion in net inflows. BlackRock generated industry-leading ETF net inflows of $186 billion in 2023, representing 6% organic asset growth led by $112 billion of net inflows into our bond ETFs. Fourth quarter ETF net inflows of $88 billion reflected significant momentum into year-end helped by seasonal tax trades and portfolio reallocations. We saw $28 billion of net inflows into precision exposures as institutional clients use these highly liquid instruments to re-risk in the quarter. With Safe-Haven cash providing positive returns. Full year and fourth quarter retail net outflows of $8 billion and $9 billion, respectively, were primarily due to allocations out of rising rate sensitive strategies namely liquid alternatives and flexible bond funds. This was partially offset by strength in Aperio, which saw record net inflows of $12 billion in 2023. Aperio AUM since acquisition has grown 95% to $80 billion. BlackRock's institutional business generated net inflows of $32 billion in 2023, led by active net inflows of $87 billion including the funding of several significant outsourcing mandates throughout the year. Index net outflows of $55 billion were driven by redemptions from our low fee equity strategies as several large clients adjusted their allocations or redeemed for cash needs. Finally, BlackRock's cash management platform saw $33 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter and $79 billion of net inflows in 2023. We're pleased with the continued strong growth in our cash and liquidity business with year-end AUM up 14% or over $90 billion year-on-year. We're leveraging our scale and integrated cash offerings to engage with clients who are using these products not only to manage liquidity, but also to earn attractive returns. Demand for private markets remain strong, with $14 billion of net inflows into BlackRock illiquid strategies during the year driven by infrastructure and private credit. We continue to expect these categories to be our primary growth drivers in the coming years. Turning to our planned acquisition of GIP this is an exciting day for us, our new partners, our clients and our shareholders. The combination will mark a transformational change in our private market scale and growth. GIP is the world's leading independent infrastructure manager with current client AUM of over $100 billion and fee-based AUM of over $60 billion. The acquisition will create a highly complementary pro forma $150 billion infrastructure platform post-closing tripling BlackRock's infrastructure client assets. The integration will nearly double our private markets management fees to over $1.5 billion and add over $400 million in post-tax annual FRE with FRE margins above 50%. Since its founding in 2006, GIP has successfully scaled its equity flagship series from its $5.6 billion Fund I to $20-plus billion in the most recent vintages. GIP's current team of approximately 400 employees across 11 global offices has delivered strong long-term performance for clients and is expected to generate approximately $760 million of management fee revenue in 2023. Turning to the financial terms of the transaction, we are acquiring 100% of the business and assets of GIP for total consideration of $3 billion in cash and approximately 12 million shares of BlackRock stock. seven million shares will be paid at closing and five million shares to be paid in approximately five years, subject to certain performance measures. BlackRock will fund the cash consideration through $3 billion of additional debt which will not meaningfully change its leverage profile. Primarily through growth synergies from proprietary deal origination, larger transaction sizes, capital formation scale and multi-asset class infrastructure investment innovation we see opportunities to drive significant value creation for BlackRock shareholders. The terms of this transaction ensure long-term continuity and strong alignment of interest among GIP and BlackRock to best serve clients employees and shareholders. A substantial majority of the consideration paid at closing and approximately 75% of nominal total transaction consideration will be paid in BlackRock common stock. GIP leadership will become meaningful shareholders of BlackRock with a shared ambition of driving One BlackRock outcomes for our clients and shareholders. 100% of carried interest and capital commitments from all existing GIP funds will continue to be owned by the GIP owners and employees. These are not economically included in the transaction perimeter and support long-term retention and incentives of GIP employees. After closing, GIP's management team will lead our combined infrastructure platform, working with BlackRock's strong investment teams in equity debt and solutions. The GIP team will bring a talented group of investment and operational improvement professionals with a proven track record of building and running high-performing private markets businesses. Each of the GIP founders will become party to a shareholder's agreement that requires shares to be voted in accordance with the recommendation of BlackRock's independent Board at any meeting of BlackRock shareholders. We've provided additional detail on the transaction structure and terms in a supplement posted to the BlackRock Investor Relations website this morning. We expect the transaction to be modestly accretive to as-adjusted EPS and operating margin in the first full year post close, which will exclude transaction-related costs. Given the structural growth trends of the private infrastructure market, and what we see as a best-in-class whole portfolio infrastructure investing capability, we believe the transaction will be accretive to long-term organic asset and base fee growth. These abilities can be a key source of earnings diversification and growth acceleration to meet or exceed our through-the-cycle 5% or better organic growth ambitions. Building on strong structural growth trends over this past year, and the over $1.9 trillion of organic asset growth over the last five years, we're investing to deliver the industry's only comprehensive platform across public markets, private markets and investment technology. Having delivered differentiated organic growth and operating margin across the weakest markets in decades, we believe markets are trending to be strong for 2024 with a more risk on tone. BlackRock's a share winner when assets are in motion. We see the pent-up demand behind over $1 trillion in money market fund flows this year poised to deliver significant opportunities across risk assets. Our combination with GIP will put BlackRock in the leadership position to drive great outcomes for clients and deliver new engines of earnings growth for our shareholders. We've built an industry leader in structural growers like ETFs, model portfolios, outsourcing and investment technology with Aladdin. We're building a private markets leader at new levels of scale and we see the best opportunities we've had in years to get closer with clients and raise significant private capital. We enter 2024 in a stronger position than ever, and all of us at BlackRock are excited about the opportunities ahead for our clients, the firm and our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back to Larry. Laurence Fink : Thank you, Martin. We'll leave plenty of time for your questions later on, but I want to describe how we evaluated bringing our firms together with GIP. Why we think the timing is so opportune and how infrastructure private markets can be so beneficial to all our clients, employees and to you, our shareholders.  Infrastructure is a $1 trillion market forecasted to be one of the fastest-growing segments of private markets in the years ahead. A number of long-term structural trends support an acceleration in the infrastructure investments. These include increasingly growing global demand and upgrading digital infrastructure like fiber broadband, cell towers and data centers. Renewed investments to logistical hubs such as airports, railroads, shipping ports as supply chains are rewired, and a movement towards increased energy independence in many parts of the world, supported by de-carbonization infrastructure. In the United States and around the world, there's a public need for greater investment in infrastructure. This growing needs creates significant investment opportunity for clients. The unprecedented need for new infrastructure, coupled with the record high government deficits means that private capital will be needed like never before. That supply-demand imbalance creates compelling investment opportunities for our clients. At the same time, corporates are looking to engage partners in new projects or partially de-risking the existing ones. These dynamics offer clients, especially those investing for retirement the high coupon inflation-protected long duration investments they need, and we believe it will define the future of asset management for the next 20 years. Our acquisition philosophy has always been about growth, not about cost takeouts and or consolidations. Consistently, these combinations have resulted in reaching heights that neither BlackRock nor a merged partners could ever reach on their own. I truly believe that this will be the case again with the integration of BlackRock infrastructure and GIP. Transformational transactions have strengthened our firm, have strengthened our culture and bringing top talent, new skills and experience into our organization. Our culture has evolved as we welcome new teams and colleagues to BlackRock. Today, it represents a blending of the best parts of the cultures that have come together over the years. What's made our acquisition so successful was our steadfast commitment to One BlackRock culture totally connecting to our clients with one platform, shared goals, a common Aladdin technology. And as a result, BlackRock is greater than the sum of any one part, and then that drives BlackRock's differentiating growth model. Reaching this moment is quite personal and emotional for me. Our firm's BlackRock and GIP have similar origin stories. We founded BlackRock on understanding investment risks and the factors and forces driving returns initially in fixed income and then across the equity markets and then globally. We wanted to help long-term investors better manage their risk in their portfolios in a scaled way through technology. That is what drove our early investments in Aladdin and all the investments we made since to enhance our understanding of risk factors to deliver superior outcomes for our clients. GIP started with a similar focus in the infrastructure space. Understanding operational risks and the factors and forces driving business efficiencies like BlackRock's focused on understanding risk and fixed income GIP built an active approach to analyzing and addressing operational risk. My partners and I had the privilege of pioneering the mortgage-backed securities market. Bayo and his GIP partners, in my opinion, pioneered modern infrastructure investing in private markets. And many of the BlackRock and GIP founders grew up in the same firms early in their careers, where we created common routes from shared experiences, most of them good, sometimes bad, and close flight relationships. The integration of BlackRock's existing infrastructure platform with GIP will result in a market-leading comprehensive infrastructure business with truly differentiated origination and asset management capabilities. GIP will be highly complementary and has limited overlap by client and investment programs for BlackRock's existing leading franchises. These include diversified infrastructure, Infradebt, Infra solutions, climate infrastructure and decarbonization partners. BlackRock has invested originally and has invested organically and inorganically growing our infrastructure platform, which has $50 billion in AUM, having tripled since our acquisition of First Reserve in 2017. BlackRock has already demonstrated our access to some of the largest pools of capital in the world. We're winning deals like ADNOC pipeline transaction and being chosen to partner with sovereign wealth funds and governments on significant climate infrastructure strategy. We have the sourcing capabilities, but greater AUM scale will enable us to have more sizable positions. The planned combination of GIP with BlackRock will accelerate investment scale enabling us to grow faster. BlackRock's deep relationships with clients, corporates, governments and sovereign wealth funds can accelerate investment opportunities. GIP's own lending proprietary deal flow -- leading proprietary deal flow has been supported by investment sizes, relationships and strong track record including a long history of successful JVs with large industrial partners. GIP's deals span the world and sectors. Their investments include Gatwick Airport, Edinburgh Airport and Sydney Airport. And Cypress One Data Center in the Port of Melbourne and several other major renewable platforms. Through the future combination of BlackRock and GIP will be able to connect our clients with bigger and better opportunities while also accelerating growth, diversifying revenues and generating earnings for our shareholders. Like Rob and I, Bayo and his partners are all founders. We're excited about the opportunity to have new partners and new colleagues. I'm proud that the consideration of this transaction consists of approximately 75% of BlackRock stock. GIP founders will become among the largest shareholders of BlackRock, and we plan to have Bayo join our Board of Directors post closing of our transaction. There is no question spiritually or financially about whether we are long-term partners. We have the same interest as significant shareholders alongside our broader shareholder base. Our One BlackRock culture has been central to our success over the last 35 years and cultural alignment has been core throughout our history of successful M&A. Here are founding to today, our firm is purpose-driven, focused on clients, focus on risk management and powered by data and technology, bringing our two businesses together result in an influx of top senior private market talent to BlackRock. GIP founders will lead our combined infrastructure platform with teams of talented investors and business builders. They bring with them a strong investment and performance culture and a commitment to working across One BlackRock. I'm confident we'll be looking back on today as another transformational moment in the BlackRock history. In a similar way, when we could look back at our acquisition of BGI, Merrill Lynch Investment Management and our early days building Aladdin. Our ability to adapt and to evolve and to grow has generated a total return of 9,000% for our shareholders since our IPO in 1999. That is well in excess of our S&P return of 490% and representative of a business model serving all our stakeholders. I truly believe we're better positioned than ever before in our history, and I'm very optimistic on the coming years ahead and the opportunities ahead for all of us. BlackRock was built on optimism. When we founded BlackRock, we knew clients would be at the center of everything we do. We had a deep conviction in the long-term growth and the importance of the capital markets in principle and practice, those beliefs remain core to BlackRock today. We are more connected to our clients as ever, thousands of clients on behalf of millions of individuals around the world have entrusted BlackRock with $1.9 trillion of net new business over the last five years. Thousands more use our technology to support the growth and commercial agility of their own business, years of organic growth alongside a long-term growth of the capital markets underpins our $10 trillion of client assets, which grew in 2023 by over $1.4 trillion. In good times and bad times, whether investors are adding or reducing risk, our consistent industry-leading organic growth demonstrates that clients are consolidating more of their portfolios with BlackRock. In 2023, our clients awarded us with $289 billion of net new assets during this period of rapid change and significant portfolio de-risking. BlackRock's differentiated business model has enabled us to continue to grow with our clients and maintain positive organic base fee growth. We've grown regardless of the market backdrop and even if most of the industry has experienced outflows. I think back to 2016 and 2018 when uncertainty and cautious sentiment impacted investment behaviors among institutional and individuals. Many clients de-risked and move to cash. BlackRock stayed connected with our clients. We stayed rigorous in driving investment performance, innovating new products, technologies and providing advice on portfolio design. Once clients were ready to move more actively step back in to stepping back into the markets, they did it with BlackRock, leading to new record flows for client flows and organic base growth at or above our targets. As we've seen before, when investors were ready to put money back to work, they did it with BlackRock. Flows and organic base fee growth accelerated at the end of the year. We generated $96 billion of total net inflows in the fourth quarter, and we entered 2024 with great momentum. I spent much of 2023 on the road, meeting with clients around the world, and I plan to do the same thing in 2024 starting this month. Our partnership approach and the performance we deliver is resonating both in markets where we have a long-standing presence and those where our profile is just beginning and strengthening. Companies and clients increasingly want to work with BlackRock. For companies where we are investors, they appreciate that we are a long-term consistent capital. We invest early and stay invested through cycles, whether it's debt or equity, pre-IPO or post IPO. Companies recognize the uniqueness of our global relationships, our brand and our expertise across businesses, markets and industries. This makes us a very valuable partner and in turn it enables us to be involved in their sourcing and in performance that we provide for our clients. For example, in November, our diversified infrastructure franchise invested $550 million in Stratos, a commercially scaled direct air capture facility in Texas which is expected to be the largest in the world upon completion. Through our funds joint venture partner, Occidental Petroleum, we are providing our clients with investment access to a bespoke energy infrastructure project. This is just a latest example of our sourcing and execution on numerous distinctive deals for clients over the last 18 months. In the United States, we partnered with AT&T and GigaPower JV and invested in Jupiter Power. Beyond the U.S., examples include such investments of Brazeau in Brazil, First Air in South Korea, Acacia Energy in Australia, like Takata Wind Farm in Kenya, just to name a few. Last month, we announced an innovative partnership with Altera that we will see a $2 billion investment in the climate opportunities across BlackRock's private debt and infrastructure equity strategies. This is one of our largest ever private markets mandates. It adds on to our very strong track record investing in the transition, including in emerging markets and extend our over $100 billion transition investment platform. BlackRock's global network of relationships, data, analytics and flexible, adaptable capital means we could source unique deals for our clients and mobilize assets and accelerate innovation and economic growth. Our active investment insights, our expertise, our strong investment performance, similarly differentiating BlackRock to the markets. We saw nearly $60 billion of active net inflows in 2023 compared to an industry outflows. Across our active franchise, BlackRock has delivered durable investment performance with 87% and 92% of fundamental equity and taxable fixed income AUM above benchmarks or peer medium for the past 5-year period. In ETF, BlackRock generated an industry-leading $186 billion of net inflows for 2023. Our long-term leadership of the ETF industry is another testament to our global platform and our deep connectivity with our clients. BlackRock is the most scaled, diversified ETF provider in the U.S. and globally. We are bringing the ETF benefits of liquidity, of price discovery and market efficiencies and access to investors around the world. Nearly half of the 2023 iShares net inflows were from ETFs listed internationally in local markets, led by our European iShares net inflows of $70 billion. BlackRock has the #1 share of the European ETF market where industry flows were up 70% in 2023. Catalyst trends that we saw in the U.S. years ago, like the growth of the fee-based advisory and model controllers are just beginning to take root in Europe. BlackRock takes a client-first approach to product innovation, and we continue to develop products that are suited for the new investment regime. For example, we launched 19 active ETFs in 2023, leveraging the benefits of the ETF structure to help clients reach the outcomes they seek. Some of these strategies provide access to the insights of our active portfolio managers such as Reader and Tony DeSpirito, other use an option strategy to generate income or provide greater downside protection, such as our buy right and buffer ETFs. And in the fourth quarter, we launched a series of LightPath Target Date ETF to provide an easier way to save for retirement, especially for the many Americans who lack access to a workplace retirement plan. Just yesterday, the iShares Bitcoin ETF began trading in another landmark moment that advances ETF innovation and expand access to Bitcoin for investors. We will continue to provide more convenient and cost-effective investment access across asset classes through innovation, through risk management and technology. Aladdin is the operating system united all of BlackRock and its fundamental and foundational to how we serve our clients across our platform. It is the key technology that powers BlackRock and it also powers many of our clients. The need for integrated data, integrated risk analytics and the whole portfolio views across public and private markets is driving the ACV growth of Aladdin. In 2023, we generated $1.5 billion in technology service revenues. Clients are looking to grow and expand with Aladdin, reflecting in strong harvesting activities with over 50% of the Aladdin sales being multiproduct. Through its dynamic ecosystem of over 130,000 users, the Aladdin platform is constantly in the state of innovation. Investments in Aladdin AI copilots, enhancements and openness supporting ecosystem partnerships and advancing whole portfolio solutions, including private markets and digital assets are going to further augment the value of Aladdin for our clients. We led our industry by both being an agent for and adapting to change. Our best years have followed tough years. And just as we continue to innovate and evolve our business to stay ahead of our clients, we are also evolving our organization and evolving our leadership team. As Martin mentioned, we undertook restructuring efforts that were designed to ensure we are aligning resources to our greatest growth opportunities and client needs. As part of this, a number of valued clients, valued colleagues and friends to part of the firm. We truly appreciate the contributions that they made to BlackRock and wish all of them well. We are continuing to anticipate with clients' needs and shaping BlackRock so they could be getting our insights, our solutions and the outcomes that they expect from us. As we look ahead, the rerisking of client portfolios will create tremendous prospects for both our public and private market franchises. These are the times where investors are making wholesale changes to the way they build portfolios, and BlackRock is leading the way in helping investors build the portfolio of the future, one that integrates public markets and private markets, and it's digitally enabled. We view that these changes are a big catalyst for BlackRock, we set ourselves up to be a structural grower in the years ahead with the diversified platform we built. And the need for integration data, technology and risk management will continue to drive demand for Aladdin. BlackRock was founded on the belief in the long-term growth of the capital markets. Our success has been shaped by a number of those calls and how we would evolve. Our client needs have always been our compass as we listen to them today, we have our eyes on themes we believe that will define the next decade of asset management. The continuum of blurring the lines across product structure, the unprecedented need for new infrastructure driving inflation protected current cash flow long-duration returns, the accelerating capital markets and asset management industry around the world. We are positioning ourselves ahead of these transformations by making three major changes in how we work and how we deliver for each and one of our clients. First, we're creating a new strategic global product and solution business that will work across all their investment strategies, asset classes, fund structures while enabling our ETF and index business across the firm. We have always viewed ETFs as a technology that facilitates investing and just as Aladdin technologies has become core to asset management, so has have ETFs. That's why we believe embedding our ETFs and index businesses across the entire firm, and that will accelerate further growth of iShares and every investment strategy within BlackRock. We are looking to the future, and we believe that ETF revolution that iShares lead will only continue to accelerate as BlackRock turns -- as our clients turn at BlackRock for ETFs as a preferred vehicle for investing in strategic and strategies of all types. If you can make an ETF or a Bitcoin, my Gosh, you can make an ETF or anything. Second, we are creating a new international business structure to provide a unified leadership to allow us to be simultaneously more global, but much deeper local in a fast-growing international markets. BlackRock has been a central player in the growth of the global capital markets, and this is including the developing of retirement solutions in every market around the world and bringing the benefits of ETFs to every market to assist them in growing their markets. And third, we are realigning our private markets business to further leverage the potential of GIP and to meet the growing needs of our clients for infrastructure and other private market investments. All of us at BlackRock have a lot of hard work and a lot of exciting work ahead of us. We have a track record of quick, intense and successful integrations. We'll be more naval and aligned with clients through our new architecture and with the aim to be delivering better experiences, better performance, better outcomes for all of our clients worldwide. I see excitement and incredible amount of energy in our offices. While there's a lot of hard work to come, there really is a bright future for all of us ahead of us. Over the past few months, we've seen decidingly more positive sentiment and tone in markets and among clients that are very optimistic will carry into 2024. And once again, we look forward to beginning this next BlackRock chapter with our new partners and colleagues at GIP. We entered 2024 with $10 trillion of our client money, we entered the year with strong growth momentum, and we entered 2024 as an organization positioned in the future for growth and prosperity. At BlackRock, we are energized by a never done attitude. And today, I really feel that we're just getting started. I see greater opportunity for BlackRock I see greater opportunity for our clients, and I see great opportunities for our shareholders today, tomorrow and stronger than ever before. Let me open it up for questions. As I mentioned, Bayo will also participate in the Q&A. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America. Laurence Fink : Good morning, Craig. Happy New Year. Craig Siegenthaler : I hope everyone is doing well, and congrats on the deal. Laurence Fink : Thank you. Craig Siegenthaler : My question is actually on the GIP deal. So this is a high-quality business, strong track record. It's big enough to go public, stay independent, but they chose BlackRock, and they decided to take stock. So I imagine gross synergies were a driver. So my question is really on the strategic rationale. How can BlackRock's global distribution platform accelerate their growth? And do you see specific client segments, and I'm thinking private wealth, where you see low-hanging fruit? Laurence Fink : Great question. I think it will be answered by me and Bayo. So let me once again go over the strategic rationale. As I said in my prepared speeches, and I think Bayo would echo everything I'm going to be saying. We're just beginning, I would say, a very bright investment horizon for infrastructure. And as I said, deficits matter. More and more governments are going to have more difficulties to do deficit financing. And in turn, more and more governments are even focusing on doing more public, private. I think GIP's success in the U.K. and Australia are very good examples of working with governments in terms of helping them sell assets. But at the same time, using the private sector to improve the quality of services and GIP has been a leader in that. I believe that a lot of capital that it could be needed as we digitize everything, the need for upgrading our electrical power grids worldwide is a must. The capital associated with that is going to be enormous. In my travels around the world, more governmental leaders are talking about the need for energy independence. And they look -- if they have some form of energy, they're going to be trying to be doing more of that, but more importantly or just as importantly, the amount of capital they need to provide -- to develop more decarbonizing investments in wind and solar, to provide broader energy for their growth in their economies is very important. If we are going to decarbonize the world, the amount of capital and infrastructure is going to be very necessary. If we are going to be more and more reliant on interconnectivity worldwide, the need for the upgrading of ports is vital. As more and more human beings grow into a middle-class lifestyle, the demand for air travel grows dramatically, the need for high-quality airports grows dramatically. And so that's just one segment. And then when you think about corporations. Corporations historically disposed of divisions to private equity. We see more corporations instead of disposing divisions, selling portions of those divisions maybe keeping a major part of that, selling parts of their infrastructure or partnering with companies in their infrastructure, like the deal we did with Occidental Petroleum for Air Capture, the transaction BlackRock did with AT&T on 5G build-out across the United States. These are just a few examples, pipelines in the Gulf region. And so the industrial logic is pretty large in our opinion, that the next 10 years is going to be greatly about the expansion of the global capital markets and infrastructure. And so we believe the demand for capital in infrastructure will only to grow larger than larger. And as I said a few times in my prepared remarks. Having a long duration, high coupon inflation-protected asset is a very strong asset class for all of retirement funds. But importantly, as you mentioned wealth, we believe a great opportunity to providing to the wealth management products, these types of products so they can enjoy these type of long-duration assets. They're going to throw off these above what I would say, public market returns. And so I believe across the board, sovereign funds, both retirements, both in the defined contribution space and the defined benefit space, across the board, these are the preferred instruments. In my calls with clients today, I can tell you more and more sovereign wealth funds, see infrastructure as a major growth area in their asset allocation. I'm going to let Bayo talk about BlackRock and us. I would only just say at Black -- from the BlackRock side, we only had one target. We only had one organization where we believe in their business model. It was only one organization where we believe we had such complementary skill sets. And then most importantly, it's a team of leaders under Bayo that we believed in. And we believe that will create real opportunities for BlackRock, and I'm pleased that Bayo will be joining the BlackRock board post closing. And importantly, we look forward to having the intellectual capital that GIP is bringing alongside our superb team and infrastructure. Adebayo Ogunlesi : What I'll add to that is I think Larry is exactly right. We are about leading the golden age of infrastructure investment. And so the question for us at GIP was always how do we accelerate what we do. We're going to keep trying to do what we are doing by ourselves, but we thought that looking at it from both point of view, from the point of view of infrastructure investing, Larry is right. We have tremendous tailwinds that are going to drive the demand for private capital infrastructure investing. On our client side, the pension funds are sovereign well funds the asset managers, infrastructure is what they want to invest in. They like the fact that infrastructure has very high yields, the average yield on our mature funds over the last 15 years annually is 8%, okay? That's in a world of zero interest rates. We generated 8% yield. They like the fact that these assets are uncorrelated to other asset classes. Think about what's going on today. Infrastructure assets are doing very well. We have 19 companies in our flagship funds, 12 of them had double-digit asset EBITDA growth last year, five of them, single-digit EBITDA growth. The only one that didn't was because it sold assets. Compare that to the other real asset class, commercial real estate, okay? So investors love the fact that these asset classes are not correlated. They like the fact there's a lot of downside protection, right? Because they provide essential services, okay? And so these are all sort of congruence that we thought how do we accelerate what we're doing. And the marriage with BlackRock is a marriage made in heaven. Rob Kapito said this is a deal where one plus one equals four. I'm not sure whether it's three or four, but I know Rob is directionally correct, okay? When we look at the two businesses, they're very complementary. BlackRock has built a terrific infrastructure business. They've tripled the size of it over the last years that they've owned it. But they make mid-market or mid-cup investments. We make large cup investments. We have a terrific infrastructure debt business. It's mostly investment grade, ours is mostly below investment grade. We have capital solutions business that we don't have. So if you put these two businesses together, we can go to clients, large cap clients, mid-cap clients, offer them a complete array of solutions. You want investment-grade debt, we've got. You want high method investment grade debt, we've got it, okay? And so we think this will allow us to accelerate the rate at which we can provide investment opportunities for our clients. And look, it's always nice to think you're right. The proof of the pudding is what people say when you call them. And as Larry mentioned, he and I have been on the phone with our clients. And this is what they've said. This is a fantastic transaction. One, for us as clients two, for BlackRock and three for GIP. Now I wish I have known that put BlackRock ahead of GIP because then going to ask for a higher price, but it's all worked out very well. And I think the other thing people should recall is -- and I hope Martin and Larry don't mind me saying this. We are taking 75% of the consideration in stock. The initial offer from BlackRock was actually a low model stuff, okay? We like the fact that BlackRock thinks their stock is undervalued. And the fact that we are taking 75% in BlackRock stock tells us we also think it's undervalue. And the final thing I'd say is we actually looked at -- Larry talked about how the call will be very different. I think that's absolutely true. But we've also looked at what BlackRock has actually done when it has acquired businesses. Interesting congruent, iShares or BGI, three trillion assets when they bought it today, 10 billion. Okay. So now it's 3.5 okay. Okay. So that's actually a little bit scary. Infrastructure, they triple the sites. So it's clear to me the supplemental message is we have to at least double the size of our infrastructure portfolio going forward. I hope that answers your question. Operator : Go next to Michael Cyprus with Morgan Stanley. Michael Cyprys : Hey, good morning. Happy New Year. Congratulations on the transaction. Just curious what are the plans for integration. If you could talk about that a bit? And any particular lessons that you take away from other private market transactions, acquisitions that we've seen across the industry as you think about driving success here? Martin Small : Thanks, Mike. Happy New Year. We have a really strong track record of successful integrations at BlackRock. And we believe this transaction will prove to be another success. I think Larry and Bayo spoke very much about the common cultures, the shared vision, the opportunities, the growth with clients. We know that GIP shares the same laser focus on clients and values that we do rigorous investment process in us and the structuring of the transaction was also done to reduce strain on teams and help facilitate the transition into new leadership in a more diversified platform. Some of the organizational changes that we also announced today are going to help us be more nimble and aligned with our clients. We've reorganized businesses for the future with the aim of delivering better experience performance and outcomes for clients. The thing I'd add is Larry talked about in his prepared remarks, our integrated operating platform, track record and integrations. We have built our private markets business with substantial inorganic activity going back all the way to the early 2000s and we built a lot of the existing infrastructure business that we have today, also through inorganic transactions that have been successfully integrated. So we've been doing this for 10 years in the infrastructure space and look forward to accelerating it with Bayo and his partners and the entire GIP team who have substantial experience in business building and alternatives. And the last thing I'll say just about integration is I think in many ways, this is a less complex integration in that these are highly complementary platforms that Bayo just talked you through in terms of some of the differences in investing acumen and solutions on the equity side, on the debt side. And so in many ways, we have limited amounts of overlap, both in clients as well as in the characteristic of our investment solutions. In many ways, that makes the integration, I think, nimble and easier to position with clients and more agile for us to bring the platforms together. Laurence Fink : Let me just add one thing. Bayo and I are going to be on the road a lot. And we are going to -- with the combined organization, we have an amazing story. And we are going to be telling everyone the story from the corporation sides to governments. I just got an e-mail from a big government and saying, okay, there are things we could do more. So that was a nice e-mail that I just received. But I do believe our key is making sure our clients and the investors that have invested in BlackRock and GIP that they understand the merits of the combination and that they think this is even better for them. And our job is to make sure that everybody sees it and we execute that way. But we are very excited about this, and I look forward to being on the road with Bayo. Operator : We'll go next to Michael Brown with KBW. Michael Brown : Maybe I'll just condition to the organic growth outlook here as we think about 2024. Obviously, there's been a lot of optimism around the acceleration of the fixed income flows and with what seems to be a more visible interest rate trajectory. So I had to hear about maybe some of your early conversations you're having with institutional clients regarding allocations and what they're -- and how you expect that to progress through 2024? And when you think about the fixed income inflows, where should we think about where that money will kind of shift from? Is it from the money market funds? Or is it kind of the ownership of direct securities moving into funds or from bank deposits? Just love some commentary on that. Martin Small : Great, Mike, it's Martin. I'll start just on some of the organic growth outlook and then Rob will talk a little bit about your specific fixed income. In 2023, obviously, we delivered $289 billion of total net inflows and 1% organic base fee growth. We continue to have conviction here in our 5% base fee target over the long term. We've reached it on average over the last five years and met or exceeded it in six of the last 10. And importantly, I think the way our shareholders evaluate us, years marked by significant market volatility, 2016, 2018, '22, '23, we generated positive organic base fee growth. And these last two years, no doubt have been more challenged on base fee growth through tough markets, but we've continued to generate positive growth while the industry has seen decay. We don't aim, as you know, to be the fastest grower in any quarter or any year. We aim to deliver more consistent and durable organic growth through market and over the long term. I would note we saw excellent momentum to finish the fourth quarter. As I mentioned in my remarks, in November and December, we generated an annualized 6% organic base fee growth rate, and that, to me, suggests that we can trend towards our 5% through the cycle target as rates stabilize and the market is more constructive. This is some of the best organic base fee growth momentum we've seen since 2021. I do want to flag two things. The first of which is I'd particularly flagged that iShares in Europe is really well positioned, and I think it's going to be a bigger part of the organic base fee growth story over time. European ETF industry flows are up 70% year-on-year. European iShares had almost 50% flow market share. And a lot of the long-term trends that propelled the U.S. industry to high growth rates are taking hold in Europe. So I think it's just the beginning. We also see this combination with GIP and the potential for higher management fee growth in illiquid alternatives as bolstering, diversifying our overall organic base fee growth trajectory. So I'll give it to Rob on fixed income. Robert Kapito : Yes. So I'll just add just two things, Mike. I wake up every morning salivating about the $7 trillion that's sitting in money market accounts that's waiting to move. And in order for it to move, you have to have a wide plate of products. That's what we have been developing in client solutions. A lot of this is going to come from money that's flowing into model portfolios, which we are the leader in. And a lot of it is going to come from digital wealth, which is a $17 billion global market. It's growing at 15% and ETFs are becoming the investors' preferred vehicle with access to investments. And then lastly, as we blend the active and passive business together, we're going to see a lot of active fixed income portfolios move into an ETF wrapper. We're the leader in ETF wrappers as well. So I think there's a huge, huge runway for fixed income and really the wind is right behind our back for that. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks. Good morning. Happy New Year. Maybe just to ask about the infrastructure, another angle of this. Just your outlook for fundraising over the next one to two years, given your -- the products that you have and your thoughts around the growth in that $760 million of fee-related revenue. And maybe just the timing of it, I think you have -- you said it a successful fund of 2019, that was a $22 billion fund. So are you in the market now for a fund or will soon be and do you expect to exceed that? And then also just the -- in that retail channel, the desire to create democratized infrastructure products for retail investors that have some liquidity features? Martin Small : Thanks. I'll start, and then I'm sure there'll be some additional color. First of all, clients continue very much to increase their allocations to illiquid alternatives in private markets. These are the client needs that drove our acquisition of eFront. They're the moves that bring us here today with GIP. And the moves that we've made organically and inorganically to build market-leading alternatives capabilities. At BlackRock, our alternatives client assets now total $330 billion, including liquid credit. Our private market to liquid alternatives have reached $166 billion in assets with about $140 billion in fee-paying AUM. And private credit, private equity solutions and infrastructure were the main drivers of Q4 and full year flows with $4 billion and about $14 billion, respectively. Since 2021, we've had excellent momentum in our private markets fundraising. We've raised approximately $96 billion of gross capital across our platform, and we continue to see good momentum with clients. We're building on vintages and strong track records, so we can scale successor funds. We expect our primary growth drivers, as I said, over the next three to five years to be infrastructure and credit private equity solutions, where we've built great franchises. We continue to see terrific opportunities. Larry and Bayo have really talked about what some of these are. But I do think BlackRock has a durable competitive advantage that's been built through our public markets, relationships with global corporates, our advisory work with sovereigns in the public sector around the world as well as our technology capabilities of the year and bringing together a lot of this public and private sector long-term objectives, officially moving capital to key drivers of industrial transformation. That's often when BlackRock at its best. So we're very optimistic and energized by our capital formation opportunities. particularly with our new partners at GIP. And I think as Larry and Bayo said, they're both going to be traveling a lot. So I'm looking forward to how those sessions, I think, will help us grow together. But importantly, I think really bring innovative solutions to corporates, through partnerships and unique public-private opportunities for us that will help grow our illiquid alternatives base and assets. Laurence Fink : GIP is in the final stages of raising a very large fund, which because it's in the stages of raising the money that we cannot talk about it. So stand by. But it's in the late stages of fundraising. Robert Kapito : The other thing is that we are very good at structuring product for the individual investor, the wealth investor, and I'm looking forward to working with Bayo's team to figure out how our teams can get together and democratize those investments because, as Larry mentioned before, this is such a perfect retirement product long duration, good yield, equity upside, it's going to open up new areas of growth that we have not tapped yet. Operator : Next question comes from Brennan Hawken of UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Happy New Year. So curious, a question on the deal here. is this a deal that you would consider transformational? Or is this more indicative of a desire to continue to add more all its capabilities going forward? And then one, just sort of a little bit more granular, the roughly $400 million in FRE is based on 2024 forecast from what I can understand. Can you give maybe an indication about where GIP's FRE was for 2023? Martin Small : Thanks, Brennan, for the question. It's Martin. First of all, this is unassailably a transaction that we consider transformational. Most definitely, our clients feel its transformation. The volume of e-mails, I can see on Larry screen suggests to me that it's transformational. And it's what we've talked about is transformational transactions. It's transformational in terms of the capabilities that BlackRock has and can offer to clients and it's transformational in terms of the financial and earnings impact to the firm. So those two axes are how we've always measured transformational in terms of our capabilities and in terms of the financial impact, and on both fronts, this is definitely a transformational transaction. GIP has generated really strong performance as well as FRE growth. I'm not going to comment on the 2023, it will let the 2024 speak for itself. But we continue to see great growth opportunities in terms of being able to expand fee paying AUM across the illiquid alternatives platform with the infrastructure as a priority as well as growing base fees in a way that adds to our 5% organic growth objective through the cycle. Laurence Fink : Let me just add on some of our small and large transformational deals. Transformational deals could be as large as a BGI transaction. But if you remember, everyone, when we did that transaction, most people hated it. They did not see the merits, did not see the marriage of active and passive, did not think cultures can merge, did not understand ETFs as a technology. And as Bayo was saying earlier, what we bought BGI was under $300 billion in iShares assets, and now it's over $3.5 trillion. In the past 10 years, we acquired First Reserve when it had about $3 billion, and it's more than tripled its assets in a number of years in terms of infrastructure. Just recently, we acquired Aperio and the assets are up 95% since we acquired Aperio. And then just as importantly, in technology buying EBITDA-Front, we made a statement that good portfolio analytics are going to become very important, not just public market analytics. And we are now the leading technology platform, both in privates and publics. And you dovetail all of this is it's all wrapped around our global view of where the global capital markets are doing. The technology needs for markets and the movement. And I do believe all of this is going to be playing out. As I said in my prepared remarks, I truly believe infrastructure and Bayo reconfirm that infrastructure is at the very beginnings as the great need of capital and because of the type of asset it is, the demand for this type of investment is really going to be strong. And we believe, and this is what our statement is, we believe the next 10 years is going to be a lot about infrastructure. And this will become more and more of a major component of the entire private markets ecosystem. Operator : The next question comes from Patrick Davitt of Autonomous Research. Patrick Davitt : Hi, good morning, everyone. Happy New Year. How's it going? You guys have been pushing this idea that the $7 trillion in money funds will start to rotate into risk assets for a while now. But the historical data we can see from past Fed cycle does not really show that, at least from what we can see. And it looks like last year's flows maybe came more from the bank deposits than risk positions. So what are you seeing maybe that we can't see that suggest this cycle will be different? And if rates really are higher for longer, can't both money funds and bonds win with $17 trillion still sitting in bank deposits? Robert Kapito : Yes. So it's Rob here. So the answer is it's going to be dependent upon rates and alternative investments. So I think history shows when the cycle stops, that's when people first start to re-risk. We saw about $40 billion come out of money market funds to us as people re-risk and then there's market volatility and it stops. So I think we have to get to what people will feel is the end of the cycle in rates, and then people will look. The benefit for us is then when they re-risk, they usually come into more precision investments, which are higher fee type investments and yield really matters. So I think if you look at it, there's a blurring between the bank deposits and the money markets, all dependent upon rates. But once that cycle stops and it's been a start and stop over the last year, at least, especially in the fourth quarter, but that's how we look at it. Operator : Your next will be our last question comes from Bill Katz from TD Cowen. William Katz : Good morning, everybody. Thank you, Larry. Happy New Year to you and the team. Congrats on the transaction. Sorry, my phone cut out a little earlier today, the hazards of working from home. So I missed a little bit of the Q&A earlier on. Maybe for Martin, perhaps just a little technical question at this point. As you sort of model out the modest accretion as you look forward, I was just sort of wondering, how do the economics on the performance fees work? It looks like you're keeping about 40% of the incremental opportunity. Wonder if you could just give us a sense of what kind of returns GIP has put up over time? And how does that flow down to performance fees? And then I would presume that as part of the guidance that this new fund that they're in the market for now that Larry is so intimate is going to be coming shortly would be part of the economics. And then when you say greater than the 50% FRE margin, can you sort of give us a little more sense on that? Can you [indiscernible] to back into the fee rate as well as the absolute margin? Martin Small : Thanks, Bill. I'm sorry, your phone wasn't working. So it's great to hear from you. Happy New Year. So as we said, we expect the transaction to be modestly accretive to EPS and operating margin in the first full year post close. We expect it to be accretive to long-term organic asset and base fee growth over time. We are adding -- we expect to be adding pro forma $400 million plus of post-tax margin accretive FRE as a result of the transaction. The transaction is structured so that we're crying 100% of the assets and business of GIP. So all of the future management base fees will be within the transaction perimeter. And that's where we derive our estimates for the 2024 and beyond FRE growth in the business. In terms of thinking about the fee rates, the fee rates are relatively comparable overall to the BlackRock illiquid alternatives, but think north of 100 basis points in terms of how you're modeling that out. As you noted in the deck that we posted to the Investor Relations website, the transaction is that GIP owners and employees are keeping 100% of the carried interest for existing GIP funds and future funds will be 60% to the GIP teams and 40% to BlackRock. I'm not going to talk about fundraising or future funds, but we would expect those performance fees to come on in later years, not in the near term, given the trajectory for how vintages come on. And we'd expect improvement in the fee-related earnings growth over the next two years. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks? Laurence Fink : Thank you, operator. I want to thank everybody for joining our -- joining us this morning and for your interest in BlackRock. Our fourth quarter and full year performance is a direct result of our steadfast commitment to serving clients and evolving for our long-term needs of our clients. Our acquisition of GIP and the organizational changes will be transformational and accelerating our growth ambitions and delivering value for our clients and for our shareholders. Hopefully, everyone could hear that we are incredibly excited about the opportunities ahead of us. the opportunity of having partners like Bayo and his team, and we believe we have never been in a stronger position to grow with the global capital markets and to grow and being a very large client serving firm and helping our clients meet their future needs. Everyone, have a very good quarter and try to enjoy it as much as possible. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Katie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated First Quarter 2024 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Martin S. Small; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. All lines have been made on mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference. Chris Meade : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn it over to Martin. Martin Small : Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the first quarter of 2024. Before I turn it over to Larry, I'll review our financial performance and business results. Our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as adjusted financial results, I'll be focusing primarily on our as adjusted results. BlackRock's first quarter results reflect sustained momentum across our entire platform. We ended the quarter with record AUM of nearly $10.5 trillion and one of the strongest opportunity sets ahead across multiple growth engines, including technology, outsource solutions and private markets. Momentum is accelerating and we have line of sight into a breadth of significant mandates in investment management and technology, spanning client channels and geographies. Teams across BlackRock are energized and organized to execute on these opportunities and deliver BlackRock's platform to clients through world-class client service. We've built BlackRock to be a structural grower with industry leadership in secular growth areas like ETFs, private markets, model portfolios and technology. With supportive markets and more optimistic sentiment from clients, we're confident in our ability to both grow assets on behalf of clients and drive profitable growth for our shareholders. First quarter long-term net inflows of $76 billion continue to lead the industry, driving positive organic base fee growth alongside double-digit growth year-over-year in revenue and earnings, as well as 180 basis points of margin expansion. Excluding low fee institutional index equity flows, we saw a $100 billion of long-term net inflows in the quarter. As equity markets powered to record highs in the first quarter, investors who were waiting in cash missed out on significant returns across broader markets. With long-term investing time in the markets is often more important than market timing. Although cash remains an attractive safe haven with the prospect of fewer rate cuts for 2024, the nearly 30% increase in equities over the last year continues to propel clients towards re-risking into stocks and bonds. Clients choose BlackRock for performance. They continue to consolidate more of their portfolios with us, which is driving our growth premium. With more clarity on interest rates and a supportive market backdrop, the assets we manage on behalf of our clients, our units of trust, ended the quarter up $1.4 trillion from a year ago, an increase of 15%. Organic asset and basic fee growth, again, accelerated into the end of the quarter and we see broad base momentum growing across client channels and regions. In the first quarter, BlackRock generated long-term net inflows of $76 billion partially offset by seasonal outflows from institutional money market funds. Total annualized organic base fee growth of 1% reflected seasonally softer flows earlier in the quarter before coming back to target in March. First quarter revenue of $4.7 billion increased 11% year-over-year, driven by the impact of market appreciation over the last 12 months on average AUM and higher performance fees and technology services revenue. Operating income of $1.8 billion was up 17% and earnings per share of $9.81 was 24% higher versus a year ago, also reflecting higher non-operating income. Non-operating results for the quarter included $90 million of net investment gains, driven primarily by mark-to-market non-cash gains on our unhedged sheet capital investments and minority investment [in invest debt] (ph). Our as adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 23% and included discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vest in the first quarter of each year. We continue to estimate that 25% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2024, though the actual effective tax rate may differ because of non-recurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation. First quarter base fee in securities lending revenue of $3.8 billion was up 8% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially driven by the positive impact of market beta on average AUM and positive organic base fee growth. On an equivalent day count basis, our annualized effective fee rate was 3/10 of a basis point lower compared to the fourth quarter. This was mainly due to the relative outperformance of lower fee U.S. equity markets, client preferences for lower fee U.S. exposures and lower securities lending revenue. Performance fees of $204 million increased from a year ago, primarily reflecting higher revenue from alternatives. Quarterly technology services revenue was up 11% compared to a year ago, reflecting sustained demand for our Aladdin technology offerings. Annual contract value or ACV increased 9% year-over-year. Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, earnings recognized from minority investments accounted for under equity method will be presented as part of our non-operating results. Advisory and other revenue increased from a year ago, primarily reflecting this change. In addition, as many of you know, we updated the presentation of expense line items by including a new sales asset and account income statement caption. This category includes distribution and servicing costs, direct fund expense and sub-advisory and other sales asset and account-based expense. Sub-advisory and other expense, which are variable non-compensation expenses associated with asset and revenue growth was previously reported within general and administration expense. We believe this change provides investors a clearer view of both BlackRock's variable non-compensation expense and G&A, which represents more fixed costs. It represents how we'll execute on our financial rubric of aligning investment spend with our highest conviction growth areas, variabilizing more of our expense base and generating fixed cost scale. Total expense increased 8% year-over-year, reflecting higher compensation, G&A and sales asset and account expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up 11%, primarily reflecting higher incentive compensation as a result of higher operating income and performance fees. G&A expense increased 6% due to the timing of technology investment spend in the prior year. Sequentially, G&A expense decreased 12%, reflecting timing of technology investment spend and seasonally higher marketing and promotional expense in the fourth quarter. While one quarter's results can be impacted by timing of spend, we expect technology to be one of our primary areas of investment within G&A. Sales asset and account expense increased 5% compared to a year ago, primarily driven by higher direct fund expense. Direct fund expense was up 7% year-over-year, mainly due to higher average index AUM. Sequentially, direct fund expense increased due to higher average index AUM in the current quarter and higher rebates that seasonally occurred in the fourth quarter. Our first quarter as adjusted operating margin of 42.2% was up 180 basis points from a year ago. As markets improve, we remain committed to driving operating leverage and profitable growth. BlackRock's industry leading organic growth is a direct result of the disciplined investments we've made consistently through market cycles. Looking forward, we'll continue to prioritize investments with differentiated organic growth potential or that will expand operating leverage through enhanced scale. In line with our guidance in January and excluding the impact of global infrastructure partners and related transaction costs, at present, we would expect our headcount to be broadly flat in 2024 and we would also expect a low to mid-single-digits percentage increase in 2024 core G&A expense. Our capital management strategy remains consistent. We invest first, either to scale strategic growth initiatives or drive operational efficiency and then return excess cash to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. At times, we may make inorganic investments, where we see an opportunity to accelerate organic growth and support our strategic initiatives. Last month, we announced our agreement to acquire the remaining equity interest in SpiderRock Advisors, a leading provider of customized option overlay strategies in the U.S. wealth market. This transaction expands on BlackRock's minority investment in SpiderRock Advisors made in 2021 and builds on BlackRock's strong growth in personalized separately managed accounts via Aperio and ETF model portfolios. At present, we expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of this year, subject to customary closing conditions. In March, we issued $3 billion of debt to fund a portion of the cash consideration for our planned acquisition of GIP. Our offering consisted of three tranches of senior unsecured notes across 5, 10 and 30 year maturities. The offering was well received by fixed income investors, especially our inaugural 30 year bond. We currently have invested the proceeds of the offering at substantially the same rate as the cost of borrowing, effectively eliminating incremental cost of carrying additional debt prior to the close of the GIP transaction. We continue to target the third quarter of 2024 for the closing of the GIP transaction, which remains subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. We repurchase $375 million worth of common shares in the first quarter. At present, based on our capital spending plans for the year and subject to market conditions, we still anticipate repurchasing at least $375 million of shares per quarter for the balance of the year consistent with our January guidance. More positive sentiment from clients and markets persisted into the first quarter. Clients increasingly turned to BlackRock to reposition and redeploy across their portfolios. First quarter long-term net inflows of $76 billion were positive across active and index strategies as well as each of our client and product types. ETF net inflows of $67 billion were led by core equity and fixed income ETFs with net inflows of $37 billion and $18 billion respectively. These inflows were partially offset by seasonal tax trading related outflows from our U.S. style box exposure and precision ETFs. As you will hear from Larry, our Bitcoin IBIT saw surging demand after launching in January, gathering $14 billion of net inflows in the quarter. This is just the latest example of BlackRock\u2019s innovating to provide better access and transparency to a wider range of investment exposures. Retail net inflows of $7 billion were led by continued growth in Aperio as well as renewed demand for active fixed income. Financial advisors are increasingly looking to customize whole portfolios at scale, driving growth across our SMA and managed model platforms. Our partnership with in Envestnet is one channel powering flows through model portfolios. We saw our best growth sales month ever on the platform and year-to-date organic asset and revenue growth has more than doubled compared to this time last year. Sales on the platform aren't just accelerating, they are diversifying. We similarly saw record growth flows and custom models and record AUM and our global allocation models both of which have larger active components. Within SMAs, our previously mentioned acquisition of SpiderRock Advisors will further enhance our product offerings and provide even greater personalization across our wealth segments. Institutional active net inflows of $15 billion were driven by our LifePath target date franchise and outsourcing mandates. We see significant momentum across our whole portfolio capabilities. Our pipeline remains strong as more and more clients turn to BlackRock for outsourcing outflows of $13 billion were concentrated in low fee index equities, as several large clients rebalanced their portfolios amid significant equity market appreciation in the last six months. Our private markets franchise saw $1 billion of net inflows continued demand for our liquid offerings was offset by alpha generation for our clients, reflected in over $3 billion of fund monetization and LP distributions or change in fee basis, primarily for more seasoned private equity solutions programs. Finally, BlackRock's cash management platform saw $19 billion of net outflows in the first quarter in line with institutional money market industry trends. Our cash business can experience seasonal rotations in the first quarter as many institutional clients withdraw these liquid assets for operational purposes, including tax and bonus payments. Cash management flows were impacted by approximately $14 billion of net redemptions during the last week of March ahead of the Good Friday holiday. Outflows were driven by clients redeeming balances to have cash on hand during a time when many businesses are open, but the financial markets are closed. This phenomenon is not uncommon or unique to BlackRock. Balance has largely returned with approximately $20 billion of money market net inflows in the first week of April. BlackRock's differentiated business model has enabled us to continue to grow with our clients driving industry leading organic growth and margins. Looking ahead as markets trend to be more supportive and clients re-risk, we see significant opportunity to expand our market share and consolidate our position with clients. We've set ourselves up to be a structural grower with the diversified platform that we've built. Enthusiasm is growing, momentum's building across the platform. All of us at BlackRock are excited about our future and the growing opportunities for BlackRock, for our clients, for our employees and, of course, for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry. Laurence Fink : Thank you, Martin. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining the call. BlackRock is partnering with clients to navigate structural and secular changes in business models, technology, monetary and fiscal policies, always staying focused on each and every client goal. Through this connectivity, we are having richer conversations with clients than ever before about their whole portfolio and in many cases deepening our relationships with them. This is driving accelerating momentum with a strong pipeline that has some of the best breadth of opportunities across all our client channels and regions that we've ever seen. BlackRock's integrated investment technology advisory platform and durable performance are resonating. In my conversations with clients around the world, I'm hearing about how they want to put their money to work. But they want to do it differently than they did in the past. They want their portfolios to be more holistically blending public and private markets active in an index. They want their portfolios to be nimble, customized, text-enabled. They want to work with fewer providers or maybe just with one provider. BlackRock is the only asset manager that can partner in this way having the most diverse, integrated investment and technology platform in the industry. Clients around the world are choosing to do more with BlackRock and this is resonating in our results. But I'm actually more excited about the building momentum we're seeing across our entire platform. BlackRock's AUM ended the first quarter at a new record of nearly $10.5 trillion, up $1.4 trillion or 15% over the last 12 months. Also, at that time, BlackRock has entrusted BlackRock with than $236 billion of net new assets. BlackRock generated positive net flows across active and index and across all client types. And we grew our technology service revenues and ACV as clients leverage Aladdin to support investments, processes and in their entire platform. We've had a number of real large marquee wins in Aladdin and are working on a number of significant new opportunities. Momentum remains strong as we grow with new and existing clients. We continue to deliver sustained asset and technology services growth at scale. BlackRock's operating income was up 17% year-over-year and we increased our margin by 180 basis points. Earnings per share were up 24%. Activity is notably accelerating. As Martin said, we generated $76 billion of long-term net flows in the first quarter, which represents nearly 40% of last year's long-term flows in just the first three months of this year. And long-term net inflows across retail and ETFs and institutional active was actually $100 billion, which excludes the episodic institutional equity activity Martin mentioned. Some of these are public, some aren't, but over the last few months, we've been chosen for a breadth of mandate from both wealth and institutional clients across regions that will fund over future quarters and we're in active conversations on a number of unique broad-based opportunities, including several large mandates for Aladdin. There is still a record amount of cash on the sidelines and money market fund balances are now approaching $9 trillion. I think this stems from fear and uncertainty, but it's hard to achieve retirement or long-dated objectives by holding cash. Clients worldwide are coming to BlackRock for advice on where and how to deploy their capital and in many ways how to help them reduce that fear and putting that money to work. Being a growth company requires continued innovation, lots of investments and intense client focus. BlackRock has invested ahead of these themes, we believe will define the next decade of asset management. I see the greatest opportunities I've ever seen for BlackRock for our clients and for our shareholders and I'm very optimistic about the momentum into the rest of 2024 and beyond. The uncertain backdrop does not mean a lack of opportunities. Instead, we see great opportunities for investors across a number of structural trends with near-term catalysts. These include rapid advancements in technology and AI, the rewiring of globalization, accelerated economic growth in certain emerging markets and an unprecedented need for new infrastructure. BlackRock is connecting with clients to these opportunities and providing them the confidence to continually investing in the long run. In a world where clients are looking for more certainty, the higher coupon, longer duration returns of infrastructure private markets are increasingly becoming more attractive. Demand for all forms of infrastructure is surging around the world from telecom networks to power generation to transport hubs for data centers and new ways of securing energy. Over the last 12 months, BlackRock's infrastructure platform has delivered 19% organic asset growth. BlackRock's infrastructure franchise and our private markets business more broadly benefited from the firm's global footprint, our deep network of clients and distribution relationships and access to high-quality deal flow. As we spoke in January, we believe the planned combination of BlackRock's infrastructure platform with GIP will provide clients with access to market-leading investments and operating expertise across infrastructure private markets. We have a deep conviction that this planned combination will be another transformational moment for BlackRock. It will be another example in our long-term history of staying ahead of client needs, positioning ourselves against accelerated macro trends. I believe this structured private markets are approaching the upward trajectory of their J curve just as ETF did when we announced our acquisition of BGI and iShares nearly 15 years ago. We always viewed ETF as a technology that facilitated investing. Since our acquisition of iShares, BlackRock has led in expanding the market of ETFs by making them more accessible by delivering new asset classes like bonds, investment strategies like actives. As a result of that success, the ETFs evolved beyond what started as an indexing concept. It is recognized as an efficient structure for a range of all investment solutions. First quarter ETF net inflows of $67 billion reflected sustained demand across our client categories, led by core equity and bond ETFs. ETF flows demonstrated accelerating activity with March accounting for more than half of the quarterly net inflows and our flows in the month were 80% higher than the next largest issuer. We continue to innovate across our ETF platform to give our clients better access to the most diverse range of exposures in the industry. Our Bitcoin fund, which was launched in January was the fastest growing ETF in history and already has nearly $20 billion in AUM. Our active ETF drove $9 billion of net inflows in the first quarter led by our equity factor rotation and flexible income ETFs. These products offer alpha generation with some of our leading investors at BlackRock in a more efficient, more transparent ETF wrapper. Across BlackRock, we continue to scale our product offerings to democratize access to new strategies, increase transparency and drive cost efficiency. To that end, last month, we announced the launch of our first tokenize fund as well as our minority investment in Securitize, a blockchain-based tokenization platform. This builds on our existing digital asset strategy and we'll continue to innovate in new products and wrappers all with the aim of providing greater access and customization to each and every of our clients. We continue to see demand for customization with our own wealth business as financial advisers and their clients they serve increasingly turn to SMAs to personalize their portfolios. We acquired Aperio three years ago in anticipation of this trend and organic growth in that business has been over 20% since our acquisition. To further booster our SMA capabilities, we announced our planned acquisition of the remaining equity interest of SpiderRock, as Martin discussed. Among wealth clients, we are also seeking the renewed demand for our high-performing active fixed income strategies with particularly strength in high-yield and unconstrained bond funds. In the post-QE market, we see more opportunity ahead for active management with greater potential for selective risk taking to generate superior returns. Quarterly active net inflows of $15 billion reflects strength in systematic equity and fundamental fixed income, including the funding of several institutional outsourcing mandates. Across our active franchise, BlackRock has delivered durable investment performance with 82%, 90% and 93% of our fundamental equity, systematic equity and taxable fixed income AUM above benchmarks or peer medium for the last five years. Our active investment insights, our strong investment performance, our integrated Aladdin technology differentiates BlackRock and ultimately drives better outcomes for our clients. We first built Aladdin as a risk management enabler, empowering investors to better understand their portfolios through technology. Today, Aladdin is much more than that. Our clients are leveraging Aladdin as a whole enterprise operating system, connecting multiple asset classes, data, technology partners and a single platform. Aladdin's integrated offering continues to resonate with the majority of our sales this quarter, spanning multiple Aladdin products. We are in the late-stage conversation with several large potential Aladdin clients and we look forward to executing on more opportunities ahead to be bringing the benefits of Aladdin to new clients and by expanding relationships with our existing clients. From the early days of developing Aladdin to now managing nearly $10.5 trillion across our platform, our ambition has always been to help investors benefit from the growth of the capital markets and achieve financial futures that they seek. More than half of the assets we manage are related to retirement, making this an outcome central to many of our client conversations. BlackRock has been at the forefront of innovation and advocacy for retirement solutions for years. In fact, we pioneered the first target date fund called LifePath back in 1993, when we introduced the concept. It was a revolutionary, eliminating some of the guesswork for retirement savings by automatically adjusting their investment mix over the time frame. Fast forward 30 years, Target Date funds have become the most common default investment option in defined contribution plans in the United States, where we're entrusted to manage the retirement assets of 35 million Americans. We continue to evolve LifePath to help deliver the retirement outcome participants need. That has meant introducing LifePath options in new countries and in new wrappers such as LifePath, Target Date ETFs we launched last year. Our LifePath Target Date franchise now has nearly $470 billion in assets and has risen over $115 billion in assets just over the last five years. In addition to helping people save for retirement, we also work to expand the LifePath solution to help people spend throughout their increasingly longer retirement. Society focuses a tremendous amount on helping people live longer and healthier lives, but spend just a fraction of that time and effort on helping them afford those extra wonderful years. The shift from pension to defined contribution models have put the large ask the large burden on individual savers. They have to first build up the retirement estate, which in and itself is a formidable challenge. Then even as they have this sizable savings at retirement, there's not much guidance about how to spend and or not -- and how not to overspend these savings. We've been working for years to address this de-accumulation challenge and we believe this will help increase hope in America. In 2020, we announced the LifePath Paycheck, the next generation of Target Date solutions. It will include an option to purchase a lifetime income stream from insurers selected by BlackRock and is expected to go live towards the end of the month. We are partnering on implementing LifePath Paycheck right now with 14 planned sponsors, representing over $25 billion in Target Date AUM and now have 0.5 million participants. We'll pair the flexibility of a 401(k) investment with a potential for a predictable paycheck life income stream similar to a pension. I believe it will be in one day, the most used investment strategy in defined contribution plans. This pioneering structure can help address global gaps in funding retirement security, improve the quality of life and retirement for millions of Americans and bring back hope for those who were retiring. It's been four years since the start of the pandemic and the subsequent geopolitical upheavals. Leaders of countries, leaders of companies need to create hope for the future for all of their stakeholders. That's certainly what we're doing at BlackRock. I've spoken before about the fear we see today, some is stoked by increasingly political polarization in the world. Our industry and BlackRock have been a subject of political dialogue mostly in the United States. We recognize some of this with being the industry leader. We have done a better job now of telling our story so that people can make decisions based on facts, not on lies and not on misinformation or politicization by others. Unfortunately, there are still others out there who put short-term politics, who continuously lie about these issues. They are putting those issues above the long-term fiduciary responsibilities. As a fiduciary, politics should never outweigh performance. I do believe that with the vast majority of our clients, our long-term fiduciary approach and performance are resonating. We heard it in our dialogue with them, and we see it in our flows and I know all of you as shareholders see it in our flows. Over the last past five years, clients have entrusted BlackRock with an aggregate of $1.9 trillion of total net inflows, $1 trillion over the last three years and nearly $300 billion last year. It has been in the United States where client led inflows in every one of these areas. It is true also in the first quarter of this year. This is in all is in the environment where the industry has experienced flat or negative flows, BlackRock saw inflows. Our sustained growth, our accelerating momentum are made possible by the trust of our clients and shareholders and the dedication of all the BlackRock people. Across our firm, we're delivering BlackRock to meet all our clients' individual needs, we're helping each and every client unlock their new opportunities and the power of BlackRock's integrated platform has enabled us to drive better outcomes for each and every client and providing them a differentiated growth for them, which then entails providing differentiating growth for you, our shareholders. I believe at this time, our momentum has never been stronger. The opportunity we have in front of us has never been stronger. And I look forward at BlackRock to be delivering on a significant broad base of opportunities across the world, across our platform, across all of our products and delivering the responsible fiduciary responsibilities that we provide to each and every client. Operator, let's open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Craig Siegenthaler : So my question is on your commentary around building momentum and line of sight into significant fundings, so if we exclude fee rate issues like divergent beta, when do you think BlackRock can get back to 5% base fee organic growth? And with the law of large numbers as a factor, what is your confidence that this objective is still achievable at your current $10 trillion AUM size? Laurence Fink : Martin? MartinSmall : It's Martin. Listen, I'd start by like Q1 net flows were solid at $76 billion. And on a more granular look, we just see durable growth in that flows mix. We had about $100 billion across ETFs, retail, institutional active, institutional fixed income. Of course, we saw some of these $19 billion redemptions from cash with the Good Friday quarter-end dynamic and the $26 billion rebalanced away in institutional index equities. You know those institutional index equities happen from time to time. They're not meaningful revenue impacts or fee rate detractors, but they weigh on kind of the long-term flow totals. When we look at this core momentum on flows, excluding the episodic index redemptions, Q1 flows were $100 billion. It's a healthy trajectory. It's an affirmation for us that we're focused on the right things to grow with clients. And on base fees, the management team here, we really feel like we've turned a corner. Over the last two quarters, we see really solid trends in organic fee growth. They're really some of the best since the end of 2021. We saw excellent momentum to finish the fourth quarter, which we talked about on the last call. We closed out in November and December higher than target. And this quarter, March new base fees annualized at target after we had a slower start. So over the last six months, we see organic base fee growth ticking up and trending more halfway or halfway plus to our long-term targets. It's not a straight line, but we're moving to target. And I say this because we see key positive trends in this sort of critical base fee growers for us. Retail posted $7 billion of flows in that 40 basis point to 50 basis point bucket. Money is going back to work, redemption rates are moderating. We see really excellent momentum in active overall with $15 billion of flows and good velocity in institutional and retail active fixed income, in particular, at $9 billion. And I think what Larry is getting at, we've been selected for a breadth of mandates across investment management and technology that we see supporting 5% organic growth and will fund over future quarters. Our planned acquisition of GIP will help us build and bump from there. So we look forward to closing that transaction, executing on these mandates and keeping you guys posted on our progress. Laurence Fink : I would just add, the breadth of conversations we're having with clients worldwide. Rob Kapito right now is in Asia, the type of conversations we had there. The opportunities we see in Europe, in the U.K., Middle East. These are just very large opportunities, large mandates, big opportunities. And if you then overlay the opportunities and you overlay what infrastructure can do related to the build-out of power with all the AI promise and the need for data centers and the need for power is going to be extraordinary. And all of this is going to lead to much bigger opportunities. And then more importantly, more and more clients are going to be seeking those organizations who deliver the proprietary differentiated products. Operator : We'll go next to Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Michael Cyprys : Just wanted to ask about balancing investment spend with margin expansion. In the past, we've heard BlackRock talked about being margin aware. So, just curious how the thinking of that has evolved. What does that mean in today's environment? And how might you quantify the opportunity for margin expansion over time? How do you see some of the levers to achieve that? Martin Small : Our approach to shareholder value creation is obviously to generate differentiated organic growth, it's to drive operating leverage in a premium margin and it's to execute on a consistent capital management strategy. We have a strong track record of investing in our business for growth and scale and expanding profitability. And I want to emphasize, it's not just about growth. It's about profitable growth over the long-term. And that growth comes from making continued investments in our business. And I've talked a lot about on the last several calls and obviously, some of the other meetings we've had, we're looking to size our operating investments in line with the prudent lens on organic growth potential. We're aiming to put more flexibility in our cost base and variabilize expenses where we can. And most importantly, we're looking to generate fixed cost scale, especially through investments in technology. We're consistently delivering industry leading margins, which is a goal and we've expanded our margin in six out of the last 10 years. And I think those scale indicators are coming through in our results. We're delivering profitable growth. We generated 180 bps of margin expansion year-on-year, while revenue op income and EPS all rose double-digits. And we delivered 60 basis points of sequential margin improvement. Over the last 18 months, AUM is up $2.5 trillion, while headcount is actually flat or slightly lower. So I feel like we're delivering benefits of scale and productivity, which is showing in margin expansion. As I mentioned, we're planning for full year low to mid-single digits core G&A growth, flat headcount both excluding the GIP transaction. So you've heard on our last few calls and I hope today and some of Larry's color, we're looking to drive more fixed cost scale. That comes from technology. It comes from automation. It can come from AI. It comes from organizational design, global foot printing using some of our innovation hubs around the world. We see those as our major levers to drive margin expansion. And in the end, we're just looking to optimize organic growth in the most efficient way possible, deliver growth for clients and shareholders and ultimately expand our margin over time. Laurence Fink : Michael, I would just add, as we continue to be investing in AI, our most recent experience of having $2.5 trillion more assets with the same headcount is a real good indication of how we are trying to drive more efficiencies, more productivity. I think this is critical. We're going to bring down an inflation in America. This is how it's going to have to be done, driven through technology and which will increase more productivity. And overall and actually through that process, we continue to drive more productivity. What it also means is rising wages. So people do more and the whole organization is doing more with less people as a percent of the overall organization. That is really our ambition. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Worthington with JP Morgan. Kenneth Worthington : Fixed income flows have picked up for U.S. -- the U.S. mutual fund industry so far this year, but the same data services that track the industry don't show a proportionate pickup for BlackRock. Your fixed income ETF sales were solid at $18 billion but below levels seen last year. Can you talk about the competitive landscape for fixed income retail and fixed income ETFs, both inside and outside the U.S.? And to what extent do you think investor appetite may have changed in 2024? Robert Kapito : So, Rob here. The conversations that we're having across all of the distribution systems are about a new allocation into fixed income. It's been very much clouded by all the noise around inflation and the Fed. So the yield curve remains inverted and investors are currently getting paid to wait. And a more balanced term structure of interest rates is going to be the indicator to watch and that's where we'll start to see demand for intermediate and longer-term fixed income. So the first quarter for us flows of $42 billion, which I think is considerable, we saw the strength in the bond ETFs from immunization activity in institutional and about 25% of the flows were into active strategies. So we're seeing renewed demand for active fixed income and that's led to flows into the high yield, the unconstrained and the total return strategies and the fact that our longer term performance has about 93% of our taxable active fixed income AUM above the benchmark or peer medium in the last five years are really set up to capture this. But I do think the noise that's out there focused on inflation and the fact that you can still earn 5%, which is very attractive right now is causing the delay in more allocations to fixed income. The other part of why I'm more encouraged is we are finding a growing interest in high-performing active fixed income strategies alongside private market strategies. So I think that we stand to bode very well once you see some changes in the yield curve. Laurence Fink : Let me just add, operator to Ken's question. Ken, I do believe as an industry, the large pension funds that have an over allocation of private equity and the rotation of money in the private equity area has slowed down precipitously. We are also seeing evidence that more and more clients are keeping a higher balance of cash to meet their liability discharges. And so without the momentum and the velocity of money in private equity, they actually have to keep higher cash balances, too. So I think that is something to be watched to. If there is an unlock in the movement of private equity, I do believe you would see a factor allocation for the industry in fixed income and other income-producing products. Operator : We'll go next to Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alexander Blostein : My question is related to private markets and GIP. Larry, you referred to it again this morning as a transformational deal for BlackRock maybe similar to some of the other large ones you've done. Does this give you enough in terms of what you're trying to accomplish in the private markets broadly? Or do you expect to pursue more acquisitions that are related in this area? And I guess somewhat related to that, growth in private markets, retail products has been quite significant and still early days. Maybe just remind us on how BlackRock is pursuing that opportunity. Martin Small : It's Martin. I'll offer a few thoughts and then Larry will jump in. Let's say, look, all of our clients continue to increase their allocations to private markets. That's what drove our acquisition of eFront. It's what drove our planned acquisition of GIP. And it's also a great focus of the organic investments we've made to build in a liquid alternatives business of size. There are sort of liquid alternatives business, we've reached $167 billion of assets, roughly $140 billion fee paying. We had a good quarter there. Infrastructure and private credit deployment added $1 billion of inflows offset by a return of capital that I talked about. We're getting close on our final closes for our BlackRock Infrastructure IV Fund for decarbonization partners, which has been a great first time funded vintage. We've got $30 billion of committed but uninvested capital. So there's good dry powder in the system. As Larry mentioned, we're originating really strong unique transactions there. So we think our capabilities are expanding in a way that's going to plan. Just yesterday, we announced an infrastructure debt deal with Santander where we're going to be financing about $600 million of infrastructure loans in a structured transaction. And we just see good fundraising momentum, which we think we can kick into next year with GIP. Since 2021, we've had $140 billion of gross capital across the platform continue to see good momentum with clients. And to the topic you mentioned, we've been building out our semi-liquid products for retail with credit strategies. Our credit strategy is interval funds and our non-traded credit BDC, BDEAT have a combined $1 billion plus of AUM. We received a really important placement for BDEAT as a National Wirehouse, so we think that will be a strong accelerant for organic growth. And then finally, that planned acquisition with GIP is going to really extend our capabilities. We think the business can be a much stronger platform for capital formation of scale and build on this philosophy we have in illiquid alternatives. We also think there's a great opportunity to bring GIP's capabilities to private wealth globally, retail retirement platforms in the U.K. and Europe with the LTIP and LTAP structures. And obviously, we'll keep you updated on our progress. Laurence Fink : I would just add that the feedback we're having from clients, including a dinner I had with a major energy company last night. The opportunity we have for driving more unique proprietary origination is going to be driving accelerated growth for us in the private markets, especially in infrastructure. I do believe the combinations of our two organization is going to open up so many more avenues. Avenues with companies but also avenues with countries. And that being said, look, we're always in the market and are looking for different opportunities and we're not slowing down, looking at different opportunities. We're not here to suggest we're doing anything that is forthcoming because the number one through five things to do is to close GIP. But the doors are knocking at BlackRock to see if there's other opportunities we want to pursue. And if it makes sense one day, we will continue to be open minded to pursue more private market opportunities. Operator : We'll go next to Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Daniel Fannon : Martin for your comments on improving trends throughout the quarter for flows, can you put in context what that means for maybe exit fee rate? And also on this pipeline of activity that's building, can you talk about the mix of fees and products more specifically and how that might inform your base fee outlook going forward? Martin Small : As I mentioned, we see good base momentum. At the end of Q4, we were running at higher than target. At the end of this quarter, we're at target. And as I mentioned, when we look at the trends over months, not days, we feel like we're half or halfway plus to our target growth. So we've got good base fee momentum. First quarter base fees, excluding securities lending were $3.6 billion, which is up 9% year-on-year, which is largely due to the impact of market movements on AUM and organic growth. And if -- the Q2 entry fee rate ex-fee lending is pretty much flat compared to the Q1 fee rate on a day count equivalent basis. But overall, I think as we see good flows into active with the $15 billion we've had, as I mentioned, retail flows of $7 billion coming in. We see good fee rate trends, which we think are about -- mostly about mix. We focus really on driving organic base fee growth in the most efficient way possible, focusing on the clients, focusing on the investments they want to make. We don't focus on a specific fee rate or product. We focus on the clients and the fee rate is more of an output. But the trends in terms of where we're raising assets on the fee rates we think are good. But as I mentioned, Q2 fee rate -- Q2 entry fee rate excess funding is flat compared to the Q1 fee rate on the same day count. Operator : We'll go next to Bill Katz with TD Cowen. William Katz : Appreciate the update. Maybe a different vein. Your performance fees continue to run pretty high. And just sort of wondering, are we reaching a new level of normalized performance fees? And how might that translate into sort of the comp ratio as we look ahead, particularly as you continue to migrate to a bigger pool of private markets post-GIP? Martin Small : So on the performance fees of $204 million in the quarter, obviously, they're up about 4x year-on-year. If you could put yourself in a time machine and think back to that first quarter in '23, it was a really difficult market. We had SVB, we had some volume in the rate markets, et cetera. So I think it was a tough time. This quarter, we've really seen good performance coming through on our teams, which has been very, very strong and I think reflected in those performance fees. Rough just is about half of that performance fee is coming from kind of our private equity funds and private equity programs where we had some very successful realizations that Larry talked about last year, which was created in some of the distributions associated with that. And the other half is more in illiquid hedge funds in our strategic equity hedge funds and some of our systematic strategies as well. Ultimately, our goal is to deliver long-term performance with clients and where we see performance fee revenues picking up, obviously, there's healthy alignment there and more supportive markets and stronger markets and strong performance, we'd expect a lot of that leverage to drop to a lower comp to revenue ratio. But ultimately, talent is one of our key investments and we'd expect it to be on a go-forward basis. Operator : We'll go next to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Maybe just to focus on the multi-asset category and a couple of areas within that. I think Martin, you were talking about obviously the build of the organic growth pipeline and also in conjunction with Larry, with your comments about the conversation pipeline. Can you talk about two areas, in particular, as that developed throughout the year. That would be OCIO deals and then also, as we start up LifePath Paycheck, how you anticipate that contributing to organic growth, I guess, as the year unfolds, obviously very early, but even over the next couple of years? Martin Small : Sure. I guess maybe I can start with a little color on the multi-asset flows and then Larry can comment on LifePath Paycheck. So, multi-asset strategy saw inflows in the quarter of about $5 billion after we had a really strong 2023 with $83 billion. Those strong inflows were driven by the continued demand for our LifePath Target Date offerings. And obviously, we see significant growth ahead in that core business but also in the upcoming launch of LifePath Paycheck. Our LifePath Target Date franchise has about $470 billion in assets, generated $9 billion of flows in the first quarter, thanks to the funding of several large mandates. We have about an organic growth rate of 8%. So we're leading the market there in terms of growth and we continue to outperform relative to the industry. Again, we're building on a strong core business there. We had $25 billion of flows in '23, which was about 7% growth. We're the number one DC investment-only, DCIO firm. We have 70,000 DC plans and we're the only provider, I think that's really global. Most of the assets at BlackRock are investing to finance retirement, and we've been at the forefront of innovation and advocacy for retirement solutions throughout our history. It's a key part of our growth. And the innovation that we're doing in LifePath Paycheck, we think is exciting and a significant area of our future organic growth. Laurence Fink : As I said in my prepared remarks, we have 14 corporations that are preparing to transform their defined contribution plan to LifePath Paycheck. So the conversations we're having with so many other clients is enormous. Many clients wanted to see actual implementation of these plans. As we said in the prepared remarks, the first implementation of the first plan is going to be in the next few weeks. We'll have many announcements about that and we plan to really make that a big issue for us going forward. We believe, as I said before, this is going to change retirement. The movement away from defined benefits to defined contributions have left many, many individuals stranded in making the decisions of their own retirement by themselves. And this eliminates some of the uncertainty for retirement. The Target Date has eliminated a lot of the variability of retirement, but there has been no transformation in terms of bringing -- once you are retired, how do you know what you have. And through this innovation of integrating investment strategies around insurance wrappers can really narrow the outcomes that the individual can have a very narrow corridor of what the dollar amount that they're going to be earning each month. And as I said in my letter, with growing longevity, retirement is going to become a bigger and bigger issue. And having this type of certainty really will alleviate some of the fear. As I said, our conversations are broad. And let me be clear, the conversations are also now beginning in Europe and other places, too. So we look at this as a major component of our future growth rates over the next three to five years. Obviously, it's not the highest fee-based product. It is like a Target Date product. But -- so it's -- but it can generate more connectivity with more clients, deeper relationships with all our clients. And so this is something that I'm very proud of what the firm has created and I do believe it's going to transform BlackRock as a leader in retirement benefits. Operator : We'll go back to Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Patrick Davitt : My question is on Europe ETFs. Obviously, the active to passive equity flow mix continues to track more like the U.S. and Europe so far this year. So firstly, could you update us on the defensibility of your positioning around that theme? And to what extent you're seeing more aggressive price competition? And finally, higher level, to what extent you're seeing a real change in how ETFs are bought and sold in Europe that could portend this so called trend continuing more indefinitely? Martin Small : As we mentioned, we had about $67 billion of iShares inflows in the first quarter, led by core fixed income. I bet the business is running in a very strong way, high single-digit asset growth, mid-single-digit base fee growth. All the trends globally are very strong. But we have been stressing and I'm glad for the question, just the real strength and competitive position of the iShares business in Europe. European iShares continues to lead the market with about 30% market share of inflows that's 2x the inflows of the number two player. And our inflows exceed the two and three players combined. Our iShares franchise in Europe is $850 billion AUM that's bigger than next five players combined. So we think we have a real outsized opportunity to grow ETFs in the U.K. and Europe. And obviously, the competitive dynamics there, I think are very, very different than they are here in the United States in terms of the buying units, how buying units are sold. This is largely a private banking market that uses exchange traded funds through discretionary private management programs and iShares is really a very strong and preferred provider. I want you to think about it this way. The United States built trillions and trillions of dollars ETF business with a national best bid, best offer system, a unified securities regulator, national exchange. Europe has more fragmented markets and has been growing, growing and growing. So we really see, obviously, regulation is trending favorable in Europe, the buying dynamics as very favorable and iShares is in a great market leadership position there, we think to post outsized growth. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks? Laurence Fink : Yes, operator, one last comment. I want to thank everybody for joining us this morning and for your continued interest in BlackRock. Our performance is a direct result of our steadfast commitment to serving our clients -- and each and every client and evolving for the long-term trends ahead of their needs. We started 2024 with great momentum, and I strongly believe that there are more opportunities ahead for BlackRock more than any other time before. Thank you, everyone and have a great quarter.

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Martin S. Small; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. All lines have been made on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference. Christopher J. Meade: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may of course differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which list some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So with that, I'll turn it over to Larry. Laurence D. Fink: Thank you, Chris. I'd like to begin by addressing what occurred over the weekend. The assassination attempt on former President Trump is abhorrent. I was very relieved he wasn't seriously injured, and I'm thinking about the victims of this shooting, especially the innocent person who was killed. As I wrote to my BlackRock colleagues in the hours immediately following the horrific event Saturday evening, we must condemn political violence of any kind, period. And as Americans, we must stand united to do our part to promote civility and unity for our country and provide hope for all Americans. I'll turn it over to Martin now. Martin S. Small: Thanks, Larry, and good morning, everyone. Before I turn it back to Larry, I'll review our financial performance and business results for the second quarter of 2024. Our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results. I'll be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. The first half and second quarter of 2024 saw some of BlackRock's strongest performance and highest growth rates of the post-pandemic period. We're growing faster than last year. We delivered double-digit operating income growth and expanded our margin by 160 basis points year-over-year. Clients entrusted us with over $80 billion of net new assets. It was $150 billion of flows excluding episodic client activity. We generated 3% annualized organic base fee growth, our highest second quarter in three years. We ended the second quarter with record AUM of over $10.6 trillion. Our business tends to be seasonally stronger in the back half of the year and we have line of sight into a broad global opportunity set of new asset management and technology mandates that should fuel premium organic growth. We're executing on the strongest opportunities we've ever seen in our core business and building for the future. We're moving swiftly and aggressively to position our firm to achieve or exceed our 5% organic base fee growth target over the long term. At the same time, we're putting the future building blocks of accelerated all-weather organic growth, that's private markets and technology. We're putting them into place with our planned acquisitions of Global Infrastructure Partners and Preqin. We're building our mix towards higher secular growth areas like private markets, technology, whole portfolio mandates, and model portfolios powered by both ETFs and active. We believe this will deliver greater diversification and resilience in revenue and earnings through market cycles. Through strong organic growth and scaling of our private markets and technology platforms, we believe we can drive compelling earnings growth and multiple expansion for our shareholders. We continue to build with our clients and more than $10.6 trillion in assets under management, $10.6 trillion units of trust, BlackRock's platform is becoming the premier long-term capital partner across public and private markets. We're connecting investors, corporates and the public sector to the power of the capital markets. Through the iShares and indexing platforms, we've developed longstanding relationships, highly aligned shareholder relationships with global corporates. Through our advisory and technology capabilities, we are a trusted partner to governments and the public sector. These relationships are creating a wealth of opportunities for unique transactions, especially in infrastructure and private markets, and they benefit our clients' portfolios, they fuel organic growth. In the second quarter, we saw equity markets power to another record high and more clients starting to re-risk. Investors waiting in cash have missed out on significant equity market returns over the last year and more investors are stepping back into risk assets. BlackRock is a [sheer] (ph) winner when there's assets in motion. Periods when investors are eager to deploy capital are historically when BlackRock's platform sees its most outsized growth. Clients are coming to BlackRock as a thought leader, as a partner as they rethink their portfolios and investment technology. We continue to execute on a strong set of large opportunities that are contracted near-funding or in late-stage contracting. And over the past few months, the slate of client mandates we've been chosen for is the most broad and diversified has been in years across active equity and fixed income, customized liquidity accounts, private markets and multi-product Aladdin assignments. BlackRock generated total net inflows of $82 billion in the second quarter, representing 3% annualized organic asset and 3% annualized organic base fee growth. Flows were impacted by an approximately $20 billion active fixed-income redemption from a large insurance client linked to M&A activity. Excluding this single client specific item and low fee institutional index equity flows, we saw nearly $150 billion of total net inflows in the quarter. Second quarter revenue of $4.8 billion was 8% higher year-over-year, driven by positive organic base fee growth and the impact of market movements on average AUM over the last 12 months. Higher performance fees and technology services revenue also contributed to revenue growth. Operating income of $1.9 billion and earnings per share of $10.36 were each up 12% year-over-year. Non-operating results for the quarter included $113 million of net investment gains, driven primarily by non-cash mark-to-market gains on our unhedged seed capital investments and minority investments. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 24%. We continue to estimate that 25% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2024. The actual effective tax rate may differ because of non-recurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation. Second quarter base fee and securities lending revenue of $3.9 billion was up 7% year-over-year and reflected positive organic base fee growth and the impact of market appreciation on our average AUM, partially offset by lower securities lending revenue. Sequentially, base fee and securities lending revenue was up 3%, reflecting higher average AUM and 3% annualized organic base fee growth in the current quarter. Our annualized effective fee rate was flat compared to the first quarter. Ending spot AUM was 2% higher than quarterly average AUM as market sharply recovered after April declines. Performance fees of $164 million increased 39% from a year ago, driven by both liquid alternatives and long-only products. Quarterly technology services revenue was up 10% compared to a year ago and up 5% sequentially, reflecting successful client go lives. Annual contract value, or ACV, increased 10% year-over-year, reflecting sustained demand for our full range of Aladdin technology offerings. 80% of new logo sales this year have come from opportunities, including multiple products. We have a strong multi-product pipeline and remain committed to low- to mid-teens ACV growth over the long term. Preqin is expected to accelerate planned technology services ACV growth within our target range. Total expense increased 5% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher incentive compensation, G&A, and sales, asset and account expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up 4% year-over-year, reflecting higher incentive compensation as a result of higher operating income and performance fees. G&A expense was up 7% year-over-year, primarily due to the timing of technology spend in the prior year and higher professional services expense. Sales, asset and account expense increased 4% compared to a year ago, primarily driven by higher direct fund expense. Direct fund expense increased 4% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, primarily as a result of higher average ETF AUM. Our as-adjusted operating margin of 44.1% was up 160 basis points from a year ago, reflecting the positive impact of markets on revenue and organic growth this quarter. As markets improve, we expect execution on our financial rubric to drive profitable growth and operating leverage. In-line with our guidance in January and excluding the impact of Global Infrastructure Partners, Preqin and related transaction costs, at present, we would expect our headcount to be broadly flat in 2024 and we would also expect a low- to mid-single digit percentage increase in 2024 core G&A expense. Our capital management strategy remains first to invest in our business to either scale strategic growth initiatives or drive operational efficiency, and then to return excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. At times, we may make inorganic investments where we see an opportunity to accelerate growth and support our strategic initiatives. We repurchased $500 million worth of common shares in the second quarter, which exceeded our planned run rate as we saw attractive relative valuation opportunities in our stock. At present, based on our capital spending plans for the year and subject to market conditions, we still anticipate repurchasing at least $375 million of shares per quarter for the balance of the year consistent with our previous guidance in January. At present, we'd expect our planned acquisition of GIP to close in the third quarter of 2024, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. And just a few weeks ago, we announced our planned acquisition of Preqin, marking both an extension of our private markets capabilities and a launching point into the adjacent fast-growing private markets data segment. We expect it will accelerate the growth and revenue contribution of technology services. The bigger longer-term opportunity is leveraging our engines in Aladdin and indexing with our capital markets expertise to build the machine for the indexing of private markets. With the creation of public benchmarks did to drive stock markets, especially visible through iShares, we believe the combination of BlackRock and Preqin can do for private markets. The momentum we spoke to last quarter is visible in our flows with $82 billion of total net inflows in the second quarter, which include the previously mentioned large outflow from one client. Excluding that single client outflow, flows were positive across product types and active in index. BlackRock led the ETF industry in flows for the first half of 2024 and the second quarter, and our flows are more diversified by product type, channel and region than any other issuer. Second quarter BlackRock ETF net inflows of $83 billion were led by fixed income and core equity ETFs, which saw $34 billion and $32 billion of net inflows, respectively. Precision ETFs added net inflows of $14 billion in the quarter, as clients reassessed their tactical portfolio allocations, adding exposures to growth equity. BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF continues to lead, gathering another $4 billion in the second quarter for $18 billion of net inflows in its first six months. Retail net inflows of $6 billion reflected continued strength in Aperio and broad-based net inflows into active fixed income. Aperio recently crossed the $100 billion AUM milestone, logging over 20% organic growth since we acquired the business a little over three years ago. As fee-based fiduciary wealth advisors grow across the world, managed model portfolios are the main way in which wealth managers are looking to scale their practices and better serve their clients. BlackRock has the leading models business and we grow through distribution of our own models, as well as through distribution of third-party models that typically include strong allocations to iShares. Our partnership with Envestnet continues to help Envestnet advisors grow and to drive assets into BlackRock products through models. In the second quarter, we saw our best net sales month on the platform in nearly three years and have generated 20% annualized organic growth in 2024. Last month, Envestnet and BlackRock announced new programs to expand personalized investment strategies on the Envestnet platform across direct indexing, models and portfolio consulting. Also in June, we announced a partnership with GeoWealth to expand our custom models offerings, which represents the fastest-growing model segment. The custom models offered through GeoWealth's platform will provide advisors with a streamlined and scalable approach that combines public and private markets in one portfolio solution. Institutional active net outflows of $2 billion were impacted by the previously mentioned single client redemption. We saw the funding of several whole portfolio assignments and strength in private markets as clients seek out and leverage our comprehensive multi-alternatives platform. Institutional index net outflows of $35 billion were concentrated in low fee index equities. Several large clients, mostly outside the United States, rebalanced their portfolios amid record levels for equity markets. Private markets generated net inflows of $2 billion. Continued demand for our infrastructure and private equity solutions were partially offset by successful realizations of about $4 billion, primarily from private equity strategies. Finally, cash management net inflows of $30 billion were driven by government and international prime funds. Flows benefited in part from clients reinvesting in cash strategies in early April after redeeming balances during the last week of March. Net inflows included multiple large new client mandates, as connectivity between our cash and capital markets teams allows us to deliver clients holistic advice and market insight. Our scale and active approach for clients around their liquidity management are driving sustained growth in our cash platform. BlackRock's strategy and platform evolution, they're rooted in our convictions about future client needs, about required investment capabilities, about technology, about scale generation. Teams across BlackRock are connected in delivering on significant client opportunities, driving product innovation and operating more nimbly and efficiently. Momentum continues to build across our platform. We're better positioned than ever to grow our share with clients and deliver profitable growth for our shareholders. I'll turn it over to Larry. Laurence D. Fink: Thank you, Martin. BlackRock's core business growth is the strongest we've seen in nearly three years, with a significant upward shift ever since our last earnings call in April. Second quarter core net inflows were approximately $150 billion, excluding lower fee episodic M&A and institutional index activities. Our structural growers areas, like ETFs, models, Aladdin and private markets, are powering steadily higher organic base fee growth. Organic base fee growth represented the best second quarter since 2021. 2024 has been our ETF strongest start in a year on record with $150 billion of net inflows and iShares' June flows were the strongest month in our history and for any other issuer. We are executing on landmark mandates across our platform and on closing our planned acquisitions of GIP and Preqin. Client and stakeholder feedback on both GIP and Preqin has been increasingly enthusiastic. We are on a differentiated path to transform our capabilities and infrastructure and to meet the growing need for private market technology, data and benchmarking. We believe this will deepen our relationships with our clients and deliver value to you, our shareholders. Our growth in private markets provides a whole new engine for premium diversified organic growth and less beta-sensitive revenues, both of which should drive future earnings and multiple expansion. We have strong conviction we are on pace to reach our 5% organic base fee growth target. And the expected third quarter closing of GIP will add on to our organic base fee growth potential, doubling our private markets base fees and adding approximately $100 billion of AUM focused on infrastructure. At BlackRock, we always intensely push ourselves to anticipate where markets are going, what clients will need and how we can deliver better outcomes in better ways to each and every client. We set the standard for buy-side risk management technology by launching Aladdin on the desktops of investors over 20 years ago. We acquired BGI and iShares to redefine whole portfolio investing by blending both active and indexing to build better outcome-oriented portfolio. iShares AUM was about $300 billion when we announced our acquisition in 2009. Today, iShares is approaching $4 trillion of client money. We recently celebrated the five year anniversary of the eFront acquisition, where ACV has now more than doubled since becoming part of BlackRock. We have never been shy about taking big, bold, strategic moves to transform ourselves and most importantly to transform our industry. Our successful business transformations are delivering our strong performance today and opening up meaningful new growth markets for our clients and for our shareholders. We continue on our mission to transform private markets. BlackRock is unique in delivering an integrated approach to help our clients across all aspects of private market investing, enabling a seamless view into investment management, into technology and data onto one single platform. With a strong common culture of serving clients with excellence, together with GIP, we will deliver for our clients a holistic global infrastructure manager across equities, debt and solutions. We will provide the full range of infrastructure sector exposures and we will offer our unique origination across developed and emerging world markets. Our recently announced agreement to acquire Preqin is another step in the transformation of our private markets and technology platform. As private markets grow, data and analytics will become increasingly more important. We believe our planned acquisition of Preqin will help to compete the whole portfolio by delivering high-quality data integrated with workflows. Ultimately, this should drive increased accessibility and efficiencies in private markets. And the combination of Preqin with Aladdin and eFront presents an opportunity to find a common language for private markets, powering the next generation of whole portfolios. We envision we could bring the principles of indexing to the private markets through standardization of data, through benchmarking and through better performance tools. BlackRock has developed a broad network of global corporate relationships through our many years of long-term investments in both their debt and equity. For companies where we are investors, they appreciate that we are long-term, consistent, always-there capital. We are not transactional. We invest early and we stay invested through cycles. Whether it's debt or equity, pre IPO, post IPO, companies recognize the uniqueness of our global relationship, our brand and our expertise across markets and industries. This makes us a valuable partner, in turn unlocks the opportunity and performance we could provide for clients. Unique deal flow and track record of successful exits create a flywheel effect, enabling future fundraising and more scaled funds. Corporates and clients increasingly want to work with BlackRock, and we are executing on the best opportunity sets we've seen in years across iShares, private markets, whole portfolio solutions and Aladdin. Importantly, our business has great breadth with organic growth diversified across our platform. In the first half of 2024, flows were positive in active and index and across all asset classes. Our active platform, including alternatives, contributed $11 billion. ETF remains a secular growth driver, processing $150 billion of net inflows, and already representing more than 70% of our total flows of last year. And our technology services revenue grew double-digit in the first half of the year. Importantly, we have notified fundings for a number of scaled institutional wealth management that we expect to fund over the coming quarters. For example, in the second quarter, we were selected to manage a $10 billion US corporate plan, a multi-billion fixed-income portfolio for a large defined benefit scheme and scientific active equity strategies for several global financial clients. These add to the global mandates which we have seen -- that we have been chosen over the last six months, including a large US RIA, a UK pension fund, a European captive asset management are just a few examples, as we look to onboard these mandates and more in future quarters and delivering the outcomes of our clients and their constituents and what they need. Growing business momentum across our scaled asset management and technology platform is driving strong financial results. BlackRock's operating income was up 12% year-over-year or 160 basis points of margin expansion. Earnings per share was up 12%, and we remain committed to delivering differentiated organic growth at a premium margin to our investors. We continue to generate leading organic growth and our operating margin of 44.1% is over 10 points above the traditional peer average. [indiscernible] 5% yields in cash have kept many investors overweight in cash and nearly $9 trillion still sits in money market funds. Those waiting in cash would have missed out on a broad stock market returns of over 26% over the last year, including 17% so far in 2024. Long-term outcomes and future liability matching needs more than a 5% return. Investors will have to re-risk, which should improve flows into equities and credit markets. BlackRock is always a sheer winner when assets are in motion and a meaningful outperformer in periods of investors re-risking. BlackRock operates from a position of strength. We have a clear path to our 5% organic base fee growth target and we're transforming ourselves to build a firm that can exceed that target. Clients increasingly see the value in the BlackRock model, a single unified platform designed for clients unmatched in breadth, powered by BlackRock and totally built on trust. And it goes beyond clients simply wanting to do more with BlackRock. They are looking for a partner that innovates and helps them grow. The world's largest asset owners want deep strategic partnerships, increased customization and innovation, approaching that might include a creative co-investment opportunities and co-development of strategies. BlackRock's Decarbonization Partners, joint venture with Temasek, is one example of this type of relationship. In the second quarter, we announced that its inaugural fund had a final close above its fundraising target raising $1.4 billion. The first-time fund attracted over 30 institutional clients representing 18 countries. The diversity and debth of the investor base is a testament to our long-standing client relationships and strength of our team. Insurers represent some of our most long-standing relationships in clients and we are leveraging our insurance expertise and diversified global platform to deliver fixed-income technology and increasingly private market solutions. BlackRock manages nearly $700 billion in long-term AUM for insurance clients. And we are the industry leader in managing core fixed income for insurance companies general accounts. Insurance CIOs are expanding their mandate with BlackRock to include private markets and structured assets. Just a few weeks ago, we awarded our first large-scale general account allocation for a private structured credit mandate. We also had success with insurers and dedicated SMAs for infrastructure debt where we have differentiated capabilities. We have deep long-standing relationships across our insurance client channel with a dedicated insurance portfolio management team. We see significant opportunity to work more closely with our insurance clients as we leverage our GA business as a potential durable source of long-term capital for our private debt franchises. The industrial logic that informed our planned acquisition of GIP has only begun even clear in the last six months. There is a generational demand for capital and infrastructure, including the finance data centers for AI and for energy transition. Private capital will be critical in the meeting these infrastructure needs both standalone and through public private partnerships. Clients' reception to GIP has been overwhelmingly positive with strong reverse inquiry from clients excited to partner with a newly scaled infrastructure platform. We see particularly strong demand for opportunities in the AI, data centers and energy transition spaces. Through BlackRock's relationships with corporates and sovereigns, BlackRock is at the center of the investment opportunity being shaped by the demand for generative AI. AI cannot truly happen without investments in infrastructure. These technologies require a new generation of upgrade data centers, which will need enormous amounts of energy to power them. With the AI fueled need to build data centers, we see great potential to monetize the 4.3 gigawatts of power production capacity of generational assets currently owned by BlackRock's infrastructure funds. When we talk to leaders in industry and governments, they express their desire to build out data centers, AI, technology, at the same time to decarbonize. Our Diversified Infrastructure fund recently invested in Mainova WebHouse, a first-of-its-kind partnership, to invest in a hyperscale data center platform in Frankfurt, run entirely on renewable energy. And our planned acquisition of GIP will add a number of global data centers assets in our portfolio. We plan to be a leader in this space, leveraging our expertise to drive capital formation and unique deal flow to generate return for our clients. For decades now, BlackRock has helped investors benefit from the growth of the capital markets, supporting their path to financial security and long-term objectives like retirement. Early in the second quarter, we successfully launched LifePath Paycheck with a subset of committed clients. We expect additional commitment plan sponsors to fund over future quarters and we have a very strong late-stage pipeline. More than half the assets we manage are related to retirement. Our growth investments to enhance our capabilities and strategies like active target date and infrastructure underpin our commitment to improving retirement outcomes. BlackRock continues to create more access and connections between long-term investors and capital markets, both in the United States and throughout the world. Early this quarter, we announced an agreement with the Public Investment Fund, the PIF, to launch an investment management platform in Riyadh, which aims to accelerate the development of our local capital markets and enable foreign investment into the region. We expanded our Jio-BlackRock joint venture in India beyond asset management to brokerage and wealth management. And just last month, we joined a new coalition to mobilize infrastructure investments in the Indo-Pacific region alongside GIP and other global investors. In the US, we announced the new opportunity for BlackRock to help expand domestic capital markets by investing in the creation of the Texas Stock Exchange. The exchange aims to facilitate greater access and increase liquidity in US equity capital markets for investors. Our investment builds on a history of investing in similar market structure opportunities for the benefit of BlackRock clients. ETFs will continue to grow as a technology that provides simple efficient access to capital markets, making investments easier for clients of all sizes. Our investments over time are driving accelerated momentum across our ETF platform. Second quarter ETF flows of $83 billion were positive across our core equity, strategic and precision categories. ETF flows of $150 billion in the first half of 2024 represents a best start to the year in iShares' history and are more than double what they were in the first half of last year. BlackRock leads the ETF industry in flows. We are also facilitating market expansion. Our Bitcoin ETF reached nearly $20 billion in its first six months and is the third highest grossing exchange-traded product in the industry this year. Three of the five top asset gathering bond ETFs are iShares and our active ETFs are growing contributors with $12 billion of net inflows in 2024. We remain focused on innovating our product offerings, particularly with active ETFs, growing bond ETFs with extending distribution partnerships to make iShares the provider of choice across all wealth platforms. In June, we expanded access to our alpha-seeking expertise through the launch of active US equities and high-yield ETFs managed by some of our leading investors. And we are partnering with a number of international banks and brokerage platform to expand distribution and access to our products. Examples include our relationship with ETF savings plan providers and our recent selection as a premier partner to Envestnet. From winning our first client to serving millions of investors today, Aladdin has been the technological foundation for how we deliver our clients across our platform. Aladdin isn't just the key technology that power BlackRock, it also powers many of our clients. We see clients increasingly using the technology investments across the fintech and data ecosystems. We're partnering with clients who are increasingly looking for comprehensive technology solutions across their entire portfolio from risk analytics, investment management and to accounting capabilities. The need for integrated investment and risk technology as well as whole portfolio views across public and private markets is driving durable ACV growth. Years ago, we anticipated that clients would benefit when alternative investments were evaluated inside a portfolio-level risk management framework. As allocation to private markets increased, we knew the ability to seamlessly manage portfolios and risk across public and private asset classes on a single platform would be critical. BlackRock invested ahead of these clients' needs, acquiring eFront in 2019 and going on to integrate it with Aladdin to deliver a whole portfolio view. And our planned acquisition of Preqin will expand our capabilities beyond private markets, investment management and technology to data. We see a significant runway ahead as private market allocations from our clients will continue to grow alongside their need for an integrated enterprise-level investment technology, data and analytics. Much of BlackRock's success and our momentum today has come from anticipating and making calls and what our clients will need as they pursue long-term outcomes like retirement and financial security. We constantly innovate, we constantly evolve, we transform ourselves and we make sure we deliver for each and every one of our clients. We've spent decades building our global network of relationships of data and analytics, integrating technology and these are the key differentiations to deepening our relationship with clients and accessing unique investment opportunity and partnerships. With our planned acquisition of GIP and Preqin and core business strength, BlackRock's capability has never been stronger. We have the most comprehensive platform in the asset management industry integrating across public markets, private markets and our Aladdin technology, and we are creating a differentiating private markets approach. We're building what our clients need for success, a skilled private market platform encompassing investment, workflow through eFront and data and risk analytics through Preqin. By bringing together investments, tech, data across public and private markets, we have the opportunity to drive better portfolio outcomes for investors and open up a diversified higher multiple earning streams for our shareholders, you. We look forward to delivering strong performance for our clients along differentiated growth, which will be an opportunity for you, our shareholders. Operator, let's open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Laurence D. Fink: Good morning, Alex. Alex Blostein : Hey, good morning, Larry. Hello, everybody. So, lots of optimism on the firm's trajectory for organic growth, and I heard you guys, obviously, echoing maybe some of the comments from last quarter around the strong pipeline and Martin's comments around premium organic growth. So, maybe help contextualize this a little bit more. What did the pipelines look like today? What kind of the timing of some of these conversions that you anticipate? What asset classes? And ultimately, what that means for the firm's organic base fee growth for the back half of '24? Thanks. Martin S. Small: Thanks, Alex. I'll start and I think Larry will add some color. But Q2 organic base fee growth, as I mentioned, was 3%. We had that typically seasonally slow start of the year in Q1. So, 3%, it's just about at our target for where we thought we'd be in May and June. We really see excellent momentum, and I think you got that in Larry's comments. But I'd say on the measures we look at for fee growth velocity sort of last three months, last six months, last 12 months, organic base fee growth, Alex, keeps grinding up by 1 percentage point; it's 1% to 2% and now 3%. And we really feel that markets are on this precipice of a reset. Rate cuts should normalize bond markets, they should normalize fixed-income allocations, they should fuel equities, they should really drive flows. We've been a really meaningful outperformer in these re-risking periods. If I look at sort of previous election cycles, rate reductions, BlackRock had huge upside capture. In '17, '18, '21, we were well above our through-the-cycle targets for organic growth in those periods. And I think when we look at growth, it's going to come from these strong structural growers, and those things grow even faster in supportive markets, ETFs, models, Aladdin, our expanding private markets business. We're closing in and growing our AUM by over $100 billion in private markets with our planned GIP acquisition, and we see that as a huge growth opportunity. So, we'd expect those engines to really capture additional growth that hits our targets, and even on the most modest growth assumptions, I think, for beta end markets to really drive significant differentiated durable earnings and multiple expansion. We look at this all the time as a team. We've achieved our premium organic base fee growth target of 5% on average over the last five years, and BlackRock has a lot of positive leverage to re-risking periods in the market that gives us a great deal of conviction about the path to 5% in the back half of '24 and also our longer-term ambition, I think, to be at 5% or better as we grow private markets and technology. Laurence D. Fink: Alex, let me just add a little more holistic texture. We have never had more dynamic conversations than we ever had now across the world, across products. I truly believe our positioning in iShares today has never been more robust. Our delivery now of active ETFs, our innovation in crypto, having more precision-type products when there is, I would say, more fragmentation going on in the world allows us to have more conversations with differentiated products for our clients. But the feedback now close -- over six months of feedback of our planned acquisition of GIP and the conversations we're having with some of the most sophisticated investors worldwide has never been more robust about how we could partner, how we could be trying to develop more things. And in my prepared remarks, I talked about the confluence of power and AI and data centers. And I believe this is going to be one of the world's biggest growth engines as we start trying to develop AI for everyone, AI not just for the big powerful organizations, but AI utilization for everybody, for every country in the world, and it's going to require just -- we're talking trillions of dollars of investments. And our conversations with the hyperscalers, our conversations with governments, our conversations with the chiller suppliers, the cogeneration suppliers, the opportunities we have in infrastructure is way beyond I've ever imagined even just seven months ago when we were contemplating the transaction and formalizing it. Our conversations with investors from the most sophisticated sovereign wealth funds to our conversations with the RIA channels, the need for data and analytics across the private sector is only going to be growing, and no firm right now has the position that we have with Aladdin, eFront and now with Preqin that we could assist more and more investors. So, we are taking a differentiated approach that obviously we have done that in the past. And I would just like to just say that, and I said in my prepared remarks, we do these things pretty boldly. When we bought eFront, everybody thought there was a big price and yet we've doubled ACV. Martin talked about Aperio where we crossed over $100 billion in AUM. I do believe -- we've talked about AI at BlackRock AI for Investments. One of the big opportunities I see is going to be systematic equities, where we've had now a 10-year track record of approximately 90% outperformance. And I do believe that we saw now close to about $5 billion of flows. I believe this is only going to be accelerating now. As more and more investors are looking at how can you use AI for investments, and we have one of the finest platforms utilizing AI, utilizing big data. So, I'm very excited about the high-growth potential we have in more and more high-fee products, but I'm just as excited about how we can provide better product across the board utilizing our ETF platform. Operator : Your next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Laurence D. Fink: Good morning, Craig. Craig Siegenthaler : Hey, good morning, Larry. So, our question is on the outlook for technology services revenue growth. With tech ACV growth at 10%, which is the low-end of your long-term target range, we want to see if you have visibility into the future trajectory given the timing of larger contract wins within your existing pipeline, in conversations with clients. And now that you have Preqin, how will that also impact the 10% to 15% target in 2025 after the deal closes? Martin S. Small: Thanks, Craig. I'll start and I know Larry will add. Technology, it's just the main engine for investment performance, right? It's the main engine to drive operating leverage. It's what great firms, I think, are using to have great client experiences that fuel growth. And we see a very consistent growth rate in how clients are investing in more technology. I can tell you as a CFO, if I could invest in tech spend, I would. Generally in the marketplace, there's just an acceleration in tech spend across the board. But I think importantly, clients are trying to retire this kind of spaghetti patchwork of legacy systems they have. They want to leverage fewer providers. They want to do deep integrations across the fintech and data ecosystems. They want to have a whole portfolio view across public and private markets. That's always been the thesis of the Aladdin platform. It's how we use it at BlackRock and with our external clients. It was what drove the integration of eFront and Aladdin. And now with Aladdin, eFront and Preqin, we think we have even more opportunities to benefit new clients and the pipeline is very strong. Tech services revenue was up 10% year-on-year, 5% sequentially. As we continue to get the big assignments and new sales from the prior years going live, we expect those revenue numbers to stay strong. Our ACV target, Craig, it's over the long-term. We've achieved it on average since we first started disclosing ACV in 2020. And we think we have a real opportunity to apply and drive indexing principles using Preqin, Aladdin, eFront together across tech data and investments. Preqin is expected to accelerate our planned technology services ACV within our target range. It's going to increase current ACV dollars by about 15%. So, we'll continue to target low- to mid-teens growth in tech services ACV, and we'd expect bringing together Aladdin, eFront and Preqin to be the way that we can get there over the next few years. Laurence D. Fink: Craig, but our line of sight, we are in conversations right now with probably the broadest and largest potential Aladdin assignments ever had. So, the conversations we're having are with broad deep conversations than we've ever had and much of it has to do -- the serious big giant conversation we're having right now are based on the ability that Aladdin can provide both public and private data analytics. And two, we deliver. There are many examples where people made big, broad promises, and there were years, I want to underline years, delayed in the implementation. We have a deep history of delivering on time. That doesn't mean it doesn't take long time to do it, but we are -- we have a huge reputation because of our expertise in delivering the technology platform on time. These are very big and complex, and we do it very well. And now with the combination of Preqin alongside eFront and Aladdin, we have probably the biggest opportunity we've had in 10 years or more in delivery even a more differentiated technology and analytical platform. And by doing so, it could really then expand our entire platform in towards the benchmarking and indexing. As you know, that's been a province of other organizations. Historically, asset managers were precluded the SEC to be into this business. This is why we were never in this business. Asset management firms can now be in it, as you know, and we create some type of customized index, but we look at this as a unique opportunity now for BlackRock. With our position, with our role, we are going to do this with the same, I would say, industrial fortitude as we did in the early years when we were just an asset manager needing risk analytics, so we did it ourselves and then we are so proud of what we did ourselves, we offered it in the '90s to our clients. We are going to do this in the private markets. And we're going to -- this is going to take time, but I think we have a real ability to provide a very differentiated platform in this and this is something of sheer excitement. And if we succeed, this will add a whole new revenue line on BlackRock's revenue side. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Michael Cyprys : Hey, good morning, Larry. Laurence D. Fink: Hi, Mike. Michael Cyprys : Hey. Just a question on the alts business and GIP with the deal expected to close in the third quarter. Can you just talk about your expectations for flows there in the infrastructure space? What strategies are you in the market raising or could be in the market raising over the next 12 months? And maybe talk about some of the steps that you may be able to take to bring some new products to the marketplace, including extending into the private wealth channel? Laurence D. Fink: Great question. Thank you. Well, obviously, we are doing whatever we legally can in terms of making sure that we are making sure that there are two operating entities until we get legal approvals and we close. But that being said, BlackRock is having incredible conversations. GIP is having incredible conversations. We have business integration meetings, which were allowed to do. And the enthusiasm between our team and their teams have -- are way beyond our imagination. This feels so fantastic right now between our organizations and the opportunity we have. As we said, we expect this to be announced in the third quarter. Hopefully, later in the third quarter, we have other announcements of things that we could be talking about, but I'm not really permitted to talk about what are the deals, what are the things we're doing. What I need to be just showing you is our incredible enthusiasm that what we have and the opportunities we have and I do believe we will have post-closing some amazing opportunities and then therefore some amazing announcements. Operator : Your next question comes from Bill Katz with TD Cowen. Bill Katz : Okay. Thanks very much for taking the question. Laurence D. Fink: Good morning, Bill. Bill Katz : Good morning, everybody. Thank you for opening comments. Just coming back to the opportunity for Preqin and you sort of think through the evolution of the private markets, how do you sort of see the product evolution? And is there a pathway here for ETFs given the underlying illiquid nature of the investments? Thank you. Martin S. Small: Thanks, Bill. So, we're extremely excited about this Preqin transaction. We think it really unlocks a whole new segment of growth for our clients, and we think it unlocks a whole new data services segment for BlackRock. And we see really the opportunity to grow Preqin by connecting it with our complementary Aladdin and eFront capabilities, as well as obviously we have a lot of client relationships and significant distribution reach. We'll continue to offer Preqin Pro in the data products as standalones. I think there's really three things that we're focused on here in driving a successful Preqin transaction. The first is simply driving more sales, building out comprehensive fund deal level databases and really integrating data and workflow into a unified platform that better serves clients. The second is, by innovating and launching new data products. I think it's fairly remarkable when you think about the public markets, you think about this symbiotic relationship that risk models and indexes and data have done to create public market indexing, benchmarking, asset allocation, all of those opportunities are ahead of us in the private markets by bringing together risk models, benchmarks and investable indices. We think this opportunity to index the private markets is really one of the most attractive that we've had in the history of BlackRock. And last, we have the ability to drive a lot of scale. We have data factories. Preqin has data factories, not the primary rationale for the transaction, but we really think that we can drive profitable growth, increased scale and efficiency by making this a seamless operating organization. We've had a really good reaction to the transaction from GPs, from LPs, from service providers, all of which who are strong enthusiastic Preqin clients. They're excited about the opportunity to bring together the eFront and Preqin data sets. And so, we think there's a lot of great opportunities here to continue to grow and we're looking forward to closing the Preqin transaction before the end of the year. Laurence D. Fink: I would just add one more point to that. The inquiries that we've had from big vendors, from exchanges, from different organizations about how can we take what Aladdin, Preqin and eFront has, how can we make that -- how can we -- and how are we going to be able to distribute that and utilize that is a great sign that the ecosystem sees the opportunity that we have. And I don't -- I think it was very clear that because of -- we have eFront and Aladdin, we were just in a very unique position to take this and add it to it. And I think this is one of the real strengths of BlackRock. And now we got to -- obviously, we got to close it and we got to execute upon it, but I'm -- as I said earlier, this is something that we can really be transformational and really change the whole foundation of public and private markets. And if we do what we did for public markets with Aladdin and data, what we did for public markets with ETFs and iShares, if we do that and transform more and more private products into more retail products using our data and analytics, we'll transform the capital markets and that's something that BlackRock has been proud of how we've moved the capital markets and this is just another step for us how we could be additive to the global capital markets. Operator : Your next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Laurence D. Fink: Good morning, Dan. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to follow-up, you talked a lot -- about a lot of momentum across the business. Fixed income has been a topic for some time, flows have been a bit more mixed here year-to-date. I guess in the conversations you're having, do you still see that as one of the big areas of incremental growth as the interest rate environment evolves? Laurence D. Fink: Well, I think, as I said in my prepared remarks, sitting in 5% yield makes a lot of sense unless you put in the -- if your liabilities are long dated, you lost money actually because with equity markets up 24% and 17% this year alone. But that being said, we are beginning to see other clients starting to re-risk and they're re-risking other. And let's be clear, if you look at iShares fixed-income flows, the market was basically flat. If you look at the -- so all the AUM growth in iShares fixed income was really re-risking. And what -- I think this is a good statement saying, one, we're going to see more and more ownership in fixed income through ETFs. That's evolution that's going on. Obviously, you're seeing growth in private markets and private credit that continues on. We are widely bullish as more and more clients are going to be using infrastructure debt. And so, I think you're going to start seeing as all this plays out, like we've seen in equities. We used to talk about equities more of a barbelling effect, I think we're starting to see that here in the bond market where more and more people are in their core fixed-income portfolios, they may continue to just use ETFs as a foundation. And our growth in bond ETFs this year in a flat market is a great example that more and more people are getting fixed-income exposure as a core element they are using ETS more and more. And if they are starting to try to get more beta -- excuse me, more alpha in their fixed income side, excuse me, they're going to do it and they're going to do that in more the illiquid space of private credit, they're going to do that in mortgage-backed securities and they're going to do that in infrastructure debt. So, I believe we're very well positioned for that moment when people are recalibrating out of cash. And it's going to be heavily into fixed income, bond funds, it's going to be also more of the alternative ETFs -- alternative income-oriented products. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Laurence D. Fink: Good morning, Ken. Ken Worthington : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Cash management had a strong quarter. To what extent are you seeing or still seeing different and additional institutional clients migrating out of banks to money market funds to get higher yield? And where would you say the global markets are in terms of this transition to higher-yielding forms of cash management? And then to the last question, you called out re-risking a couple of times. Are you seeing re-risking coming out of cash, or is re-risking really a migration within other asset classes either extending duration or going out the risk curve in equities? What are you sort of seeing in terms of that re-risking? Martin S. Small: Thanks, Ken. It's Martin. So, cash flows, $30 billion, as I mentioned, largely driven by government and international prime funds. We had that dynamic at the end of March and the Good Friday dynamic where clients have come out and then we saw a significant kind of return and an increase in balances in early April. We had multiple large new client mandates. I flagged that the cash platform today is about $780 billion. It's grown more than 50% over the last five years. And investors, they are earning a real return in cash. We expect that investors will re-risk. But I'd say a couple of dynamics we've definitely seen in the platform. Post Silicon Valley Bank, we saw through sort of Cachematrix, we saw in our institutional business, I think clients just being more mindful, tactical and kind of operationally flexible in how they manage cash. We think that largely for an institutional manager like BlackRock that's been a good trend of being able to put together technology and customized liquidity accounts in a way that we can grow. And then, ultimately, we have seen this business grow, but I'd also flag that bond ETFs have been a real surrogate, I think for kind of how clients are managing cash. And as Larry mentioned, over the last year we've seen $100 billion basically of organic growth in bond ETFs, which I think have been used as cash or cash proxies along the way as clients manage their liquidity dynamically across money funds, separate accounts and traded instruments like ETFs. Laurence D. Fink: But let me add a little more towards the asset allocation into more re-risking. I think it's a mixed bag, Ken, as we said in our prepared remarks. We're seeing a lot of pension funds who are saying, \"I'm at my liability. My assets reached my liability level. I don't need to own as much equities.\" That's going to be persistent if we continue to have rising equity markets. And on top of that, if -- with rates staying higher longer, that gave those pension funds the liability rate that's set, but obviously if interest rates go back down, the liabilities will go out a little bit. And so, we're seeing some clients actually derisking because they can, but where are they derisking? A lot of clients are not just derisking going from out of equities into cash, they're going into equities into other fixed-income instruments. This is where I believe you're going to see more and more investments into infrastructure where you have less volatility in the investments, higher probable returns, high fixed coupon. So, we're seeing clients around the world recalibrate their risk. There are some clients who were sitting in way excess -- too much cash, and they're obviously paying for that, and we'll see how they re-risk. But overall, I think probably if I had to say the headlines for the first six months, the clients that are overweighted in illiquid strategies like private equity where they had liquidity issues, you saw them keeping more cash balances. If and when the private equity markets unlock itself and there's a little more distribution, maybe you could see some of that cash going out and re-risking. So, you're seeing a whole mixed bag. But I do believe the macro trends towards more bond allocation because of the extensive equity rally over the last 10 years, deeper allocation towards private, especially private credit and infrastructure is going to continue. And I do believe the tools of using ETFs as a core component of portfolios is going to become a larger and larger component of how investors invest. They're going to use more core fixed-income ETFs, more equity ETFs and then barbell against using more -- I would say, more diversified, maybe more illiquid strategies across the board. And I do believe BlackRock is as well positioned for that as any firm in the world. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks? Laurence D. Fink: I do, operator. Thank you. And thank you for all joining us this morning and for your continued interest in BlackRock. Our second quarter results are possible because of our deep partnerships with our clients around the world and our One BlackRock approach in everything we do. We are well-positioned to execute on our landmark mandates across our platform and we're closing in on our planned acquisitions of GIP and Preqin. We see unbelievable growth opportunities for our clients and our shareholders for the rest of 2024 and beyond. Everyone, please stay safe, stay cool, have a lovely summer as best you can. Enjoy our political conversations over the next few weeks. Be active, and have a great quarter. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock, Inc. Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Martin S. Small; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference. Christopher J. Meade: Good morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC which list some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So with that, I'll turn it over to Martin. Martin S. Small: Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the third quarter of 2024. Before I turn it over to Larry, I'll review our financial performance and business results. Our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results. I'll be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. On our previous earnings call, we spoke to improving client sentiment and steadily improving organic growth. We sounded optimism about our growth trajectory in the second half of the year, and in the third quarter organic growth surged and BlackRock delivered some of the best financial results in our history. We generated $221 billion of net inflows, our highest net flows quarter ever. We delivered record levels of quarterly revenue and operating income. We expanded our margin by 350 basis points year-over-year. We generated 5% annualized organic base fee growth, our highest quarter in three years. Organic growth is accelerating as we execute on a strong pipeline and clients turn to BlackRock to move in size into public and private markets. Our structural growers, iShares, whole portfolio outsourcing in Aladdin, the structural growers all delivered strong third quarter growth and are poised to accelerate into year end. iShares, iShares leads the industry in global flows with approximately $250 billion through the third quarter and historically sees upwards of 40% of its total annual flows in Q4. Fixed income ETFs built chiefly on organic growth, iShares fixed income ETF assets now stand at over $1 trillion, nearly 40% higher than at year end 2021. And Aladdin, Aladdin logged 15% ACV growth consistent with our long-term low to mid-teens target with excellent momentum and key wins with growing clients. Finally, fixed income. Fixed income delivered across the platform with over $60 billion of net inflows. We believe a continued path of central bank normalization will support sustained inflows across bond funds, ETFs, and institutional accounts. Fixed income remains a compelling organic growth opportunity for BlackRock. Private markets are a strategic priority for BlackRock, delivering world-class private markets capabilities to more deeply-served clients across the whole portfolio. On October 1st, we closed on our acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners. The combination triples infrastructure AUM and doubles private markets run rate management fees. We're already seeing the power of BlackRock and GIP together. Our partnership with Microsoft and NGX, It aims to realize the enormous investment potential of infrastructure to support AI innovation. And it's just the first proof point of the growth synergies we can create together. We're bringing private markets to wealth clients. BlackRock manages more than $300 billion of assets across model portfolios and separately managed accounts for wealth managers. These portfolios would benefit from increased exposure and more efficient access to the private markets. We believe the model portfolio solution we're building with Partners Group will revolutionize access to private markets for wealth managers and improve portfolio outcomes for millions of households on an even bigger scale than what's been done with Evergreen Funds. And as long observed in markets, information about capital has become almost as important as capital itself. Our planned acquisition of Preqin is accelerating this exciting private markets data and analytics journey for BlackRock and our clients. Our focus remains on delivering BlackRock's platform to clients through access to unique opportunities, expertise, and world-class client service. We're also moving swiftly and aggressively to position our firm to continue to achieve or exceed our 5% organic base fee growth target over the long term. We're building our mix towards higher secular growth areas like private markets, technology, whole portfolio mandates and model portfolios. We believe this will translate to higher and more durable organic growth, greater diversification and resilience in revenue and earnings through market cycles. Successful execution of these goals should also result in multiple expansion for our shareholders. We ended the quarter with AUM near $11.5 trillion. $11.5 trillion units of trust, clients building with BlackRock. Our business tends to be seasonally strongest in the fourth quarter and we maintain line of sight into a broad global opportunity set of new asset management and technology mandates that should fuel organic growth. BlackRock generated total net inflows of $221 billion in the third quarter, representing 8% annualized organic asset growth. Third quarter revenue of $5.2 billion was 15% higher year-over-year, driven by 5% organic base fee growth, the impact of market movements on average AUM over the last 12 months, and alpha generation in our liquid alternative strategies. Operating income of $2.1 billion was up 26% year-over-year. Earnings per share of $11.46 increased 5%, reflecting a higher tax rate compared to a year ago. Non-operating results for the quarter included $108 million of net investment gains, driven primarily by gains linked to a minority investment and unhedged seed capital investments. Our as adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 26%. The prior year quarter included $215 million of discrete tax benefits, while the third quarter of 2024 was impacted by $22 million of discrete expense. We continue to estimate that 25% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2024. The actual effective tax rate may differ because of non-recurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation. Third quarter base fee and securities lending revenue of $4 billion increased 9% year-over-year, reflecting the positive impact of market beta and foreign exchange movements on average AUM and organic base fee growth, partially offset by lower securities lending revenue. Sequentially, base fee and securities lending revenue was up 4%. On an equivalent day count basis, our annualized effective fee rate was approximately four-tenths of a basis point lower compared to the second quarter. This was due to the relative outperformance of lower fee U.S. equity markets and client preferences for lower fee U.S. exposures and lower securities lending. The closing of GIP added $116 billion of client AUM and $70 billion of fee-paying AUM on October 1st. We expect GIP to add approximately $250 million of management fees in the fourth quarter of 2024. The GIP portfolios contribute competitive private markets fee levels that are typically over 100 basis points. They add primarily long dated non-redeemable assets to BlackRock's overall business, which further diversify our revenue and earnings mix. We expect these private market assets to positively impact BlackRock's overall effective fee rate by 0.5 to 1 full basis point. Performance fees of $388 million increased significantly from a year ago, primarily reflecting strong alpha generation over the last 12 months from a hedge fund with an annual lock in the third quarter. Quarterly technology services revenue was down 1% compared to a year ago due to the prior year quarter revenue impact of eFront on-premises license renewals for several large clients. Excluding this impact, technology services revenue would have increased approximately 9% year-over-year. Sequentially, technology services revenue was up 2% reflecting successful client go lives. Annual contract value or ACV increased 15% year-over-year, driven by sustained demand for our full range of Aladdin technology offerings. In the third quarter, a large U.S. asset manager selected Aladdin to unify its investment management technology platform across public market asset classes. Our ACV results include the impact of this client announcement and a number of other new client mandates. Our results highlight the power of Aladdin as a unifying technology. Aladdin provides a highly scalable operating backbone to clients that's tailored to meet their needs. It enables new capabilities to drive top line business growth for clients, while also unlocking scale and efficiency. Clients recognize a direct positive impact to the bottom line. Total expense was 8% higher year-over-year, primarily driven by higher incentive compensation, G&A, and sales, asset, and account expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up 10% year-over-year, reflecting higher incentive compensation as a result of higher performance fees and operating income. G&A expense was up 8% year-over-year, primarily due to the timing of technology spend last year and higher professional services expense. Sales asset and account expense increased 6% compared to a year ago, driven by higher direct fund expense. Direct fund expense increased 7% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, primarily as a result of higher average ETF AUM. Our as adjusted operating margin of 45.8% was up 350 basis points from a year ago, reflecting the positive impact of markets on revenue, significantly higher performance fees, and organic base fee growth. As markets improve, we've executed on our financial rubric, aligning controllable expense and organic growth, adding more resilience to our operating margin through greater variabilization of expenses and driving fixed cost scale. This approach is yielding profitable growth and operating leverage. In line with our guidance in January and excluding the impact of Global Infrastructure Partners, Preqin and related transaction costs, at present we would expect our headcount to be broadly flat in 2024. And we would also expect a low to mid-single digit percentage increase in 2024 core G&A expense. In line with this outlook, we would also expect Q4 core G&A to reflect execution of planned technology investment spend at levels more consistent with Q3 and seasonal increases in marketing spend. We welcomed approximately 400 new colleagues to BlackRock following the close of the GIP transaction. Inclusive of the GIP acquisition impact, at present, we'd expect full-year core G&A expense growth to be closer to the high end of the previously communicated range of a low to mid-single digit percentage increase. Our capital management strategy remains first to invest in our business, to either scale strategic growth initiatives or drive operational efficiency, and then to return excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. At times, we may make inorganic investments where we see an opportunity to accelerate growth and support our strategic initiatives. At the closing of the GIP transaction, we issued and delivered approximately 6.9 million shares of BlackRock common stock, subject to a two-year lockup period. Approximately 30% of the total consideration for the transaction or 5 million shares is deferred and is expected to be issued in approximately five years based on achievement of certain performance milestones. We repurchased $375 million worth of common shares in the third quarter. At present, based on our capital spending plans for the year and subject to market and other conditions, we still anticipate repurchasing at least $375 million of shares in the fourth quarter consistent with our previous guidance. At present, we expect our planned acquisition of Preqin to close around year-end 2024, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. BlackRock's third quarter net inflows of $221 billion were well diversified and positive across client type, product type, active and indexed and regions. Momentum in our ETFs continued to build with $97 billion of net inflows in the third quarter. Fixed income and core equity led net inflows of $48 billion and $32 billion, respectively. Precision ETFs had $20 billion net inflows as clients efficiently adjusted tactical portfolio allocations with tilts towards U.S. and international developed market equities. BlackRock's cryptocurrency ETPs continue to grow and added $5 billion of net inflows in the third quarter. Institutional clients continue to consolidate more of their portfolios with BlackRock, and our institutional franchise raised $56 billion of net inflows in the third quarter. Our institutional active franchise saw $27 billion of net inflows, primarily in fixed income and multi-asset. Flows benefited from the funding of several large insurance and pension outsourcing mandates. We also saw positive flows into systematic equity, LifePath target date offerings, and private market strategies. Institutional index net inflows of $29 billion reflected large mandate wins and client-specific asset allocation and rebalancing decisions. Retail net inflows of $7 billion were led by continued strength in Aperio inflows into U.S. active fixed income mutual funds. Fixed income flows were positive across our municipal bond, high yields, unconstrained, and total return franchises. Demand for our illiquid alternative strategies continued in the third quarter with $1.5 billion of net inflows driven by infrastructure and private credit. Net inflows also reflected the impact of successful realizations of over $3 billion, primarily from private equity and infrastructure strategies. Finally, cash management saw net inflows of $61 billion in the quarter, driven by both US government and international prime funds, and included multiple large new client mandates. Clients recognize the benefits of our scaled and integrated cash offerings, and this is contributing to sizable inflows of BlackRock. BlackRock delivered one of the strongest quarterly results in our history, and we're in an excellent position to grow with our clients, moving ahead into the end of the year and beyond. BlackRock's historically delivered outsized organic growth in periods of investor re-risking, around election cycles, and changes in central bank policy. The fourth quarter's also been historically strong for inflows, so we're staying connected with our clients. We see significant opportunity to deepen relationships and to grow our share. As clients increasingly turn to BlackRock, we believe this will result in sustained market-leading organic growth, differentiated operating leverage, and earnings and multiple expansion over time. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry. Laurence D. Fink: Thank you, Martin, and good morning, everyone. Hopefully everyone has had a good summer and a really fun fall. Last week we happened to cross two milestones on the same day. We celebrated the 25th anniversary of BlackRock becoming a public company and we closed our acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners. We're incredibly excited to officially welcome our GIP colleagues to the BlackRock family. We've enjoyed great connectivity with Adebayo and Raj and all the GIP founding partners. And we look forward to Adebayo joining our Board of Directors this quarter. Reflecting on these milestones and those came before, I believe our relationships with clients, with corporations, and with other partners are the strongest they've ever been. The long-term connectors and our relationship span many years as holders of company debt and equity. Our position as a consistent long-term investor differentiates us from opportunistic capital. We are not transactional. We are effectively perpetual capital, particularly through our index holdings. Those longstanding relationships, underpinned by long-term ownership positions are unlocking differentiated partnerships, especially as we expand into private markets. We founded BlackRock based on our belief in the long-term growth of the capital markets and the importance of being invested in them. BlackRock has grown as the capital markets have become a bigger and bigger part of the global economy. In my conversations with clients and policymakers around the world, I hear how more and more countries recognize the power of American capital markets and would like to build their own type of capital markets. Record government deficits and tighter bank lending means people, companies, and countries will increasingly turn to markets to finance their retirements, their business, and their economies. The growth and prosperity generating power of the capital markets will remain a dominant economic trend in the coming decades. And BlackRock will be an important player in that growth. The opportunities ahead are never been better than we've seen now. We see this through unique deals and partnerships with BlackRock at the center and are an accelerating client activity. 2024 net inflows have already surpassed the full year net inflows of both 2022 and 2023. The asset we manage on behalf of our clients reached a new high, ending the third quarter at $11.5 trillion. AUM has grown $2.4 trillion or 26% over the last 12 months. In that time, clients have entrusted BlackRock with $456 billion of net assets, including a record $221 billion in the third quarter. Third quarter net inflows and corresponding organic base fee growth of 5% represents our highest level in the last three years. And 15% technology services ACV growth is also at a fresh high. On our earnings calls earlier this year, we discussed with our shareholders our visibility to a strong pipeline. We shared how this would lead to accelerating organic growth in the second half and we're seeing that in our results today. We continue to grow our pipeline across the breadth of the Aladdin investment management mandates and we expect momentum to further build into year-end in 2025. We are effectively leveraging our technology, our scale and our global footprint to deliver profitable growth. Quarterly revenues and operating income both set new records, up 15% and 26%, respectively, year-over-year. And our 45.8% operating margin is up 350 basis points. Importantly, organic growth has great breadth and is diversified across BlackRock. Above the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024, flows were positive and active and indexed across all asset classes, across all client types, and across all regions. Actives have contributed $28 billion in the third quarter, including positive results in active equities. ETFs remain a secular growth driver, adding $97 billion in net inflows in the quarter and $248 billion year-to-date. We're seeing a broadening of ETF adaptation globally, leading to increased levels of utilization which we believe will only continue. A number of significant whole portfolio institutional mandates funded in the quarter, and we continue to be chosen for large global solutions. Last month we were selected as a fiduciary manager for over $30 billion dollar Dutch pension fund with more than 30,000 members. Our performance, our technology, and our in-depth knowledge of local investment nuances increasingly make us the preferred partner for institutional clients. Many investors have large cash holdings. Money market industry assets are hitting new records in the quarter, including BlackRock's own cash position, which had $61 billion in net inflows. But investors will have to re-risk to meet their long-term return needs. And we see great opportunities in investors across a number of structural trends continue to build this. These include rapid advancements in technology and AI and rewiring of globalization and the unprecedented need for new infrastructure. BlackRock is exceptionally well positioned in front of that $9 trillion of money market funds across the industry as it makes its way into public and private markets. We are connecting our clients to opportunities and working with them in an integrated whole portfolio lens to help them deploy their capital. We know our strategy is ambitious and our strategy is working. Black market is becoming the premier long-term capital partner across public and private markets. Private markets are becoming increasingly important in the financing of the economy. Growing public deficits are only going to expand the role of private markets and powering economic growth. These dynamics are reshaping the landscape of how our clients invest and how they allocate capital within their portfolios. Throughout our history, we have never shied away from making big bets to better serve our clients. As we did when we created Aladdin, unlocking new markets through ETFs and pioneered whole portfolio advisory across active and index, we made coordinated investments to bring private market opportunities to our clients in a better way. By an enthusiasm for the planned integration of GIP and the closing of Preqin has exceeded our own high expectations. Our clients are excited to see how GIP and Preqin capabilities are amplified by being part of BlackRock. The private markets and the client's allocation to them will continue to grow. Standardized, transparent private market data and analytics will be increasingly important. As with Aladdin, we believe we can add more value to Preqin as both a user and a provider of private market data and risk analytics. Aladdin expanded into new asset classes and markets as BlackRock and our own clients evolved. And we expect the same for Preqin. The growth of private markets is underpinned by the continued rise of infrastructure. It presents a generational investment opportunity. Over the next 15 years, the world will need to invest $75 trillion to repair aging infrastructure to invest in new projects like data centers and decarbonization technology. The current cash flow inflation-protected return profile of infrastructure makes it an attractive sector for our clients, most of whom will represent investor savings for retirement. For the close of GIP, we are now offering our clients access to market-leading investment and operating expertise across infrastructure private markets. Clients will benefit from a substantial scale as the second largest private market infrastructure managers in the world, with $170 billion in client assets. We have differentiated performance. GIP brings a track record of well-timed and disciplined entries into strategic exits, having returned over $45 billion of capital to investors. With higher rates, distributions to paid-in capital are a critical measure of success in where we are an industry leader. The combination of BlackRock\u2019s infrastructure platform with GIP is already unlocking meaningful opportunity for our clients. We recently announced our partnership with Microsoft and MGX to launch the Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership. We will make investments in new and expanded data centers to meet growing demand for compute power. We will also invest in energy infrastructure needed to create new sources of power for these facilities. Mobilizing private capital to build AI infrastructure like data centers and power will unlock a multi-trillion dollar long-term investment opportunity. BlackRock is uniquely positioned at the center of this opportunity through our longstanding relationships with corporates, including hyperscalers and energy suppliers and governments around the world. We look forward to be working with our stakeholders in this ecosystem to navigate opportunities and challenges while we also are delivering investment returns for our clients. This partnership is a powerful demonstration on how our expanded capabilities will enable us to do even more with our clients investing in one of the largest growth imperatives in the coming decades. In addition to infrastructure, private credit is an important component of our client's portfolio. We've grown our own broader private market -- private debt business organically and inorganically in recent years. Today we manage over $85 billion in diversified across lending, investment grade, private placement, infrastructure and real estate debt. And we've been a top 10 fundraiser over the last decade. BlackRock\u2019s nearly $4 trillion in assets across public fixed income cash and private credit means we both provide integrated fixed income solutions for our clients and deliverable scale benefits. Our scale enhance our proprietary deal sourcing access to the execution of deal flow, deeper liquidity, lowering trading costs, all of which benefits each and every one of our clients. Private markets have mainly been accessible to institutional investors while private wealth holding underweight by comparison. For many wealth investors, the addition of private markets to the portfolio may provide diversification benefits to better returns. To help bridge this gap, we recently announced a partnership with a Partners Group to develop a first-of-its-kind private markets model portfolio solution. We believe it will transform retail access by enabling financial advisors and their clients to add broad-based exposures to the private markets, including to the BlackRock funds. We continue to innovate new investment strategies to improve private market access for our clients backed by our own investment expertise, our proprietary sourcing of deals, and our technology. As market complexities and opportunities grow, clients need to scale enablers like Aladdin. Clients use Aladdin to consolidate a patchwork of legacy technologies resulting in greater and better business agility and resilience. It combines risk management, the investment book of record, its performance, its accounting, its risk, and data all on one platform. Clients research shows that Aladdin's scalable capabilities allow clients to grow faster, operate more efficiently, better risk management with their technology spend over the long term. The power of Aladdin is resonating with both asset owners and managers. The ACV growth reflected several significant client mandates, including a large public asset manager, and one of our largest Aladdin assignments ever. Aladdin is core to the consistent performance our portfolio managers deliver for clients. We leverage our investment insights and technology to bring the performance they demand and deserve. Flows into BlackRock active strategies accelerated in the third quarter with $28 billion of net inflows, bringing our year-to-date total of $39 billion. This includes demand for active equities led by our high-performing quant strategies, where more than 90% of the AUM is above the one, three, and five year period. Across asset classes, investment performance remains strong over the long run. This is resonating in our active flows and our liquid performance fees, and performance positions us well for future growth. Index ETFs are increasingly being used with an active management and the ETF structure is being used to pair the alpha generation of leading investors with the liquidity, tax efficiency and transparency offered by ETFs. These dynamics are contributing to client demand globally for iShares ETFs. BlackRock generated in the third quarter ETF net inflows of $97 billion. ETF flows were positive across all segments and major regions, including double-digit organic growth in Europe. There's more to come with the fourth quarter, which typically brings our seasonally strongest period of the year. iShares fixing an ETF platform recently cost $1 trillion in assets, and standalone, it would be a top-five bond manager by itself. Assets have nearly doubled over the last five years. All of that growth has been organic and mostly in a flat to down fixed income beta environment. A more normalized, relatively high rate environment has the potential to encourage investors back even more into fixed income. We continue to innovate in our exchange traded products to provide better access to markets. This quarter we launched our Ethereum ETF which has garnered more than $1 billion of net inflows in the first two months of trading. It follows the successful launch of our Bitcoin product, which has now grown to $23 billion in its first nine months. And we will continue to pioneer new products to be making investing easier and more affordable. On October 1st, 1999, BlackRock listed on the New York Stock Exchange for $14 a share. Today, we're trading somewhere around $960. When we went public, it was with a belief in the importance of growth and the depth of the global capital markets. We wanted to share our success with a broader population of people investing for the future, including our employees that all still holds true today. Our relentless focus on clients, having a growth mindset and a willingness to change and evolve has generated a compounded annual total return of over 20% for our shareholders since our IPO 25 years ago. BlackRock has exceeded the total return of the S&P 500 in 19 of those 25 years, representing a business model to serve all our stakeholders. We are better positioned than ever to serve our clients and to deliver growth for our shareholders in the years to come. I've never felt more optimistic in our positioning as I do today, even after 25 years of being a public firm and 37 years of being a firm. I want to thank all the BlackRock employees for their commitment to upholding our culture and serving our clients with excellence. And again, we welcome our new colleagues and clients from GIP. Operator, let's open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America. Martin S. Small: Hey, Craig. Craig Siegenthaler : Hey, good morning, Martin. Hope everyone's doing well. So my question is on the net flow trajectory. From your broad-based client conversations and your current institutional and funded wind pipeline, do you expect the acceleration of re-risking activity continue into next year post the election? And if your long-term net flows strengthen or stay strong given that they're already pretty strong in the third quarter. Should we expect any outflows in your money market business, which I know might be somewhat protected given the institutional scale? Martin S. Small: Thanks, Craig, for the question. So new inflows are strong, as you said, very healthy on any and all of the measures we track. No question, Craig, we're winning share with our clients. The $221 billion of Q3 flows, they showed great breadth across the business. Positive flows in U.S. active fixed income mutual funds, systematic equity, LifePath target date. Larry talked about just our long-term active business really shows resilience. Since 2019, I think we've had positive active flows in 18 of 23 quarters. So, we just continue to have a very strong flow performance, 25% higher than full year 2023, and we still have this seasonally strong Q4 ahead. So, we feel like a very healthy trajectory on asset growth. It's an affirmation for us that we're focused on the right things with clients. And I think for where we are in the cycle, BlackRock's always been a meaningful out performer in re-risking periods. So going back to previous election cycles or central bank action, if you look at BlackRock, we had outsized upside capture if that was in 2017, 2018, 2021, and we saw very strong organic asset growth as well as organic base fees growth that was over our long-term targets. So we see that the market and we think the world is lining up for that with our clients. And then with respect to money markets, our business is largely institutional. It's been very durable. The $61 billion of flows that's come there I think have been good. The trajectory has been very strong this year. I think Craig when we look at it, our money market fund business is at $850 billion today. It's nearly 70% bigger than it was five years ago. Cash is a meaningful part of client portfolios, but we're seeing that sort of return to fixed income as well, which has been good for the flow trajectory. Laurence D. Fink: I would just add one thing is, as the global capital markets become a larger player in the economic activity here and other places in the world, the opportunity for us and our positioning for us is fantastic. And that will allow the backdrop for better flows and more exciting opportunities. Operator : We'll go next to Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Michael Cyprys : Hey good morning. Laurence D. Fink: Hi Michael. Michael Cyprys : Hey, congratulations on the strong quarter here. Great to see the meaningful operating leverage as well in the quarter. Just curious how you're pacing investments spent here into 2025. How is that evolving? And what are some of the levers to drive margining in the 12 to 18 months? Maybe you can update us on where you are along the journey of variablizing your expenses. Martin S. Small: Thanks, Mike. I appreciate it. It\u2019s Martin. So just contextually, right, our approach to shareholder value creation is to generate industry-leading differentiated organic growth, to drive operating leverage and industry-leading margins and to execute on a consistent capital management strategy. We've got a strong track record at BlackRock of investing in the business for growth and scale, while also expanding profitability. It's not just about growth, it's about profitable growth over the long term. As our growth comes from being very disciplined in making and managing continued investments in our business. We've dubbed this our financial rubric, which I mentioned. We size our operating investments in line with a prudent lens on organic growth potential. We're aiming to put more flexibility in our cost base and variablizing more expenses where we can, and we've made a lot of progress there. And most importantly, we're looking to generate fixed cost scale, especially through investments in technology. We've got a consistent track record of delivering industry leading margins and improving them. And I'd say the scale indicators, they're really coming through the results. We generated 350 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year, while operating income rose 26%. And since the end of 2022, BlackRock assets under management are up $3 trillion, while headcount is broadly flat. So we're delivering the benefits of scale and productivity which showing our margin expansion. We continue to believe that technology, automation, firm foot printing are the major levers there for us to continue to drive that margin expansion. The last thing I'd say is just market movements, market movements beta, that's our highest margin item, both when markets move meaningfully up or down. And we continue to see conditions for reasonably positive growth in the markets over the near to intermediate term. So we believe we can continue to invest to accelerate organic growth and deliver margin expansion using this financial rubric that we've laid out. Operator : We'll go next to Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Hey, Larry. Hey, Martin. Good morning. Laurence D. Fink: Hi, Alex. How are you? Alex Blostein : I'm good, thanks. Question for you guys on private markets, there's a couple of topics, but maybe starting with GIP, helpful to maybe just to get a market to market on some of the financial elements. I know Martin, you talked about $250 million, I think, in management fees in the fourth quarter. Can you talk a little bit about how you see that evolving into 2025? What are some of the kind of fun flow dynamics on the legacy GIP side and what are some of the things that you guys are working with them together? And also if you could just remind us what the operating margin on that business is as well out of the gate as well. Thanks. Martin S. Small: Thanks Alex. So just the closing of GIP, it's a great milestone in BlackRock's history. We're really excited to welcome over 400 new colleagues, to welcome the leadership team, Adebayo, Raj, Michael, John, everybody. Our clients are excited. The consultants that we've been working with are excited. The corporate partners are excited. So we're really eager to partner on this new platform. And the reception, as Larry mentioned, has been overwhelmingly positive. For us, this is a revenue growth story. This is about expanding capabilities. We're working to unlock substantial growth synergies across origination, capital formation, and platform scale. We're seeing excellent momentum in fundraising for -- across the platform at GIP, at BlackRock, and have, I'd say, really strong ambitions, especially around the AI Innovation Fund that Larry mentioned. As I mentioned on the call in my earlier remarks, we're consolidating $116 billion of GIP AUM, client AUM, $70 billion of fee-paying AUM. We're doubling private markets run rate management fees at BlackRock in the transaction. Think about GIP adding, as we said on the call, annualized north of $400 million of earnings at sort of 50-ish percent margins, $250 million in management fees we expect to come in the fourth quarter. So I'd model sort of a $1 billion of fees with an FRE margin north of 50% when we think about 2025 in terms of GIP. Operator : We'll go next to Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Laurence D. Fink: Hi Dan. Operator : Caller, your line is open. You may be on mute. Dan Fannon : Sorry, can you hear me? Laurence D. Fink: Yes, we can now, Dan. Dan Fannon : Okay, great. Sorry about that. I was hoping you could discuss your appetite for additional M&A and what constraints you have financially, but more importantly as a management team to appropriately integrate the recent deals and really maximize the opportunity you have with these transactions? Martin S. Small: All right, thanks so much for the question. As I said, we're really excited for our clients about GIP and Preqin. This is a meaningful accelerant in our private markets capabilities. And I think just, as I mentioned in the last question, it's a major financial contributor for BlackRock, but it's going to take some work to integrate well and realize the plan synergies of the transaction. So right now we're very focused on integrating GIP and closing Preqin, and we're focused on delivering a great integration experience for clients and employees. We've always thought of making organic and inorganic investments in our business. And inorganic is a tool that we have in order to optimize organic growth, but we don't need M&A to meet our organic growth targets. Look at this quarter, we've hit our 5% organic base fee growth target and we see excellent momentum. So, we'll continue to be prudent with our capital and financial position and consistent with our long-term approach. We'll evaluate inorganic opportunities that have the benefit for our clients and shareholders. We're always going to be very rigorous and selective in those criteria and entertain possibilities that have clear alignment with our culture, strategy and long-term organic growth. We have great capabilities here, Dan. So across infrastructure now, we've got $170 billion platform. We have an $85 billion private credit platform. We have a huge opportunity to grow inorganically in private credit with our insurance clients. We're the largest core fixed income manager in the world for insurance companies -- organic, we have the largest organic opportunity to grow -- organic opportunity to grow with our insurance clients. We manage $700 billion of insurance company general account assets for them. So if you think about the conversations we're having with CIOs to integrate our private credit capabilities into that GA. If we can just flip seven -- if we can flip 10% of the $700 billion into private credit strategies, that's $70 billion of opportunity sitting with existing clients with the capabilities that we have today. Operator : We'll go next to Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Laurence D. Fink: Hi, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. So I think we're all pretty impressed with the broad growth that you keep putting up and huge margins too. So, I want a high-level question. You mentioned the word multiple expansion once or twice during the conversation and it's just -- I think earnings growth needs to be part of the equation too. When you have strong growth and everything, you have big margins. I'm just curious why 5% EPS growth this quarter, should we expect these initiatives as they layer in and you consistently hit your base fee targets to actually bring the earnings growth along with it too. I appreciate that. Thanks. Martin S. Small: Thanks so much for the question, Glenn. So we're focused on driving differentiated organic growth, meeting our 5% organic growth targets through the cycle driving operating leverage. And as you said, I think you see those results very much coming through. We think if we are able to drive 5% organic growth, continue to execute on this financial rubric I laid out. We should be able to drive industry-leading margins and margin expansion and double-digit EPS growth. I think in the quarter, I mentioned our effective tax rate was 26% in the quarter. And that's the main driver between some of that lighter EPS here was the $22 million of discreet expense that we had in this quarter versus the $215 million of benefit that we had last year from discreet. Operator : We'll go next to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Laurence D. Fink: Hi Brian. Brian Bedell : Hi, good morning. Congrats on a great quarter. Maybe just back to the 5% organic base fee growth and maybe a different angle on this in terms of the fee rate. Obviously, the rate is going up with the GIP acquisition of that 0.5 to 1 basis point. Do you feel better now than you have maybe in a long time on the potential for the fee rate to either be stable or even move up sequentially in the next several years versus the fee pressure that you've seen. And I know it's all been due to mix in the past, but now the composition of your future organic growth seems to be tilted more towards the private markets, towards higher fee products versus, obviously, some of the lower mandates that you've been bringing in and also the core iSeries -- iShares, [Core Series] (ph) iShares, sorry. So bottom line is, do you feel better about that fee rate growth potential? And maybe if you can just touch on the model portfolios partnership as well in terms of the organic growth potential there. Martin S. Small: Absolutely. Thanks so much for the question. So we generated 5% annualized organic base fee growth in the quarter. So 5% annualized organic base fee growth. We're excited about that. Continue to see great momentum just in our organic growth. We're growing revenues and operating income at double digit rates and expanding margin. Average AUM growth was 18% higher than base fee growth, and that was mainly due to relative outperformance of lower fee rate US equities, or what you all in our analyst community would call divergent beta. So spot AUM of $11.5 trillion ended the quarter about 4% higher than average AUM. And so our annualized effective fee rate was approximately four-tenths of a basis point lower sequentially. More macro just on the fee rate. On our AUM, the fee rate, it's a backward-looking output basically of the mix of the stock of assets that we manage and net new flows and net new fields on the fee rate. It's primarily affected by beta and FX and also by organic growth. And so over more recent periods, US public equity markets, which are a lower fee rate segment, They've grown faster than international equities. And that's been a driver of these fee rate trends on our platform. And in those environments of strong US equities, also the new base fee growth tends to occur at relatively lower fields to international or EM equities. Fee rate for us, it's primarily an output. It's not the basis or driver of the strategy. We're focused on meeting client needs across the whole portfolio. We're focused on technology. We're focused on driving organic growth in the most efficient way possible. But I do think you're grabbing on the point that we see, which is as we grow our private markets business, and we're going to go from $170 billion of client AUM with GIP to call it $285 of client AUM, as we grow our private markets business, we would expect to see positive leverage to base fee revenue. We'd expect to see positive leverage to average fee rates and organic growth over time. Going into Q4 ex-GIP, we'd expect the entry rate to be flat. And as I noted, consolidation of the GIP portfolios into our business is expected to lift the fee rate by about a 0.5 to 1 full basis point. So in the longer term, as we see a liquids and private markets as a bigger contributor to our business mix, we would expect that to have positive leverage on the fee rate. Operator : We'll go next to Bill Katz with TD Cowen. Bill Katz : Okay, thank you very much. Good morning everybody. Happy anniversary. I think I was there at the beginning. Sad to say. Indeed, I remember that meeting like it was yesterday. So question for you, I was very intrigued by your statement about revolutionizing the wealth management opportunity. I was wondering if you could maybe unpack that a little bit. I think you mentioned that the whole portfolio opportunity could be better than everything on the evergreen side to date. And just wondering if you could expand your thinking a little bit just so we get a sense of the magnitude and the opportunity and maybe any go-to-market strategy we should be thinking about as we look into the new year? Thank you. Martin S. Small: Thank you. Thanks, Bill, very much. Very much appreciate the question. So we have strong relationships in wealth and retail markets across the globe. Our aims to help wealth managers build long-term portfolios that blend public and private markets exposures. I think if you go back to the last several investor days we've had, we've talked about building the portfolio of the future for wealth managers, which is digitally enabled, it's public-private, and this market, I think, is still very early. Retail allocation to private markets still remains in low single digits. Just on capabilities for us here, we have a great established leading franchise in retail liquid alternatives. We've got over $40 billion of assets here across merger [ARB] (ph), systematic multi-strategy commodity exposures. We've had a lot of success in bringing retail [alts] (ph) to retirement in the UK and Europe through the LTIF and LTAP for structures. We've been building out our evergreen and credit integral funds here in the United States. We have a credit strategies integral fund [CredEx] (ph). We have a non-traded credit BDC [BDET] (ph), which are combined to be over a $1 billion today. BDET's well placed for RIAs, independent broker dealers, offshore wealth. We think this can be a strong grower for us. But as you said, longer term, our aspiration is to integrate semi-liquid products into our over $300 billion of managed models and SMAs. That would be the most significant unlock and we feel competitive advantage we have. It's at the heart of the models venture that we've entered into with Partners Group. But I'd say, it's consistently, it's part of the partnerships we have with InvestNet, with GOL, with iCapital, with Case, with Vesmark. Our goal is to make model portfolios seamless in terms of public-private in the same way we've been able to do that with ETF and mutual fund active model portfolios. So we have a lot more work to do on that, but we're excited about the opportunity. Laurence D. Fink: Bill, let me add more to that answer. As we believed when we acquired BGI that ETS would become the instrument of so much of the activity in the capital market that it's really been that way. Even in 2012 when we said ETS are going to be expanding heavily in fixed income to the surprise of so many people and we crossed $1 trillion from that. What we are seeing now in private markets of blending of public and private and that's going to continue to blend. Institutional clients are going to be looking at measurements of liquidity, and they're going to be trading in between public and private. That will become the new domain. And so, we're not going to look at private markets in the same way. Like we're not going to say there are alternatives. They're just part of the marketplace itself. And one of the reasons why we were so driven to acquire Preqin, we believe that data and analytics will accelerate that movement of making public and private ubiquitous together and what we're going to look at is liquidity as the driver of risk. And so, we're going to be blending liquidity from the public markets, the liquidity of the private markets and making risk assessments. And if through the data analytics that we could have combining Preqin, Aladdin and eFront, if we could build that platform into more transparency in privates, more opportunities for privates, this idea of the blending in public and privates will become a reality, just like the reality of how ETFs became the driving force of so many of the markets now, and we believe that will happen too, but it's going to happen with the acceleration of data and analytics. So when you think about these retail platforms that will be driving more private type of exposures, it will accelerate only when we have better data analytics transparency indexing and that is a major component of our strategy going forward. Operator : We'll go next to Ben Budish with Barclays. Laurence D. Fink: Hey Ben, good morning. Ben Budish : Good morning and thank you for having me on the call. I wanted to ask about your ambitions in digital assets to maybe change it up a little bit. It seems like one way or another we're going to have a new president next year who's going to be more friendly to the industry. And while it could take some time to see new rules and regulations, I'm just wondering, what do you see as the key opportunities for BlackRock that this change in posture from Washington could unlock sort of beyond the ETF business and some of the other custody things you do? Thank you. Laurence D. Fink: Well, first, I'm not sure if either president or other candidate would make a difference. I do believe the utilization of digital assets are going to become more and more of a reality worldwide. Conversations we\u2019re having with institutions worldwide, conversations about how should they think about digital assets, what type of asset allocation there should be. We believe Bitcoin is asset class in itself, it is an alternative to other commodities like gold. And so I think the application of this form of investment will be expanded. Two, the role of Ethereum as a blockchain can grow dramatically. So if we can create more acceptability, more transparency, more analytics related to these assets, then it will be expanded. But I truly don't believe it's a function of regulation, of more regulation, less regulation. I think it's a function of liquidity, transparency, and then through that process, no different than when you -- years ago when we started the mortgage market, years ago when the high yield market occurred, started off very slow, but it built as we build better analytics and data and then through better analytics and data, more acceptance and a broadening of the market. And I truly believe we will see a broadening of the market of these digital assets. And then we'll see how does each and every country look at their own digital currency. That's a very different asset than a Bitcoin in itself. But I do believe what we're going to witness as we build out better analytics. And then the question is, as you mentioned, regulation. How do we see in this country the role of digitizing the dollar? And what role does that play? That's a very different question related to, let's say, Bitcoin and other items like that. But all of that is going to be under discussion. And what we're witnessing in other countries that we're seeing big success in India and Brazil in the digitization of their own currency for various different reasons. But we believe the technology of these blockchains are going to become very additive. And then it will overlay AI and having better data analytics. The applicability and the broadening of these markets will occur. Operator : We'll go next to Brennan Hawken with UBS. Laurence D. Fink: Hi, Brennan. Brennan Hawken : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Curious whether you all have seen any changes in the RFP activity on the fixed income side. There's recently been some regulatory issues at a large institutional bond manager. So kind of curious about what you're seeing in the market there on the back of that? Laurence D. Fink: So if you look at our announcement this quarter, we announced we won a $30 billion mandate from a pension fund. It is not uncommon to see big, large changes in the marketplace. I don't want to talk about one client or another client or what's happening with one manager versus another manager. There is no question, money is in motion. Rob Capito talks about this a lot. We are seeing this. There's a very large institutional mandate that are going to be up for -- there's an RFP right now. And so, I don't look at this as any different. Obviously there are some issues around that are in the press, but money in motion occurs every quarter. There are large opportunities every quarter. And I think one thing that we see consistently as OCIO mandates occur, they're occurring with more regularity and with more opportunity. And this is away from the topic that you brought up. But it's important to just note this is not uncommon seeing large blocks of business moving around. And I'll leave it at that. Operator : At this time, this does concludes today's Q&A session. And I'd like to turn the call back to Larry Fink for any additional or closing remarks. Laurence D. Fink: Thank you, operator. I want to thank all of you for joining us this morning and your continued interest in BlackRock over these last 25 years. Our third quarter results are possible because of the global network of relationships we've created, our data analytics that are differentiated by all imagination, and importantly our integrated technology that we built over many, many years. We have a long history of good integration, whether it is integration of BGI, Malim, Aperio, eFront, and now we're working on a successful close and integration of GIP. And we expect the same thing of a closing and integration of Preqin around year end. And I believe our position has never been better. And I believe as we look forward in delivering strong performance for our clients, we will create differentiated growth for you, our shareholders, in the coming years ahead. Everybody, thank you and have a nice and positive quarter. Thank you. Bye-bye. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Martin S. Small; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference. Christopher J. Meade: Good morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which list some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So with that, I'll turn it over to Martin. Martin S. Small: Thanks, Chris. Good morning and Happy New Year to everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024. Before I turn it over to Larry, I'll review our financial performance and business results. Our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as adjusted financial results. I'll be focusing primarily on our as adjusted results. With over $600 billion in net new assets entrusted to BlackRock, 2024 was a milestone year of programmatic organic and inorganic actions rooted in client needs, investment capability expansion, technology, and scale. We executed breakthrough investment offerings and industry-leading partnerships. 2024 marks a quantum leap forward for BlackRock against our long-term value creation objectives and an invigoration of the future of asset management and technology services for our clients. We've spoken all year about how organic growth momentum and overall client sentiment has been improving. BlackRock saw record net inflows in 2024, powered by two back-to-back record flows quarters in the second half. Our annual revenue, operating income, and earnings per share each grew double digits. We made disciplined investments for profitable growth, delivering 280 basis points of margin expansion as our AUM grew to a new high of nearly $11.6 trillion. We enter 2025 from a position of strength, having generated 7% annualized organic base fee growth in the fourth quarter, our highest in three years. Our record client activity and the accelerating organic revenue growth we saw in 2024, they're independent of the lift that we believe will come from GIP, HPS, and Preqin. Our structural growth businesses, ETFs, Aladdin, outsourcing, fixed income, they're the strong foundations to serve clients and deliver on our through the cycle 5% organic growth objectives. We didn't need M&A to achieve and rise above our organic base fee growth target. Our expansions are about more deeply serving clients in high growth segments that can exceed our 5% goals. We enter 2025 on a new trajectory, with record AUM and operating income and having increased our effective fee rate by seven-tenths of a basis point. Over the course of 2025, we'll be integrating and adding the high-growth and earnings power of GIP, HPS, and Preqin. Clients have embraced our strategy. Our track record of successful acquisitions and integrations is bringing clients into deeper relationships with BlackRock. We finished 2024 with sequential quarters of at or above target organic growth. More importantly, that organic growth is broad-based across institutional, wealth, and technology and across regions. Clients want to consolidate more of their portfolios with a partner that's with them for the long term. They want portfolios that are seamlessly integrated across public and private markets that are dynamic and that are underpinned by data, risk management, and technology. BlackRock is now truly in a category of one. We've built a unique asset management and fintech platform that's integrated across public and private markets. With the close of the GIP transaction this past October and our planned acquisition of HPS, BlackRock's private markets and alternatives platform is expected to be $600 billion in client assets, a top-five provider, and over $3 billion in revenues or about 15% of 2024 revenues. BlackRock houses whole portfolio solutions for clients, the world's number one ETF franchise by assets, flows and breadth of exposures, a $3 trillion fixed income platform across active and index, $700 billion managed for insurance companies, over $350 billion in models, direct indexing and SMAs for wealth managers, over $900 billion in cash management AUM, leading advisory services and our proven Aladdin technology with $1.6 billion in revenues. Aladdin is powering a whole portfolio ecosystem across public and private markets with eFront in our planned acquisition of Preqin. On a pro forma basis for HPS and Preqin, private markets and technology are expected to make up over 20% of BlackRock's overall revenue. That's an ecosystem we feel wins with client needs and results in over 20% of our revenue base in long-dated, less market-sensitive products and services. Our mix continues to evolve towards higher secular growth areas with clients. We believe this will translate to higher and more durable organic growth, greater resilience through market cycles and multiple expansion. In 2024 BlackRock generated a record $641 billion of total net inflows and delivered 4% organic base fee growth. We finished the year strong in the fourth quarter with $281 billion of total net inflows and 7% annualized organic base fee growth. Full-year revenue of $20.4 billion was up 14% year-over-year. Operating income of $8.1 billion was up 23% and earnings per share of $43.61 increased 15%. Fourth quarter revenue of $5.7 billion was 23% higher year-over-year, driven by the impact of higher markets on average AUM and higher performance fees. Quarterly operating income of $2.3 billion was up 36%, while earnings per share of $11.93 was 23% higher versus a year ago. EPS also reflected a lower tax rate, partially offset by lower non-operating income and a higher share count in the current quarter. The higher share count included 6.9 million shares issued and delivered at the closing of the GIP Transaction. Non-operating results for the quarter included $7 million of net investment losses, primarily due to changes in co-investment valuations. Lower interest income in the current quarter reflected the delivery of cash at the closing of the GIP transaction, which was raised through our debt offering in March 2024. Our as adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 21% and benefited from discrete items. We currently estimate that 25% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for 2025. The actual effective tax rate may differ because of non-recurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation. Fourth quarter base fees and securities lending revenue of $4.4 billion was up 23% year-over-year and up 10% sequentially, driven by the positive impact of market beta on average AUM, organic base fee growth, and approximately $230 million of base fees from GIP. Our annualized effective fee rate was approximately seven-tenths of a basis point higher compared to the third quarter. Over time and with continued growth in infrastructure strategies and the successful closing of the HPS acquisition, we would expect to see positive leverage to base fee revenue, average fee rates, and organic growth as we grow private markets with clients. This is evidenced by this quarter's fee rate increase, primarily reflecting the onboarding of higher-fee rate private markets assets following the GIP closing. Fourth-quarter and full-year performance fees of $451 million and $1.2 billion, respectively, increased from a year ago, led by higher revenue from alternatives. We saw strong broad-based performance across hedge funds. Quarterly technology services revenue increased 13% year-over-year and full-year revenue of $1.6 billion increased 8%, reflecting the successful onboarding of a number of new clients and expanding relationships with existing clients. Full-year technology services revenue growth also reflects the prior year revenue impact of several clients' renewals of eFront on premises licenses. Annual contract value or ACV increased 12% year-over-year. On a constant-currency basis, we estimate ACV would have increased 13% from a year ago. The need for integrated risk analytics and whole portfolio views across public and private markets is driving strong demand for Aladdin. We signed some of our largest clients ever in 2024. We remain committed to low to mid-teens ACV growth over the long term. Total expense increased 9% in 2024, primarily due to higher incentive compensation, G&A and sales, asset, and account expense. Full-year employee compensation and benefit expense was up 11%, reflecting higher incentive compensation as a result of higher performance fees and operating income. Recall that year-over-year and sequential comparisons of fourth-quarter compensation expense are less relevant because we finalized full-year compensation in the fourth quarter. Full-year G&A expense was up 5%, primarily from planned technology investment spend, higher professional fees, and GIP's G&A expense. During the year, we made disciplined investments in business to drive operating leverage and profitable growth. Our fourth-quarter as adjusted operating margin of 45.5% increased 390 basis points year-over-year and our full-year as adjusted operating margin of 44.5% was up 280 basis points. Looking ahead, we aim to maintain our systematic approach to investing for profitable growth on the budgeting principles we've consistently articulated for the last 12 to 18 months. We'll continue to be disciplined in prioritizing our hiring and overall investments with the ambition of delivering market-leading organic growth and operating margin. At present, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, we expect our planned acquisitions of Preqin and HPS to close in the first quarter of 2025 and in mid-2025, respectively. Based on these closing timelines, we'd expect BlackRock's headcount to be higher in 2025. Our planned acquisitions of Preqin and HPS are expected to bring approximately 2,300 new colleagues to BlackRock. Additionally, excluding HPS, we would expect a mid-to-high single-digit percentage increase in 2025 core G&A expense. Most of the core G&A expense growth should come from consolidating the G&A expense of GIP and Preqin and continued investment in technology as we look to operate more efficiently and better serve our clients. Our capital management strategy remains consistent. We invest first, both organically and inorganically, either to scale strategic growth initiatives or drive operational efficiency. We then return cash to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. After investing for growth, we returned over $4.7 billion to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases in 2024. This includes open-market repurchases of approximately $375 million and $1.6 billion for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. Share repurchases have been a consistent element of our capital management strategy. In the last 10 years, we've repurchased 28 million shares at an average price of $510 per share. Today, we're trading at almost double that. This represents a more than 15% annualized return for our shareholders. For both the GIP and HPS transactions, BlackRock Equity proved a valuable currency in consummating these transactions and structuring them for alignment with our shareholders. At present, based on capital spending plans for the year and subject to market and other conditions, we're targeting the purchase of 1.5 billion of shares during 2025. In addition and also subject to market and other conditions, we expect to seek Board approval later this month for an increase to our first-quarter 2025 dividend, consistent with our track record of continued dividend growth. Record full-year total net inflows of $641 billion were diversified across active index and cash as well as by region, led by $385 billion of net inflows from clients in the United States. BlackRock generated industry-leading ETF net inflows of $390 billion in 2024, representing 11% organic assets and 7% organic base fee growth. Record annual net inflows into our ETFs included $41 billion into our digital assets ETPs that were just launched in 2024. Fourth-quarter ETF net inflows of $143 billion reflected significant momentum into year-end, helped by seasonal portfolio reallocations. As U.S. equity indices and spot Bitcoin prices reached new highs in the quarter, clients used iShares products to re-risk and add these investment exposures to their portfolios. BlackRock's institutional platform generated net inflows of $74 billion in 2024, led by active net inflows of $64 billion, including the funding of several large outsourcing mandates from a variety of client types. Index net inflows of $9 billion were driven by $43 billion into fixed income. This was partially offset by $31 billion of net redemptions from low-fee index equity strategies. Several large clients, mostly outside the United States rebalanced their portfolios amid record equity market levels. Full-year retail net inflows of $24 billion were led by continued strength in Aperio and inflows into active fixed-income mutual funds. Aperio had another record year in 2024 with net inflows of $14 billion and active fixed-income added $12 billion of net inflows. Demand for private markets remains strong with $9 billion of net inflows during the year driven by infrastructure and private credit. BlackRock's full-year net inflows also included the impact of successful realizations of $13 billion, primarily from private equity, private credit, and infrastructure strategies. Distributions are a key metric for measuring performance in the private markets. GIP has a strong track record of operating portfolio companies and ultimately returning capital to investors through exits with strong uplift. At present, we expect to recognize approximately $5 billion of realizations in the first quarter from older GIP fund vintages executing on successful exits. Starting this quarter, we've updated our earnings supplement to provide additional transparency into organic growth drivers and realizations activity for our private markets assets. We expect to make disclosure enhancements, particularly around private markets beginning in the first quarter of 2025. Finally, BlackRock cash management saw $81 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter and $153 billion in 2024. Flows were driven by both U.S. government and international prime funds and included multiple large new client mandates. We continue to see strong growth in our cash and liquidity platform built on our scale and integrated offerings with AUM up 20% year-over-year. BlackRock's platform delivered record results in 2024 and the consistency of our results stands out even more over the long term with over $2 trillion of client net inflows over the last five years. While 2024 was a watershed year for BlackRock, it's just the start of our next growth story. We're better positioned than ever to build with clients and create value for our shareholders. BlackRock is a meaningful outperformer when assets are in motion and investors are re-risking. We're optimistic about market opportunities for our clients into 2025. I'm going to pass to Larry in a minute. But for those of you keeping score at home, this is Larry's 100th earnings call. We did a little research and counted only 15 current CEOs in the S&P 500 that have celebrated 100 earnings calls as the CEO. Larry, congratulations on a century of earnings calls. How does it feel? Laurence D. Fink: I can't say, I feel any older. I can't complain at all. It's been a fun journey and I think the journey going forward is it going to be better. There's a lot of change in the world in the last 25 years. Another lot that stays the same. My meal the night before earnings remains the same and a bowl of cereal last night with blueberry. So, I guess, everything is the same. But thank you, Martin. And also Happy New Year to everybody, and thank you for joining the call. And yes, it is our 100th. But I haven't done it alone. We have a number of shareholders that have been with us since the IPO 25 years ago. I remember that original roadshow when we tried to convince many of our shareholders remain today about the opportunities to invest in BlackRock. And we're also grateful for the analyst community in helping the markets understand our business. I think two of our equity analysts on the line are with us from the IPO. So I want to thank -- thanks to Bill Katz and Brian Bedell for your coverage over all these years. And the best is still in front of us. When we IPOed, we were a company of 650 employees and we managed $165 billion in assets. That same year, we began selling our Aladdin technology to our clients for the first time. Today, clients trust us with nearly $11.6 trillion of AUM and Aladdin has more than 130,000 users. Since our IPO, we've delivered an annualized total return for our shareholders about 21% compared to about 8% for the S&P 500. And as I said, this is just the beginning. As Martin said, 2024 was a milestone year for BlackRock. Clients entrusted us with a record $641 billion of net inflows, including $281 billion in the fourth quarter. We now had two consecutive record flow quarters. We entered 2025 at our strongest inflection point. We added $1.5 trillion of AUM, delivered record revenues and record operating income, and increased our effective fee rate by 5%. Historic client activity took place as we executed on the most significant acquisitions we've done since BGI over 15 years ago. It's not uncommon for companies to see clients pausing. As they wait out the M&A results, as they determine and -- determine whether BlackRock is focusing on their needs. At BlackRock, clients are instead embracing and rewarding our strategy. Clients activity accelerated into the fourth quarter, resulting in a 7% organic base fee growth and 12% technology services ACV growth. Our operating model delivered exceptional performance in a year of meaningful change. We crossed the $20 billion of annual revenues, up 14% from our 2023. Our adjusted operating income grew by 23% and our industry margins of 44.5% was up 280 basis points. We always raise the bar for ourselves and know our clients and shareholders do the same. Our results consistently beat even our high expectations and we surpassed Street estimates for flows, fee rate, base rate in addition to total revenues, margins, and EPS. Our record organic growth and financial results do not yet reflect the full integration or pending acquisitions of GIP, HPS, and Preqin. All three of these businesses have a track record of delivering strong revenue growth, profitability, and margin expansion. And we're steadily making organic investments ahead of our -- the structural trends that we believe will drive outsized growth in the years ahead. We've had strong momentum across our entire franchise, including our newly enhanced private market platform. We positioned ahead of market opportunities that we believe will drive outsized growth for BlackRock in the years to come. We invested in our talent, which is fundamentally the most important thing that we invest in each and every year. Our key driver of BlackRock's success has been our focus on developing leaders with a broad range of experiences and connectivity across all of BlackRock, what I've called horizontal leadership. We look to identify people ready for the next challenge and then move them into roles that both advance their professional journeys and drive our business forward. Today, we are excited to announce that many leaders across the firm are taking on new and expanded roles and responsibilities that will help drive our next phase of growth. Part of the leadership changes reflect on Mark Wiedman's desire to pursue his next chapter after nearly 20 years with BlackRock. We've discussed his transition over a number of months and he will be with us through spring and I want to take a moment to recognize and thank Mark. Mark is a great friend of mine, a great friend of the firms, and has helped drive strong growth for BlackRock for our clients and for our shareholders. He has also built a powerful team of leaders prepared to take on new responsibilities and drive our business forward. This includes a number of the senior leaders taking on expanded roles. Mark will work with our leadership team over the next few months to ensure a smooth transition. We thank him for his many contributions, his partnership, and his vision in shaping the successful evolution of BlackRock. Rob and I are proud of the deep leadership team at BlackRock. It reflects a breadth of experience and sustained excellence. Strategic acquisitions have also historically strengthened our firm, strengthened our culture, and bringing top talent, new skills and experience into our organization. Our culture has consistently evolved as we welcome new teams and colleagues to BlackRock. And today, it represents a blending of the best parts of the cultures that have come together across the years, across all the firms that became part of BlackRock. A few months ago, we welcomed the influx of talent with the close of GIP. We've already enjoyed great connectivity and our teams are energized. BlackRock's world-class leadership alongside the top talent from GIP, from HPS, and Preqin position us to serve our clients with excellence and seizing the opportunities ahead for us. In my conversations with clients around the world, they're eager to put capital to work and they want to do it through BlackRock. Public markets enter the year from a position of strength. Clients holding cash on the sidelines missed out on a 25% total return in equities last year. We expect 2025 to be a dynamic investing environment. As policies and economic questions play out, the most important factor will be the growth backdrop. Mega forces like AI and ongoing evolution in the debt financing and the low-carbon transition are transforming economies with long-term growth trajectories. Capital markets will play a key role in this transformation. Private market assets are an increasingly vital part of capital markets and blending both public and private markets will be critical to fully capturing growth opportunities. Long-held investing principles need to evolve, including the traditional 60-40 portfolio mix of stock and bonds. The diversifying nature of the stock and bond relationship is under increasingly strong pressure, making resilient portfolio construction more critical than ever. Clients are coming to BlackRock for advice on how to build portfolios, how to broaden out where they invest. For many, they will increasingly include private markets, especially private credit and infrastructure. We also think active strategies can provide an advantage in an environment that requires a more dynamic approach. BlackRock is well-positioned to capitalize on structural growth opportunities against a backdrop of economic and capital market evolution. We've made coordinated investments to build the premier long-term capital partner and technology provider across public and private markets. 2025 is a new launch point for significant growth for BlackRock, our clients, and our shareholders. Our recent acquisition of GIP, the planned acquisitions of Preqin and HPS, each position our platform ahead of evolving our client needs and structural industry trends. 15 years ago, we acquired BGI and we're the first scale provider to integrate both active and index investments. In 2024, we made bold moves to connect public and private markets through portfolio management and technology. The reaction to our recent announcement to acquire HPS has been extremely positive and we see great opportunities to partner more closely with clients and borrowers. The capabilities we're adding through these transactions allow us to serve clients even more comprehensively and position us to raise significant private capital. For our shareholders, we believe the increased contribution from private markets and technology will drive higher and more resilient organic growth, differentiating financial performance and multiple re-rating. In addition to private markets, we are executing on the strongest opportunity set we've seen across multiple growth engines. These include technology, ETFs, multi-asset solutions like outsourcing, and models. We invested for years to develop leading franchises and capabilities that our clients need most, and that are our long-term growth channels. Importantly, they're scaled and integrated onto one platform with a culture that is client-led, not product-led. We're able to serve our clients in a way that no other asset manager can. Aladdin has always been the operating system uniting all of BlackRock. It's grown and evolved as BlackRock has. It's the industry's most comprehensive operating system, supporting scale and commercial priorities for clients. We're growing our capability set in Aladdin, all with the aim of serving our clients through sophisticated risk management, scaled portfolio analytics across both public and private markets, and soon private market data through Preqin. Fourth-quarter ACV growth of 12% reflects several significant mandates with large financial and corporate partners. The Aladdin technology stack is resonating with over half the Aladdin sales involving multiple products. This includes clients using Aladdin's whole portfolio view, which grew out of our acquisition of eFront to seamlessly manage portfolios across public and private asset classes on one platform. It includes clients leveraging enterprise Aladdin alongside Aladdin Accounting or the Aladdin Data Cloud. Technology is at the foundation of BlackRock. ETFs are another example. We view ETFs as a technology that facilitates investments. Since our acquisition of iShares, BlackRock has led in expanding the market for ETFs by making them more accessible and by delivering new asset classes like bonds or crypto and investment strategies like Active. Approximately a quarter of the $390 billion of ETF net inflows were into products launched in the last five years. Our active ETFs delivered $22 billion of net inflows in 2024, while our Bitcoin ETP was the largest ETF launch in history, growing to over $50 billion of AUM in less than a year, and it was the third-highest asset-gathering ETF in the entire ETF industry behind only the S&P 500 index funds. We're innovating at the product and portfolio level and accelerating our distribution capabilities to deliver a differentiated investment solution. In Europe, we scaled our ETF offering significantly and the market is still much more nascent than it is in the U.S. We have seen double-digit organic growth in each of the last two years, including over $90 billion in growth in net inflows in 2024. Our European ETF platform is nearing $1 trillion of assets, which is larger than the next five issuers combined. Much of this growth is powered by individual investors as online banking platforms, digital-first offerings, and ETF saving plans are enabling more first-time investors to invest in their savings to start and beginning their retirement savings and to build a better and more robust future for themselves. From first-time individual investors to the most sophisticated institutions, ETFs are connecting investors to the growth of the capital markets around the world. Client's needs are driving industry consolidation and investors increasingly prefer to work with BlackRock as a scaled multi-asset provider. We see this in the wealth channels where managed model portfolios are the main way in which wealth managers are looking to scale their practices and better serve their clients. BlackRock has a leading models business backed by our multi-asset, multi-product capabilities across both ETFs and active strategies. We see this in our relationship with the largest asset owners, our pension funds, and corporates as these clients seek to deepen their ties with BlackRock. Many of these corporate partners see positive network effects to their core business and to their own shareholders by extending their relationship with BlackRock. This year, our clients entrusted us with more than $120 billion of scaled outsourcing mandates. Many of these outsourced portfolios are from pension plans and retirement schemes that we're investing on behalf of millions of workers to help them save for their future. Our LifePath target date franchise now manages more than $0.5 trillion of assets and we're extending our work in this important area to help more and more people save for retirement. In 2024, we launched our LifePath Paycheck offering, which pairs a traditional 401(k) plan with the option to purchase an annuity-based income stream as a worker approaches retirement. The solution is the fastest-growing lifetime income target date strategy in the defined contribution market with $16 billion invested at year end. We also adopted LifePath Paycheck as part of our U.S. retirement saving plan for employees here at BlackRock. We think this will become the default defined contribution offering for the entire industry and we're exploring opportunities to expand LifePath Paycheck to more partners and workers throughout the world. We have built our platform around a core strategy of connecting investors to the long-term growth of the capital markets. In my conversation with clients and government leaders around the world, there has been great focus on the strong capital markets we have in the United States. Countries want to further develop their own robust capital markets and this drives investment in their own local economies, which in turn provides opportunity for job growth, wealth creation for their own citizens. Over the last few years, BlackRock has partnered with governments and sovereign wealth funds to help deepen their local capital markets. We see tremendous opportunities in India where digital infrastructure efforts are facilitating widespread access to digital payments and financial products. Our joint venture, Jio BlackRock is expected to launch later this year, subject to regulatory approvals. We're combining our investment expertise with the local market knowledge of our partner, Jio Financial Services to launch digital-first assets with wealth management businesses. In Saudi Arabia, we're launching an investment management platform to partner with a public investment fund to drive investments and future growth in the local economy. And we're investing and layering the foundation today for opportunities that we believe will result in significant AUM over the next five to 10 years. We've had great success with our large asset owners in collaborations already, including our joint venture decarbonization partners with Temasek. Our recent AI partnership with Microsoft and MGX, which aims to mobilize data centers and infrastructure investments. These global partnerships are only available to BlackRock because of the deep relationships we built over many years with local partners, heads of states, and sophisticated asset owners. I have spent a lot of time on the road last year, as has Rob and other members of our leadership team. [indiscernible] and I have also traveled to see clients together in recent months. We're spending time with our institutional clients, our wealth clients, and increasingly with our largest asset owners in the world. Clients, corporates, and sovereigns are looking to assemble deeply intertwined partnerships, not just the set it and forget it investments that yield a good return. BlackRock is in a class of its own in being able to partner with clients comprehensively and in an integrated scaled way. We can build with clients across their entire portfolio and across the investment life cycle from ETFs to high-performing active and private markets to technology and data through Aladdin, eFront, and eventually Preqin. The strength of our platform and the commitment of our employees in serving our clients powered record results for our shareholders in 2024. And that was before significant growth unlocked from our strategic acquisitions and organic investments in high-growth markets around the world. 2024 was just the beginning, BlackRock enters 2025 with more growth and upside potential than ever. Operator, let's open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Hi, good morning, everybody. Happy New Year. I wanted to start with a discussion on Money Motion, that's something we talked about last year as well. As you think about 2025 and taking into account maybe the rates move we had recently, to what extent does that change the backdrop you're seeing in the marketplace today? And when it comes to more money in motion, what asset class do you guys expect to benefit most in 2025? Thanks. Martin S. Small: Thanks, Alex. Happy New Year. Listen, it all starts with clients. We had back-to-back quarters of above or at target organic base fee growth, 5% in Q3, now 7% in Q4. It's definitely putting the lift we want in the trailing 12-month trend for our long-term through the cycle target. Full-year organic base fee growth was 4%. And so we're really entering 2025 with continued momentum in a real position of strength. Larry talked a bit about continued ETF exceptionalism, very strong contribution to the 7% organic base fee growth in Q4, rounded out by private markets and alternatives, fixed-income, and cash. Even in ETFs like higher-fee rate segments like active ETFs gathered over $20 billion in new assets, digital assets ETFs are driving higher organic base fee growth. We see those trends continuing into 2025. I would note that GIP's organic growth contributed to about one-half of a percentage point to the overall 7% organic base fee growth. So it didn't have an outsized impact on this quarter's above target outcome. I do think it's a good indication that a growing infrastructure business, a growing private markets business can support obviously above trend, above target, long term targets. But looking into 2025, we've built the business around structural growers, ETFs, models, Aladdin, fixed-income, target date funds. They all drive sustainable organic base fee growth through market cycles. And in positive markets, our lived experience has been that these areas capture substantial upside, generate substantial earnings just like they did here in 2024, which where we hit records. Looking into 2025, we continue to see strength in structural growers, a bigger private markets business, and BlackRock as a meaningful outperformer and re-risking periods. Going back to previous election cycles, periods of central bank action, Alex, we had outsized upside capture. Look at 2017, 2018, 2021, we were well above 5% in those cycle targets. And I'd offer that I think we're even better diversified now. Even with higher for longer rates, we see short-duration active fixed-income yield strategies like our active ETF managed by Rick Rieder. BINK, the INC is the ticker, and our cash management platform as growth engines. And I think that recent macro events are also going to lead to some interesting opportunities in secondaries and private credit in a more supportive market. We've achieved our organic base fee growth target of 5% on average over the last five years. We hit 5% in Q3, 7% in Q4. We did it without the benefit of M&A. So we believe that HPS, Preqin, and GIP can help lift our business beyond those targets. It gives us a lot of conviction about our 5% or better goal going forward, Alex. So we look forward to updating everybody on progress. Laurence D. Fink: Alex, let me just talk about the rate market. We've been living in a world of the inverted yield curve. And you had the ability to earn the highest return, keeping your money in cash. Now you missed out on some great equity market movements. But as you notice, the yield curve is steepening. And so you're going to over the time you're going to be benefiting by going out the curve. That being said, there is close to $10 trillion of money in money market funds as that money will be put to work. And as I said, with the steepening of the yield curve and with higher rates, it's going to lead to some great opportunities in the fixed-income area. As Martin just said, I think more and more income-oriented products like private credit and infrastructure are going to play a larger role with our investors over the course of the next five to 10 years. And if -- and we can't underestimate the role of the capital markets as that is going to be developed more robustly even in Europe and other parts of the world where there's going to present even better opportunities. There's no place like the United States with the U.S. exceptionalism that you have -- if you're a small startup, a medium company that you have access to so much capital. That is one of the principal drivers of the U.S. economy. And I do believe that is -- hope to be replicated in other economies right now. And that development, having a strong banking system with a strong capital market system really plays well into our future growth. Operator : Your next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Laurence D. Fink: Hey, Craig, Happy New Year. Craig Siegenthaler : Hey, good morning, Larry, Martin. Happy New Year, Larry. Hope everyone is doing well. My question is on retirement. So BlackRock is the largest DCIO manager and one of the largest managers of AUM in 401(k) plans and target date funds. And currently, these strategies have a 0% allocation to Alts, but the red sweep in November has many of us debating if Alts will break in the retirement channel. So especially given your recent acquisitions of GIP and HPS, I don't know if any firm is better positioned for this team. So we wanted to get your updated prospects on Alts finally breaking into the U.S. retirement channel. Martin S. Small: Thanks, Craig. Happy New Year. I'll give it a go and then see if Larry has anything to add. But listen, we think of ourselves as a retirement company. More than half of the $11.6 trillion of assets that BlackRock manages are related to retirement. We've been at the forefront, I think, of product innovation. We've been at the forefront of advocacy for retirement solutions through our whole history. It was in fact Barclays Global Investors that pioneered the first target date fund back in 1993. It was a revolutionary concept eliminating, I think, some of the guesswork for retirement savers by automatically adjusting their investment mix over time. We now today, as you mentioned, have over $0.5 trillion of assets in LifePath and target date funds. We're the number-one DCIO provider. As Larry went through in detail, we've been innovating the target date structure to include guaranteed income with LifePath Paycheck. So we see real potential benefits that retirees could have with greater diversification, better retirement outcomes by blending public and private. I mean, people have won Nobel Prizes talking about the market portfolio. It wasn't just about public markets, it's also about private markets. And so we've been doing work, we've been doing work, we're always doing work on product innovation and we've been thinking about how to bring private markets potentially into target date structures. We think the same innovations that powered LifePath Paycheck could ultimately power a target date structure with private markets and alternatives as part of the glide path. We'd also think about things like managed accounts and models, where we've been working on including public-private models as we announced with the Partners Group model portfolios, which we think can make their way into retirement counts as well. And so, we do think this is a real opportunity with our leading presence in these channels, we've got the relationships, the distribution, the investment expertise to capitalize on these opportunities to create better retirement outcomes. We do think we're watching the space closely. For more tangible opportunities, we do think there'll have to be some reforms, potentially safe harbors litigation or advice reform in the U.S. to add private markets to DC plans. So we're watching the space closely, keeping in touch with the trade associations. We're doing a lot of work in keeping connected with Washington. But for years, we've tried to innovate. We've advocated on behalf of workers to improve retirement solutions. We think there is a real opportunity here. And if there is an opportunity to bring private markets to the retirement channel, we will aim to be at the forefront, Craig. Laurence D. Fink: Craig, let me add one more point that I think is essential. And that is having better analytics and data, that will be fueling. I think, regulatory opportunities to expand offerings in the space. As you know, the retirement system is heavily weighted with a lot of regulation. Fiduciary standard is very high. And so as a result of that, the need for better market analytics and data are essential. And this is one of the primary reasons why we sought out and acquired Preqin. Having the analytics that we have with eFront and Aladdin and the data that we will have will allow the entire market to have access to better information. And we believe more and more asset managers will then take on Aladdin with Preqin data and eFront to help them navigate this. And so to me, dovetailing relaxed regulatory oversight can only happen if we have better systematic analytics and data to work with the investors under our Arista laws. And I think this is essential and this is one of the key reasons why we made the acquisition of Preqin. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Michael Cyprys : Hey, good morning. Happy New Year. Laurence D. Fink: Good morning. Happy New Year. Michael Cyprys : It's been a little bit over a month since you announced the HPS acquisition. Just curious here in terms of the conversations you're having with clients, how that dialog has evolved given the expanded private credit capabilities that you have? I believe insurance and private wealth were some of the areas that you were most excited about. Just curious what steps you might take to best maximize that opportunity here as you're thinking about 2025, what sort of growth might this translate into and which of the opportunities do you see as more near-term versus more medium to longer-term? Martin S. Small: Well, obviously, we need to close and we expect to close sometime in the second quarter that would be our objective. And we're very excited about the client feedback related to HPS. It has been extraordinarily positive across all the channels. HPS has incredible relationships with clients worldwide and that dovetails with our relationships across all the insurance companies. And so I do believe insurance will be one of the primary areas of growth for us. But as we were talking about earlier, if we could really expand in the wealth channels, HPS right now has about $20 billion in wealth channels already. And we believe with the BlackRock connectivity with all the wealth management organizations that we have an opportunity to really increase that size by a dramatic amount. And our conversations that we've had globally worldwide from Japan to the Middle East and throughout Europe, probably one of the great surprises to me was the conversations we're having about expanding private credit as a part of these portfolios. And as I said earlier, when we did not do the HPS acquisition as a singular expansion, you have to overlay the design around buying Preqin and having eFront and bringing that together and having the ability to provide better data and analytics to these markets to -- and that will then provide much more expansion of the market. And we've seen that over the last 40-odd years, we've been in business and throughout my career when you have better data and analytics as you're expanding new and frontier markets, they become large-scale markets through data and analytics. And so we believe we will be the best-suited organization to take advantage of that expansion of the private credit markets in the future. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Brown with Wells Fargo. Michael Brown : Great. Good morning, everyone. Laurence D. Fink: Mike, Happy New Year. Michael Brown : Happy New Year. I wanted to follow up on the expense guidance for the year. So thank you for the core G&A guide. I guess, as we think about the contribution from HPS, assuming that mid-2025 close, how should we think about kind of the guide including that? And then as we think about the margin, I appreciate that markets and FX are really going to impact the outcome. But could you just give us some thoughts on maybe the puts and takes that we should consider for the margin in 2025 relative to 2024? Martin S. Small: Sure. Thanks for the question. So let me just put some context around it. I think our approach to shareholder value creation is to generate consistently market-leading organic growth. It's to drive operating leverage and industry-leading margins and to execute on a consistent capital management strategy, we have a strong track record of investing in our business for growth and scale while expanding capability. It's not just about growth, it's about profitable growth over the long term. Our growth comes from being disciplined in making and managing continued investments in the business. We're keeping the rules-based budgeting principles that I've outlined over the last 12 to 18 months that's sizing our operating investments in line with a prudent lens on organic growth potential. It's aiming to put flexibility in our cost base and variabilizing more expenses where we can. And most importantly, it's looking to generate fixed-cost scale, especially through investments in technology. We've got a -- I think, consistent track record in delivering industry-leading margins and improving them. I think you see in 2024, those scale indicators came through in the results. We grew operating income by over 20%, generated close to 3 percentage points of margin improvement versus 2023. We improved margin by 390 basis points year-on-year in Q4 while operating income was up 30%. And since the end of 2022, a more rope metric is BlackRock AUM is up $3 trillion, while headcount is up by a more modest 1,300 employees, about 7% headcount growth. So we really see ourselves as continuing on that strategy of driving scale and productivity, which shows up in margin expansion. On the outlook for 2025, the guidance is mid-to-high single-digits, excluding HPS, as I mentioned. In terms of the major influences, we think our budgeting approach in a positive market environment should drop more profitability into operating income. Market movements are our highest-margin item, Mike, both on the way up and on the way down. We see the conditions for reasonably positive growth in markets over the near-to-intermediate term. So we believe we can continue to invest to accelerate growth and deliver margin expansion through this rules-based budgeting that I've outlined. And we expect that the impact of positive markets on AUM and revenue through this budgeting approach would drive further margin expansion into 2025. Operator : We'll go next to Ken Worthington of J.P. Morgan. Martin S. Small: Happy New Year Ken. Ken Worthington : Hi, good morning. Happy New Year. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to piggyback a little bit on Alex's question. What are your thoughts on the outlook for fixed-income flows as we look out to the next 12 months? I guess, maybe starting, where do you see investors position in fixed-income as we begin 2025? And do you get the sense generally that investors are under or over-allocated to fixed-income broadly? And how do you see those allocations evolving this year? I think you've successfully made the case that the allocations are also be increasing. You made the case for a while that the allocations to cash are probably too high. How do we think about this sort of flowing into fixed-income allocations for the next 12 months? Robert S. Kapito: So I'll take that one. Last time I mentioned I thought it would reign fixed-income. I'm going to continue that for 2025, but I won't go as far as a Nobel Prize, Martin, in fixed-income. But a more balanced term structure of interest rates is an indicator that we're going to watch to indicate the potential demand for intermediate and longer duration fixed-income. And this has been negative for years and now the U.S. term premium has reached its highest level in a decade. Now we see that people are underallocated to fixed-income and we see that through our models business and we see that they're looking to increase their weightings in longer duration fixed income. And whether there's above market steepener or a bear market steepener, I do believe some of that large allocation to cash that Larry mentioned being around $10 trillion is going to look for opportunities to increase their income. And with countries around the globe at deficits, there is going to be a lot of issuance and you'll see the premium over treasuries be significant enough to move that money from cash into intermediate and longer-term duration fixed-income. So last year, we saw a strong demand. Our fixed income flows were $164 billion in 2024. That's driven 6% organic asset growth and that included $24 billion in the fourth quarter alone. Now one of the other reasons for this demand is better wrappers to express your interest in fixed income. So we saw a demand across iShares, non-ETF index, and active fixed-income, and active fixed-income continue to include scaled institutional assignments as well, not just retail, and this came primarily from insurance partners. So I think spread income presents a great opportunity even if duration is not as reliable a diversifier as it used to be. And we see a lot of clients that want to clip solid yields at the front end of the curve and now we expect that to continue into the longer end of the curve. So the other part is the run-up in equities last year actually over -- made them over-allocated to equity, so they need to catch up in fixed income. So I think it continues to roll into cash and then cash as rates change move into intermediate and longer duration fixed-income paper and that will not only be in the public markets, but it will be in the private markets as well, which describes part of the acquisition you were asking Larry and Martin about. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Oh, great. Martin S. Small: Hey, Brian. Brian Bedell : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Hi, Happy New Year. Laurence D. Fink: Happy New Year. [Multiple Speakers] Brian Bedell : Yes. Thanks. It's -- actually I was just thinking, I certainly couldn't imagine you've become what you've become sitting back in 1999 as the leading fixed-income manager at the time. I always knew the strategy was great, but the firm has certainly involved -- evolved, I think well beyond anyone's expectations. So congrats on that journey. Laurence D. Fink: So have you turned 35 yet? Brian Bedell : Yeah. Exactly. It's been a long time for sure. Yeah. But -- so maybe just thinking about this evolution of the strategy in alternative and particularly the retail end of that. So maybe just talk a little bit about your confidence, clearly, you have a lot of ways to go into the retail on the Alts side. But your confidence on that building up because it's obviously, there is still a lot of your roadblocks into growth in those channels. And I know you talked about the 401(k) channel earlier. Maybe within that answer, you can comment on your view of the likelihood of Safe Harbor provisioning in the 401(k) market and the demand from 401(k) plan sponsors to actually adopt Alts. Within their portfolios clearly would obviously benefit the planned participants substantially. So just, I guess overall, just your confidence on the retail market for Alts building in -- even in 2025 and into 2026 for you inclusive of potentially 401(k). Martin S. Small: Thanks so much. So we -- this is one of the -- I'm most fond -- one of the businesses I'm most fond of here at BlackRock. We have strong relationships in wealth and retail markets across the globe. As Larry mentioned in his remarks, our aim is to help wealth managers build long-term portfolios that blend public and private market exposures. The market is still early, as you said, wealth manager and retail allocations to private markets still in the low-single digits on most of the Cerulli dinner data. We are focused on innovating to provide better access to private markets for wealth managers and retail investors, and that's across taxable and non-taxable accounts, retirement accounts. Let me tell you about a couple of things we're working on and what I think are some of the bigger opportunities. As we had previously announced, we're working on a first-of-its-kind managed model solution with the Partners Group. We think this will simplify Wealth Access, offering a single subscription model product with varied allocations based on risk tolerance, but moving the private markets into a model portfolio with different risk tolerances that blend public-private, that manages the cash flows that's on a single subscription document. We think that's a huge unlock. One of the barriers to adoption with wealth managers is just the operational burden and tax of managing multiple subscription documents and cash flows and distributions for private markets products. We think a managed account can do that better and increase access. In Europe and Asia, those markets are in a different place in the United States when it comes to our private markets in retirement accounts. We recently launched our new evergreen fund offerings under the LTIF 2.0 structure. Those initial offerings are in private equity solutions and multi-alternatives. Those evergreen funds, we're planning to also have infrastructure and private credit offerings into the future. We're looking at bringing similar structures in terms of evergreen -- evergreen products for the United States as well. The planned acquisition of HPS is going to bring real scale and expertise in the wealth channel for us, including more than $20 billion of wealth-focused assets in HLEND, one of the high-performing BDCs in the market. We think there is a great opportunity to continue to scale that in the channels where HPS is, but also bring that to the RIA market where BlackRock has a particularly large footprint. We have really excellent momentum in many of the strategies that we have in B debt. Our non-traded BDC has about $600 million plus in growing. Our credit interval fund CREDX, same deal has had a lot of growing. I do think that the biggest opportunity ahead of us is to integrate semi-liquid products and to integrate private markets into our over $300 billion managed models and SMA franchise. That would be the biggest unlock. And I really do think it's our competitive advantage. It's at the heart of the model venture we have with Partners Group. It's at the heart of many of the previously announced partnerships we have with Envestnet, GeoWealth, iCapital, Case, and Vestmark. So we think the two best execution channels for us here to help clients are target date funds and retirement accounts, assuming that we can have favorable conditions to do so and manage models in wealth and retail channels and the LTIF structures in UK and Europe. Operator : Your next question comes from Bill Katz with TD Cowen. Bill Katz : Okay. Thank you very much. Laurence D. Fink: Hi, Bill. Bill Katz : Good morning, guys. Thank you very much. Laurence D. Fink: 25 years. Bill Katz : Yes, indeed, it goes quick. It goes quick. I remember that IPO conversation. Anyway, thank you for the shout-out. It's been a pleasure. Just maybe -- I know, one gentleman, just think about the evolution of the platform and then your guidance around buyback. As your earnings power continues to scale and become more diversified and more durable, how are you thinking about maybe the payout relative to the earnings power? And then how about the allocation underneath that between dividend growth and repurchase? Thank you. Martin S. Small: Thanks a lot, Bill. Our capital allocation strategy is consistent. As I mentioned earlier, like first to invest in the business. That's our main focus is investing the business to drive organic growth. We preferenced the dividend and then the size of our share repurchases, they're an output after those allocations of capital. We don't manage the company to hoard excess cash on BlackRock's balance sheet. So we have a very strong track record of returning that excess cash through share repurchases that are systematic. I think the size of future repurchases would result from a whole variety of factors. The levels of cash flow generation in organic growth and market beta and FX, the sizing of organic and inorganic investments, the leverage ratio of the company, the reasonableness of debt financing versus equity financing. So, all of these things would influence ultimately the sizing of the share repurchase program. But the share repurchase is an output, not an input into our capital management strategy. But this year, we had $4.7 billion return to share to shareholders. We know that BlackRock has become an attractive compounder between dividends and buybacks, and we want to keep that track record up for our clients and shareholders. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks? Laurence D. Fink: Yes, I do. Thank you, operator. I want to thank everybody for joining us this morning and your continued interest in our firm BlackRock. Our record results in 2024 are just the beginning of our next phase of growth. We invested ahead of our structural growth trends and drivers that we believe will define the future of the capital markets and asset management. We have a lot of exciting work ahead of us, including the planned addition and integration of Preqin and HPS. And we entered 2025 better positioned than ever to deliver differentiating performance to our clients and value-creation for our shareholders. Everyone, have a really wonderful quarter. Enjoy. Talk to you in next quarter. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",
