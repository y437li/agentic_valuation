My name is Crystal, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Hershey Company's First Quarter 2014 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Mark Pogharian, please go ahead. Mark Pogharian : Thank you, Crystal. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Hershey Company's first quarter 2014 conference call. J.P. Bilbrey, President and CEO; Dave Tacka, Senior Vice President and CFO; and I, will represent Hershey on this morning's call. We also welcome all of you listening via the web cast. Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2012 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the Notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted or pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. As a result, we will discuss 2014 first quarter results excluding net pre-tax charges of $13.4 million or $0.04 per share diluted, related to the net acquisition and transaction costs, primarily associated with Shanghai Golden Monkey, project Next Century, and non-service-related pension income. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges. And with that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey. John Bilbrey : Thanks Mark. Good morning to everyone on the phone and web cast. During the first quarter, we made solid progress against the initiatives we discussed earlier this year that gives us confidence Hershey will deliver on its 2014 expectation. As we stated back in January and at CAGNY, we expected the first quarter to be pressured by year ago comp, and the timing of our 2014 innovation. However, Q1 topline results were a bit softer than we anticipated due to some unexpected anomalies related to U.S. consumer trip within the various classes of trade, and weakness in our Latin America business. Despite Q1 store traffic issues, U.S. net sales increased 3.4% less than our expectations. Specifically in channels such as convenience stores and dollar stores, we are profitable and also instant consumable pack types drive sales, consumer trips declined more than we anticipated. In the traditional food and mass channels, consumer trips were relatively in line with our expectation. However, the basket included a greater focus on staples. Importantly, as we got closer to the end of March and into April, it appears the consumer shopping behavior was returning to normal. While preliminary April Nielsen data for the four week ended April 19th, indicate a strong sell-through for the Easter season, and a sequential improvement in non-seasonal trend. Additionally, net sales declines in Latin America were impacted by the timing of Easter, macroeconomic challenges and new tax legislation in Mexico on certain food products, and volume elasticity in Brazil due to a price increase. Overall, total company Q1 net sales increased 2.4%, driven primarily by volume. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates was a 0.8 point headwind. Organic net sales growth of 3.2% generated earnings growth that was slightly greater than we anticipated, due to the timing of SM&A expenses. Dave will provide you with additional financial detail, so let me provide you with an overview of the [indiscernible]. Before we get into the specifics, the U.S. retail takeaway, recall, that in 2014, Easter occurred on April 21, and in 2013 on March 31. Therefore, the timing of Easter has and will impact Nielsen and IRI data related to the March, April and May quiet period. Including Easter seasonal activity in the year ago and current period, the candy mint and gum, or CMG category declined 2.7% for the 12 weeks ended March 22, 2014, within the xAOC+C channel. As a reminder, this is xAOC+C-store data consisting of food, drug, MassX and C-store channels, plus the inclusion of Walmart, partial dollar, club and military channels. Gum continues to be a drag on total CMG performance and excluding it, the chocolate, sweet and the refreshment categories 2.2%. Excluding Easter, seasonal activity in the current and year ago period combined category growth of chocolate, sweet and refreshment, was plus 2.4%. Given the investment we continue to see in the category, in the form of innovation and consumer marketing, including the new product news and related activity we have planned over the remainder of the year, we continue to expect a candy of mixed category to increase 3.5% to 4.5% in 2014. We are particularly excited about our innovation that ramps up in May, with the launch of YORK Minis and Hershey's Spreads as the consumable items in the third quarter launches of ICE BREAKERS Cool Blast's Chews and Brookside Crunchy Clusters. Given the timing of Easter and our innovation calendar, Hershey's CMG retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ending March 22 declined 3%. Excluding Easter seasonal activity at both the current and year ago period of better, yet still in perfect measure, our retail takeaway was up 1.4%. Despite the Easter comp, this was less than our expectation and reflects the impact of the lower trip that I referred to earlier. A better way to assess performance given seasonal timing and therefore noise in the datas [ph] by looking at absolute market results. Hershey's first quarter market share within the U.S. non-chocolate candy, mint and gum categories increased. However, this was offset by a decline in chocolate market share, given the timing of new product launches, and related advertising and consumer marketing. As a result, Hershey's U.S. CMG market share, including Easter seasonal activity in the year ago and current period declined 0.1 point. While results are preliminary, we had a solid Easter and will gain share in this important season. First quarter xAOC+C chocolate category growth, excluding Easter in the current a year ago period, was 3.6%. Hershey's xAOC+C chocolate retail takeaway excluding Easter was up 1.2% and resulting in a loss of 1.1 market share points. Looking at absolute market share results, KIT KAT and Brookside Chocolate market share was up in the quarter, however this was offset by Hershey franchise softness and Cadbury, which lost 0.5 chocolate share points. Cadbury is primarily sold during the Easter timeframe, so we would fully expect a reversal of the share loss over the next two quiet periods. Switching to non-chocolate candy or NCC in the xAOC+C channels, the NCC category, including and excluding Easter in the current and year ago periods, declined 5.2% and 0.2% respectively. Hershey's xAOC+C store NCC business, including and excluding Easter in the current year-ago periods declined 4.9% and 2.7%. As a result, our NCC market share was slightly up, as Lancaster gains offset declines in JOLLY RANCHER TWIZZLER bites. Lancaster is off to a good start and distribution is tracking to expectations. Advertising started on February 16, and is driving trial and repeat. While early, Lancaster results are similar to where Brookside was at this stage of the launch. While not as large as chocolate and NCC, we continue to do well within the gum and mint categories. Specifically, our Q1 gum and mint retail takeaway within the xAOC+C universe was up 29% and 6% respectively. As a result, our gum market share increased to 1.3 points, and we now have a modest 4.8% share of the market. Our mint market share increased 0.7 points, expanding our segment leading position to 39.8%. In the C-store class of trade, where the Easter impacts are minimal, the CMG category was up 3%. However, this was significantly impacted by the mid single digit percentage of decline in the gum category. Excluding gum and despite trips being down in this channel in Q1, C-store candy and mint category growth was up a combined 5%, driven by news and activity by major manufacturers. Hershey instant consumable innovation and programming accelerates over the remainder of the year, and we would expect our C-store performance to materially exceed our Q1 retail takeaway of 1.5%, that resulted in a market share decline of 0.5 points. In the U.S. marketplace, in addition to the many exciting new products I had previously mentioned, we had many exciting promotions, programs and merchandising in place across all channels. These include a Reese's NCAA Gameday football program; new and highly effective Hershey S'mores! advertising; a relaunch of Hershey's Miniatures, with improved taste and new packaging, supported with refreshed advertising; and a sweet summer showdown program, featuring TWIZZLERS and JOLLY RANCHERS. The Hershey Spreads launch has gotten off to a good start. Retailer response has been extremely positive, driving spreads category growth of around 10%. Category growth has been driven by the chocolate spread sub-segment, which is up about 40%. Most major retailers have accepted all three flavors of Hershey Spreads. Advertising and couponing started in February, and is driving initial trial and brand awareness which were leveraged when we launched the Hershey Spreads instant consumable product in May. Outside of the U.S. and Canada, international results were mixed. China continues to be a standout. Net sales increased in the mid-teens on a percentage basis versus last year and exceeded plan. In China, Hershey continues to be one of the fastest growing international chocolate companies. For the three months ended February, chocolate category growth accelerated, driven by gifting and timing of the holiday and Chinese New Year season. As a result, our chocolate retail takeaway of about 50% was more than double the category growth rate of almost 20%. Our seasonal sell-through was solid, as evidenced by a 2.3 point share gain and overall China market share of 10.1%. Reese's testing and expansion continues, and we are pleased with what we continue to learn. The team continues to refine the messaging, based on what we have learned to-date, and we will apply these best practices during a broader roll-out later this year. In Mexico, our year-to-date chocolate market share in the Modern Trade increased 1.1 points. However, category growth slowed to the start of the year, given Easter timing, the VAT tax and a sluggish economy that's impacting consumer purchasing power and confidence. As a result, Mexico Modern Trade chocolate category sales declined about 1%. This represents a slowdown, versus the low double digit growth --  [Technical Difficulty] Similar information related to insights driven performance initiatives. Now let me provide a brief update on our international business. Similar to last year, our expectation entering the year, was that 2014 international sales growth would be back-half weighted. We still -- Mark Pogharian : Ladies and gentlemen, Mark Pogharian here. We apologize for the technical difficulty. We believe JP, you got cut off. When JP started his remarks related to international commentary. So we will pick it up from there, and just the moment. Again, we apologize for the delay, and, please be patient while we pick up. JP, I will now turn it back to you, if you start with your international commentary. John Bilbrey : Okay. Thank you everyone for your patience, and I am going to have to move here in the room, as we continue to make some adjustments, so please bear with us. So assuming that you can hear me now, I will pick up with our international comments. Outside of the U.S. and Canada, international results were mixed. China continues to be a standout, net sales increased mid-teens on a percentage basis versus last year, and exceeded plan. In China, Hershey continues to be one of the fastest growing international chocolate companies. For the three months ended February, chocolate category growth accelerated, driven by gifting and the timing of the holiday in Chinese New Year season. As a result, our chocolate retail takeaway of about 50%, was more than double the category growth rate of almost 20%. Our seasonal sell-through was solid, as evidenced by a 2.3 point share gain and overall, China chocolate share of 10.1%. Reese's testing and expansion continues and we are pleased with what we continue to learn. The Team continues to refine the messaging, based on what we have learnt to-date, and we will apply these best practices during a broader roll out later this year. In Mexico, our year-to-date chocolate market share and the Modern Trade increased 1.1 points. However, category growth slowed to start the year, given Easter timing, the VAT tax, and a sluggish economy, that is impacting consumer purchasing power and confidence. As a result, Mexico Modern Trade chocolate category sales declined about 1%. This represents a slowdown versus the low double digit growth in 2013. Given these headwinds, we expect Mexico net sales growth to be pressured this year. In Brazil, local currency net sales were a bit below our plan and year ago, as volume elasticity related to a price increase was greater than anticipated. Year-to-date, the chocolate category, the Modern Trade declined 4.9%, due to the timing of Easter. We primarily participate in the tablet/bar and chocolate snack subsegments, and the categories declined here as well. However, Hershey tablet/bar and chocolate snacks retail takeaway was up, and we gained share. We expect our business in Brazil to accelerate over the remainder of the year on a local currency basis, and be up low double digits. We have a good foundation in our key international markets. We are building on our go-to-market capabilities, driving trial and repeat and gaining market share. We are focused on the long term, and not guided by the impacts of foreign currency exchange rates, which is the factor on [ph], while we'd most likely see international net sales growth of around 15% in 2014. I am pleased with the progress we are making. There are exciting things happening in our focus markets, and we remain on-track towards the aspirational goals, and we have shared with you over the last year. Now to wrap up. We were not pleased with our overall performance in the first quarter. However, core brand merchandising, programming, innovation and advertising accelerates, and is expected to generate solid net sales growth over the remaining three quarters. As a result, we continue to expect 2014 full year net sales growth of 5% to 7%, and a 9% to 11% increase in adjusted earnings per share diluted. I will now turn it over to Dave, who will provide some additional financial details. David Tacka : Thank you, JP. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the web cast. First quarter net sales of $1.87 billion increased 2.4% versus last year, generating adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.15, an increase of 5.5% from last year. The sales growth was below our expectation for the quarter, primarily because of the U.S. market anomalies JP discussed, combined with lower sales in Mexico and Brazil. We expected first quarter sales growth to be tempered by the comparison to the strong Brookside distribution gains last year, our innovation calendar in 2014, and foreign currency headwinds. In fact, foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Canadian dollar and Brazilian real, negatively impacted sales growth by 0.8 points, resulting in organic sales growth of 3.2% for the quarter. Sales growth was driven primarily by North America, which increased 3%. U.S. net sales growth of 3.4% was essentially all volume related. Canada achieved slightly higher volume growth, offset by unfavorable FX. Outside of the U.S. and Canada, net sales declined 2.4%. Results varied by country, with declines in Latin America and increases in Asia, driven primarily by growth in China. Turning now to margins; adjusted gross margin declined by 10 basis points in the quarter, as higher input costs and an unfavorable sales mix, more than offset supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives. We incurred higher than forecasted dairy and minor raw material costs in the quarter, as well as lower fixed cost absorption, resulting from the lower than forecast volumes. For the year, we now expect gross margin expansion of around 20 basis points. This is lower than our previous estimate of around 50 basis points, due primarily to higher input costs, primarily dairy, and a less favorable sales mix. Adjusted EBIT in the first quarter increased 3.7% versus last year, generating adjusted EBIT Margin of 22.3%, a 30 basis point improvement. The increase was driven by lower SM&A expenses. Advertising expense in related consumer marketing decreased about 3% versus last year. Importantly, we executed our planned advertising programs in the quarter, including the recent CAA program, seasonal celebrations advertising, and launched support for the Lancaster and spreads introductions. We expect advertising spending to increase over the remainder of the year, supporting our new product launches and core brands in North American and international markets. SG&A, excluding advertising, increased 4% versus last year, but less than our previous estimate, as we delayed certain discretionary items, in light of first quarter market trends, higher input costs, and our initiatives to achieve SG&A leverage. We will continue to invest in expanded root-to-market capabilities, as well as knowledge based consumer information, related to the insights driven performance initiatives. Now let me provide a brief update on our international business. Similar to last year, our expectation entering the year was that 2014 international sales growth would be back half weighted. We still believe that will be the case, given the seasonality of our business, together with our plans for advertising, merchandising, programming and new products, including the broader distribution of Reese's in Q3 and Q4. Q1 international net sales declined 2.4% in the quarter. On a constant currency basis, they increased 2%. In our focus markets, China net sales increased high teens on a percentage basis, and continues to do well. Importantly, Chinese New Year sell-through was solid, and we are gaining market share. In Mexico, sales declined. Our chocolate business in the Modern Trade is responding to merchandising and programming. However, our sweets, refreshment and beverage businesses have been pressured, given the sugar tax and other macroeconomic headwinds impacting Mexican consumers. We expect the Mexico business to continue to be challenged, but to improve over the remainder of the year. In Brazil, sales declined as consumers are adjusting to higher price points. We expect that our business will grow over the remainder of the year. For the full year, we expect international sales growth to be around 15%. Note, that this excludes the Shanghai Golden Monkey business, which we estimate will close in the second quarter of 2014. Moving down the P&L, first quarter interest expense of $21.4 million declined $2.2 million versus last year. For the full year, we continue to expect interest expense to be around $85 million. The adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was 34.3%, essentially in line with last year, but slightly less than our expectations of 35%, due to the timing of favorable tax issue resolution. For the full year, we expect the adjusted tax rate to be around 34.5%. For the first quarter of 2014, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 227 million shares. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow; at the end of the first quarter, net trading capital increased versus last year's first quarter by $103 million. Accounts receivable was higher b $104 million, primarily because of sales timing and remains extremely current. Inventory was higher by $52 million and accounts payable increased by $53 million. Capital additions, including software, were $80 million in the first quarter. For the year, we continue to expect total capital expenditures to be about $355 million to $375 million, including the capital related to the Johor, Malaysia project of $120 million to $130 million. Depreciation and amortization was $49 million in the first quarter, in line with our estimates. Cash outflows in Q1 included dividends of $105 million, and the repurchase of approximately $272 million of our common shares, to replace shares issued, in connection with stock option exercises. All shares were repurchased in the open market. In 2014, we will make progress against the old share buyback authorization, which has $125 million remaining on it, before buying back shares related to the new authorization. At the end of the first quarter, cash on hand was just over $1 billion. Let me close by providing some context on our 2014 outlook; as JP outlined. We have initiatives in place that we believe will drive net sales growth across our business. We are confident of our plans, and we expect 2014 net sales growth within our targeted range of 5% to 7%, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. We believe we have concluded a strong Easter season and April Nielsen data is showing solid improvements in our every day business. We expect net sales gains to build through the year, driven by core brand volume growth, and innovation in U.S. and international markets. Complemented by in-store merchandising, programming and greater levels of advertising and consumer marketing. We now expect gross margin expansion of around 20 basis points for the year. We expect higher input costs and a less favorable sales mix versus 2013, offset by supply chain productivity and improved fixed cost absorption. We have good visibility into our input costs, with the exception of dairy costs which we are unable to hedge. As we look at timing and year ago comps, we expect second quarter gross margin to be similar to what we had in Q1. Advertising and related consumer marketing is expected to increase mid-single digits on a percentage basis versus last year, slightly below our previous estimate. This change does not impact advertising spending on core brands, but instead reflects decisions on return on investment analysis on non-scale brands, and reductions in non-media consumer spending. SG&A expenses are expected to increase at a more modest level than previous years, as we start to achieve SG&A leverage. This increase will build on the investments and go-to-market capabilities, as well as consumer knowledge based projects related to our insights driven performance initiatives. As a result, we expect full year adjusted earnings per share diluted to increase within our long term targeted growth rate of 9% to 11%. Note that this outlook excludes estimated operating results related to Shanghai Golden Monkey. Upon approval of the agreement, expected in the second quarter of 2014, and excluding acquisition and transaction costs, the company expects the acquisition to be slightly accretive on an adjusted basis in 2014. Thank you for your time this morning. JP, Mark and I will now take any questions you may have. Mark Pogharian : Thank you JP and Dave for your remarks. For everybody on the line and the web cast, we again apologize for the technical difficulty this morning. But, out of the respect to a lot of you, couple of other peers that are reporting this morning and holding conference calls, just so we can facilitate time here, we would ask that you please limit yourselves to one question. Thank you, and operator, we will now open it up for Q&A. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Mark Pogharian : Good morning. Rob? Operator, we are not hearing any question. Operator : His line is open sir. Mark Pogharian : Okay. Why don't we go to the next question? Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse : Hello? Mark Pogharian : Yes. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse : I am sorry. This is Rob. I guess my question is to do with the decision to cut advertising. I wanted to know why make that decision to lower the advertising growth so early in the year, its only first quarter. It seems to be related to the gross margin cut as well. Thank you. John Bilbrey : I think Rob, the way to think about it is that, we have really taken a look at some of the secondary brands that we have been supporting, and we have limited some of our advertising there. On our core brands, there really isn't any reduction, and in fact, advertising GRPs would be increased on a couple of levels. One, the dollar spend against core, because of moving some of that mix around. And then the other thing is, is in GRP efficiency. So as we become a more scaled purchaser, one of the things that's happening is that, we also are more efficient. So if you really look at GRPs against those core brands, and against the new item initiatives that we have, we really feel as though we are executing against the strong plan, and what we need. And of course, we will continue to assess that as we go forward. But that's how I think you might want to think about that, and then the other thing with innovation, you also have then stronger consumer events there as well, which we need to support. So we really feel as though, we have got a solid plan. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse : But John, it seems like your competition is increasing advertising right now. Are you concerned that you're kind of scaling back, when they are scaling up? John Bilbrey : No I think -- well first of all, your assessment is absolutely right, and in fact, in the first quarter, we saw with new item introduction, as well as some other strong support from competitors. The absolute advertising level in the category was significantly higher than it has been. So our advertising was higher as well, but not as high as some of the competitive initiatives. So I think, as others move into higher advertising spends, that's something that we have to be cognizant of. I think a lot of that however was really in support of what was happening with new item introductions, and then of course, with Easter being later, some of that advertising also -- for us, also falls into April as well. But your point is noted. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. John Bilbrey : Good morning Bryan. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, good morning. So I guess the one question I wanted to ask was just based or relative to gross margin outlook and the potential of the raised prices. I guess, last couple of years -- or the last five years I guess, whatever; there has been some meaningful change in raw material costs, you have been able to price it through. So I guess, is that in the realm of expectations or possibilities looking forward if we are going to see elevated input costs going forward, is there a chance that may be there would be ability to price that through, or at this point do you think that the elasticities just don't work in your favor in that regard? Thanks. John Bilbrey : Dave and I will take that, it\u2019s a two-part; and the first part is we don't talk about or speculate around what we think pricing will be in the category. But what I would say is, as you have heard us say before, we will continue to be a gross margin focused organization, it would be tough to necessarily have the levels of gross margin expansion we had in 2013, but we continue to be very gross margin focused, and then from a commodity perspective, I will let Dave make any comment he feels appropriate. David Tacka : As we said, we are seeing slightly higher commodity costs, particularly dairy as we look at 2014. But we do have good visibility on our cost basket other than dairy for 2014, and we will be addressing 2015 later in the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Kenneth Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets : Good morning everyone. Just continuing on the ad spending, what changed with the analysis of the ad spend; because you guys do typically have pretty good analytics. So I am not sure exactly what changed, as you were looking through it. Then just to follow-up on that is, how much leeway do you have for the cut, just say the sales or your numbers don't come within -- the top line doesn't come within your expectations again, at least there is another leeway for you to reduce that excitement a little bit more? John Bilbrey : Well I think first of all, philosophically, we want to make sure that we are fully supporting our brands against the strategies that we have articulated. There are brands, which we have chosen to not support, that we have been supporting, or reduce some support. So again, I think that, that's a decision driven by analytics, and its a good decision. And then, we really feel as though, based on the ROIs and what we know at this point in time, that we are fully supporting those brands, and then our innovation in the second half. If there were to be a material change in the category, we are very committed to being brand builders, then we would assess that as we would believe appropriate. Kenneth Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank. John Bilbrey : Good morning Eric. Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank : I am a bit confused on some of the international stuff between local currency and dollar results. I think JP you said that, and this was kind of split up, but I think you said China was up mid-teens, but then Dave said it was up high teens. I think you mentioned something about being up 50% and two times the category --? John Bilbrey : Eric, to just put clarification around that. So one is a sales number, and the others were off-take numbers, during that period of time. So those would be what the difference is, but those are -- and remember with Chinese New Year and so forth, you get -- some of that shipment is actually, would have been in the fourth quarter of last year, and then the off-take really is happening in the quarter. So that's why you would see differences in that, and Mark can help you with greater detail around that. And then, if you look at the other markets, in local currency, we made good progress in Brazil, but the real, hurt us on FX. You had some of that in Mexico and Canada as well. So on a local currency basis, in both Brazil and Canada, we felt good about our progress, but FX hurt us a little bit more there. Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank : Thanks, and just as a -- David Tacka : Eric, the profile for international will probably be very similar to last year, where you get much greater part of the growth in the second half. Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank : So the international dollar sales are down 2.4 in the quarter. You're saying that for the year, international sales will be up 15% in dollars, or is that local currency? John Bilbrey : Its in dollars. David Tacka : That would be dollars including FX impact. John Bilbrey : Including FX impact. Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank : But ex-M&A. Okay, I will pass it on. Thank you. John Bilbrey : Thanks Eric. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. John Bilbrey : Hi Andrew. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital : Hi, good morning everybody. Just want to pick up on the pricing theme as well. And again, not whether you will or won't take it of course, but I remember the last time you took a price increase. It was the first time in quite some time that promotive price points went up as ell. And I think, because you were bumping up against some key retail, sort of price thresholds. I think the promotive price points went up like 20% or so, and you ended up managing it very well in hindsight, [indiscernible] and all of that. So I guess what I am trying to get a sense of is, is there any way to may be hard to do the -- kind of characterize where you are today and the next time you take pricing, whenever that may be, if it\u2019s a year, if its three years. But are you bumping up against any key retail sort of promotive price point thresholds, or is there some room to kind of work with them there? John Bilbrey : I think, the way that I would think about it is, if you look over an extended period of time, the category has been pretty unelastic, and so its 50% volume and 50% price realization historically in the category. As we have crossed price thresholds, which we always watch very-very closely. Our experience has been pretty positive, that the category digests that pricing. So the category in general, I think, has demonstrated its ability to again be pretty accessible and affordable, and that really has sort of won the day. And then there is a couple of things to think about, in terms of how companies may think about pricing, is obviously there is a commodities element, and then there is an element of how you invest in the business, and I don't think its exclusively one or the other, but we look at both of those. And I think both of those things are intrical to how you would think about that particular topic, and that's probably -- Andrew, I don't know if that satisfies you, but that's probably about as far as I can go on that. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital : That's helpful. I appreciate your perspective. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi. John Bilbrey : Hi Dave. David Driscoll - Citigroup: Hi guys. Thank you. Good morning. Wanted to go back to advertising for a minute; just to be clear, at least as much as we can. So add spending in the quarter down 3%, full year at mid single digit increase. So clearly its going up, you're supporting your products, not as much as before, but you're supporting it. I think what this suggests, is that the change was almost entirely in the first quarter, and as I look at Qs two, three and four, you're going to have fairly substantial increases in two, three and four. So first off, is that right, and is that pretty much consistent with the plans? I think it kind of helps people to understand that may be the big change was Q1, and its not something that's massively different in the next bunch of quarters. Can we just start there? John Bilbrey : Yeah, I think that's a very good assessment. David Driscoll - Citigroup: Okay. Then on the increases that you have coming in Qs two, three and four, where are they going to be deployed? Because I think what everybody is just going to want to understand as best they can, is your expectation that sales growth will accelerate, and I think its going to be directly related to where all this additional ad spending goes. So can you talk about how you deploy it? John Bilbrey : Well if you think about the innovation we have this year, its actually spread across our different segments of the business, and so, you will see the appropriate amount of advertising supporting a broad piece of the portfolio, but appropriately, you will see it supporting the new initiatives. Then you have Lancaster and spreads, which really just started in February and we are building distribution there. So you will see strong support for those, as we go throughout the year, we feel very good about our distribution progress. We have had a coupon drop, and we should continue to build on our merchandising and then advertising support for both of those as well. So those will be brands that are supported. And just to be clear, coming back, the support on our core brands continues to grow. So a lot of that growth again is out of GRP purchase efficiency, and it is not making a choice, not to advertise on some secondary brands. And if you recall historically, we have talked about how we like to rotate across those brands, so that's also money that comes back against the core. David Driscoll - Citigroup: Really appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JP Morgan. John Bilbrey : Good morning Ken. Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan : Hey everybody, thanks for the questions. My guess is, you're cutting ad spending on may be some brands like, I don't know, Bliss, Simple Pleasures. At least in Nielsen data, they're lagging a bit. So first of all, is that correct? John Bilbrey : That's correct. Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan : That's right. So AIR DELIGHTS too I would imagine. Can you talk a little bit about the future of those brands? How should we think about them? I guess I am asking, is there a risk they get delisted, is there some [indiscernible] coming because -- often when step one is cutting advertising, step two can be the brand loses whatever, I don't want to say shaky, but whatever legs it had? John Bilbrey : I think the way to think about it is, it doesn't mean that we would not be supporting those brands. I think in a couple of instances, those -- there may be some other brands that you talked about, that have ended up playing more of a niche role, than maybe we would have hoped at one point in time. Then, in the case of bliss, it\u2019s a meaningful brand, and within a position, but that whole trade-up space has sort of evolved over time. And so it doesn't mean that we wouldn't support a brand like Bliss, but we are in an environment where we believe making choices is important and these brands will evolve and consumers will ultimately decide, how they do. Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan : Great, thanks JP. John Bilbrey : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets : Good morning guys. John Bilbrey : Good morning. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets : Typically, Hershey starts the year rather quickly, and this year, obviously its not the case but some of that seems to be your timing of new product news. But some of it seems to be, from what we are hearing Mars, which has been rather aggressive on promotion, and that's a big contract for the last couple of years, could you comment on that? And then specifically related to the seasonal share, which I guess was down significantly, if I look at the numbers in your release. We hear there may have been something of a co-packer issue, where orders weren't filled right away for Hershey, one of your co-packers, was that a factor at all in the quarter? John Bilbrey : No, let me talk about kind of -- le make a broad statement here about the quarter. So first all, you have the timing of Easter being three weeks later. So there is just a lot of noise in the data. Yet, strong competitive program, it included new items, and also increased advertising. Our plan, as you point out, is much more back-half loaded than it was before. So even though we had introductions with -- kick out many, as you have spreads, you have Lancaster, all of those are currently building. And then you have anomalies in the consumer purchasing pattern. So all of those things clearly had an influence, I wouldn't focus on one much more than the other. As we look at weekly data, and as I've said to you guys many times, I don't get overly enamored by weekly data. But I guess in this case, what I would tell you is, I continue to be encouraged that our hypothesis around the quarter and the things that we are describing to you, I feel good about, because as we look at the weekly data, it continues to strengthen and in fact, in the latest weekly data on year-to-date basis, our total CMG share has turned positive, which again, gives me confidence that as I talk to retailers, consumers seem to be back in stores, I can't comment on for anybody, what their spending is. But it appears to feel as though, some of the trips issues, some of the basket mix etcetera, I am more comfortable calling it an anomaly. I do believe going forward, there is some degree of bifurcation in the total consumer environment, but we will sort that out for all CPG, as we go forward. But I am just feeling a lot better, as I see some of this weekly data come in that we have called this about right. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. John Bilbrey : Good morning. Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley : Hi. Good morning everyone. I just wanted to focus on the factors underlying the lower gross margin outlook. I know there are some specific external things like higher dairy and Q1 traffic that have had an incremental impact. But looking beyond the lower, sort of Q1 fixed cost allocations and what already know about dairy prices, to what extent does that lower gross margin outlook also reflect of you that the competitive and the promotional environment could be sustainably a bit more intense than you originally envisioned? David Tacka : Well the biggest chunk of the gross margin change is in fact the dairy outlook. There are some impacts around the sales mix, which are principally in the first quarter, and we have programming very well set for the balance of the year, and so we think that we are in the right place on that and we have a good view of the commodity cost, with the exception of dairy. Mark Pogharian : And I would say too Matt, even if you continue to look your IRI and Nielsen data, you just don't see a lot of positive or negative price in that category, which would help answer your question as well of what's really going on. I mean, as JP alluded to, there is just a lot of activity in the first quarter, which is what we expected in news, coming into this year. Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. John Bilbrey : Good morning. John Baumgartner - Wells Fargo : Good morning JP. Just in terms of the elasticity in Brazil. Did the magnitude of that surprise you at all? And then maybe related, if you look around some of these snacking categories in developing markets, biscuits, gum, one can may be argue here that they category level growth hasn't really snapped back from the recession. Is that your sense that these categories are kind of prone for more tempered growth going forward? Just your thoughts there? John Bilbrey : You know, I actually would tell you that I continue to be very positive on the category, especially on the chocolate segment across just about all of these markets, and I think that, we are going to have some of these different dynamics, the real got awfully strong, unusually strong from my historical experience, and now its moving the other direction. So I think as we look at, what do we believe are the right plans within a given market? Do we feel on a local currency basis, we are managing our business correctly for the long term? And then, we have a relatively modest sized business in a country like Brazil, and with that being the case, sometimes when you have negatives from a translation standpoint, the impact is accentuated. So we sometimes probably have that as a bit of a greater influence, on how those numbers come out. But I continue to feel good about the progress, the distribution we are building across the country and our brand portfolio there. I think for our company, part of what you see there may be less macro and a little bit more unique to us, given the size of our business there. John Baumgartner - Wells Fargo : Great. Thanks JP. John Bilbrey : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein. John Bilbrey : Good morning Alexia. Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein : Hi. Just wanted to pick up on your comments about the lower consumer trip in the instant consumable channel and the irregular approach in patterns and traditional mass. Could you just give us a little bit of a handle on what that was, and I know it's settled down now, but what caused it to settle down? Thank you. John Bilbrey : If you looked at just trips in general and you went back to about June-July 2013, you could start to see a change in the frequency of trips and then the distances people drove from their home to do their primary shopping, and so that was one of the reasons the food channel is an example, continue to do a little bit better, as people got a higher percentage of their primary trip there, and so, that was one of the influences. It continued through the fall and into the first quarter, and what we observed, as we look at total store data and household panel data etcetera, is that the mix in the basket changed. So you got a little bit greater focus on staples versus instant consumables. If you think about people who may have been impacted by the weather, and then when we saw differences across the country, if weather wasn't an issue versus whether being an issue. And then you also have changes in some of the government programs that people had to adjust to and figure out what that meant for them. And so I think this concept of bifurcation also is an issue in terms of how people build their basket. And so, there was just a lot of moving parts in what we believe we are seeing is a bit of an emergence from that, where things, both in terms of traffic, primary shopping, outlets, as well as mix of the basket, is returning to what we might call a more historical norm. I think the trips data of course will continue to follow and see if you know that changes and it comes back. But those are really some of the influences that were in that comment. Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein : Great. Thank you very much. I will pass it on. Mark Pogharian : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Your last question is from Rob Dickerson with Consumer Edge Research. John Bilbrey : Good morning. Robert Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research : Hello. So just a question on balance sheet and cash flow. I understand Q1 is a little bit more pressured than expected. Part of it is coming out of international advertising's pullback. We have seen share loss in the U.S., coming from lower end, but we are also seeing it from Russell and some of the higher end guys. There has also been some discussion though on the M&A front for some smaller players, one of the company executives is getting very old, to be frank, and in another company there has been rumors, that the brothers might be looking to sell. I am just curious, if you were to come under pressure, you are now running at a net debt level, its about a 15 year low. I understand all the near term pressures in the business, but could you may be just kind of discuss a bit what your theory is around capital allocation outside of Golden Monkey over the next two years, haven't seen any shares purchased really, or repurchased to effect EPS over the past two years, for the most part. I don't really feel like I thought you were talking about the balance sheet, thanks. David Tacka : Okay. Well I guess, we feel very good about the balance sheet. We have a very strong balance sheet, and as we look at -- and we had about $1 billion in cash at the end of the quarter. As we look at both our cash and our debt capacity, our priority first continues to be to grow, and so we are continuing to look at M&A opportunities, and we are also investing in capital to support our business growth. We have got new plant under construction in Malaysia, and we will have some additional need for additional volume as our business grows. So our number one priority for cash and debt continues to be growth, and we expect that to be M&A and also to be the capital investments. Our second priority is dividends. We have a policy of about 50% dividend pay out of our earnings, and so that's where we would go. And then third, we would go to share buyback. We buy back what is exercised in options, and as I reported, we bought back a bit over $200 million in the first quarter for replenishing option exercises and we also have $125 million on an old authorization, and an additional $250 million on a new authorization that we did earlier in the year, and we expect to be making progress against those, as we go through the year. But that's kind of our priorities, first is growth, second is dividend and then we will buy back shares after that. Robert Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research : Okay. Thank you. Mark Pogharian : Thank you very much for joining us for today's conference call. Again, we apologize for the technical difficulties, and Sergio Flores and I will be available to take any follow-up calls that you may have. Thank you very much. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Jonathan Patrick Feeney - Athlos Research LLC Eric Larson Operator : Good morning. My name is Phyllis, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Hershey Company's Second Quarter 2014 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Mark Pogharian, you may begin your conference. Mark K. Pogharian: Thank you, Phyllis. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Hershey Company's Second Quarter 2014 Conference Call. J.P. Bilbrey, President and CEO; Dave Tacka, Senior Vice President and CFO; and I will represent Hershey on this morning's call. We also welcome those of you listening via the webcast. Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2013 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. As a result, we will discuss 2014 second quarter results, excluding net pretax charges of $2 million or $0.01 per share diluted related to net acquisition and transaction cost primarily associated with Shanghai Golden Monkey, Project Next Century charges, as well as non-service-related pension income. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges. With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey. John P. Bilbrey: Thanks, Mark, and good morning to everyone on the phone and webcast. Net sales sequentially improved versus the first quarter, and we continue to make progress against the initiatives that will drive improved performance over the remainder of the year. In the second half of the year, seasonal growth will be solid. New products will launch, and we'll have new initiatives that should enable us to deliver on our objectives. Driven by a late and solid Easter season, second quarter CMG category growth was 6.8%. Hershey marketplace results were also strong with Q2 retail takeaway of 7.5%, resulting in a 0.2 point market share gain, offsetting the decline we experienced in the first quarter. Our Easter sell-through was very good, and we gained 1.1 market share points in this important season. On a quarterly and year-to-date basis, chocolate is driving category growth, and as we stated earlier this year, we expect our net sales and marketplace performance to be driven by strong second half activity that we have planned. But our first half results have been below our expectations. In-store activity and trends were difficult to interpret over the first few months of the year, given abnormal shopping patterns, a late Easter and a continued challenging macro-environment, especially related to the consumer who has not participated in the economic recovery. However, we've now been able to discern that across the broader snacking continuum, especially as it relates to the instant consumable pack type, we're encountering greater levels of competitive in-store merchandising and programming. As a result over the remainder of the year, in addition to solid seasonal growth and previously mentioned new product launches, we have a few more initiatives than we initially planned. A couple examples of those include a King of Summer program, which is a major effort within the C-store channel to increase king-sized displays; a new limited-edition instant consumable product to drive excitement, variety, news and more importantly merchandising and programming; a new Brookside product launch in December, in addition to the Brookside Crunchy Clusters; and incremental shelf space gains in the C-store channel as a result of favorable shelf sets. We feel good about the plans that we have in place, our business model and the opportunities that lie ahead. We continue to believe that over the long-term, the candy and mint category grows in the 3% to 4% range. Although given year-to-date results and the aforementioned challenges, category growth will most likely be around 3% in 2014. Before we get into the details of the second quarter, I'd like to spend a moment on the pricing action announced on July 15. As you're all aware, commodity prices have been volatile. Prices for many of the primary and secondary commodities that we use in our products have increased year-over-year. Given category dynamics related to pricing, flow-through and the view of our future cost profile, a price increase was necessary to protect our margins. This action was effective immediately on July 15. However, during the 4-week period, ending August 12, existing customers can, based on their historic order patterns, order up to 8 weeks of inventory at the previous price if delivery occurs by September 7. On everyday items, consumers will start to see higher prices primarily on instant consumables and on in-aisle non-merchandise take-home items. As such, we expect initial price elasticity impact to result in lower volume over the remainder of the year, primarily in the fourth quarter and into 2015. We do not expect this action to materially impact our financial results this year. While it is a bit early to measure consumer reaction in response to pricing, we feel that our brand support, innovation, consumer spending and investment in go-to-market capabilities should enable us to deliver on our long-term target. Now for some marketplace performance. Nielsen's second quarter measures do not encompass the entire Easter season in both the year ago and current periods. Therefore, the majority of my remarks today will refer to year-to-date marketplace performance for the 24 weeks ended June 14, 2014. Year-to-date CMG, that's candy, mint and gum, category growth in the xAOC+C channels was up 2.1%. However, gum continues to be a drag on total CMG performance, and if you exclude it, the category was up 3%. Total Hershey CMG retail takeaway for the year-to-date period through June 14, 2014, in channels that account for about 90% of our U.S. retail business was up 2.2%, in line with overall category growth with market share of 31.1% flat versus the previous period. As a reminder, this represents xAOC+C store data consisting of food, drug, MassX and C-store channels plus the inclusion of Walmart and partial Dollar, Club and Military channels. Year-to-date, xAOC+C chocolate category growth was plus 3.5%, and in the range we expected given the level of activity in the category. Hershey's xAOC+C chocolate retail takeaway was 2%, resulting in a loss of 0.7 chocolate market share points. We expect our performance in the back half of the year to be better given the launch of York Minis and Brookside Crunchy Clusters. Retail takeaway for Reese's, Kit Kat and Brookside was solid, resulting in market share gains for all 3 brands. Year-to-date, non-chocolate candy or NCC, xAOC+C category growth was plus 1.6%. It has lagged chocolate category growth given the industry's focus on chocolate. In xAOC+C channels, Hershey's non-chocolate candy retail sales declined 1%, resulting in a market share loss of minus 0.4 points. However, post-Easter, our NCC trends improved, and we've outpaced the category driven by the Lancaster brand. Lancaster continues to show very positive results. Trial and repeat is in line with expectations, and it's revitalizing the caramel category. Distribution is in our targeted range, with plans in place to increase distribution in the back half of the year. While not as large as chocolate in NCC, we continue to do well within the gum and mint categories. Specifically, our year-to-date gum and mint retail takeaway was in the xAOC+C universe was up 29% and 7%, respectively. As a result, our gum market share increased 1.2 points, and we now have a 4.9% share of the market. Our mint market share increased 0.7 points, expanding our segment-leading position to 39.8%. In the C-store class-of-trade, Easter impacts are minimal. Here, for the 12 weeks ended June 14, the CMG category was up 1.9%. Excluding gum and despite trips being down again in this channel, C-store candy and mint 12-week category growth was up a combined 3.1%. Hershey's Q2 C-store performance was less than our expectations. Our total C-store retail takeaway increased 1.3% driven by our mint business with posted growth of 7.2%. However, we underperformed in chocolate, resulting in Q2 C-store CMG market share loss of 0.2 points. Overall, C-store trends were mixed. In Q1, C-store chocolate category growth was about 6% due to introductory price points of new competitive products. With the inclusion of this promotion, Q2 C-store chocolate category growth slowed to about 3%. Hershey's Q2 C-store chocolate retail takeaway was up only 1.1%. Our C-store performance was soft in the first half of the year, given that more of our innovation was in take-home versus instant consumable pack types. As I mentioned earlier, we're seeing more in-store activity across the broader snack categories. Combined with lower trips and economically challenged consumers, our merchandising and programming was not as effective. From my earlier comments, we're making changes and updates to our merchandising, programming, innovation and consumer investment over the remainder of the year and into 2015 to improve our performance. I'd also like to provide you with an update on our grocery segment, whose marketplace performance is excluded from the CMG Nielsen database. The Hershey spreads launch has gotten off to a good start. We're on track with our plans related to the jar and the instant consumable pack types. Given the mid-May launch of the IC items and repeat jar purchases, the contribution of Hershey spreads net sales will be greater in the second half of the year versus the first half. Our ACV target for the spreads jar was reached in the Q2, and instant consumable ACV is off to a good start and will build over the remainder of the year. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we'll launch Reese's spreads, a peanut butter chocolate spread, and my personal favorite, which has tested very positively. Additionally, we partnered with Pizza Hut on desserts portfolio, featuring Hershey's chocolate chips. We believe this will have a halo effect on our baking chips business just in time for the upcoming holiday baking season. Moving now to international. Net sales were in line with the outlook we provided last quarter. We anticipated a profile similar to last year despite slightly greater foreign currency headwinds. International net sales were in line with expectations, up 7%. China continues to do very well. Our sales increased double digits, and Hershey continues to be one of the fastest growing international chocolate companies in China. For the 3 months ended June 14, chocolate category growth was around 7.7%, less than last quarter and typical of the trend post the Chinese new year. But our chocolate retail takeaway of about 30% was almost 4x the category growth rate, and we're poised to have another solid year. We're on track to achieve distribution gains in the second half of the year, and begin a phased launch of Reese's in the fourth quarter. In Mexico, and overall economic environment remains sluggish. As expected, our business sequentially improved in the first quarter, with net sales flat on a local currency basis versus last year. Modern trade chocolate category growth resumed in Q2 and was up about 4%. Hershey retail takeaway of 11% resulted in a market share gain of 0.8 points. Given the economic challenge it's facing, traditional trade consumers in Q2, our non-chocolate business underperformed the category. We expect a tough operating environment in Mexico over the remainder of the year with a sales profile similar to the second quarter. After being down in the first quarter, Brazil Q2 net results increased double digits versus last year, reflecting April shipments related to a late Easter. Importantly, chocolate category growth resumed in the second quarter, albeit helped by a late Easter. On a year-to-date basis, the Brazil chocolate category is up about 2.3% while Hershey has increased about 2.9%. We now have a 4.8% share in this important market. Given the challenging macroeconomic environment, we would expect category and Hershey growth to be slightly below last year. We're focused on the long-term and not concerned about the impact the foreign currency exchange rates or near-term challenges facing consumers. We remain very optimistic about our businesses in these key international markets, and expect international net sales growth of around 15% in 2014. Dave will provide you with additional financial details of our Q2 results and our full year outlook, so let me now provide you with some closing thoughts. Over the remainder of the year, we'll have greater levels of merchandising, programming and innovation in the marketplace. Advertising GRPs or impressions will be up mid-single digits on a percentage basis for the full year versus 2013. Advertising GRPs are able to increase greater than advertising dollars this year due to a new global media planning and buying process that is leveraging our scale. Halloween orders are on track, and we have the right mix of seasonal specific advertising, coupons and programming support that sets the stage for another winning season. So we have a lot of activity over the remainder of the year that should help us drive sales growth. Additionally, we continue to feel good about the outlook for candy and mint category growth. Overall, the category continues to perform well with year-to-date gains within the category's historical growth rate. Investments in the category in the form of advertising and innovation are present for most major manufacturers. Given high household penetration and the impulsive nature of the category, as well as affordable price points, we believe retailers and consumers will continue to value the confectionery category. As a result, we would expect the category to continue to consistently secure key merchandising and programming space even as price points may rise. Thank you for your time, and let me now turn it over to Dave. David W. Tacka: Thank you, J.P., and good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Second quarter net sales of $1.58 billion increased 4.6% versus last year, generating adjusted earnings per share diluted of $0.76, an increase of 5.6% from last year. We expected second quarter sales to improve sequentially versus the first quarter, and they did. However, sales growth was below our expectations, given the U.S. mix headwinds and the increased levels of in-store activity across the broader snack continuum that J.P. discussed. Organic net sales growth of 5.3% was driven by volume. As expected, new product launches are on track from net sales and a marketplace perspective, and we're about 60% of our total volume growth. Core-branded contribution was about 40%. The unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates was 0.7 points, and in line with our expectations. North America's sales increased 4.5% with balanced growth in the U.S. and Canada. International net sales increased 7%, relatively in line with our expectations. Turning to margins. Adjusted gross margin declined by 230 basis points in the quarter as higher input costs, primarily commodities and unfavorable sales mix, more than offset supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives. Dairy costs in the quarter were higher than our expectations. As many of you know, there's not a developed futures market for dairy, which significantly limits opportunities to hedge our requirements. While spot prices have declined slightly from year-to-date high, U.S. market costs remained at elevated levels. As a result of the higher prices, we have increased our dairy cost forecast for the remainder of the year. This increase, as well as higher trade spending, primarily for greater merchandising activities, will adversely impact gross margin, particularly in the third quarter. Adjusted earnings, before interest and taxes in the second quarter, increased 1.6% versus last year, generating EBIT margin of 17.7%, a 60-basis-point decline versus last year. The decrease was due to the lower gross margin, partially offset by slightly lower selling, marketing and administrative expenses. During the quarter, advertising and related consumer marketing expense declined about 5% versus the prior period. GRPs increased in the quarter as we continued to fully execute our on-air advertising programs for our major brands and new products. The reduced expense was primarily the result of decisions to delay new production costs, and shift some funding to coupons and trade merchandising to better reflect today's consumer environment. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses, excluding advertising and related consumer marketing, was about the same level as the prior year, as higher selling and employee-related costs were offset by a $5.6 million foreign currency exchange gain related to the manufacturing facility under construction in Johor, Malaysia. Now let me provide a brief update on our international business. Similar to last year, we believe 2014 international sales growth will be back-half weighted given the timing of distribution gains, new product launches and seasonal growth. Second quarter international net sales increased by 7%. On a constant currency basis, they were up 10.4%. In our focused markets, China net sales increased low double digits, and we continue to grow market share. We are on track to achieve further distribution gains in the second half of the year, including the phased launch of Reese's in the fourth quarter. In Mexico, second quarter net sales declined about 5% versus last year due to foreign currency headwinds. On a constant currency basis, sales were about flat, an improvement versus the first quarter. We expect the operating environment in Mexico to remain sluggish over the remainder of the year, resulting in a sales profile similar to the second quarter. In Brazil, second quarter sales increased double digits due to the timing of Easter shipments that occurred in April. Over the remainder of the year, we expect the chocolate category in Brazil to be pressured by a soft economy and volume elasticity related to pricing. Therefore, we expect total international net sales growth for the year of around 15%. Note that this excludes the Shanghai Golden Monkey business, which we estimate will close before the end of the year. Moving down the P&L. Second quarter interest expense of $21 million was about the same as last year. For the full year, we expect interest expense to be around $85 million. The adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was 34.3%, in line with our estimate. For the full year, we continue to expect the adjusted tax rate to be around 34.5%. For the second quarter of 2014, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 225 million shares, leading to an adjusted earnings per share diluted of $0.76, an increase of 5.6% versus year ago. Now let me provide a quick recap of year-to-date adjusted results. Net sales increased 3.4% in the first half. Adjusted EBIT increased 2.8%, resulting in an adjusted EBIT margin of 20.2%. Year-to-date gross -- adjusted gross margin was 46.0% versus 47.1% last year or 110 basis points lower due to higher commodity costs. Adjusted earnings per share diluted in the first half increased 5% to $1.90 per share. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the second quarter, net trading capital increased versus last year's second quarter by $82 million. Accounts receivable was higher by $57 million, primarily because of sales timing and remains extremely current. Inventory was higher by $76 million and accounts payable increased by $52 million. Capital additions, including software, were $70 million in the second quarter. For the year, we now expect total capital expenditures to be about $380 million to $390 million, including the capital related to the Johor, Malaysia, project. This is an increase from previous guidance, primarily as a result of including capital in the China manufacturing JV that we've now taken control of. Depreciation and amortization was $51 million in the second quarter, in line with our estimates. During the second quarter, the company repurchased the $125 million of outstanding shares, completing the $250 million repurchase authorization that was approved in April 2011. Additionally, we repurchased $40 million of our common shares to replace shares issued in connection with exercises of stock options. All $165 million of the acquired shares were repurchased in the open market. The company continues to generate substantial free cash flow and has a strong balance sheet. As was mentioned in this morning's press release, we have increased our quarterly dividend by 10% so that we remain in line with our targeted 50% payout ratio. This action reflects our confidence in the long-term growth potential of our business. Additionally, we have authorization to make additional repurchases of up to $250 million based upon cash availability within our cash use priorities. Cash at end of the second quarter of $563 million was relatively in line with the year ago period. The company is well-positioned to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements and the Golden Monkey acquisition. Let me close by providing some context on our 2014 outlook. As J.P. outlined, we have initiatives in place that we believe will drive net sales growth across our businesses over the remainder of the year. We believe these actions will result in 2014 net sales growth around the low end of our 5% to 7% long-term target, including the impact of the price increase and foreign currency exchange rates. Due primarily to higher dairy costs, greater merchandising and unfavorable mix, we now expect gross margin to be slightly down versus 2013. Based on the timing of new product launches in both North America and international markets, advertising and related consumer marketing expense in the second half of the year is expected to be up mid-single digits on a percentage basis versus last year, with the biggest increase expected in the third quarter. This will result in full year expense being up low-single digits. As J.P. mentioned, the increase in GRPs will be greater than dollars this year. We continue to expect SM&A expense, excluding advertising, to increase this year at a rate less than sales, as we leverage the investments we've made over the last few years. As a result, we expect full year adjusted earnings per share diluted to be around the low end of our long-term growth rate of 9% to 11%. We continue to expect that the fourth quarter will drive second half and full year EPS growth as we begin to lap the higher commodities and SM&A cost levels. Additionally, note that this outlook excludes operating results related to Shanghai Golden Monkey, which we now expect will close by year end. We continue to expect Golden Monkey results, excluding acquisition and transaction costs to be accretive in our first year of ownership. The impact in 2014 is now expected to be minimal, given the later-than-expected closing date. Thank you for your time this morning. J.P., Mark and I will now take any questions you may have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : I just have a couple -- a couple of questions, if I could, please. The first would be, I guess, maybe to Dave, in terms of the gross margin being down slightly for the year, is it the pricing you're relying on in terms of the improvement sequentially in gross margin? I know you lapped some of the input cost inflation, started late last year. And then I guess rated to that, is the -- in terms of the cost savings coming through in terms of Project Next Century and that kind of thing, do those pick up in the second half of the year? David W. Tacka: So the Project Next Century savings are pretty well completed. We've completed that project, and the savings were pretty much all flowing through. In the back half of the year, the gross margin is impacted by the higher commodity costs versus last year, but with respect to the fourth quarter, we really just begin to lap where we started having the higher cost last year. Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. And then if I could ask another question for J.P. And just in relation to, I guess, as you see your investments behind the business from an advertising and promotional standpoint, advertising is up less than you said as of last quarter, but it sounds like you're getting more promotional as well. So as you look at kind of the pressure against the consumer, is that the same as what you thought before, or just more money moving into promotional spending? John P. Bilbrey: Yes. I think there's a combination of things, and let me point a couple of things out about the cost. There's the GRP efficiency, which we've gained, which is a piece of it because of a change we made there in the process. And then one of the things that you don't see is the nonworking piece or the production cost piece, which is a meaningful number for us this year as well. So in terms of absolute GRPs, I think that we're good there as we look at our current plan. I think the way to think about the merchandising is, is as we look at the total snacking continuum, we've seen a significant increase in overall quality merchandising, especially in some specific channels like C-store. It's not that merchandising is necessarily at a deep discount versus where you might think it has been historically. It's really more of a competitive environment and the range of choice that the consumer has. So some of that snacking is being where -- I think, if you look over the last couple of years, a lot of that growth has been led by CMG. I think what you're seeing in the current environment is that there's more on the floor, and it's more competitive across total snacking. So the choice the consumer has is broader versus absolute price being a driver. Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : So any limitation to Hershey getting their fair share of space or more space, especially in the C-store? Is that the intention of these new programs? John P. Bilbrey: No, I don't -- no, I don't think so. I mean, as you know, we've got great coverage in C-store. For us, I think it was really about programming and what we saw with competitive programming, particularly in the first quarter and in continuing into the second quarter. I know there's some of the things that I talked about that we're going to be responding to, and then, of course, our innovation is much more significant in the second half. So we feel good about our stance, but it's a competitive environment. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Actually, just to follow-up on Chris's question. If you look at the, I guess, the non-seasonal business and the instant consumable business, the non -- the snacking, the broader snacking competitors have -- there's been a lot of product -- new product innovation. Doritos has definitely -- or Frito has definitely stepped up its activity on new products. You've seen it in Nabisco. So I guess, my question is just how do you feel about your innovation pipeline, not so much for this year, but even kind of into '15? If we assume that there's going to be a lot more of this sort of stepped-up product innovation in that snacking continuum, do you feel comfortable that you've got the new product pipeline to compete and what is -- could be a more competitive landscape? John P. Bilbrey: Yes. Let me answer it in 2 different pieces. First of all, on the innovation front for our brands, we've got what we believe is a very strong innovation pipeline in the second half. We've talked about some of that, and then, of course, we've added some incremental things. So we think we're going to be competitive there. If you really dig into the data of what's going on, part of what we've seen, which is different than what we've seen in the past is that our everyday business didn't do as well as we would have hoped it would have in this particular timeframe. I think the forces and factors are some of the things that we talked about. The independent C-store in CMG did not do as well, and I think you have a consumer who's more challenged than in maybe the more modern C-store channel, where gas is a part of the overall mix. And then one of the unique things, as we look at our data, is remember, last year, Hostess, Twinkie, some of the bakery segment was not participating in the category. This year, they are. And while they haven't participated at a significant price discount, the percent of merchandising over the quarter that they had their products merchandised was very high. So you saw meat snacks did very well. Salty snacks did well. Bakery did well, and so the growth was really led there across the snacking continuum more so than it was with CMG, and those are some things that we have to respond to as we go forward. Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : So as you go forward into '15, will you change anything about your -- the types of new products you want to roll out or make some of the -- some adjustments to your pipeline? I mean, it's -- I guess to kind of put it succinctly, it's just you had a new product innovation pipeline, and I guess some of it's going to be back-half-loaded, but it may not be matching up as well against some of the other sort of non-chocolate and non-candy competitors. So is there something you have to do to tweak your innovation or... John P. Bilbrey: Well, I think -- yes, I think you can say that, in the first quarter, as we kind of go back and keep score there. But as we look at our overall growth algorithm of getting a minimum of 1 point of our growth from innovation, and as you know, we've been more in the 2-point range, what we'll do is we feel very good about our pipeline. We'll be pulling some things forward in that pipeline, as it relates to the U.S. business so we don't feel as though we don't have initiatives that can bring a lot of value to us, and then that pipeline will also have a focus on the core. And if you look -- again, just recall from my remarks, if you look at the first and second quarter, we did well on Kit Kat. We did well on Reese's. We did well on Brookside, and so we just need to make sure that we've got the right timing and phasing of that innovation. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Just a question on the balance sheet and M&A. You were mentioned in press reports as a potential suitor for Russell Stover, which obviously ended up going elsewhere, I was just wondering if there was anything you could say anecdotally about how you evaluated that opportunity and why, given the strength of your balance sheet, you didn't pursue it more aggressively? And then just on a broader level, can you remind us whether you have any specific valuation or return on capital criteria that come into play with when you're evaluating acquisitions? Or is it really only about strategic fit and accretion over sort of a 1- to 2-year period? David W. Tacka: Well, I mean, I think in terms of how we look at the business, so I think the #1 thing we will look at is our strategic fit. And so, again, when we look at acquisitions, we're trying to find things that will be both in our focus markets, and that will add to our ability to grow or ability -- or our capabilities. Those capabilities could be portfolio. They could be distribution or route to market. Those are really our key factors. Economically, we use a discounted cash flow model and clearly look at the return, and we use that to make sure we're disciplined in terms of the pricing. With respect to the Russell Stover, I really don't care to comment any further on that one. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay, understood. I mean, just a quick sort of broader question on category trends. Obviously, there's a number competitive and macro factors, and you've highlighted those. But just wondering based on your segmentation work and your observations on the category, is there any evidence that broader health and wellness trends concerns are having, at this point, a measurable impact on the category even though that historically hasn't been the case? John P. Bilbrey: We don't think so. I think that there's broadly consumers you can see over time have changing a relationships with food. If you look at total snacking, snacking continues to grow as a total category. And then one of the things that we've talked about is if you look at the core confectionary category, people come to the category as a reward-me category. They know it's indulgent. It's not a food group. They tend to -- it tends to represent about 2% of total caloric intake. So it's self-regulating in many respects. So as we think about the future, we're thinking about the total snacking continuum. That can be everything from indulgent to more functional, but remember, the chocolate segment in the category really continues to do well. It's just simply in the last quarter that wasn't led as largely by us as it has been in the previous time frames. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Quick question on elasticity. I guess, I'm curious what you are sort of modeling for elasticity to the price increase. And I guess, more importantly, if it's different from kind of what you built in the last time around when I think elasticity was -- frankly, it ended up being a lot more modest than you expected, and certainly less than kind of a one-to-one relationship. And then as part of that, J.P., you'd mentioned in your prepared remarks that given the price increase, you'd expect volume to be lower in the second half of the year. I didn't know if that meant lower year-over-year or just lower than you previously would have been, had you not taken pricing? John P. Bilbrey: Yes. So to answer the second part, it's really versus a planning stance without pricing, is what I would say there. Andrew, we always model a one-to-one ratio on all of our pricing. You're correct in that, the last couple of pricing moves we've seen with a significant increase in advertising spend in the category, which reminded consumers why they participated in the category, we experienced something more like 0.6, 0.7 conversion rate. And so the things that we're talking about would have the modeling of one-to-one. Obviously, I'd like to see us do better than that, and we'll keep you posted on what that looks like. So we would hope to see conversion with shorter timelines and faster conversion rates, but the modeling is one-to-one. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Right, that's very helpful. And then just the last one, typically, you've taken pricing with an intention to protect your gross margin percentage as opposed to just gross margin dollars. I assume that's sort of the intent as you think out to '15 and beyond, but I just wanted to run that by you. David W. Tacka: You have it correct. Our model is to protect our margin and invest in our brands. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank. Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : I guess first is a more detailed question. In the press release, you said that the FX was -- headwind was greater than you expected? And Dave, you said it was in line? So we want to clarify which is correct? David W. Tacka: Sure. I think where we wind up there is that, as it affects the international business, that was a bit greater than what we expected. And as it related to North America, Canada was a little bit more favorable than we expected. Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : So you mean Canada was more favorable? David W. Tacka: Canada was a little bit more favorable. International was a little bit more unfavorable. So on balance, we were pretty close to what we expected. Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. And then I guess this is kind of like what did you know and when did you know it? But when you last gave guidance, you had -- you expected sales to still be in line with your target, and gross margins you had moderated, but you still expected them to be, I guess, kind of flattish. And now in your guidance, you've included the price increase. So obviously, the price increase could be material to top line, as well as your gross margin calculation. So kind of what -- I guess, what -- were you anticipating a price increase, but didn't tell us last quarter when you gave guidance versus today? David W. Tacka: No. I mean, our guidance as of the last quarter was basically what we expected at that time, and not anticipating the price increase. As we've said, we really don't expect the price increase to have a significant impact in 2014. I mean, in the fourth quarter, we'll see some instant consumable pricing, and some of that will be offset by volume, but again, given the elasticities, we don't see much impact. The change in the gross margin versus the last guidance is really about the continued high pricing in dairy costs and also the mix that we saw in the second quarter. Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. And then last question, I'll pass it on. Can you remind me, is gross margin a part of your compensation package because, obviously, that piece is coming in well below your expectation this year? And so my question is really geared towards your comp accrual and would have kind of a setback to normal in 2015, be a headwind we should kind of consider? I mean, I realize the year's only half over, but gross margins are obviously below plan. David W. Tacka: I guess kind of 2 points. With respect to your first one, and we do disclose our metrics in the proxy. Gross margin, actually, gross margin level is not a part of our comp program, but it's a key part of how we get to our earnings, and so that's how I would address that. The second part of your question, as you're looking at 2015, we're not really ready to give 2015 guidance. But what I would say to you is that as we've taken the price increase, we've looked at our gross margin as part of that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : I wanted to know if Mars' price increase that they just announced, it's 7%. Yours was 8%. Is there any -- have you done any math to determine whether their pricing will be a little bit below yours when it's all said and done? And then secondly, I wanted to know if I could kind of think again about the international growth algorithm. You're probably still mid-teens this year, but if Brazil is -- the category seems to be growing at a very low rate. Mexico has stagnated. China is doing, obviously, very well, but that -- China seems to be the only real driver of growth. So excluding the acquisition for a second, what are your thinking -- what is your thinking about 2015? Does the macro have to get better in Mexico and Brazil for that algorithm to work? John P. Bilbrey: Well, I think there's one component that you didn't talk about, and we have a meaningful export business as a part of that international business. So it's not all about just the focus markets, but we also have a very good structured export business that continues to do very well, and that's also a really profitable business. I think it's important to keep in perspective in Brazil that it's a relative -- we have a relatively modest size business there, and we continue to build distribution and presence on shelves. So a lot of our potential there is really around increasing the portfolio size, and it's really increasing brand presence. So those are fundamentals that we believe that as we continue to execute against that, we'll continue to grow there. So I think while a lot of those macro things are important, we also have another lever that works well for us. In terms of the Mexican business, we've continued to grow our chocolate share there. There's some macro-economic issues that seem to be impacting the consumer there. So I can't really predict, going forward, what I see there in terms of pace of recovery in terms of the total market. But I think those markets will get better versus worse, and then I think we will continue to do well in China, and as well as these other markets. Just remember, within our strategies, as we talk about being focused on specific geographies, it's also about expanding the portfolio. In a lot of these markets, we have a very modest portfolio still at this point in time. So again, I think the fundamentals of how we grow are very much in our favor, and I think that's why more broadly we could feel optimistic about the continued growth process in international businesses. Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : And the Mars question? John P. Bilbrey: You've seen what I've seen in the general marketplace. So I can't really comment or provide any analysis on what they may or may not have done, but I'm sure that will reveal itself as time passes. Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Just a follow-up. Can you say how much your exports are up this year, and whether that's higher or lower than historical? John P. Bilbrey: What I can do is I don't have the number right in front of me. But if you want to call Mark, we're more than happy to provide you specifically that information. I just don't have the number at the -- on the top of my mind. I apologize for that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JP Morgan. Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : As we think about your price increase and the window you've given customers to perhaps buy in a little more than they usually would over the next few weeks, how should we think about the cadence of your shipments the next 2 quarters? I assume it's reasonable to model some 3Q sell and a reversal in 4Q. Is that accurate? And can you help us on the magnitude of that perhaps? David W. Tacka: Well, I think given the timing of the price increase and how it executes, I wouldn't expect to see a big swing between the third and fourth quarter because the buy-in period here would run into August and would ship pretty well clean out in September. Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : And then question for J.P. on advertising. You and your predecessor, Dave West, had a really strong commitment to advertising. For a long time, it's worked, and I guess that's what make this year's lower ad spending as a percent of sales, in terms of growth, a bit confusing. And I guess my question is this, if you believe strongly in brand building, and it's been effective in the past, why not just say, \"Okay, this won't be the best year in our history. Maybe we grow earnings below our long-term range. A lot of companies are experiencing that. But we're not going to back off our principles of innovation and marketing just to, perhaps, at least from the outside, it looks like making our numbers.\" So why not take that hit this year, keep brand-building high, especially in this competitive environment and really stick to your long-term philosophy? John P. Bilbrey: Well, I do believe we're sticking to our long-term philosophy. I think part of what is going to happening is, is you're going to continue to see the balance over the first and second half as we support innovation. We've also gotten a number of our brands more towards the top of the curve of our advertising efficiency. So it doesn't require necessarily the same levels of increase. It's really much more around the mix of where you apply some of that advertising. So if you were to really look at where we've rebalanced some of that advertising, you would see some brand, individual brands, that have gotten some pretty significant increases in advertising. Maybe some others that have been deemphasized, the frequency has changed, but I don't think our philosophy has changed, and we'll continue to reassess over time if we believe we're doing the right thing or not. And the fact that we want to be a knowledge-based brand building company is at the core of everything we think about and how we want to act. So I may come to a different conclusion in the way that you're describing it, but the philosophy hasn't changed. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi. David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : J.P., just wanted to ask a little bit about the second half sales growth. You made some comments here, but I want to go over this because I think this is a fairly critical issue. Second half sales growth must accelerate to reach the full year growth of about 5%. Given first half performance at 3.4%, really, I want to just understand what gives you confidence in this acceleration? And frankly, is this just a high bar kind of given after first quarter in a reduction in guidance here. I think you might understand that confidence on the outside is going to be a little bit low so your answer here, I think, is reasonably critical. John P. Bilbrey: Yes. Well, so there's a couple of things. Remember that in the second half of the year, 68% of our seasonal growth occurs then. We have visibility to what those numbers are, and that seasonal growth is ahead of what the average company growth would be. So we know that we have very strong seasonal business booked for the second half of the year. We believe that the innovation that we have is both meaningful, and should be effective for us. So those are big contributors as well. And we continue to have, we think, in our international business, where we're rolling out Reese's, that that's going to continue to work hard for us. And then the incremental advertising that we've added with the king-size event I mentioned earlier, we have a great cross promotion program with Coke and Reese's, and a couple of things that we haven't talked about yet. So I think, David, we're really lining up to take the things we learned in the first half. The take to make is over 6%, and we know that, but we feel good about the actions that we're taking in terms of the competitiveness and understanding of some of the things that went on in the first and second quarter. So I have confidence that we're going to get there. David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Two follow ups. On international, I believe, last quarter, your guidance for international on a full year basis was 15%, and you've reiterated that today. But apologies, but it sounded like in your description of international, things were weaker. So I'm just trying to reconcile kind of the tone of your international comments in Mexico and Brazil versus the fact that the international guidance is unchanged. John P. Bilbrey: Well, I think -- Dave and I can both respond to this. I think what we're saying about Mexico and Brazil is pretty consistent with what we've said last quarter, and we continue to experience good growth in China. And then the exports piece of our business, as I mentioned to you, continues to do well also. So to reiterate, I don't think there's change there. Certainly, I was very transparent in terms of some of the challenges in terms of FX, and then the consumer challenges in Mexico. But from a programming standpoint and a takeaway standpoint, I think the results are pretty good. David W. Tacka: Yes. I mean, in the first quarter, I mean, I think we laid out the challenge in Mexico and also the challenge in Brazil, and we said we would see some sequential improvement as we go through the year, and we definitely saw that in the second quarter. So our results there were pretty much in line with what we we're expecting. David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : If I could sneak just a final one in, the innovation on Ice Breakers and Brookside, am I correct that you have shifted this from the third quarter into the fourth quarter? And if that's true, can you explain why you did that? John P. Bilbrey: Well, the only thing that has had a shift on timing is Cool Blast. It really had a couple of factors. We continue to be finalizing, perfecting the start-up and formula, and then the other part of it is the capacity issue, where we just want to make sure we had the right capacity in place. It's not going to affect anything else, and we feel good about going ahead there. But those are some normal kinds of start-up things, nothing remarkable. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : So I've got 2 here. I'll just rattle them off at the same time. First, if there's some concern in immediate consumption channels that consumers are swamping into other categories where promotional activity is elevated, as you raised prices, how do you make sure that, that shift doesn't accelerate? And then the second question, lower advertising, more trade promo, bringing back limited editions, just feels very d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu mid-2000s, which obviously didn't end very well. So can you maybe draw some parallels or contrast of why -- what's similar, what's different and why this doesn't end as poorly as that one did? John P. Bilbrey: Yes. Well, let me -- let's try to do everything we can to not compare the fact that we're doing a limited edition to the fact that we did a lot of limited editions back in 2005. So in 2005, as we've discussed quite openly many times, those limited-editions really became our innovation, and that's really not what we do at this point in this era. And so -- but if you have a limited edition, and it's limited, the news is not a bad thing. It's a merchandising event. So that's how, I think, you ought to probably think about characterizing that. We know that the category has been pretty inelastic over time. We've been able to successfully convert price. The consumers' been able to convert it again. I think what we have to observe over time is what's happening with the frequency in some of those areas or channels, where the consumer may not be participating in the recovery as those at the top end of the economic pyramid. So I think that it will be as we've done in the past. We expect conversion to be good, and the phenomena that I talked about in the independent C-store probably is not going to be that connected to what's happening in terms of the price, and the pricing most likely would affect the entire category and not individual brands. So I don't think to the consumer it's going to look that different. David W. Tacka: What I would add is in the things that we've gone through and we've talked about in responding to the situation from the first part of the year is that there's activities that we're putting right around our base products. And so that -- the limited editions have a very limited focused role, and that's just to obtaining some level of merchandising and news. And as J.P. said, the big difference is that we really are focused. The innovation now is really focused on more meaningful and sustainable activities. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Athlos Research. Jonathan Patrick Feeney - Athlos Research LLC : I wanted to dig in, get another go with this price increase margin elasticity question going into next year. When you took your price increase in 2011, I mean, as bad as things are today, I mean, the unemployment rate was higher then. It was just wasn't a great macro environment in general in 2011. If I remember correctly, gas prices were going up at that time. So I guess -- you've talked a lot about the macro environment, but I guess, what gives you -- what makes you think that the elasticity reaction consumers will have in this really tough macro-environment would be any different than what they had back in 2011, particularly given that your -- it seems your leading competitor is sort of following suit here? John P. Bilbrey: Yes, I don't think that it will have big differences than what we've seen. As I've said before, the planning that we've always done around these is the one-to-one ratio. I think your point is a good one in terms of how we should expect the category to behave this time versus other times. And the history of the category over many, many decades is it is a pretty inelastic category, and it cycles pricing really effectively, and that's exactly what I would hope this time. I don't want to -- the thing that I want you to take away from this call is, is that we think about their business. There have been a number of different things over the last 6 to 9 months, whether it's been trips, weather, all of these other things. Largely, we don't know if those are one-offs. If there's some weather effect, they were real. But what we know is that we have fundamental execution opportunities, planning opportunities around how we schedule the promotion and merchandising activities we have, and so we really want to kind of put a number of these things aside. We do know in certain parts of classes of trade, there's a consumer that continues to be challenged. But we're also seeing in the snacking categories some items with some pretty significant pricing. They've been doing very, very well. So I think in the end, while there may be some people, unfortunately, who are really impacted, I think the real drivers will be around the things we know how to do best, and that's execution. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Eric Larson with Janney Montgomery. Eric Larson : One quick follow-up question. In your price increase that you have, going forward here, and in your allowed buy-in to your customers, are you protecting the margins on your fourth quarter seasonal sales for your customers? John P. Bilbrey: Yes, so the answer would be yes. And if you just think about how it works, so the instant consumables tend -- those prices tend to go up almost immediately on the shelf. Merchandising that's been schedule tends to also -- you'd agree, tends to be protected, and then the seasons are protected all the way out to what will be Halloween of next year. So the answer to your question is yes. Mark K. Pogharian: Thank you very much for joining us for today's conference call, and we'll be available for any follow-up questions that you may have. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division Operator : Good morning. My name is Phyllis and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Hershey Company's Third Quarter 2014 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Mark Pogharian, you may begin your conference. Mark K. Pogharian: Thank you. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to The Hershey Company's Third Quarter 2014 Conference Call. J.P. Bilbrey, President and CEO; Dave Tacka, Senior Vice President and CFO; and I will represent Hershey on this morning's call. We also welcome those of you listening via the webcast. Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2013 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the Notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. As a result, we will discuss 2014 third quarter results, excluding net pretax charges of $13.8 million or $0.05 per share diluted related to a noncash trade impairment charge cost associated with Project Next Century, a net gain related to the Shanghai Golden Monkey transaction and non-service-related pension income. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these charges. With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey. John P. Bilbrey: Thanks, Mark and good morning to everyone on the phone and webcast. As expected, net sales, retail takeaway and market share sequentially improved versus our first half of the year trends. Our U.S. CMG, or candy, mint and gum, retail takeaway in the xAOC plus convenience store channels increased 3.3% and was about double the category growth rate. We gained market share in nearly every 4-week quad during the quarter and across every segment. That's chocolate, non-chocolate, gum and mint. Where we focused our investments, results were good. Last quarter, we stated that there would be increased levels of in-store activity in the convenience store channel. I'll provide more detail in a moment, but C-store merchandising and programming generated 4% retail takeaway in this important channel. I was also pleased with our marketplace performance in large mass and value channels. However, store traffic in the food channel was irregular in the third quarter. Our market share in the food channel increased 0.3 points in the third quarter, but category and Hershey growth was less than the historical growth rate of the category. While preliminary Halloween sell-through in all channels, including food, is tracking with expectations, Halloween orders, merchandising and programming were executed in the marketplace, and we believe it's the right mix of seasonal-specific support that sets the stage for another winning season. However, food channel nonseasonal candy during the third quarter and into October was soft. As a result, unfavorable product sales mix pressured profitability. Similar to what we did in the C-stores, we have food channel-specific activity in the fourth quarter that we believe will improve upon these trends. As was the case last quarter, broader snack category growth and in-store activity was present across many channels, although it tempered in Q3 versus the first half of the year increase. Given this backdrop, I was pleased with the Hershey-specific programs by pack type and channel that was executed in the third quarter, enabling us to compete effectively and generate retail takeaway of 3.3%. As it relates to the pricing action we announced in July, in the fourth quarter, we expect consumers will see higher nonseasonal everyday price points. As such, we expect an initial price elasticity impact to result in lower volume in both the fourth quarter and 2015. We will work with our retail customers to ensure that the implementation of the price increase is supported with greater levels of advertising and the right mix of customer trade promotions and merchandising to reduce the impact of volume elasticity. As it relates to the buy-in, we estimate that about 0.75 points of net sales growth in the third quarter was attributable to volume, which normally would've shipped in the fourth quarter. And I'm excited that we completed the initial closing of Shanghai Golden Monkey. The strength of their portfolio, manufacturing expertise and overall distribution capabilities, especially within the traditional trade, is an opportunity for us to leverage scale to make the iconic brands of both our companies even more powerful. This acquisition will make China Hershey's second largest market by the year-end 2015 with anticipated net sales of around $500 million. Now for some marketplace performance. In the third quarter, Hershey's CMG growth in the xAOC+C channels was 2x the category growth rate. Specifically, the CMG category increased plus 1.6%. Gum continues to be a drag on total CMG performance, and excluding it, candy and mints was up a combined 2.3%. Total Hershey CMG retail takeaway for the third quarter in channels that account for about 90% of our U.S. retail business increased plus 3.3% with market share up 0.5 points. As a reminder, this represents xAOC+C store data consisting of the food, drug, MassX and C-store channels, plus the inclusion of Walmart and Partial Dollar Club and Military channels. Third quarter xAOC+C chocolate category growth was plus 2.3%. Given the upcoming Halloween and holiday season, we expect markedly greater chocolate category growth over the remainder of the year. Hershey's xAOC+C chocolate retail takeaway was 3%, an acceleration from the 2% June year-to-date amount, resulting in a Q3 chocolate market share gain of 0.3 points. We expect to build on our chocolate marketplace performance momentum over the remainder of the year given our strong seasonal plans to launch Brookside Crunchy Clusters and the new look and packaging of Hershey's Miniatures take-home packaged chocolate. While early, the new advertising support on Hershey's Miniatures is showing positive results. Third quarter non-chocolate candy, or NCC, category growth was plus 1.8%. Hershey's NCC retail sales increased to 2.7% with market share up 0.1 point. We're pleased with our Lancaster brand performance. However, we're lapping some Jolly Rancher innovation and the successful year-ago summer Twizzler promotion. Lancaster continues to show very positive results, and after 8 months in the market, is the leader within the soft caramels category. Trial and repeat is in line with expectations, and it's revitalizing the roughly $250 million caramel category that's up about 20% this year. Lancaster sales were solid in the summer, but lower versus Q1 due to seasonality. We expect sales to be strong in the fall and winter as merchandising support is executed in the marketplace. The aforementioned nonseasonal chocolate and non-chocolate activity should benefit the food channels where, as I mentioned, overall store traffic continues to be mixed. And we continue to do well within the gum and mint categories. Specifically, our Q3 gum and mint retail takeaway within the xAOC+C universe was up 16% and 6%, respectively. As a result, our gum market share increased by 0.8 points, and we now have a 5.1% share of the market. Our mint market share increased by 0.1 points, expanding our segment-leading position to 39.5%. In the C-store channel, Q3 CMG category growth was up 3.4%. Hershey's Q3 C-store retail takeaway increased 4%, driven by solid candy and mint performance, resulting in a 0.2 market share gain in this channel. I was pleased with our C-store chocolate retail takeaway of 3.5%. The programs I mentioned last quarter such as the King of Summer program, the Coca-Cola and Reese's promotion and the 7-Eleven Big Gulp and King Size promotion drove our solid performance. In the fourth quarter and into 2015, we have C-store merchandising and programming as well as innovations such as seasonal-shaped Reese's products and the 2015 launches of Kit Kat White Minis, Reese's Crunchy Cup and Ice Breakers Cool Blasts Chews that should enable us to win in the C-store channel. I'd also like to provide you with an update on our category segment whose marketplace performance is excluded from the CMG Nielsen database. The Hershey's Spreads launch is relatively in line with expectations. Trial is progressing, and in the third quarter, one of our larger retailers, the Hershey's Spreads' instant consumable pack type was the company's fifth-largest SKU at the front end. Reese's Spread in a jar ships in Q4 and the instant consumable will launch in 2015. Our entry into chocolate spreads is driving category growth of almost 20% this year. As a result, we're getting good collaboration from our retail partners. Now moving to international. As expected, similar to last year's profile, third quarter international net sales increased in the teens, up 18.4%. China continues to do well and is the driver of our overall international net sales growth. China chocolate category growth increased 11% in Q3. The category is developing as anticipated with instant consumable and take-home growth both up double digits. Hershey third quarter retail takeaway was about 4x the category growth rate. For Nielsen, our year-to-date market share is around 10%, driven by the Hershey's and Kisses brands, which have gained 0.9 and 0.7 market share points this year. We've carried our momentum into the fourth quarter and have begun shipping Reese's. It's been a milestone year for us in China and we're on track to achieve about $200 million in China chocolate net sales in 2014. Third quarter net sales growth in Mexico and Brazil were slightly below our estimates. In the modern trade, chocolate category growth in Mexico was up about 4%. Hershey Mexico chocolate retail takeaway was up 6%, resulting in a modern trade chocolate market share gain of 0.4 points. Volume has been gradually improving throughout the year as consumers get used to the higher prices. Trends in Brazil have improved versus the soft start to the year with third quarter net sales in both U.S. dollars and local currency up mid-single digits on a percentage basis versus last year. Year-to-date, the Brazil chocolate category, as well as Hershey retail takeaway, is up 1%. Looking at the subsegment of chocolate wafer candy, Hershey's Mais retail takeaway is up 16% year-to-date. We'll look to build on our momentum here as it's a unique form in this competitive market. Over the years, we've also had success in growing our international export business. Our products can be found in over 70 countries in both developed and emerging markets. We have a profitable export business model and targeted balanced growth with an objective of maintaining the right level of distributor inventory so consumers experience fresh product. Given macroeconomic challenges in some of these markets, demand has tempered. Our go-to-market philosophy of shipping to consumption applies to these markets as well. As a result, we now expect full year international net sales growth, excluding the contribution from Golden Monkey, to increase low double digits. We're focused on the long term and believe the aforementioned challenges facing international export consumers is a short-term issue. Dave will provide you with additional financial details of our Q3 results and our full year outlook, so let me now provide you with some of my closing thoughts. Macroeconomic challenges persist, putting pressure on consumers and retailers. Over the remainder of the year and into 2015, we have targeted innovation, advertising, merchandising and programming to address the needs of consumers by channel and pack type. In the fourth quarter, holiday is tracking as expected, and we're excited about the launch of Brookside Crunchy Clusters, Reese's Crunchy Cup and Reese's Spreads. Along with the carryover benefit of our fourth quarter innovation, in 2015, we're bringing a lot of variety, news and excitement to the category with the new product launches of Kit Kat White Minis, Hershey's Caramels, Ice Breakers Cool Blasts Chews, Reese's Spreads instant consumable as well as some other yet-to-be-announced new products. These initiatives will be supported with greater level of advertising and related consumer marketing that's expected to increase in 2015 at a rate greater than sales growth. These initiatives should position us and to deliver against our objectives. I remain optimistic about our future. Globally, the investments we're making in our scale chocolate brands and go-to-market capabilities are having the desired effect. Kisses and Hershey's are gaining momentum and are true global brands with around 45% and 25% of total brand sales now achieved outside the U.S. Reese's is rolling out in a measured and well-supported pace in China, Mexico and Brazil and initial consumer response is in line with expectations. And Brookside continues to post strong double-digit sales growth and tests well in our international markets. So there's a lot to be excited about. We have plans in place that positions us to win wherever we compete. Our brand-building model is evolving and we expect to grow market share across all of our key markets. We remain focused and know what we need to do to succeed and increase shareholder value. I'll now turn it over to Dave, who will provide you with the financial details. Dave? David W. Tacka: Thank you, J.P. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Third quarter net sales of $1.96 billion increased 5.8% versus last year, generating adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.05, an increase of 1% from last year. Organic net sales growth in the quarter was 6% and was driven primarily by volume. Foreign currency exchange rates, primarily involving Canada, were a 20 basis point headwind. Sales were driven by strong Halloween seasonal growth, new products and instant consumable items in the convenience store channel. Core brand and new product volume growth contribution to net sales were roughly equal in the quarter. By geography, net sales increase included growth in North America and international markets of 4.2% and 18.4%, respectively. Turning to margins. As expected, adjusted gross margin declined in the quarter, driven by higher input costs, primarily cocoa and dairy; greater levels of trade support for in-store merchandising and programming; and other costs related to executing the price increase. However, the 240 basis point decline in gross margin was greater than our forecast as a result of a less favorable sales mix, higher-than-forecast freight and warehousing costs related to the price increase and higher costs related to aged inventory, packaging material write-offs and the timing of certain fixed cost deferrals. In the fourth quarter, gross margin is expected to increase as the company begins to lap the higher input costs it began to incur in the fourth quarter of a year ago. However, as a result of the higher supply chain costs and expected lower sales volumes, we now expect full year gross margin to decline about 75 basis points versus 2013. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes in the third quarter increased 1% versus last year, generating adjusted EBIT margin of 19.4%, a 90 basis point decline versus last year. The decrease was due to the lower gross margin. During the quarter, advertising and related consumer marketing expense increased 1%, while selling and administrative expenses declined 1%. As we stated last quarter, GRPs, which are gross rating points or impressions, will be up mid-single digits on a percentage basis versus last year. Now let me provide a brief update on our international business. Similar to last year, 2014 international sales growth is back half-weighted, given the timing of distribution gains, new product launches and seasonal growth. Third quarter international net sales increased 18.4%, slightly below our estimates, primarily in Mexico and certain export markets. Net sales in China were solid and were in line with the retail takeaway that J.P. referenced. Plans are in place to generate similar results in the fourth quarter that should result in full year China chocolate net sales of around $200 million. In Brazil, third quarter net sales on a reported and constant currency basis increased about 5% versus last year. In Mexico, third quarter net sales on a reported and constant currency basis declined about 4% versus last year. Our businesses in both Mexico and Brazil are improving, albeit slowly. As expected, the macroeconomic operating environment in both countries remains sluggish, and as a result, we continue to expect net sales in 2014 to be slightly below the prior year. As J.P. mentioned, fourth quarter order flow and demand in select international markets has tempered given macroeconomic headwinds. As a result, we now expect full year net sales growth outside the U.S. and Canada to increase low double digits versus our previous estimate of about a 15% increase. Note that this excludes the contribution from Shanghai Golden Monkey. Moving down the P&L. Third quarter interest expense of $21 million was about the same as last year. For the full year, we continue to expect interest expense to be around $85 million. The adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 34.8%, in line with our estimate. For the full year, we continue to expect the adjusted tax rate to be around 34.5%. For the third quarter of 2014, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately $224 million, leading to adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.05. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the third quarter, net trading capital increased versus last year's third quarter by $224 million, $107 million of which is related to acquisitions. Accounts receivable was higher by $127 million, primarily as a result of the Golden Monkey acquisition and the higher sales levels. Our global accounts receivable aging remains extremely current. Inventory was higher by $138 million as a result of the Golden Monkey and China manufacturing facility acquisitions, together with some higher raw material inventory levels in North America. Accounts payable increased by $41 million, primarily as a result of the acquisitions. Capital additions, including software, were $83 million in the third quarter. For the year, we now expect total capital expenditures to be about $360 million to $370 million, lower than our previous estimate of $380 million to $390 million, primarily due to timing related to the manufacturing facility we're building in Johor, Malaysia. Depreciation and amortization was $53 million in the third quarter, in line with our estimates. During the third quarter, the company repurchased $75 million of outstanding shares against the $250 million repurchase authorization that was approved in February of 2014. Additionally, $31 million of common shares were repurchased to replace shares issued in connection with the exercise of stock options. All $106 million of acquired shares were repurchased in the open market. During the quarter, dividends paid were $115 million. Cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter of $575 million was in line with our forecasts. Seasonal working capital requirements, combined with closing on the Shanghai Golden Monkey purchase at the end of September, caused us to take on approximately $300 million of commercial paper debt in the U.S. that we will pay off in early November. The balance of the short-term debt increase relates to the Golden Monkey acquisition and the needs in our other international markets. The company remains well positioned to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements and acquisitions. Now to summarize. We made progress in the third quarter as net sales, retail takeaway and market share improved versus the first half of the year. Halloween and holiday are tracking nicely. The company's chocolate business in China continues to be strong and is the driver of our international sales growth. However, challenges in nonseasonal sales growth, particularly in the U.S. food channel, combined with the pushback launch of Ice Breakers Cool Blasts Chews and weakness in certain international export markets, have caused us to lower our organic sales growth projection for 2014. We now expect 2014 net sales to increase around 4.75%, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rate and the contribution from Golden Monkey sales of about 0.75 points. Given year-to-date results, combined with higher supply chain costs, unfavorable sales mix and lower sales volumes than previously forecast for the fourth quarter, we now expect full year gross margin to decline about 75 basis points versus 2013. Total selling, marketing and administrative expenses will be about in line with a year ago as the company leverages investments made in go-to-market capabilities established over the last few years. As a result, the company anticipates 2014 adjusted earnings per share diluted growth for the full year to be around 8%. The impact of Shanghai Golden Monkey in 2014 is minimal, given the late September closing date. As J.P. summarized, we have a solid pipeline of targeted innovation, merchandising and programming that should drive pack type and channel growth in 2015. Additionally, advertising and related consumer marketing expense is expected to increase at a rate greater than net sales growth. We're focused on the plans and investments to drive top line growth and believe these initiatives will resonate with consumers and be a catalyst that enables the CMG category to increase within its historical growth rate of 3% to 4%. There are a couple of other items expected to impact 2015 sales growth. The company has signed a definitive agreement to purchase The Allan Candy Company in Canada for approximately $28 million. This company co-manufactures products such as Jolly Rancher Hard Candy and Lancaster Caramels for Hershey. It also has other confectionery product sales of around $30 million. The primary goal of the acquisition is to increase capacity and manufacturing capability for Hershey's sweets and refreshment products. The transaction will close upon completion of regulatory reviews, which we expect to be by the end of 2014. We will also make product line changes in India that will negatively impact sales growth by about 40 basis points. These changes include the termination of edible oil sales as our brand license expires. We will also rationalize certain other low-margin products as we focus on our product portfolio. As a result of these, we expect 2015 net sales to increase about 7% to 9%, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and a contribution from acquisitions of around 2.5 points. We continue to be a gross-margin-focused company and expect that the previously announced pricing action, as well as productivity and cost savings, will result in gross margin expansion in 2015. We expect increases in advertising and direct marketing expenses to increase faster than sales and continued SG&A cost discipline. The resulting growth in adjusted earnings per share diluted is expected to be in the 9% to 11% range. Thank you for your time this morning. J.P., Mark and I will now take any questions you may have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : So I guess, the question, just looking forward into 2015 and trying to get a sense for -- there's a lot of moving parts and just trying to get a sense for how aggressive your underlying plan is for next year. So if I kind of think about headwinds and tailwinds this year, probably the biggest hurdle was that gross margins came in below expectations. And even though you had sales softer than expected in nonseasonal, now in the food channel and you've had some softness in the export business, the biggest sort of hurdle from an earnings perspective was gross margins coming in below expectations. So can you just kind of frame for us, as you think about high end, low end of your guidance range for next year, some of the puts and takes that are important in terms of getting you to the top end versus the low end and whether this guide for '15 maybe has some more flexibility or some more caution into it than maybe what you were looking at when you started '14? David W. Tacka: Okay. Well, Bryan, I'll start with that. When we look at the gross margin and the issues for this year, the biggest issue really wound up being around our commodities and the dairy costs and we've really addressed that with our pricing action that we've taken. In addition, we did, here in this quarter, have some additional issues around some obsolescence things and we'll be able to fix those. I mean, essentially, we didn't adjust to some of our production schedules as quickly as we probably should have in light of how the sales were changing. So fundamentally, overall, we continue to be on track with our productivity initiatives, and so we expect that we'll be able to continue to improve gross margin in 2015 and stay true to our business model where the margin will also increase enough to be able to be increasing our advertising faster than our sales growth next year, which is part of our plan to support the price increase. John P. Bilbrey: Bryan, I would just add to what Dave said that I think one of the learnings we have from this year is really around how we executed by channel and some of the specificity of what we were seeing in channel. So I think from -- if I were able to change one thing this year, would really be around our quality merch on a channel-specific basis. So we're going to be doing more precision marketing as we go forward. And what you saw in the third quarter is the place is based on planning cycles where we were able to do that as we knew we were going to sequentially improve through the year in North America. We saw good results from doing that. So I think you'll see us ensuring that we're getting the right merchandising levels by channel to be able to win in the marketplace. Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : So is it fair to say, as we kind of look into '15, that your plan doesn't assume that there is going to be a real imminent reacceleration of growth in the food channel? You're still expecting that the export business in the next year will be soft. I guess you're expecting gross margins will expand, but it's -- you're not -- some of these issues that sort of have hit you, especially in the second half this year, it's not like you're expecting an immediate reacceleration incorporated in the guidance that you gave us. John P. Bilbrey: No, I think the things that are in our control, we will be doing what I hope to be a better job of making sure that we've got the right support by channel to continue to win share, which we're doing that. I think there's caution globally around just the consumer environment in general. So there's probably some of that in our thinking, but I think we'll be executing very aggressively. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Athlos Research. Jonathan Patrick Feeney - Athlos Research LLC : So I guess following up a little bit. So if I read you right, you have 4.5% to 6.5% organic net sales growth for next year, which, if I'm getting the -- and correct me if I'm wrong here, if I'm getting the price contribution, if I look at the list price, the region that's in, that's essentially looking for no volume growth for next year? And the last time you implemented a price increase, you did see volumes drop off, as to be expected, but maybe a little bit less substantially. I guess, in light of a little bit better consumer spending situation now than in, say, 2011, if you could just -- first of all, let me know if I have my math right about that for 2015, and I guess, a little bit more detail on why that is. David W. Tacka: Yes, I think as you think about 2015, what I tried to point out in the comments is that we're doing some product line changes in India that have about 40 basis points headwind into the sales growth. So I think overall, in organic, without that, we would still expect to be in about that 5% to 7% range. And so I think for next year, what we're looking at is we're looking at price to be about 6.5%, and we're probably -- depending on how the sell-through and the conversions go, we would expect to have volume declines against that of somewhere from 0% to 2%. And of course, we would be being helped with that with some of the innovation and with the advertising and the other things that we would be typically doing to respond to the price increase. Jonathan Patrick Feeney - Athlos Research LLC : Got you. And I guess that leads into -- the last time you took a big price increase in '11, '12, you raised ad spending over that period pretty dramatically, yet -- I mean, relative to sales. But that was off a much lower base and we've talked about how maybe you're at a more sustainable level now. Do you -- would you see ad spending as a percent of sales growing next year? John P. Bilbrey: Well, I think that what you would see is that we'll continue to probably spend in a range of, call it, 2x sales growth. If you remember, when we were growing advertising in the previous price increase, it was off of a very low base. As you point out, we feel as though, at our current level of spending, we're probably at the right level to support the brand. So we always model these at about a 1 :1 ratio. That's how we've modeled this one. We've done better in some of these, but that's how we model it and that's how we build it into our plan. Jonathan Patrick Feeney - Athlos Research LLC : And just one last, detailed question. That little impairment you took, what brand was that? Or what region did that come from at least? David W. Tacka: What -- we have to do impairment tests on our intangibles each year and this is particularly related to the Mauna Loa macadamia nut brand. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : You hinted that Hershey will be pushing back against the competitive in-store merchandising you're seeing, particularly in C-store channels and particularly with the instant consumables. There was king-size display activity you said you're rolling out, your limited editions. How would you say this incremental merchandising is working for you so far? John P. Bilbrey: Yes, I think we're very pleased with the results we got in both 3Q in C-stores. We saw it in Mass and a couple of other channels where we were able to increase our quality merch. We got really good results. The planning cycles there and our ability to respond are shorter than some of the other channels. So if we go back and analyze the first half of the year and some of the areas where, frankly, we -- you could say we got beat or we didn't merchandise at the levels we thought we should, we didn't get the results we wanted. And so we're really correcting for that and we felt really good about the results we were able to get. And so we're building that into our plans going forward. And then of course, as you know, in the first half, we weren't as chocolate-driven as we are in the second half and that's made a difference as well. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : And one final question. On the resealable pouches, it seems that Hershey, over several years here, has been rolling out the -- that pouch-packaged Minis and Pieces and putting some advertising and merchandising activity behind that per brand. York has been the most recent benefit of this. Do you see that packaging rollout continuing to hit more and more of your business? Or is that benefit perhaps running its course as you get across the brands? John P. Bilbrey: Well, I think one way to think about it is we see package innovation that can support occasions as a really important insight. So I think what you'll see from us is that we have a number of package innovations that we're testing and looking at that we -- we're pretty excited about. So yes, the pouches have been successful for us. It gets good price realization on the sizes, and it gets us into some places we haven't been, and we're going to continue to pursue some of those innovations. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank. Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : A couple of questions. I guess, a year ago, you raised your long-term growth target on the bottom line and a lot of things have gone against you since then. Now you're kind of not surprisingly kind of suggesting that the global markets, emerging markets are a bit more challenging, but you've got a lot of incremental, let's say, EBIT coming from those emerging markets if you, in fact, make your, call it, 10-plus percent margin goals. And so I'm kind of wondering how that all fits together, granted it's like a 2017 question. But is that -- are there things at risk here given that international is that much more challenging and that's a pretty big part of what grows your EBIT over the next couple of years? David W. Tacka: Well, I think where we're at, Eric, is our goal continues to be to get to the 10% level in international. And as things sit in 2014, our biggest issue was really around the commodities and then some other costs that sat in the gross margin that I talked about earlier. I think we've taken steps to get those into line. With respect to the international growth, our China business continues to do very well. You're right, we're a little bit behind where we were tracking as we wanted to do that with respect to India and Latin America. So we may be a little bit later depending on the levels of investment that we continue to make and how we're able to kind of work through those couple of markets. But overall, I don't see any of those as being big risks to the overall corporate targets that we expect to hit in 2017. Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. And if I can just -- one follow-up. I think it's on -- maybe kind of following up on Bryan's question earlier in 2015. It seems like the one input that you can't really control is dairy and some -- there have been some players in the market who have suggested that dairy may come down. Others are less optimistic. Kind of how are you thinking about dairy costs into next year and in your plans for gross margins being up next year, have you basically assumed that dairy kind of remains where it is? Or did you expect some possible benefit in that? David W. Tacka: Well, I guess, I don't want to really get into our specific view of individual market -- of individual commodities, but what I would say is we've taken our best shot at what we believe the market would do. And also, I alluded a bit earlier in the inventory discussion that we have taken on a little bit of additional inventory and some of that is also to help us with our dairy cost visibility for next year. So we think we've taken our best shot at where we're at, but you're right, there'll be an element of risk to that as we go through 2015. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Just as we think out to 2015, a key part, obviously, of your sales growth will be a category returning back to that sort of historic 3% to 4% level that you mentioned in the prepared remarks. In the third quarter, I guess, the CMG category seemed, from your numbers, to decelerate sequentially, even when you exclude the gum portion. And that was with, I think, some incremental activity in innovation and whatnot that you brought to the market in the third quarter. I'm just trying to get a sense, what drove that? And obviously, what bends the trend, as you see it, to get back to a 3% to 4% category growth rate next year? And then I've just got a follow-up. Mark K. Pogharian: Yes. Andrew, before J.P. jumps in, I don't know if you're looking at Q2 or year-to-date, but Q2 certainly would've been impacted by the late Easter. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Right. I think I was comparing 3Q versus the first half that you talked about on your second quarter conference call. The overall category sequentially decelerated in the third quarter from the first half level. John P. Bilbrey: Well, if I look at 3Q, I think what we're saying for CMG was up about 1.6 points. If you look at us, we were up about 3.3 points. So I think that... Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division : And I'm talking about category here. John P. Bilbrey: Yes, yes, that's what I was talking -- yes, that's what I'm referring to there. If you look at chocolate in particular, it was about 2 to 3 for the category, we were at about 3. So again, I think one of the key differences for us was really around the acceleration of merchandising and winning in the store every day. We had a bit of a different lag in the food channel and a lot of that was that we didn't -- we weren't able to get into the planning to be able to get the kind of incremental coverage and merchandising that we did in the other channels. So I think that was a key difference. There was a difference in trips and so on, some of the everyday items. One of the things that we're observing is as you look at advertising effectiveness when you have trips that decline, that instant consumable piece of your business also doesn't have the same effectiveness as it would before. So it's really important for us to be able to get the right merchandising to get those brands to be responsive as well. So I think all of those things are happening. I think on the good news side, for snacking in general, there's elements of that in total, which I think continues to do very well. Consumers continue to eat on the go. They're looking for different alternatives there. So we continue to be very optimistic from that standpoint. I think our view is that we just have to execute well on a by-channel basis, maybe better more so than we have -- did in the first half. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Got it. And then one last one. It looks like, at least by my quick math, you need about 100 basis points of gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter to hit the down 75 basis point gross margin look for the year. Is that just a combination of a little bit of the pricing kicking in and lapping some of the higher sort of incremental costs from last year? And is that... David W. Tacka: I think you've got it pretty well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Two questions. First, just to come back to gross margins. I definitely appreciate that dairy stayed higher for longer than anticipated and that creates some challenges when volumes are weak and you're waiting -- and pricing is such a structured process. I guess what I'm wondering is, when you run into problems meeting your gross margin target due to sort of persistent higher prices in a discrete commodity, does this call into question whether you maybe should be pursuing more aggressive productivity initiatives on an ongoing basis so you have greater flexibility to work through discrete issues like this as they arise? David W. Tacka: Well, I mean, I think that our productivity efforts -- our goal is to try to be getting as much out of them as we're able to. So to hold a little bit in reserve in case we miss the commodity guesses or the commodity forecasts probably isn't how we would really like to operate. We certainly push forward and we certainly did, in 2014, put additional focus into productivity. We've put additional focus into SG&A discipline, and we also took a closer look at our DME. So I mean, I think we did that across the P&L, but the amounts that we had were just more than we could reasonably deal with this year. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. And so for 2014, just in terms of quantifiable productivity, is that going to end up being higher than what you would've sort of targeted on a long-term basis? David W. Tacka: Well, in terms of if you look at it strictly within gross margin, it's going to be about in line with what we were looking at on a long-term basis. But it actually hurt a bit because of the volume changes, that we weren't able to get quite the level of benefit from some of the productivity things we were implementing. And then similarly, some of the shipping patterns and that around the price increase also had some adverse impacts. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. And then just a follow-up on the C-store trends you highlighted. I just wanted to get your thoughts on the broader consumer environment, the acceleration you saw sequentially. Would you chalk most of that up to an improvement in quality merchandising? Or is there a portion of that, that you would, based on what you observed across the channel, would consider just a macro tailwind from gas prices, something along those lines? John P. Bilbrey: Well, to talk about gas prices, we tend not to try to allow fuel costs get into our forecast, if -- we've seen a lot of different things happen over the years. When fuel prices were really high, sometimes you saw that the consumer put half a tank of gas in and they still went inside the store, and in some instances, we benefited from that. With gas prices being lower, you could say that we benefit because people aren't spending as much at the pump and they're going inside. So we actually don't try to derive too much from the cost of fuel. We really look at what's happening from traffic. So I think you continue to have a bifurcation of the consumer. I think the people at the top, if you will, are experiencing what I would call more normal kinds of times and habits and then I think you have folks that have kind of adjusted to their circumstances. So they may not necessarily have the job they want but they have one but yet they recognize this is how things are going to be and they've adjusted for that. So you see promotion effectiveness being lower from a price standpoint because people don't necessarily always have the cash to buy forward and take advantage of that or they believe something will be on sale at some point in time. So a lot of the things you've heard discussed in the CPG space, we certainly see as well. The big thing for us is really being in front of the consumer, making sure our instant consumable piece of the business is working hard for us. Consumers have costs that they didn't have before. The good news is health care is available but yet that's a cost maybe some people didn't have before. We all saw the impact of SNAP and we've also seen fewer trips, but yet, the good news is basket size seems to be holding up, and in some cases, growing. So I think we're just going to have to continue to work our way through here. So I'm not sure we have a lot of new insights to add, but we're certainly seeing a lot of things we're hearing our peers talk about as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi. David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : First off, just an observation. For a company that's growing its EPS at 8%, several hundred basis points above the group, this is one of the tougher years that I've seen from you guys, just given these fairly constant reductions in both the revenues and the gross margins outlook. I think Bryan nailed it when he asked you guys what's your confidence in 2015. And J.P., if I could just push you a little bit on this thing, do you have real fundamental confidence that the outlook has a robust nature enough such that we're not going to be going through this every quarter? There's margin problems, revenue problems, that we're not on the bleeding edge of the forecast. Can I just start there? And I mean, it's the #1 question we're getting from everybody this morning. John P. Bilbrey: Yes -- no, David, I'm optimistic about our business model. I don't think there's anything fundamentally wrong. Obviously, we learn. We have to adapt. You can't do the same thing forever and expect to continue to win. But I think the visibility we have on our brands, the things we're working with retailers, I feel good about. Even though we've talked about the export markets, look, those are prudent business decisions. I mean, we could have pushed into some of those businesses, but you put at risk what your results will be then following from that. So I think we're being wise and prudent around some of those things we can't see around the corner well on. But the things that are within our control, I think we have good plans. I think we've got a ton of runway and our strategies were, I'll call it, doubling down on China, if you will, in terms of what we think is possible there. So I feel good about things. And I think that we want to give ourselves some space here that we don't have surprises. We've got good visibility, I think, as best we can in terms of commodities. I'm glad to see that milk prices have -- dairy has softened some here. But I don't know if that's short term, long term, but we'll sure take it while we've got it. And from a cocoa standpoint, we've had a little bit of easing there. So there's some of the things on the cost side are good. We're rigorously looking at our operations all the time in terms of where we can find productivity and yet we continue to -- we're at a historic point in time for the company where we're investing in our future. So I'm not going to be overly concerned with a quarter that we may not be hitting our long-term aspirations but, boy, I believe that we're in a very good place in terms of the company's long-term outlook and potential, and we're going to continue to execute against that. David W. Tacka: David, what I would add is as we look at '15 versus '14 gross margin, yes, I think we had some issues in '14 and really the persistent dairy cost and not adjusting quickly enough to some of the volume changes put some costs in there that I think we've taken steps to address. So I think we're rightly positioned for 2015. David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Two other quick ones. On the fourth quarter revenue build, I think the implied organic number is somewhere around 4.5%, and I think it should be kind of mostly price. But first off, do I have that right? And is that an actual deceleration from where the organic growth was in the third quarter? If so, can you just talk about the kind of the pressures quarter-to-quarter? I don't mean to be too crazy about this, but Andrew, again, another good question, trying to just get an understanding on the sequential movements and if there's a softening into Q4. I think it deserves maybe just a little bit of explanation. David W. Tacka: Yes, I mean, I think the -- excluding the Shanghai Golden Monkey, the fourth quarter growth that's implied is around the 4%. And so within that, we are expecting about 5% of price. David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : And then comparison to 3Q, I mean, do you see it softening a little bit? David W. Tacka: Well, I think what we've said is in the fourth quarter, given the export and some of the softness in the food channel, that, that's kind of the thing that's been taking down the -- it is the reason that we took down the full year guidance. David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. Final question. The inventory obsolescence charges, quite honestly, I had kind of hoped to never hear those words again on your calls. I had the visions of the 2005 and '06 periods when all those limited editions were being -- inventory obsolescence charges that seem to never end. Is this a minor issue? Is this just some planning that went on in the -- or I think you mentioned changeovers or you didn't respond quick enough. Is this inventory obsolescence issue that you called out for the quarter, is that something that spills into Q4 and Q1 of next year? Or is it pretty much wrapped up here? David W. Tacka: There could be a little that would carry over into Q4, but it won't carry beyond that. John P. Bilbrey: Yes, it's very internal, David. It's not a marketplace issue at all. David W. Tacka: Right. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : I'll keep my questions to one question. Shanghai Golden Monkey, I believe when you closed the deal, you said it was $205 million in sales in 2013 and that appears to be the forecast for '15 as well. I think when you originally announced it, the expectation was that it would be $225 million. I'm just trying to really understand why the reduction in the size of sales and why no growth expected for 2015, unless I'm getting my math wrong. And then maybe how are you integrating the business? David W. Tacka: Well, yes, I think there's probably 2 things as you go through that. First, as we started on this, there was -- there's some adjustments between sort of how they keep their accounting in U.S. GAAP that had a little bit of impact in terms of where the sales were. But then in addition to that, just as we're basically working to be generating the synergies and actually take over the business, there's just some changes in the business that caused us to just want to make sure we're being cautious in terms of how we're defining how we get started. Because in terms of working with the distributors and how we're working with what products will be sold in what channel, what of our stuff is going to be through Golden Monkey's channels and what of theirs through ours. Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Are you rationalizing the SKU count? Are you reducing inventory... David W. Tacka: There is some of that also. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Just made the cut here, so I'll be very brief. The first will be in a bit of a follow-up to the fourth quarter. And really, as we look through the year, you did talk about some sales pulled forward into the third quarter. Does that mean those come out of the fourth quarter, if you will? I think related to that, or in addition to that, would be what your FX assumption is for the year, if I could, please. David W. Tacka: Well, with respect to the first, our -- the guidance, as we're talking about it, reflects the shift between the third and the fourth quarter. So that's really reflected in terms of what we're talking about going forward. And then secondly, with respect to FX, we're probably looking at about a half, 50 basis points for the full year, and it's pretty much in line with what we had forecast. We forecasted it to be heavier in the first half and lighter in the second half. Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. And then if I could, just one follow-up. Dave, in relation to dairy costs and I know those are high, but they were really trending higher in the fourth quarter of last year. Based on that degree of pricing you're coming through -- or expected to come through in the fourth quarter, it would seem like you could offset your cost inflation in the fourth quarter. Would that be an accurate assumption? David W. Tacka: Yes. I mean, we're expecting to see gross margin increase in the fourth quarter versus last year. Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : And then hopefully you'll be able to overcome costs, okay. David W. Tacka: Yes, yes. Mark K. Pogharian: All right. Thank you for joining us for today's conference call and the Investor Relations group will be available for any follow-up calls you may have. Operator : That does conclude today's conference.

Bernstein & Company, Inc. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank David Driscoll - Citigroup Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus Ken Zaslow - Bank of Montreal Operator : Good morning. My name is Phyllis and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Hershey Company's Fourth Quarter and Year End 2014 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Mark Pogharian, you may begin your conference. Mark Pogharian : Thank you, Phyllis. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to The Hershey Company's fourth quarter 2014 conference call. J.P. Bilbrey, President and CEO and Bert Alfonso, President International and Head of Mergers & Acquisitions will provide you with an overview of our results followed by a Q&A session. Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2013 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the Notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. As a result, we will discuss 2014 fourth quarter results, excluding net pretax charges of $32.5 million or $0.30 per share diluted primarily related to a noncash trademark impairment charge and loss on disposal of $24.8 million or $0.10 per share diluted and business realignment cost of $4.7 million or $0.02 per share diluted. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges. With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey. John Bilbrey : Good morning all of you on the phone and webcast. In 2014, Hershey made progress against its strategic initiatives. U.S. CMG, xAOC+C market share reached 31.4% up 0.3 share points versus last year. We acquired Shanghai Golden Monkey which more than doubles the company\u2019s presence in China. We expanded into snacks and adjacencies with the launch of Hershey Spreads and the related Snacksters Graham Dippers. And we sourced 30% of our cocoa needs from certified and sustainable cocoa farms, putting us in a solid position to deliver on our 100% goal by 2020. There are also challenges. In 2014 we believe lower retail store traffic, changes in consumer spending patterns as a result of the SNAP program and a more competitive snacking environment for contributing factors that impacted how consumers participated in the snack segment. This resulted in fourth quarter and full year sales and earnings that were below our expectations. Specifically, growth in snacking alternatives and an evolving retail landscape are impacting what consumers buy and where and how they make purchases. Higher income consumers continue to ask for simple ingredients, health and wellness, and millennials view brands and brand attributes beyond traditional transparency to include social responsibility. They are also interacting with media differently. Now let me share with your some of the things that we're doing to address this. Our R&D and innovation teams continue to make progress on new confectionary and snack products that enable us to offer great confectionary products and increase the breadth of our portfolio. Later this year, the Club channel will be introducing Brookside, dark chocolate, fruit and nut snack bars. Building on our snacks and adjacencies strategy, earlier today we announced that we entered into an agreement to acquire Krave Jerky, which enables us to enter the rapidly growing meat snacks category. We are really excited about this acquisition and the opportunity to participate in the 2.5 billion meat snacks category that's growing at a double digit rate. While snacks and adjacencies is a lever in our long term sales algorithm, we are very focused on confectionary. It's who we are and it's our name sake. We have a lot of CMG innovation this year that I'll talk to in a moment. But we also have a meaningful new product pipeline that gives me confidence that innovation can continue to contribute at least one point of growth to our net sales algorithm on an annual basis. So I remain bullish on the CMG category and our ability to keep increasing market share. As it relates to simple ingredient and transparency, we've actually done a lot of work here. We have at leverage what we've done as our plan is to move a large portion of our portfolio in this direction. We are building the capability and have made progress to source non-GMO sugar and RSBT free milk for products in the United States. We've already begin this work with key sourcing suppliers here in the U.S. and we\u2019ll have more news on this later in the year. On the media front, we expect that advertising and related consumer promotion will increase at a rate greater than sales. Included in this is a greater proportion of investment in digital advertising on programs, consumers view on their mobile devices via traditional networks, user generated content and sources like BuzzFeed. So we are making investments that will benefit the company in the near and long term. And we'll have more on this at CAGNY, so let\u2019s move on. I was satisfied with improved results in the convenience store, large mass retail, and dollar store channels especially in the second half of the year. However, FDMx non-seasonal candy performance was not inline with our initial plans. Lower retail store traffic, greater levels of in-store activity by broader snacking manufacturers and continued economic challenges for a segment of consumers in these channels impacted our non seasonal candy growth. Looking at total xAOC+C store retail takeaway, U.S. marketplace performance sequentially improved throughout the year. Hershey fourth quarter retail takeaway of 3.8% was greater than the category growth of 2.2% resulting in a market share gain of 0.5 points. Marketplace performance was greater than 4Q net sales given solid Halloween and Holiday sales, a portion of which shift in the third quarter. The timing of the buy-in related to the price increase as a portion of third quarter net sales would have normally occurred in the fourth quarter. And that lapping of the strong year ago period when select retailers increased inventory levels. Driving our fourth quarter takeaway results were improvements in convenience stores, large mass retail and dollars stores. These were the channels where many of our second half initiatives were focused, so I was pleased with the results. The programming and execution changes we made in the FDMX and Club channel simply required a longer lead time to impact in-store merchandizing activity. Hence our sales mix and lower than forecast category growth impacted profitability and margins. Let me now talk about 2015 where our focus will be on restoring our U.S. momentum. We have a solid line-up of new products that will bring variety, news and excitement to the category. In addition to the carryover benefit of Brookside Crunchy Clusters and Reese's Spreads, we're also launching Kit Kat White Minis Hershey\u2019s Caramels, Ice Breakers Cool Blasts Chews, Reese\u2019s Spreads Snacksters Graham Dippers and some other yet to be announced new products. Additionally, the Reese\u2019s brand is leveraging its NCAA relationship and is becoming the official sponsor of ESPN College Football Game Day. These initiatives are tied into customers, specific merchandizing programs and big core brands that should result in higher quality merchandizing versus last year. Additionally, we're increasing our reach as we're adding incremental headcount to our sales force that will result in hours in store being up mid single digits. We'll complement this with increased levels of advertising that I mentioned earlier. We believe the investments we're making across our business, positions us for future growth. The dynamics of the confectionary category, impulsivity, conversion rate of check-outs, season, multiple pack types are all an advantage. As a result, in 2015 we anticipate that the plans we have in place will help mitigate the volume elasticity related to the price increase and it will outpace the category and again, gain market share. Let me now provide you with some information on our international business. For the full year, our international net sales increased nearly 15%, including the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates and positive contribution of about $54 million for Shanghai Golden Monkey. Excluding SGM and unfavorable FX, international net sales increased 10%, a solid number, but less than our expectations due to macroeconomic headwinds that have yet to subside and will most likely remain a challenge this year. The Hershey Golden Monkey integration work is underway and on track. In 2015 we will distribute acquired confectionary and protein based bean curd snacks into the China modern trade and we expect to have deeper Tier 2 city coverage of some Hershey chocolate products. We're also leveraging newly acquired manufacturing capabilities. In China, Brazil, Mexico and India we've made solid progress against our planned initiative of investing in go-to-market capabilities and portfolio expansion. In select markets, we launched Reese's and is off to a good start. Additionally, we're testing additional products as we look to build out global brands over the next few years. Therefore in 2015, including a negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates and excluding the impact of M&A, we expect international net sales growth to increase around 10%. Including SGM, reported international net sales are expected to be around $1.2 billion by the end of 2015. By country, our chocolate business in China had a solid year. Chocolate category growth in 2014 was about 12%. Historically the chocolate category has increased 10% to 11% in the fourth quarter. However, it's slowed to around 8% as we see less gifting behind the Government policy changes. Hershey fourth quarter retail takeaway of about 20% was less than our expectation. Importantly, our market share in Q4 increased a full point to around 11%. In Mexico, chocolate category growth in the modern trade in 2014 was around 1%. The category and consumer struggled during the year although trends were better in the second half of the year with chocolate category growth of 3%, but this is still below the historical growth rate of 7% to 8%. Hershey Mexico chocolate retail takeaway for the year was up around 2%, resulting in a market share gain of 0.3 points. We expect 2015 to be better than last year albeit in a continuing challenging environment. Our performance in Brazil has sequentially improved as the year progressed. For the year Brazil chocolate growth was 1% versus about 5% in recent years. Hershey retail takeaway was up 2%. Our performance was driven by our Hershey tablet bar growth and the launch of Reese's. We look to build on this in 2015. Now to wrap up, our consumer and customer plans as well as our investment profile for 2015, clearly reflect the learnings from 2014. Our plans are focused and the investment profile was concentrated in the areas to leverage Hershey's advantage brands and go to market strength. Investment in our brands, innovation and capabilities as well as an increase across all channels and merchandizing and programming, positions the company to compete effectively in confectionary and across the broader snack continuum. We believe these investments should generate organic net sales growth or constant currency sales, excluding M&A and FX impacts of around 4% to 6% in 2015. This is less than our previous estimate and reflects the macroeconomic headwinds in international markets and the slowly improving U.S. non-seasonal trends. I typically just talked to net sales with and without M&A however, when we established our long-term sales target, we didn't anticipate the U.S. dollar being this strong. Given the current backdrop, we expect foreign exchange rates to be greater than our previous estimate and be about one percentage point unfavorable in 2015. We estimate that the net contribution for acquisitions and divestitures will be around 2.5 points. We continue to focus on growth initiatives and margin opportunities behind continuous productivity improvement initiatives. With the conclusion of the Project Next Century program, in 2015 we'll focus on with the next largest opportunities are for future incremental productivity and cost savings. A portion of any particular savings from this assessment would be reinvested in our CMG and snacks business to accelerate our growth and we'll provide more information on this at the upcoming CAGNY Conference. I'll now turn it over to Bert, who will provide some additional detail on our financial results. Bert? Bert Alfonso : Well thank you JP and good morning, to everyone. It's a pleasure to be here to talk about our results as well as some of the recent M&A activity. As Mark mentioned, I've been very close to all of this as I have responsibility for the M&A function as well as our international segment. So let's get started. Fourth quarter net sales of $2 billion increased 2.7% versus last year, generating adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.04, an increase of 20.9%. As JP stated, the sales increase was lower than our expectations, primarily due to lower retail store traffic. Net price realization, mostly in the U.S., was a 3.1 point benefit. Excluding Shanghai Golden Monkey, volume was off 2.3 points due to price elasticity associated with the U.S. price increase announced in July and lower than expected non-seasonal sales. The Shanghai Golden Monkey acquisition was a 2.7 point benefit and foreign currency was a 0.8 point headwind. Q4 U.S. seasonal sales primarily driven by holiday increased high single digits on a percentage basis versus last year. Full year seasonal sales were a bit higher given a later Easter in 2014. Conversely Easter is 15 days shorter in 2015 and will be a headwind this year. From a market place perspective, our Halloween and holiday market share increased 0.9 points and 1.1 points respectively. International net sales in the fourth quarter, increased 28% including a benefit of about $54 million related to the Shanghai Golden Monkey acquisition. Excluding Shanghai Golden Monkey, international net sales increased 8% as reported and 11% on a constant currency basis as unfavorable FX was greater than anticipated. Macroeconomic headwinds in Q4 led to international sales being lower than our expectations. Turning to margins, fourth quarter adjusted gross margin increased by 30 basis points. The increase is driven by net price realization, slightly favorable input cost and supply chain productivity, partially offset by unfavorable sales mix and other supply chain costs. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT increased 17.5% versus last year, generating an adjusted EBIT margin of 18.7%, a 240 basis point increase versus last year. The increase was due to the higher gross margin and lower SM&A cost that declined about 5% due primarily to lower employee related costs. In Q4, advertising was up about the same as last year and as we said throughout the year, advertising GRPs were up mid single digits on a percentage basis versus 2013. Now let me provide a bit more detail on our international business. China continues to drive international net sales growth and excluding Shanghai Golden Monkey increased about 35% in both the fourth quarter and for the full year. We anticipate a similar profile in 2015. I'm very pleased with the progress we continue to make in China and remain optimistic regarding confectionery growth in both the modern and traditional trade. We'll continue to expand our selling capabilities and expect growth in 2015 to be balanced between velocity and distribution games. We will also expand cross-selling of products between Shanghai Golden Monkey and Hershey China in the coming year. And finally we were very pleased with our 1.6 point share gain in chocolate in 2014. In Brazil, Q4 net sales were about the same as last year on a reported basis, an increase about 12% on a constant currency basis. For the full year, net sales declined about 3% on a reported basis and increased about 7% on a constant currency basis versus last year. Despite the difficult category environment, we were pleased with a small share gain of 0.1 points. In 2015, we're exploring other go-to-market options together with our current JV Partner Bauducco. Our distribution JV with Bauducco has enabled us to double our market share in the last few years. However, we are considering having total control over the selling and distribution function to give us more flexibility and investment options. In Mexico, fourth quarter net sales declined 6% on a reported basis and were flat on a constant currency basis versus last year. For the full year, net sales declined to 8% on a reported basis and 4% on a constant currency basis compared to 2013. Again our chocolate performance is favorable with a 0.3 point share gain driven by both velocity and distribution gains. Trends in Mexico are getting better and we expect continued improvement throughout 2015, although still below the historical growth rates. We\u2019ve made solid progress against our international strategic plans. We remain committed to our core markets and we\u2019ll continue to make the necessary investments to build distribution capability, brand equity, and drive trial and repeat purchases. Moving down to P&L, the fourth quarter interest expense is $21 million, was about the same as last year. The before year interest expense was $85 million and in line with our expectations. And for 2015, we expect interest expense to be $75 million to $80 million. The adjusted rate for fourth quarter and the full year was 34.5% in line with our estimates. In 2015, we expect the adjusted tax rate to be similar to last year. In the fourth quarter, with average shares outstanding on a diluted basis, we're approximately $223.5 million, we need to adjust earnings per share $1.4, an increase of 20.9%. Full year adjusted EBIT increased 5.8% versus last year, generating an adjusted EBIT margin of 19.6% or a 40 basis point increase. The increase was driven by lower SG&A. Turning now to the balance sheet and to our cash flow. At the end of the fourth quarter, net trading capital increased versus last year's fourth quarter by $240 million. The cash receivable was higher by $119 million primarily due the Shanghai Golden Monkey acquisition, Lotte China consolidation and traditional credit terms provided to our largest customers in China. Inventory was higher by $141 million to the Shanghai Golden Monkey in Lotte, as well as higher raw material inventory levels, primarily dairy that we mentioned in the last quarter. And accounts payable increased by $21 million. Capital additions including software were $139 million in the fourth quarter and $379 million for the full year in line with our expectations. This included capital related to our manufacturing facility that we're building in Johor, Malaysia. In 2015, we expect CapEx to be in a $375 million to $400 million range. The company repurchased 2 million outstanding shares in the fourth quarter and 202 million for the full year. Repurchases of 125 million were against the prior authorization and 77 million were against the current 250 million repurchased authorization approved in February of 2014. In addition, 32 million of common shares were repurchased in Q4 to replace shares issued in connection with the exercises of stock options. Depreciation and amortization was $59 million in the fourth quarter and $212 million for the full year in line with expectations. Dividends paid during the quarter were $115 million and $440 million for the full year. Cash and short term investments at the end of the fourth quarter were $471 million slightly below our expectations due to the lower sales. The company remains well positioned to fund our dividends, working capital, capital expenditure requirements and acquisitions. Let me close by providing context into our 2015 outlook. As J.P. summarized in 2015 we have a solid pipeline of target innovation, merchandising and programming that can drive pack type and channel growth. In addition, advertising related to consumer marketing expense is expected to increase at a rate greater than net sales growth. As a result, we expect 2015 net sales to increase from 5.5% to 7.5% including the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, and a net contribution from acquisitions and divestitures of about 2.5 points. This includes the acquisition of Shanghai Golden Monkey and Allan Candy that closed in the fourth quarter, as well as the agreement entered into over the last month to acquire Krave Jerky and divested Mauna Loa. We expect the Krave and Mauna Loa transactions to close in the first quarter. Excluding that acquisitions and divestitures, sales are expected to increase 3% to 5%. This is lower than our previous estimate due to the continued macroeconomic headwinds as well as greater than initial estimates related to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. And we expect foreign exchange impact to be greater than our previous estimate and have an unfavorable impact of approximately one percentage point on our full year net sales growth. We continue to have a significant focus on gross margin and expect the previously announced pricing action, as well as productivity and cost savings to result in 2015 gross margin expansion of 135 to 145 basis points. Adjusted earnings per share diluted are expected to increase 8% to 10% and that includes dilution from acquisitions and divestitures of $0.03 to $0.05 per share. Before we open it up for Q&A, just a couple of thoughts on the first quarter. Remember that Easter is two weeks shorter this year and being sold in at the old price points which will pressure gross margin. Our international sales profile is similar to prior years with annual growth primarily driven by second half. Therefore total first quarter net sales including M&A are expected to be around the low end of our annual sales target. Additionally, brand building as well as investments and selling capabilities will ramp up in Q1. Given all these moving parts, EPS growth is expected to be pressured in the first quarter and higher as the year progresses. I thank you for your time this morning, and will now take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. John Baumgartner : J.P., did I hear correctly about a sales force increase in 2015? John Bilbrey : If you think about the total investment we're making on our go-to-market strategy both in international as well as North America, the U.S. will continue to invest in hours for store in our sales organization. Then of course in China we've been talking about a geographic expansion there. So it requires a broader go-to-market strategy. So yes, we are really investing again in our go-to-market capabilities. John Baumgartner : So just digging deeper in the US increase, is it in terms of just why now. Is it more of a sense the competitive environment is maybe shifting beyond your current capabilities? Or is it more related to shifts in channel shopping by consumers and the irregularities there? John Bilbrey : Well I think the biggest driver for us is, we look at 2014 in a competitive nature of merchandising and being in the right place and being able to responsive. We really see that as always being one of our core advantages and we continue to believe that. We're going to invest in those resources at retail. John Baumgartner : Thanks J.P. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : So I had a question about as we're looking into next year and the parts of the revenue, the drags on revenue relative to target right now, aside from FX, are the non-seasonal, confections business in the US. And the international, collectively, the international business is below long-term targets. So if you could talk about first, on the non-seasonal business, are you seeing any sequential improvement in January or so far year-to-date, just simply because you've got some pressure? Gas prices are lower, jobless numbers that look better. Just any insights into how non-seasonal is maybe tracking as you moved into the first quarter. John Bilbrey : Sure. There's a couple of things and we\u2019re encouraged with some of the things we're seeing as we deconstruct the weekly data. So you\u2019re correct, the non-seasonal FDMx sales has been the biggest drag in our business. So we feel good about the fact, the fourth quarter we saw improvement we continue to grow ahead of the category and it was really a result that we think improve focus on merchandising in specific channels. In FDMx it's a slower built there because the planning cycle is also different. But there\u2019s a couple of things that we were seeing, and if we look at the weekly data when you get the most recent quarter, you're going to see that we're making good progression from a share standpoint. We think that reflects some of the changes we made in merchandising. One of the other things that we're seeing is a trips continue to be negative although they are getting better but negative and off course that continues to effect the consumer business, as everyday business, people log into story, you loose that instinct consumable piece. So we are very focused on that. There is a piece of data that I recently looked at for our brand specifically that would in the trip, there is an increase in actual purchase size. So the trips that we're getting purchase side is actually up. But the one caveat I make, keep in mind with the fourth quarter you have some seasonal, so that can be part of it. But in the weekly data, and this is all home scale information, we do have some really encouragement there. So I feel good about what I'm beginning to see anecdotally as you talked to retailers, I would say that I\u2019m hearing some of those same kinds of sentiments echoed. And then of course we all are aware that the consumers had a lot of pressure at the bottom of the economic pyramid and its still yet to be seen how that consumer participates in the market. But for the total, I think I\u2019m encouraged. Bryan Spillane : That's really helpful. And I just wanted to clarify. In terms of the -- your revenue outlook for this year, and actually the gross margin because it's affected by it as well, are you expecting a material improvement both in international or non-seasonal? Or at this point, will an improvement be upside to where the guidance is? Bert Alfonso : You started the questions by started comparing what we were thinking in the third quarter versus more recently. And if you think about the international side, a half of point is really just incremental drag from FX, back then we\u2019re thinking closer to half a point today, we\u2019re firmly at a point and we'll see where that goes, hopefully the dollar starts to stabilize a bit. When we look at international business, we're probably closer to around 13% back than we alluded to 10 as J.P. mentioned. The macro economy has got little tougher in places like Brazil and Mexico. We saw a little bit of slow down in China in the fourth quarter but we worry less about that. We've had a lot of momentum going into Chinese New Year but certainly what J.P. talked about in terms of some pickup on the everyday business and little bit lower expectations at least for 2015 in international is what makes the biggest difference. We also had a little pressure on our export business which while is not huge is very profitable and as you can imagine the currency into some of these markets also has some impact. Bryan Spillane : Thanks, Bert. That's helpful. And again, as we tie that altogether, does the guidance assume that things really improve, or would improvement in both of those areas be upside to where our revenue guidance is? Bert Alfonso : We're hoping for - although we haven't baked it into our plans, gradual improvement. But we would say back half versus first half. Bryan Spillane : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Athlos Research. Jonathan Feeney : So I have three questions, but they're all kind of related. The first is, about what percent of your North American volume do you assume is going to be under the new price increase this year? You mentioned Easter was, and about what percent would that be? Related to that and secondly is, is there some negative mix factor I'm missing that why gross margins would only be up 120 to 130 rough gross margin? When you've got this magnitude of price increase, you're number two commodity dairy is now in free fall, and I know you've bought forward to some extent and that's understandable. But it looks to me like your cost bucket might be flat to down exiting the year. But is there something I'm missing as to why that margin expansion is so small, and how that might pace over the year? And then third and finally, can you give us a sense of what kind of volume you're thinking globally associated with this guidance? So maybe I can understand if there's some deep manufacturing deleverage like we saw in the fourth quarter? Thanks very much. John Bilbrey : Let me take the pricing one first and then let Bert talk a little bit about the gross margin. The best way to think about the pricing is as we move through the year, there is still some activities that are under the old price certainly around the seasonal business. So you\u2019ll begin to see that have a greater impact in Q2 and Q3 and then if you think about getting through the end of 2015, we continue to model the elasticity at about one to one rate in terms of volume and price. So by the time we get to the first quarter of 2016, our modeling would suggest that we\u2019re back to a whole environment or back to 100 in terms of volume contribution to our growth. So that's the way I would think about it broadly. There is a lot of movement still, but as we look at some of our channel modeling, there is nothing that we're seeing that would cause us to believe that it would be any different than how we planned. As you know, when we were increasing advertising in a very rapid rate back in 2008, 2009 and 2011, there might have been a little bit of a faster conversion rate but we think the way we\u2019ve currently model this its probably about right. Bert Alfonso : Let me try to fill your end on your question around gross margin. As we think about our gross margin expansion, we're expecting 135 to 145 basis points. We are coming off the year when we\u2019re actually down at gross margin first time in a long time. We did start to see a pick up in the fourth quarter slightly below what we thought. When you look at our year end year commodities, I won't talk specifically about hedging program but clearly cocoa is still on average at higher prices than it was in our 2014 standard. And that\u2019s really a function of - as we roll out of commodity program in a environment of increasing costs and we've seen cocoa increase pretty dramatically. Obviously, you may have some of the lower hedges rolling off and are buying into little bit higher market. So, while we\u2019ve seen some improvement recently and that\u2019s good. We still have cocoa that's higher than 2014 level. So that does have some, a bit of an impact in terms of how you\u2019re thinking about the expansion. The other thing as J.P. mentioned, our profile for 2015 is driven by pricing. So we are expecting five to six points of pricing and one to two points of lower volume. And that lower volume does pressure our absorption in the plans, and so you don\u2019t get the full benefit of that until as you get later in the year as J.P. mentioned we start to recover the pre price increase volume. So some volume impact doesn\u2019t work through the price of elasticity. And while some commodities are clearly in a better place like dairy, and sugar we do still have higher cocoa prices year-on-year. So that\u2019s helping to mitigate to some degree what might be otherwise larger growth margin expansion. Jonathan Feeney : Great, thank you. And if I could just add one follow-up real quick about the mix. Is there any big mix the factor we ought to know about, whether it's geographic or whether it's in the portfolio? Anything that's really affecting either the present quarter or 2015 that maybe isn't obvious? Bert Alfonso : In the first quarter we certainly have the mix of Easter at the lower or old prices right, because that particular season is still protected. Once you get beyond that, then you have seasons. So if you do have that, and J.P. already talked about the everyday business starting to improve but the more that improves quicker, the better we look on a mix basis. We did have as is already explained, not as good a mix in 2014 as we thought we would just based on the every day. So certainly a first quarter impact on Easter at old prices, and then improving throughout the year as pricing kicks in. Mark Pogharian : Jon its Mark, just one thing so you would expect that we would have the most pricing than in the second and the third quarter and looking at it total company for the full year you\u2019re probably thinking \u2013 think about it as five to six points a price volume of 1.5 to 2 points because most - a lot of the international business is all going to be volume driven and then you got a point of FX so that\u2019s I guess how to think about the full year. Jonathan Feeney : Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein. Alexia Howard : So a couple of quick questions. It was a little alarming to hear about how the candy mint and gum category growth has slowed to about 1.7% in 2014, and how there might be some encroachment from other snacking categories. Are you worried that some of those types of shifts may be more structural I guess? Are you seeing -- are you worried about smaller brands continuing to come up? And then my second question is actually more about the acquisition strategy from here. As you've bought the Krave business and moved very clearly into a very different snacking category, might we see more of those types of moves that you end up bulking up in snack categories that are maybe more in line with where the consumer is heading? Thank you very much. John Bilbrey : Alexia to your first question around the category my answer is no. I don\u2019t think there is anything structural that's going on here. One interesting piece of that is, helpful penetration actually went up through our brands in 2014. And so I think the thing that we\u2019re seeing is potentially several fold. So 2014 there were lot of moving parts in terms of macroeconomic influences on consumers so we see that. The trips piece for business like ours which has this everyday component is certainly an impacted people audience stores. And I think there is a real consumer strata influence there that I think has to be dealt with. Then in terms of let's just talk about the consumers themselves. I do believe there is an evolution always happening with consumers and the relationships they have with brands, I think some of the smaller brands have done a very good job of resonating with some of the on trend things that consumers talk about and we can talk separately about Krave here in a second of why we think that's on trend product uniquely positioned within that particular segment. But as we saw takeaway improved throughout the year, we feel we became a more competitive company, responding to some of the just things that are happening within the category and consumers of course have broader choices. What we see happening almost everywhere though and I'm very optimistic about how this plays to our strengths, is that snacking and snack and portable snacking is not just a short term, this is really a trend and its becoming a habit if you look at the way the number of meals people have during the day, they have broader options on the menu of how to participate that. We just have to be competitive and we have to be competitive with the brands we have that are within the core of the Hershey Company, our confectionary products, we are expending brands like Brookside which have a nice hallow effect of goodness. And then we also see ourselves as we\u2019ve talked about expanding across a broader snacking continuum. And even if you talk - even if you think about China in a brand - our bean curd, in China that\u2019s a product, it brings protein, it's on trend in terms of being a snacking on the go brand. So we just see that being more and more important in terms of consumer trend and so as a company we have to adapt to where the consumer head it. We talked about simple ingredients with GMO. So if you think about a chocolate bar, there is really only four components in a chocolate bar. So we should be talking about the simplicity of that in responding to the transparency that consumers want, and we\u2019re doing that. So I'm very optimistic about all of these things. You set us up nicely to talk about Krave. Michelle Buck who is the President of North America was very, very involved with the acquisition for Krave. She's here so, why don\u2019t I give her a chance to just talk for a couple of minutes about the acquisition. Michelle Buck : Thanks J.P. As J.P. mentioned, we\u2019re seeing consumers continue to snack more and graze throughout the day and as such their snacking need are really evolving. We\u2019re going to be focused as we continue to look at the growth of our company as a snack company and how we meet those needs. One of the areas that we\u2019ve seen a lot of consumer interest in is affordable nutrition and protein-based snacking. So, as we look at that marketplace, clearly one of the categories that's really meeting consumers need is meat snack category that is one of the fastest growing, growing double digit in the U.S. this past year and over the past several years. Household penetration is expanding so household penetration is only up 31% but it continues to grow through two points this past year. So clearly its meeting a lot of consumer needs. And as we look to that category Krave was interesting to us because Krave is really playing in the fastest growing segment of the meat snacks category, the better for you premium segment. So we really like the brand, we think it has tremendous potential, the product preposition has a unique point of difference with a great taste, a texture, it's a culinary inspired kind of profile, and we think that there is a lot of potential as they can continue to bring new consumers into the meat snacks category in the marketplace first to leverage Hershey strengths and supply chain, consumer insights and retail to really drives the business. So we couldn\u2019t be more excited about how it would continue to help us to meet consumer's needs as we stay very focused of course on winning in our categories. John Bilbrey : Alright, we\u2019ll take our next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar : Two quick things. One, J.P., would be -- and maybe you'll cover this a little bit more at CAGNY, but I think it's important just to cover the topic. I certainly appreciate the evolution of where consumers are going, and Hershey's desire to cover off on that a bit more with snacking adjacencies and such. But the last time Hershey did this, albeit in a different set of broader snacking categories, the execution really wasn't where the company wanted it to be. The sustainability of some of those items, whether it was cookies in the C-store, nuts, things like that, weren't exactly I guess as sustainable. So is there something now that is different about capabilities, the way you're planning for these sorts of things whether it's KRAVE or things beyond that that make you feel a lot better about the sustainability of it? And then I've just got a quick follow-up. John Bilbrey : Andrew I think the biggest thing in my mind is the ability for us to execute against I think a clear business model today than we've had in the past. I think that if you look what we\u2019re doing in China and we\u2019re going at a plan for thoughtful to execute against the right R&D, the right distribution, the consumer insights and supporting it with advertising et cetera. I think that\u2019s where we're probably doing a much better job today than we have in the past. And so admittedly not all things work perfectly but I think that we have a clear sense of how we want to execute it against these \u2013 against these things and I expect this to be successful. Andrew Lazar : Thanks for that. And then I certainly understand your thought process around no structural changes to the core CMG category growth rate. Do you think for planning purposes that perhaps the historical 3% to 4% rate as a category in 2015 may prove overly optimistic, or do you think that might still hold for this year as well? John Bilbrey : As we\u2019ve thought about the category we certainly plan to go market share within that category. We think long term, the 3% to 4% growth rate for the category is still the right way to think about it. You know these things are sometimes a bit of up, sometime it's a bit low but as we\u2019ve seen some improvement over the - as I talked earlier about, the quarter and the weeks et cetera, we think that it's still a good planning stand for this year to think about, positive category growth. And the most important thing is that in environment we have to win. Andrew Lazar : Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche. Eric Katzman : A couple of questions. Kind of related to that comment about the category broadly in the U.S. It seems like the premium end of it is gaining some share for RO, Lindt, et cetera. The company, kind of like and snacks years ago, tried to get into premium but wasn't really all that successful. J.P., perhaps you could touch on that, and what that means for the category and your growth within it? John Bilbrey : I think Eric if you look historically the premium as we sort of defined it over time, is somewhere around 7% or 8% of the total category in good economic times it always tends to grow and expand in terms of space, some of that growth is driven by distribution and then in more difficult economic times usually the distribution in category contraction goes along with it. I think what it speaks to in the current environment is the top end of the economic pyramid is fine and the consumer that participates there has the ability to participate. And I also think that part of the category has in many ways a clear message to the consumer also that is around sometime ingredients and so forth. So, I believe that\u2019s what we are seeing more than anything else. I agree with you we have not done a good job in the premium space. We are spending a lot of time right now on how we want to participate in premium, we\u2019re pushing up some within our \u2013 the middle of our portfolio certainly with products like Brookside which takes us up a little bit you\u2019ll see some of the innovation we have this year which will also do that. And then we\u2019re looking stronger our brands like Scharffen Berger and trying to make an effort to see how we can play differently with those brands. So we are not going to ignore that. I think in the past we have not done a good job. We want to reiterate ourselves a bit there and then its still problematic for the consumers are participating in the category. So you will see some category expansion from that space but I think the overall category really will continue to be driven by mass products. Eric Katzman : Okay, thank you for that. And then, Bert, the long-term margin goals for international, obviously, the world has become more volatile, a bit slower, input costs have moved up in certain respects versus when you laid out those goals. Any comments about your ability to still achieve double-digit EBIT margins in international by 2017? Bert Alfonso : We will probably get deeper at CAGNY but I think your point is a good one, we have seen depreciating currency not so much in China even though there we\u2019ve seen slight - that certainly has had an impact. We continue to invest behind the brands because we think we\u2019re in the right top line response. So I always as we think about our margins overseas we could be if you think about 2017, but we think directionally we still in the heading in the right direction, our China margins are very, very close to company average which is our biggest expanding business. And right now we are seeing a blip in our exports and in markets like Brazil. So there is certainly possibly we could be off by a year but I think directionally we are still on path to get what we said as low double digit like by 17, 18 yes. Eric Katzman : Okay. Thanks. I'll pass it off. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi. David Driscoll : Wanted to ask a question here about pricing. I think on the last conference call, you guys discussed 2015 pricing to be up about 6.5 points. And I think today, you're saying 2015 pricing up 5 to 6 points. Maybe on one side of it, 50 bips, maybe that's just in the margin of commentary. But the low end of 5% seems considerably lower than what you were talking about last quarter for 2015 price realization. Can you guys just talk about today's thoughts on pricing? John Bilbrey : I don\u2019t recall the exact commentary from Q3 at this time but obviously you know when looking at the sales target this year in general, it is little bit lower than what we provided back in October. I mean obviously it does reflect how we exited the year particularly in the FDMx or call it legacy. Legacy channels that\u2019s certainly is part of it as well. David Driscoll : Okay. So what you're saying is that part of this reduction in the revenue guidance is related to pricing, not specifically all volume. I think when I read the release, it felt like what you guys were saying was that the volume performance in the non-seasonal was below expectations. And my interpretation was that was the flow through to 2015. But I think now you're saying that it's a combination of both lower price expectations in 2015 and lower volume expectations in 2015 versus prior guidance. John Bilbrey : I think excluding the M&A the 3 to 5% reflects M&A roughly a half of point greater than our expectation. Some of the international headwinds that Bert talked about on the international business that will have ending up around 10% up in 2015. And then again some of the trend certainly not getting back to what we thought it would be in the non seasonal business exiting in the fourth quarter. We think if it gets better what it probably is not going to get a bigger pick up until post Easter and the second quarter when some of the innovation starts to launch there. David Driscoll : When you guys talked in your script about higher advertising running ahead of re-rated sales growth in 2015, can I just be slightly more clear about this? This seems like it's vastly higher. So if we have 135 basis points of gross margin expansion, I think the math comes out to somewhere between a 20% or 25% increase to the A&C budget. Is that the right neighborhood to think about, or is there something else going on in the G&A line that would require a substantial investment? Bert Alfonso : Yeah let me try to clarify that for you below gross margin. What J.P. mentioned was that, certainly our advertising would be higher year-on-year and we\u2019re talking in the neighborhood of two times sales. There is something that you should try to understand on SG&A. The SG&A as we planned it out with M&A is going to be in the mid-teens. If you strip Alan Candy, crave which we're expecting will close in the first quarter. And then the biggest piece by far Shanghai Golden Monkey that gets you down sort of the high single digits. And it's that mid teen to high single digits with and without M&A so apples-to-apples that should make it sort to think about what happens below that. Not that advertising up 20%, we are saying it's going to be up around two times sales. David Driscoll : That's extremely helpful. Because that part of it's hard to forecast. Just final question from me then is that when you just simplify all of this, your expectations for U.S. category growth in the chocolate candy category is more or less something around 3%, 3.5% for 2015? Is that right? Bert Alfonso : That's right. David Driscoll : Okay. That's all I needed. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Chris Growe : Just two quick questions for you. If I could follow on the line of questioning Dave had there. As I look at the fourth-quarter, it's not clear to me why the U.S. gets better. That is, that you had a high degree of elasticity. So is it as simple as, and you've given us some good information your sales reps and the increase in coverage there, the increase in marketing or advertising would help certainly as well. Anything else that we're not considering, maybe is there a larger new product benefit for the coming year, things that can help us get a little comfort around that 4% to 6% underlying growth. John Bilbrey : One thing I would mention Chris and I know there were lot of moving parts in the fourth quarter but certainly in the North America business the third quarter one point time shift because of the volume certainly that was a headwind in the - for the fourth quarter but there were some positive that we certainly saw in the fourth quarter. I mean we saw the C-store class of trade did very well at the high end of our 3% to 4% long term category growth rates. One of our largest retail partner was - had takeaway in the fourth quarter certainly greater than the 3% to 4%, dollars store continue to do well. In the trends that we \u2013 again and we are seeing very early in January, are in pace with that, certainly in some of the FDMx, again building, not quite at the level of those other channels but getting better than we had given up the fourth quarter. So those are some signs of encouragement there. Bert Alfonso : You know a couple of other things as you start to lap, the SNAP which was an event that back in November the previous year in 2013, so you start to get that back into the base. And then I think the unknown and keep in mind we never talk about gas prices in terms of leading sales up and down. So in difficult times we seem to be pretty good in terms of those linkages. However, what we don't know to answer to yet, I don\u2019t think is that the real income that the lower fuel prices are bringing to consumers is really significant. So how that makes it way through to behavior, I don\u2019t think we know yet but I think that\u2019s more likely a positive than a negative, I would say for food in general and consumer products in general and then obviously we\u2019re going to fight for our share there. John Bilbrey : I guess the way to think about it and hopefully you\u2019ve this team now, is that and to clarify maybe what Bert said, we continue to feel very good about our business within CMG. I think Bert has set a category previous, we actually think the category could be some that, we think we will be better than the category. And we\u2019ll gain shares just as we did this year and our result - if you look first half, second half from a takeaway and share perspective they are much different profiles. Chris Growe : That's good. Just a quick one if I could. The Krave acquisition, I see a lot of ways in which that fits, and you're operating the same channels. It's obviously snacking category. I think at first glance, and I wrote a note to this effect, and I'm sure that you've as well. It's just that it's a very different category for you from an input cost standpoint. And I'm just curious, should we assume that there are the snacking categories beyond the obvious confectionary categories where Hershey will be looking in the future to bolster its growth? John Bilbrey : I think the simplest way for me to address that is, as you get to learn more about Krave, you\u2019ll really see how the positioning of the brand, we believe is very on trend and creates differentiation within that segment. We\u2019re always looking for both in our product development as well as potential acquisitions for things and we believe could fit well with portable nutrition and broader snacking. We will always be diligent to not distract ourselves from the core business that we\u2019re in but we are also in the consumer products business and have to make sure that we\u2019re meeting what consumers are always desiring. We think that\u2019s definitely within the core businesses that we\u2019re in. And we think because of our go-to-market capabilities, our R&D and ability to make things taste great that there are opportunities for us in broader snacking. Chris Growe : That\u2019s good. Thank you for your time. John Bilbrey : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Your final question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Ken Zaslow : Not to belabor the point, but I guess taking a bigger picture look at this. Do you think your long-term growth algorithm, both not only one just a sales line but also on the bottom line, is a little bit more challenged because as it seems like Hershey needs to take greater risks in terms of product integration. You're taking more risks on acquisitions, more risk on creating a new brand, having to add new salespeople. It feels like we're going into a different era with Hershey versus two or three years ago where it was not low hanging fruit, but a little bit easier to get the growth and now it seems a lot more challenging, and you have to do bigger risk items for it. Can you comment on that? John Bilbrey : Well first I tell you it feel challenging every day, but you know, I think the way to think about it is, we feel good about our long term guidance. We know that there\u2019s going to be these periods of times where there\u2019s pressure on businesses and you know, if we look back I\u2019m sure over our 120 year history and I remember hearing people talk about cocoa being at $7,000 a ton and the world was going to end. There are always, these periods of times, which seem more challenging maybe than others. But if you think about our footprint and our portfolio, the countries that we\u2019re focused against, despite there maybe currency headwinds and these kinds of things, these are some of the best high growth GDP markets around. We don't have a lot of legacy businesses that we have to drag along with it. I look at China by itself and, largely we're a Hershey\u2019s business there, more specifically we\u2019re a Hershey's kisses businesses there. As we expand our category, our portfolio within the category, that gives us a tremendous amount of runway. We advertise in - like I think only about 20% or 25% of the cities that the leading competitor in the market does. So as we continue to expand that, and our household penetration grows, we can talk about what\u2019s the right GDP for China, but if think about an emerging middle class and our portfolio over time, we have a tremendous amount of runway there. And so as we execute against our business model in a thoughtful, plan-full way, we have this very precious North American business that I have a tremendous amount of confidence in. I think that our guidance is absolutely right for the long term. We want to continue to be acquisitive and so I think we've got great future. Ken Zaslow : And my just final -- just add on a little question is, the skill set for Hershey in terms of being very focused on chocolate is that your ability to hedge and just understand the input costs associated with Hershey is far superior - because of your knowledge base. Now you're getting into a meat category, which has a whole another host of issues which buying and selling. Does that raise concerns for you? John Bilbrey : Well we have people in our organization in specifically in our both R&D as well as our supply chain that have a lot of experience in their background specifically within protein and in meats. So while it maybe a new endeavor for some of our folks it\u2019s certainly not for all of our people, we\u2019re acquiring what we thing are people with great skill sets. Obviously we\u2019ll do everything we can to learn as much about the business as fast as we can. But when you think about food science we have a technical center with 250 professionals sitting over there many of them PhD\u2019s in food science and they already are experts in proteins. We certainly don\u2019t go into anything with any arrogance we\u2019re going to be eager to learn, but we also believe that we bring some capabilities to the category that will service as well. Ken Zaslow : Great. I thank you very much John Bilbrey : All right. Thank you for joining us today and we'll see you all in a few weeks at the CAGNY conference. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

Bilbrey - CEO Patricia Little - CFO Analysts : Andrew Lazar - Barclays Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Ken Goldman - JP Morgan John Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank David Driscoll - Citi Research Jonathan Feeney - Athlos Research Ken Zaslow - Bank of Montreal Operator : Good morning. My name is Steve and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Hershey Company's First Quarter 2015 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Mark Pogharian, you may begin your conference. Mark Pogharian : Thank you, Steve. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to The Hershey Company's first quarter 2015 conference call. J.P. Bilbrey, Chairman, President and CEO and I will provide you with an overview of results followed by a Q&A session. Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2014 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the Notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. The non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP, rather the company believes the presentation of earnings and excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. As a result, we will discuss 2015 first quarter results, excluding net pretax charges of $9.7 million or $0.02 per share diluted and gain on the sale of a trademark of $10 million or $0.03 per share diluted. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges. With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey. J.P. Bilbrey: Thanks, Mark and good morning to everyone on the phone and webcast. While our sales and earnings performance for the quarter was mixed, I was happy with the progress that we've made in key areas, particularly in the U.S. business were operating and marketplace performance was in line with our expectations. We completed the Krave acquisition towards the end of March and we began the integration work. We can now begin to share snaking inside related to consumer and market segmentation as well as distribution in channel opportunities. As we said in January at that CAGNY, we expected first quarter sales and earnings to be pressured to the Easter timing as seasonal net sales occurred at pre price increased levels. However, Q1 results were lower than we anticipated due to some unexpected softness in China. The weakness was across the majority of the consumer package good space in the China modern trade. The acceleration of this softness in the first quarter versus Q4 was unexpected. Chocolate was one of the few categories in Chinese that grew in the first quarter although less than last year. In China, Hershey's slightly outpaced the category and gained market share. However, the pace of growth slowed significantly. Mark will provide you with additional financial details. So let me give you an overview of the business. Overall, total company Q1 net sales, excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates increased 4.6% driven primarily by pricing and net benefit from acquisitions of 1.6 points. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate was 1.1 headwinds. Our expectation was for adjusted earnings per share diluted to be about the same as last year. So the $1.9 that we earned was largely due to lower than expected international sales growth. Including Easter's seasonal activity and the year ago in current period the candy, mint and gum or CMG category, increased 3.9% for the 12 weeks ended March 21, 2015 within the xAOC+C channels. Gum continues to underperformed and excluding yet the chocolate, non-chocolate and mint categories increased about 4.2%. Excluding Easter's seasonal activity in the current and year ago period combined growth of chocolate, non-chocolate and mints was up 3%. Hershey, first quarter, CMG retail takeaway and the xAOC+C universe was 4.6% benefiting from an Easter versus last year. We had a good Easter and believe we will gain share in this important season. Excluding Easter seasonal sales Hershey's everyday marketplace performance continues to improve. Specifically, Hershey's xAOC+C CMG retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ending March 21st, excluding Easter seasonal sales in the current and year ago period increase plus 3.1%. Perhaps the easiest way to assess performance given seasonal timing is by looking at absolute market share results. We gained market share both with and without the Easter seasonal activity. All in including the seasonal activity Hershey first quarter CMG market share in the xAOC+C universe increased plus 0.2 points. U.S. first quarter organic net sales of nearly 3%, seasonal sales roughly one quarter of our business in the first quarter declined year-over-year due to a shorter Easter season.  This was more than offset by our everyday business which I'm pleased to say increased mid-single digits on a percentage basis versus last year. This is slightly ahead of everyday retail takeaway of 3.1% due to the timing and shipments of second quarter promotions and new products. In the second quarter we believe our everyday momentum will continue with the broader roll out and launch of Ice Breakers Cool Blast Chews, Hershey's Caramels and additional Lancaster Cream flavors. In Hershey's first quarter xAOC+C chocolate retail takeaway excluding Easter was up 3.3% resulting in chocolate market share gains in 0.6 points. Importantly, retail takeaway was solid across many of core chocolate franchises including Reese's, Hershey's, Kit Kat, Kisses and Brookside. Switching to non-chocolate candy or NCC in the xAOC+C channels, Hershey's NCC business excluding Easter in the current and year ago period declined 2% as we were lapping the year ago launch of the Lancaster product line. We anticipate that our NCC performance will be a bit better over the next couple of quarters supported by Lancaster in store sampling events, national FSIs and some summer fun flavors of Twizzlers. While not as large as chocolate, at NCC we continue to do well within the gum and the mint categories, specifically our Q1 gum and mint retail takeaway within the xAOC+C universe was up 11% and 10.5% respectively.  As a result our gum market share increased by 0.4 points to 5.2%, our mint market share increased 0.7 points expanding our segment leading position to 40.3%. In the C store classic trade where the seasonal impacts are minimal the CMG category was up 5.1% driven by pricing. As it relates to the previously announced price increase volume elasticity trends are tough to discern in the xAOC universe given the influence of seasonal candy on shelf at pre price increase levels. However conversion appears to be on track.  Total Hershey's C store performance was solid with retail takeaway up plus 4.8%, it was driven by pricing of 9-10 points offset by volume elasticity of about 5%. This is relatively in line with our modeling for this channel, our C store chocolate and mint retail takeaway was particularly solid up 4.9% and 8.9% respectively. These gains were driven by core brand advertising, in store selling, merchandizing and programming. International results were mixed in the first quarter giving greater than expected unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and China retail softness that impacted overly grocery as well as the chocolate category growth. Recall during last quarter's conference call we stated that chocolate category growth in China was about 8% and that was less than the historical 10-11%.  In the first quarter chocolate category growth was 4% again softer than we would have anticipated and less than the year ago period. Given the Chinese New Year holiday the first quarter is typically the biggest quarter of the year for chocolate consumption. Some of this softness is most likely due to government policy related to gifting, however macroeconomic news indicates things have significantly slowed and this could be impacting overall consumer confidence. This is evident when looking at Nielsen data for the broader CBG group which was also soft. Our chocolate retail takeaway in China was about 5% in the first quarter resulting in a market share gain of 0.1 point. In all of the markets where we operate our goal is to ship to consumption so the consumer has a good experience related to freshness and taste. Therefore our China first quarter net sales moderated and declined 47% versus year ago. We will continue to execute against plans with our retail partners in China to drive store traffic and in store activity over the remainder of the year. As a result our China chocolate plan reflects the first quarter miss and remains relatively intact versus our initial plan. We have made some adjustments on how we\u2019ll get there. We expect to enter some Tier 2 cities will increase the level of in store sampling to drive everyday trail and repeat. Additionally, we're beginning to get Brookside out into the market and using Golden Monkey distributor assets that help us to achieve that. Shanghai Golden Monkey integration is progressive. In the first quarter Golden Monkey was diluted to our earnings. However, results will be stronger in the second half of the year supported by a solid pipeline of snack and non-chocolate candy new products. In Mexico, first quarter constant currency net sales increased about 16%. As expected our business is sequentially improved over the last three quarters as consumers have adjusted to the VAT tax instituted last year. Importantly, the chocolate category increased about 13%. We estimate that Hershey's retail takeaway was up about 12% driven by Hershey's spikes and a King Size Q1 event at some selected retailers. Over the remainder of the year, we have a lot of in store activity planned to highlighting new packaging designs and pack types that we believe will generate solid net sales growth. In Brazil, first quarter constant currency net sales increased about 18% results benefited from an easy comp versus the year ago period and an earlier Easter. Although note that we don't have a broad Easter portfolio on Brazil as the big Kiss offering is our primary seasonal item. Hershey's Tablet Bar performance was good and while all small Reese is starting to gain attraction in Brazil. Despite mixed international results in the first quarter we remain confident about plans over the remainder of the year. We\u2019ve made adjustments where necessary and have the right mix of innovation and in-store activities to achieve our objectives. Our international growth profile excluding Golden Monkey is similar to prior years and driven by performance in the second half, particularly the fourth quarter. However, foreign currency exchange rates remain volatile and over the remainder of the year, the other favorable impact on net sales is expected to be greater than our previous estimate. Given this backdrop and first quarter softness in China, we now expect international net sales excluding the benefit of Golden Monkey, to increase about 5% versus our previous expectation of about 10% increased. Now to wrap up. Core brand merchandising, programming and innovation accelerates over the remainder of the year. There is no change to our advertising and marketing methodology and we continue to expect that it will increase at a rate greater than net sales growth. We believe these investments should generate full year organic net sales growth or constant currency sales excluding M&A and FX impacts of around 3.5% to 4.5% in 2015. We expect foreign exchange rates to be greater than our previous testament by about a half a point and be about 1.5 points unfavorable in 2015. We continue to estimate that the net contribution from acquisitions and divestitures will be around 2.5 points. With the profitable U.S. business on track and increase in gross margin expansion and Golden Monkey accretion later in the year, we expect an increase in 2015 full year adjusted earnings per share diluted of 8% to 10%, including dilution from acquisitions and divestitures of $0.03 to $0.05 per share. Before we provide you with additional financial details, I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome Patricia Little our CFO as of March 16. Patricia is a season financial leader who knows how to create shareholder value and develop talent and we believe will be a benefit to our global organization and all of our shareholders. Patricia Little : Thanks, J.P. I'm pleased to be here and it's a privilege to be part of the Hershey team, especially given the many opportunities in front of us. I follow the consumer package goods states as a board member at another company. So while I\u2019m a bit familiar with the category, I still have a lot to learn over the coming months. However, in my first few weeks on the job, it's clear and the confectionary category are advantaged. Our business is growing in the profitable North America market and in our focus international markets the category has a long runway. I'm committed to long term value creation, as is our board of directors and look forward to helping our company reach its potential. Overtime, I look forward to meeting all of you and sharing what I learned and opportunities that continue to exist for the Hershey company. With that let me turn it over to Mark, who will provide you with further information on first quarter results. Mark Pogharian : Thank you, Patricia. Good morning to everyone on the phone and webcast. First quarter net sales of 1.9 billion was up 3.5% versus the prior year, excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 1.1 point, about half a point greater than estimate net sales increased 4.6%. The fluctuation in the Canadian dollar was responsible for about half of that FX impact and the Mexican peso and Brazilian real, the majority of the remainder. As we indicated last quarter given a shorter Easter, volume elasticity related to the U.S. price increase and the timing of innovation, we expected consolidated net sales growth in Q1 to be around the low end of our long-term target. However, we didn't anticipate the anomaly in China that J.P. referred to. Pricing and net M&A was at 3.8 point and 1.6 point benefits. Partially offset by volume that was 0.8 point headwinds. Importantly, North America organic net sales excluding FX and M&A increased 3.4%, relatively in line with our expectations. North America pricing up 4.3 points was partially offset by volume that was up 0.9 points due to elasticity related to the price increase and lower seasonal sales. International and other segments net sales increased 8.5% driven by the Golden Monkey acquisition, a 13.3 point benefit, while FX was a 4.8 point headwind. International and other segment organic net sales were about the same as last year. As we stated in January first quarter EPS would be pressured, our expectation was for adjusted EPS to be about the same as last year due to seasonal product sales that accorded a pre-price increase level and our plan for higher SM&A expenses. However we did not anticipate the lower levels of growth in China within the biggest cities and hyper markets. This impacted chocolate categories growth in the quarter as well as some of our decisions related to Golden Monkey go to market strategies. Hence adjusted EPS diluted of a $1.9 down about 5% versus last year was off versus our plan primarily due to China chocolate sales and Golden Monkey dilution. Turning now to margins, in the first quarter adjusted gross margin increased 10 basis points driven by supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives as well as the net price realization which more than offsets higher input cost, earlier this month we implemented select input cost strategies that we believe will enable gross margin to increase a 155 to a 165 basis points for the full year. Adjusted EBIT in the first quarter declined 5.6% versus last year resulting in adjusted EBIT margin of 20.3%. The decline was driven by higher SM&A expenses that increased 12.3% versus last year. Looking at a couple of the pieces, advertising and related consumer marketing expense increased about 8%, selling, marketing and administrative expenses excluding advertising and related consumer marketing increased about 15%. This increase reflects the addition of Golden Monkey, investments in mark-to-market capabilities in the US and the international markets, as well as knowledge based consumer insights.  Let me now provide you with a brief update on the international business. Similar to prior years our expectation entering 2015 was for international net sales growth would be back half weighted. We still believe that will be the case given our plans for advertising, merchandizing programming and new products. Q1 international net sales increased 8.8%. Note that this excludes global retail and licensing results which was relatively in line with expectations. Looking at our focus markets we believe China chocolate category softness was impacted by consumer confidence given all the negative headlines you've all see like slowing GDP growth. Although we were encouraged that March Nielsen data showed an acceleration in category growth versus January and February. Over the remainder of the year we expect net sales growth in China to sequentially improve, although it will be driven by performance in the second half of the year. We've adjusted our China plans to generate greater in store activities, support faster growth in the hyper markets, we'll be entering some Tier 2 cities and we have plans to increase our exposure in the fast growing e-commerce channel. On a constant currency basis net sale in Mexico and Brazil increased mid-teens on a percentage basis versus last year due to easier comps. Recall that at the beginning of '14 we had the headwind of the back tax in [inactive] in Mexico, and volume elasticity related to the price increase in Brazil. We expect Mexico and Brazil performance to be better than last year however we expect the Real and Pesos to remain volatile and be a major headwind related to reported net sales. Moving down to P&L, first quarter interest expense of 19.2 million, declined 2.2 million versus last year. For the full year we continue to expect interest expense to be in the $75 million to $80 million range. The adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was 35% in line with our estimate. For the full year we expect the adjusted net tax rate to be slightly lower than the year ago rate of 34.5%. This is a little different from our initial analysis and guidance that the full year adjusted tax rate would be about the same as last year. For the first quarter of 2015 weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 222.7 million, a 1.9% decline compared to last year.  Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow, at the end of the first quarter net trading capital increased versus last year's first quarter by 69.2 million, account receivable was lower by 13.8 million and remains extremely current. Inventory was higher by 67 million and accounts payable declined by 16 million. The net increase in trading capital was driven by acquisitions, excluding net acquisitions and divestitures net trading capital increased 7 million. In terms of other specific cash flow items total capital additions including software were 62.7 million in the first quarter, for the year we expect total capital expenditures to be about 375 million to 400 million including capital related to the Johor Malaysia project of about a 110 million. Excluding this project CapEx is about 275 million or about 3.5 % of net sales. Depreciation and amortization was 58.3 million in the first quarter in line with our estimates, during the first quarter dividends paid were over 114 million. The company repurchased a $173 million of outstanding shares in the first quarter against a February 2014 authorization which is now complete; no shares have been purchased against the $250 million authorization approved in February 2015. This authorization is in addition to the company's policy of repurchasing shares in the open market related to issues in connection with stock option exercises. In the first quarter the company repurchased a $134 million of common shares to replace shares issued in connection with exercise of stock options. Cash and short term investments at the end of the first quarter were up 405 million. As J.P. summarized, in 2015, we have a solid pipeline of innovation, merchandising and programming. In addition marketing expense is expected to increase that greater than net sales growth. As a result we expect 2015 net sales to increased 4.5% to 5.5%, including a net contribution from acquisitions and divestitures of around 2.5 points and the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates of about 1.5 points. Excluding these items, organic net sales are expected to increase 3.5% to 4.5% versus the previous 4% to 6%. While we remain confident in our business plans, a narrowing of the sales range reflects to global macroeconomic challenges that continue to persist. But decline of the lower end of the range by half of point primarily reflects the first quarter China underperformance. We continue to have a significant focus on gross margin and expect that the previously announced price increase as well as productivity and cost savings to result in gross margin expansion of 155 to 165 basis points. Combined with a slightly lower net cash rate and Golden Monkey accretion in the second half of the year, adjusted earnings per share diluted is expected to increase 8% to 10%. Before we open it up to Q&A just a couple of thoughts on the second quarter. We have planned to generate solid gross margin expansion over the remaining quarters. However the second quarter is typically our smallest quarter as it relates to overall net sales. And our international sales profile is similar to prior year with annual growth primarily driven by fourth quarter performances. Additionally, Golden Monkey will be dilutive in the second quarter before ramping up in the second half of the year. While small [crave] margins are lower than the company average and it will also contributes to the increase in total consolidated SM&A expenses in the second quarter. Therefore second quarter net sales, including M&A and FX is expected to be at near the low end of our full year sales target of 4.5% to 5.5% before accelerating in the second half of the year. Given all these moving parts, we expect second quarter EPS diluted growth to be pressured and around the same as last year. Thank you for your time this morning and we'll now take any questions that you may have. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Your line is open. Andrew Lazar : If the more sizable part of the top line weakness in the quarter as you talked about was international and SGM, I just want to make sure that I'm clear on why the these full year organic sales target is coming down? Is it just the organic piece of the international particularly China that you talked about or is there some North American angle to that as well? I just want to make sure that's not changed. J.P. Bilbrey: It is the China flow through at the first quarter Andrew that you\u2019re seeing; the U.S. business [indiscernible] is off to a good start and is forecasted to be as we anticipated earlier in the year. Andrew Lazar : Okay and then despite this [indiscernible] the sales weakness in SGM, I guess you talked about still looking for the same full year contribution from acquisitions but I guess you only have, I think maybe two quarters left to make up for that first quarter weakness in SGM because I think you start lapping it in the fourth quarter, if I'm not mistaken. So I'm just trying to get sense of what gives the comfort level there that the acquisition contribution can still be the same despite the first quarter? J.P. Bilbrey: Yes, that's correct. Last year we had two months if you recall from Golden Monkey and the fourth quarter. And as we start of the year we had a similar pattern as we did in the chocolate business, we were lower in terms of the Chinese New Year. What we have in Golden Monkey, which is different than the regular chocolate businesses, we have a part of the business which is not so seasonal, which is the [bean curve] business and we also have a lot of innovation which kicks in after new year and that's been the typical pattern, where we have distributor meetings early in the second quarter for that innovation and there is a very strong innovation pipeline for that. And so our expectation is that we will be on target for that accretion during the full year and that will come into back half. The other small acquisitions and divestitures whether the Mauna Loa or Krave kind of offset each other. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is open. Bryan Spillane : Just the follow up to Andrew's question and I just want to make sure, I called all these pieces the -- in the first quarter the downside relative to your internal plans was really partly at least more dilution from Shanghai Golden Monkey. But for the full year you're not -- you expecting the dilution to be similar or the same in terms of what you thought it was going to beginning at the year? But it sounds like you're going to spend more money for some of this in market activity to try to boost sales. So, trying to piece those pieces together. Why it wouldn't be more diluted if you\u2019re having to spend more money to drive sales, special since it was already more dilutive than you thought in the first quarter. So am I thinking about that correctly, I guess? J.P. Bilbrey: Yes, not partially -- not exactly. Let me explain. We always said Shanghai Golden Monkey would be slight accretive to the year and all we\u2019re trying to do is reconfirm that despite a slower start attributable to new year. We did have -- Obviously, lower operating income in the rest of the China business for the same reason that we had a slower start. What we're saying in this case is that the Shanghai Golden Monkey's slight accretion to the year remains intact, based on the activity progress that we have in place. In terms of you know higher spending, we\u2019re not projecting higher spending in the international business in terms of getting back to you know our targets for the year and we're also given the magnitude of the China sales miss, we're not projecting that we can make up that sales miss which is part of what Mark explained on the call down on the lower end. We do have higher year-on-year cost in the sales force that's our program as we actively go into more cities and we did still have advertising in the first quarter during Chinese New Year although it certainly wasn't as effective as we thought it would be. Mark Pogharian : And those comments are related to the China chocolate business, Brian, so it's not only did you have the SEM dilution you had all the investments we made in the China chocolate business throughout '14 that happened perhaps in the back half that are [indiscernible] that are in your pace, that will be in the pace of the first half this year. Bryan Spillane : Okay. J.P. Bilbrey: Like in sales force, et cetera. Bryan Spillane : And then just one last follow up to that is just, it sounds like you know in terms of when you built this plan in I guess October and November versus where we are today, Chinese New Year was weaker than expected and a lot of this I guess is more macro, it\u2019s not just specific to Hershey and so I guess as you go forward in terms of as you've done the planning going forward has it incorporated that maybe that you know the macro environment is just not as strong as it was when you initially planned 2015 or is the expectation that it's the same? I'm just trying to understand how it accounts for what seems like just slower growth generally in China. J.P. Bilbrey: We've taken that into account and as we looked, to your point, as we developed the plan last year and we said during the January call that we expected Chinese growth to be approximately the 30% that we grew in '14, so we weren't -- while we were seeing some slowdown, let's call it in December, we weren't planning for as poor a performance. We know, we think there's a lot of this is cyclical based on what you're hearing, GDP, consumer confidence, things that we've already mentioned. We don\u2019t think it's as much structural, in fact some of the structural changes we think actually help us in the long run, things like urbanization, as well as more of a consumer economy which is what the government's pushing but, we've lowered certainly the overall year expectations, as you know we said we'd be somewhere around 30 and that the category would be in the low double digits. We certainly lowered that to high single digit. Still think we can do two-three times the category growth rate but we certainly lowered that overall year expectation, not trying to make up the first quarter. Mark Pogharian : Let me just add one other comment, it's really important for the perspective of our company in China is, we continue to be in a brand building and portfolio expansion mode, Shanghai Golden Monkey is of course critical for the distribution, build of that, and so we really continue -- we believe we have the right brands, the right growth plan, markets will moderate as we're certainly seeing right now over time, but on a long term basis we continue to believe our model's a good model, obviously volume is a magic elixir on some of these things, so you also have to manage pace in investment along with that but we really believe that we have the right plans in place and over time we\u2019ll continue to grow in China, mainly around distribution and portfolio expansion for the near term anyway. Operator : Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JP Morgan; your line is open, Ken Goldman : I had a question for Patricia if I could, and first welcome to the food industry, I'm curious and I realize it's still early days right, but is there anything you're seeing that you might consider sort of low hanging fruit you'd like to pick, I don\u2019t know whether that's in the balance sheet or M&A strategy, really anything, is there something you're looking at and saying you know what we can and I guess should be doing this differently. Patricia Little : Thanks for the question, I don't think it's so much that I'm going to come in with those kinds of answers, what I've seen is leadership team here who's really focused on all of those things, on the M&A, on the cost leverage on how they manage the brands on how they focus on growth both in North America and the key focus markets, I view my job as to be really a catalyst to help that team bring all of their great ideas to fruition, so I wouldn't say that there's low hanging fruit that I come in to see, what I see is a group that's working on all of those very actively. Ken Goldman : Okay, and then this is a question, just one more for anyone really, you're one of the first food companies to report since the Kraft Heinz deal and I recognize you've already made significant improvements to your cost base over the years and I appreciate you're more of a growth company right than either Kraft or Heinz, but I guess when you read some of the -- read about some of the massive margin improvements 3G is able to implement, you know, I guess on some level do you think to yourself boy there's, maybe there's a lot more we can do than what we're currently planning on, or do you say this is our plan, we'll need to balance top line growth with margins and so forth? I\u2019m just curious how you react, what seems to be a continued trend here in food. J.P. Bilbrey: So, I think as you rightly point out we're very focused on growth, we've been investing in our business is about the new geographies and I think very importantly in capabilities. So I can\u2019t specifically talk about 3G, what I do thing is very important and as I mentioned on the last call at CAGNY, we're really looking about -- we\u2019re really looking at how we evolve our business mode, how we allocate and reallocate resources against what we believe are opportunity, you\u2019ve heard us talk about knowledge and insight. We continue to believe that's really important and we're investing in different skill sets there than we have and so we have to be mindful at the pace of our business. We have to make sure that the volume continues to be the elixir that makes all things affordable. So you should expect us to continue to take hard look at the leverage we have against our P&L and you\u2019ll hear us talk a bit more about that we're doing a lot of work in that area. But I think for our company we strongly believe that there has to be an ongoing balance between brand building and P&L leverage. That obviously takes cost as one of the key leverage, but we want to make sure that we maintain the right balance and focus on all those things. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. John Baumgartner : John, as you look to your cost basket here, gross margin are tracking bit more favorably relative to your last update and with that sailing going for you, do you find your still needing to reinvest the incremental benefit in sales force or marketing, or have you reached the position where SG&A budget is more of less fixed and those cost can flow through more to products going forward? J.P. Bilbrey: Well, I think that, there is a couple of thing to probably seeing as we raised our gross margin outlook, part of that is around commodities and input cost and then as I said, we want to make sure that we continue to look at the levers that we put in place. So yes we've invested in our selling capabilities and we want continue to invest in our brands some of that's in our international markets but it's also importantly in our U.S. market as well, where we get the right see store level of coverage where we get the right frequency in stores so that we can win in merchandising and so, if we look at our overall business model we think we\u2019ve got the right approach. And to make sure that, you continue to be reassured that we are mindful about what we can afford and non-afford obviously we want to make sure that we continue to grow into those investments at the appropriate pace. But I think over the long-term again we're really committed to our business model and we also feel good about the markets that we're in. We think, we're in the right markets long-term and it will have to whether some of the volatility of the short-term up and downs. But we're in this business to stay, we\u2019re been here a long time and we planned to be here either longer. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Eric Katzman : Couple of questions, I guess, kind of following up. This is -- should we read this like select input cost strategies as a kind of one time in nature? I mean did you like just favorably locking some hedges or something that makes this -- the gross margin improvements locked in for this year? J.P. Bilbrey: I think, Eric, we look at what we believe are the right strategies to protect our brand investment in our pricing and our -- I would just reiterate that we can be anywhere between 3 and 24 months hedged on some of our key commodities. Certainly coco\u2019s been volatile so we\u2019ve looked for opportunities to price went we think the -- it's a good value and then the entire industry is getting some benefit out of dairy and you know well, I'm not trying to predict, where dairy goes, it feels as though it\u2019s in a direction which could benefit. But if you look at lot of the tree nuts and so forth, those are going up largely and so again we try to look at the overall commodity basket and we feel pretty good about how we've been able to take a forward view to protect our current plans. Eric Katzman : Okay and then -- thanks for that. And then just kind of talking about the U.S. business overall, I mean as I've been travelling around -- again it's not a scientific sample, but it just seems like there is more promotion in the market, I see kind of BOGO, it seems like a lot of the pegboard and mini products that have been introduced in past years are on sale a lot, I think J.P. you've mentioned in the past seeing more kind of snack based competition and so maybe can you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in market and is that are those observations fair appraisal? J.P. Bilbrey: Eric, I think what we would say is that across snacking we are seeing that there is a lot of activity out there, if you look at the overall snacking wheel and the share performance you can see that there's been some moderation there with the exception that CMG is sort of returning more to its historical performance base, you\u2019ve see meat snacks which continues to perform really well and obviously we're encouraged by Krave. But I think we're in an era where the snacking continuum and the occasions of snacking are broadening and therefore consumer choice is greater and so we have to work hard at making sure that at the point of sale our brands are winning in terms of merchandizing etc. I\u2019ll tell you the one thing, that if I -- as I personally have a takeaway from the first quarter that I feel better about than anything else we probably could talk about on this call is that we're seeing a strengthening in our everyday business and if you take Easter out and you know all of the previous quarters and all and you just look at what's the health of the everyday business. We're doing a -- our everyday brands are up and importantly that's always a measure of advertising effectiveness. So the combination of advertising working for us and seeing our everyday business improving outside of that environment, that is a very, very healthy sign and for me that's the thing I feel best about in the entire first quarter. Operator : Thank you, our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi Research, your line is open. David Driscoll : Wanted to follow up on two points, the first one on Ken's question regarding kind of the cost structure of the company. J.P. I think you indicated in the release here that SG&A investment kind of excluding the acquisitions was up about 10%. Yes, I think over the years you guys have really been adding to your \u201ccapabilities\u201d within that line, and the question here is, is all of that 10% increase focused on these emerging market opportunities or how much of it is really focused on the U.S. And then how do you think about that in light of Kraft-Heinz and [ZBB] and all of these commentary regarding the US marketplace where it seems as if folks are really taking costs out of their U.S. operations not putting them in. J.P. Bilbrey: Well I think David first of all a couple of things, I would tell you that as consumer insight driven company, a brand building company, we're going to always be focused on growth and growing our brand. The cost is a lever, and it\u2019s an important one, so look, I mean if we can all capture synergies in our business via acquisitions and add-ons and making sure that we've got P&L leverage, we absolutely have to be focused to get that because the investments that we make have to pay for themselves. But first and foremost we have a business model you know that we want to pursue. So, yes I think there's some very good reminders in the marketplace that suggest that, listen, you got to make sure you're not getting fat, but you also have to make sure that along the way to not getting fat, you're allocating resources in a way that you can win in the market place on a go in basis. So that's important. If I come back to the first part of your question, we're balancing those investments both internationally and in the U.S. So we've proven over and over again that the passion of our sales organization, our feet on the street represent us better than any other choice we could make, I've also seen some evidence in the market place where some other companies are coming to that conclusion as well. But for our company we continue to be focused against those investments, and the only way we can grow our brands in these new markets is to forward invest in the capabilities that make them broadly available to consumers and we'll continue to do that. But we\u2019ll do that in the most effective and efficient way we possibly can. David Driscoll : Okay and just a follow up on international, so I think what you guys wrote is that Mexico, Brazil and India were up 15% and that was in line with your expectations, so that seems to be tracking and then all of this international stuff is related to China, that's where the short fall is, so hopefully I have that correct and then kind of the question here is, you know 47%, of course every time you read a number like that on a company like this you do a double take to make sure you didn't misread it. I think the takeaway here -- but this is the question, is the 47% decline in the China business, it's an inventory adjustment essentially, so that in 4Q you had massive shipments of product to retail, anticipating something like a 30% growth in the first quarter in China. First quarter China retail I think you guys said was 5% for Hershey products and hence that requires a massive change in the shipment pattern in Q1. [Bert] am I putting all this together right. Mark Pogharian : Yes, let me -- to your first point, it is largely China, there were other small bits right, so there're a couple of our export markets where the dollar is making the product quite expensive, example could be an export market like Japan, obviously which, they're actually in quantitative easing so their currency's going the other way, So there were a few markets and certainly our export business was impacted but it was largely a China story in the scheme of things. And you're quite right, as we anticipated the growth in the first quarter for Chinese New Year and didn\u2019t see that coming along we obviously shipped less into the marketplace, because J.P. mentioned earlier I think in his remarks, we try to ship with the consumption pattern is, we don't expect that will be made up in the rest of the years, so we've adjusted down or growth although we think the rest of the year should be more normalized than what we saw during the Chinese new year. David Driscoll : Okay. So, kind of short version here is this you do the big catch up in the first quarter to get this thing, the distribution inventories on track and then the remaining three quarters are negatively impacted by a fundamental view that the China growth rate is lower than what you had previously thought, is that right? Mark Pogharian : I think, that's correct. Again don't forget a lot of the next wave of China business, Golden Monkey\u2019s is little bit less seasonal, does come in the last four months of the year Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line on Jonathan Feeney with Athlos Research. Your line is open. Jonathan Feeney : Just following up more directly with David here, I mean, if China was down -- Shanghai Golden Monkey 47% on 5% take away, what were you hoping China was going to do in the first quarter? And maybe for the year and approximately by how much -- did you lower that internal forecast? J.P. Bilbrey: Yes, we don't talk about quarters, we did say in the first quarter call that we expected the China business to grow around at 30% that we grew last year, I think, last year we were up 34. And so we expected to similar growth. I'll just reiterate we -- that would translate into category and the low double digits, we've lowered that to the high single digits reflecting the first quarter miss. Jonathan Feeney : Makes a lot of sense, thanks. And of that growth, how much of that is channel penetration of the former, Shanghai Golden Monkey -- enabled by the Shanghai Golden Monkey acquisition and if you can -- can you tell us, you look at the 13.3 impact, I assume that's all from Shanghai Golden Monkey, I assume that of this year sales, can you tell us, what apples-to-apples if it's possible the Shanghai Golden Monkey business is trending? J.P. Bilbrey: On the first part of your question, the synergy aspect of Golden Monkey, we're in the very early stages of that, so there is very little of that. And the reason for that is -- as we plan for those synergies; let's take an example, chocolate products through Golden Monkey sales force. We're still on the process of designing different pack size, different price points which are more appropriate for those markets. So, there is not a lot of the miss that's accounted for by not penetrating Hershey products to Golden Monkey. On a year-over-year basis we haven't given that type of information, the Golden Monkey certainly had a similar impact in the first quarter as you would see in our chocolate business based on the same lower New Year. Jonathan Feeney : Thank you. And do you continue to expect that or do you expect that cross selling opportunity once you get through the appropriate pack sizes remains to be significant? J.P. Bilbrey: Very much. Well it's not -- well it's all incremental to what their business model has been all along. A lot of that welcome toward the end of the year as we designed these pack types and we start to launch into the next wave of Chinese new year if you will, which comes later in the year but we're fairly confident that we have the right products, we have to reconfigure them and they suddenly have the capability to get them into lower Tier cities and traditional trade. Jonathan Feeney : Thanks and I just ask one last question, you have a -- in the first quarter clearly, you had -- looked like some pretty good in North American performance at least as far as both the everyday business and overall. And you -- it seems is this gross margin would have outperformed your expectations were it not for the impact of international, can you give us a sense -- weighs the full years gross margins, so can you give us the sense how much maybe mix or performance in these international business affects gross margin versus if it we're just say in North America, that extra growth in international you're expecting, affects the consolidated gross margin versus if you're say just North American business experiencing that 4 plus percent pricing in modest line decline, thanks J.P. Bilbrey: I mean, Jon, I guess the way, I would think about it, don't forget that seasonal was about 25% to 30% of our overall North America sale, so that's why it's not up as much as you would have maybe have anticipated. Again when you go to some of these international markets, the growth -- absolute level of gross margin in China for example, would have been down year-over-year, when you think about the 5% take away and perhaps how we think about trade there to make sure it all gets out eventually at the end of the day. So that was the little bit of a drag at the gross margin on the international side. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Your line is open Ken Zaslow : Just two follow ups, one is -- I think, this is what you said is, but the incremental gross margin expansion for your guidance is entirely related to the money environment or there anything operational you are doing to increase that? I didn't get that full answer. J.P. Bilbrey: Well I think what is said is, is that meaningful piece is really related to the commodity improvement on our input costs and our outlook there. You also have the benefited mix as you get through the year with the pricing you know that really begins to show up in the US business as well. So you got a combination of things that are helping us there. And then as the US business continues to perform well there's always a positive mix effect that happens. Therefore, I made some commentary around the everyday business on one of the earlier questions, so I think you've got several factors. Mark Pogharian : I guess Ken there's no change, if you think about the initial 135 to 145 bps, it\u2019s all about the pricing and it\u2019s the incremental 20 basis point increase is related to the [indiscernible] on the commodity strategy. Ken Zaslow : Okay, great, my second question, Tier 2 cities, when you think of them in China, does the long term growth opportunity as well as margin opportunity compare to Tier 1 cities or are they significantly lower, how do they scale up over time? Mark Pogharian : No, they're -- I mean from a margin perspective they're very comparable. There are some slight benefits, as an example advertising rates are a bit lower as you spread into lower Tier cities. But there's no penalty in terms of pricing and as you go into Tier 2 and Tier 3, the further down you go obviously the pack size change and there's more traditional trade that's part of the mix. But that doesn't cause a margin penalty. J.P. Bilbrey: The other comment I would just make is that and I kind of come back again to the long term perspective, you know the category growth in China and brand building is still the biggest story and what happens with their pace of urbanization, obviously everybody wants to participate in that, at the same time you have a large dispersement and that's why -- of people and that's why we feel good about the acquisition of Shanghai Golden Monkey and the ability then to put both our brands -- both of the brands of the two entities across our entire distribution chain. Ken Zaslow : What would make you work for 2016, what would create Chinese growth to be restored to last year's growth level, can you speak to that, and what would you need to see that would change, that would make you think that 2016 could compare with 2014? J.P. Bilbrey: We haven't started to talk about '16 yet, I think that's a little premature, I think what I mentioned earlier is that certainly what we see in China today you know feels more cyclical in terms of what\u2019s going on with GDP, what's going on with consumer sentiment. You've seen the government react to some degree, last weekend I think the Central Bank lowered reserve rates in order to put more monies into the economy, particularly for small business. I think the structural changes favor CPG categories in terms of urbanization which J.P. mentioned as well as a more consumer oriented economy versus exports, so I do see given to see that evolution, we\u2019re structural, I think helps us and then the cyclical right now will all have to hold hands and see how soon that gets resolved, but I do think that's more cyclical in structure. Mark Pogharian : Operator, we have time for one more question; want to respectful of other peers that are reporting today. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard, your line is open. Alexia Howard : Can I ask about the everyday items, you mentioned that you were encouraged about that would trend and could you give us some numbers around that? About the progression there, maybe first half last year, second half last year and then what you\u2019ve seen this latest quarter. And what do you think is driving that, are you seeing better traffic in the stores, you mentioned the advertising effectiveness was another piece of it. Thank you and I'll pass it on. J.P. Bilbrey: Yes, Alexia the thing that I would point to and I'll try to give to give you a couple of things here, if you look at the quarter, Reese's was about nine-tenths of a point, Hershey's up 2.4%, Kit Kat was up 3.6%, Kisses up over 9% and Brookside was a big number and because it's a new brand, may not be meaningful to talk about it, but it was a big number. So for me the fact that the everyday ex-Easter was healthy until all of our core brands grew and that's the piece that I was feeling so good about and you know the first quarter last year was -- so some of the comparable in terms of the total CMG may be a little bit harder to look at, the first quarter of 2014 last year was up about 4.6% or so and a lot of that was driven by non-chocolate products with Lancaster and some big Twizzlers type promotions. So if you really isolate our biggest brands and those core brands and look at their performance that really shows you, we remember we talked about -- we were going to try to be very focused against merchandizing, against our core and big brands making sure they were available to consumers, that appears to be working for us. Mark Pogharian : And to answer your TRIPS question Alexia, I would say it looks pretty the [tripped] in by channel. I mean, I think our performance and category performance looks pretty similar to last year, we see store dollar in one of the largest retailers in the country continue to really, really shine. J.P. Bilbrey: I'd make one other point just broadly as I had been out and about talking to retailers and have listened to other manufacturers is, people are saying that they believe the basket is more constructive than they've seen for a while, so that strengthening of the basket is also probably a really good sign for the overall industry, that's a North American comment as well. Alexia Howard : Thank you very much and I'll pass it back to you. Thank you. Mark Pogharian : Thank you very much for your time today. I'll be available for any follow up question that any of you have. Operator : This conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

LLC Operator : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to The Hershey Company's second quarter 2015 results conference call. My name is Steve, and I'll be your conference operator today. All participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Mr. Mark Pogharian, you may begin your conference. Mark K. Pogharian - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Steve. Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to The Hershey Company second quarter 2015 conference call. J.P. Bilbrey, Chairman President and CEO and Patricia Little, Senior Vice President and CFO, will provide you with an overview of results which will then be followed by a Q&A session. Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward looking. These statements are based on current expectations which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2014 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the note section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating the performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings excluding certain items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. As a result, we will discuss 2015 second quarter results excluding net pre-tax charges of $282 million or $1.23 per share diluted primarily related to a non-cash impairment charge and cost associated with the business productivity initiative announced in June. Our discussion of any future projection will also exclude the impact of these net charges. With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Mark. I want to thank all of you on the phone line and webcast for joining us today. And our long-term strategic planning cycle, we know there is always the potential for volatility, particularly in international markets. The combination of macroeconomic influences and competitive activity in our core China chocolate business along with disappointing Golden Monkey performance have resulted in negative short-term results in this part of business. I'll talk more about this in a few minutes. Importantly, we're committed to our long-term strategic plan and believe the balance of performance of the strong North America business and attractive growth opportunities in key international markets should enable us to deliver solid growth over the long term. Our scale and profitable North American business gives us flexibility in the near term while maintaining focus on building our brands in China, Mexico, Brazil and India. The investments we've made in North America over the last few years are paying dividends. Our focus on consumer capabilities and customer insights provides us with the framework to build our brands with retailers. We're also working with innovative firms like Palantir that are building our predictive, analytical capabilities in the areas of consumer insights and enterprise connectivity. The implementation of the U.S. price increase we announced last year is on track and the related CMG volume elasticity is in line with our modeling. This was partially offset by increased levels of promotions and discounts related to the spreads and baking chips businesses. Our overall year-to-date U.S. retail takeaway of 3.1% is in line with our expectations. However, this was impacted by a shorter Easter season. Looking at the everyday base CMG business, retail takeaway was up mid-single digits in the second quarter. This is a solid indicator that our advertising or pull efforts is working. Additionally, our continued focus on core brands has resulted in market share growth all across The Hershey's, Kit Kat, Brookside, Kisses and Ice Breakers franchises. We continue to optimize and refine our North America marketing model and execution capabilities. We're focused on advertising and marketing returns and are optimizing our spending across the portfolio. For example, we are increasing our investment in the highest return chocolate business and increasing digital within our media mix. We're also leveraging our precision marketing capability to accelerate growth by executing in-store programming against consumer and geographic preferences by store. Where we're implementing these plans, those retailers are outperforming the market. Nielsen's second quarter measures do not encompass the entire Easter season in both the year ago and current periods. Therefore, my remarks will refer to year-to-date marketplace performance for the 28 weeks ended July 11. Year-to-date, CMG, that's candy, mint and gum, category growth in the xAOC+C channels was up plus 2.7%. The Hershey's CMG retail takeaway for the year-to-date period through July 11, 2015, in channels that account for about 90% of our U.S. retail business was up 3.1%. Looking past the Easter timeframe, as expected, our retail takeaway accelerated and is up 4.8% for the eight weeks ending July 11. Our overall market share increased to 31.3%, an increase of 0.1 points. Performance by segment is tracking as expected with share gains in chocolate, mint and gum. We're pleased with our chocolate performance where our year-to-date working share is up 0.3 points. This is partially offset by non-chocolate candy performance where we lost market share, as anticipated, as we lapped prior-year JOLLY RANCHER line extensions and last year's launch of Lancaster. We're also making progress within snacks. Brookside bars are now available with initial demand and velocity we need to be on par with the category leaders. This launch as well as Snack Bites and Snack Mix products will expand our confection equities to source volume across the broader snacking space. Recent spread is on track as this flavor profile is differentiated versus the other chocolate spreads within the category. However, the overall jar segment of the chocolate spread category had slowed with household penetration flattish. The instant consumable segment in the spreads category is growing, although it's become more competitive. The Krave business and integration is on track versus our plans. Krave is growing faster than all major competitors, driven by distribution and velocity gains. Items per store and merchandising is growing and net sales should nearly double this year. Outside of the U.S. in our international markets beyond China, business is relatively on track with our plans. In Mexico, net sales in local currency are up mid-single-digits on a percentage basis versus last year and in line with the retail takeaway. As expected, the category at Hershey continue to improve as we lap the VAT tax that was instituted last year. In Brazil, net sales in local currency declined mid-single-digits on a percentage basis versus last year due to the timing of Easter and last year's Reese's launch. But despite the tough macroeconomic environment, year-to-date the chocolate category growth in Brazil has been resilient and is up high single-digits on a percentage basis versus last year. Our market share in Brazil is up 0.3 points with Hershey's and Reese's continuing to gain traction. Now let me address the challenges that we're facing in China. Our chocolate performance this year has been impacted by macroeconomic challenges that we believe impacted shopping behavior. Recall we gained market share in the first quarter, but our growth was lower than the historical performance and our own expectations. And in the second quarter, while category growth returned to low double digits, competitive activity increased as manufacturers responded to poor Chinese New Year sell-through. This resulted in higher levels have increased trade, promotion allowance, discounts that impacted net sales and profitability. June year-to-date chocolate category growth in China was nearly 6%. Hershey year-to-date China chocolate retail takeaway was 4.3%, with market share off 0.1 point. We believe the category will continue to increase at the low double-digit rate we saw in the second quarter, putting it on track to be up 8% to 10% for the full year. Some of the initial work we've done to help ensure that we execute against our plan in China and get back to our winnings ways includes the broader rollout of Brookside Chocolates, distribution into smaller format stores, and continued focus and acceleration of our e-commerce business. Our e-commerce business, while small, is up 60% this year. We're partnering with key third-party online retailers like Tmall, Jingdong, and Yihaodian and learning a lot about digital consumers in China that will help us going forward. China is a priority market for us and we'll be focused on executing against our core brand building business model. For 120 years, our company has persevered and prospered with great people, purpose, and brands, and we believe this model will work in China as we look to gain share in this evolving country and category. As it relates to Shanghai Golden Monkey, I'd like to address some of the factors leading to the estimated impairment charge that we announced in this morning's press release. As we've indicated previously, we acquired the Golden Monkey business to broaden our footprint in China by leveraging both the sales force and the regional and local distributor network in order to diversify Hershey's Chocolate growth, which has historically been leveraged to Tier 1 hypermarkets. Results have been disappointing. We initially thought this was primarily due to macroeconomic headwinds in China. As the integration has progressed and the situation on the ground evolved, we've come to understand that there are significant business issues that we need to address in order to achieve our goals. Accounts receivable collection has remained challenging, and sales continued to slow in the second quarter. Our assessment of the distributor network has made it clear that the network is not as stable as we believed, and therefore the related retail customer reach is not as broad as we believed it to be. As a result, the sales forecast for the business in 2015 around $90 million is less than our initial expectations of at least $200 million. This disappointing performance is impacting profitability. Despite these near-term results, we remain committed to the long-term success of this acquisition as well as the China market. We're taking steps to build a strong foundation for future success, including the appointment of a new chairman and general manager for Golden Monkey with solid China consumer packaged goods experience. We're also looking at the cost structure and different integration strategies that are intended to get the business back on track as quickly as possible. We'll continue to assess and address these issues and their impact on the value of the business as we work towards acquiring the remaining 20% of the business, which we now anticipate will occur in the fourth quarter of 2015. The timing and terms of the second closing will be informed by the results of our ongoing assessment. We estimate that our international and other segment net sales will be about $1 billion this year, with a chocolate share of nearly 10% in China, 14% in Mexico, and 5% Brazil. We like the future growth outlook and prospects of these markets, which are an integral part of our international profile. Now to wrap up, core brand merchandising, programming, and innovation accelerates over the remainder of the year. With the exception of China, there's no change to our advertising and marketing methodology. In these same markets, we continue to refine our plans and we expect North America advertising and related consumer marketing expense to increase at a rate about two times greater than the organic net sales growth rate, and it's generating results. Patricia will provide you with all the details related to the full-year outlook. But excluding China chocolate, M&A and unfavorable FX, net sales are expected to be up around 3.5% to 4%. We feel confident in our North America business plans, where we generate the majority of the company's sales and earnings. The situation continues to evolve in China, and our outlook reflects all the inputs that are available to us today. While further volatility could occur in this market, we wouldn't expect it to have a material impact on our cash flow and strong balance sheet. Our profitable and on-track North America business more than offsets the expected dilution from acquisitions and divestitures, primarily Golden Monkey, of about $0.20 per share, which we expect will result in 2015 full-year adjusted earnings per share diluted growth of 3% to 5%. Let me end by saying that despite these challenges, I am optimistic about our future. We're focused and know what we need to do to succeed. We're building strong plans that will put us in a position to win wherever we compete. I'm very pleased that we continue to work as a focused team across the entire company. We have experienced leaders in place who have strong records of success and are all focused on increasing value for our shareholders. Now let me turn it over to Patricia, who will provide some additional detail on our financial results. Patricia A. Little - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thank you, J.P. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Second quarter net sales of $1.58 billion were in line with our revised guidance and generated adjusted earnings per share diluted of $0.78, an increase of 2.6% versus last year. Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rate of 1.3 points, net sales increased 1.3% versus the year-ago period. Pricing and net acquisitions and divestitures were a 5.8 percentage point and a 1.4 percentage point benefit, partially offset by 3.6 points of volume elasticity related to the previously-mentioned price increase and lower sales in China. Promotional spending, driven by China direct trade and returns, discounts and allowances, was a 2.3 percentage point headwind. As J.P. stated, North America continues to perform well. As is typical, the second quarter is our smallest quarter as it relates to overall net sales growth given the launch and timing of new products and seasonal growth associated with Halloween and holiday. North American net sales increased by 1.8% versus last year. Excluding the 60 basis point impact of unfavorable foreign-exchange rates in Canada, net sales increased 2.4%. North America net sales were slightly better than expectations, primarily due to solid U.S. CMG performance that was partially offset by snacks and grocery softness, primarily due to increased spreads and baking chips competitive activity. Net price realization was 5.5 point benefit and was offset by volume of 3.6 percentage points due to snacks and grocery sales that were less than anticipated and elasticity related to the pricing actions that was in line with estimates. On a net basis, The Allan Candy Company and Krave acquisitions as well as the Mauna Loa divestiture was a 50 basis point benefit. Turning now to margins, adjusted gross margins increased 130 basis points in the second quarter, driven by net price realization and supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives. Partially offset by obsolescence, unfavorable sales mix and lower volumes. For the full year, we continue to expect that gross margin will increase 135 basis points to 145 basis points, driven by price realization. Operating profit in the second quarter increased 3.3% versus last year, resulting in operating profit margins of 18.3%. The increase was driven by gross margin gains and a decrease in advertising and related consumer marketing expense of about 3%, primarily in China. As expected, North America operating profit increased double digits on a percentage basis versus last year and was ahead of plan. This was partially offset by international performance, again primarily China. Excluding the acquisitions and divestitures, SM&A expenses excluding advertising and related consumer marketing was about the same as the year-ago period. Now let me provide a brief update on our international business. Total international and other segment net sales for the second quarter declined 12.1% versus last year. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates were a six-point headwind, and the Shanghai Golden Monkey acquisition was an eight point benefit. The international and other segment core business was off about 14 points due primarily to China chocolate business performance where sales declined $35 million. We believe China chocolate category performance was impacted by macroeconomic challenges and trends that are affecting consumer behavior, lower trips in Tier 1 hypermarkets, increased competitive activity, and accelerated momentum of e-Commerce and online purchases. As JP stated, over the remainder of the year, we're focused on the broader rollout of Brookside chocolates, distribution into smaller format stores, and continued focus and acceleration of our e-Commerce business. None of us are happy with the developments around the Golden Monkey acquisition and integration. Our latest outlook for the business is obviously different than the acquisition model. Our initial estimated non-cash impairment charge of about $250 million reflects the write down of the goodwill. There is a lot of in-country analysis and fieldwork going on to assess the potential of the business and the value of the sales and distributor network. Once this work is complete, we'll have a final amount related to the impairment charge. We estimate full year Golden Monkey net sales of about $90 million, but this is subject to change based on the ongoing work mentioned previously. On a constant-currency basis, net sales in Mexico, Brazil, and India were relatively in line with our expectations. Given the macroeconomic and competitive environment in Mexico and Brazil, we're pleased with our performance. Looking at year-to-date because of Easter timing, local currency sales in Mexico and Brazil are up about 10% and 7% respectively. Plans are in place that should result in similar net sales increases over the remainder of the year. In India, Q2 local currency sales were off about 2%. The brands that we are investing in, JOLLY RANCHER, Sofit and Jumpin are up double digits. This was offset by the legacy low margin hard candy business, which we previously indicated we would rationalize. Therefore, we expect total international and other segment net sales, including foreign currency headwinds and net contribution from M&A to decline mid-single digits for the full year. Moving down the P&L, second quarter interest expense of $18.9 million declined $2.4 million versus last year. For the full year we continue to expect interest expense to be in the $75 million to $80 million range. The adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was 35.3%, relatively in line with our estimates. Last quarter, we stated that the full year adjusted net tax rate would be slightly lower than a year ago. Driven by U.S. government investment tax credits, we expect the tax rate to be about 30% in the second half of the year and around 32.5% for the full year. However, there will be a corresponding offset or expense related to the write-down of the investment tax credit within the other income and expense line item. Hence the net effect of the full year net income of the tax credits is only about $5 million. For the second quarter of 2015, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 221 million shares, leading to an adjusted earnings per share diluted of $0.78, or an increase of 2.6% versus a year ago. Let me now provide a quick recap of year-to-date adjusted results. Net sales increased 1.9% in the first half. Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates, net sales increased 3.1% versus the year ago period. Operating profit decreased 2%, resulting in an operating profit margin of 19.4%. Year-to-date adjusted gross margin was 46.6% versus 46% last year, or 60 basis points higher as a result of net price realization gains and supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives partially offset by higher input costs and obsolescence. Adjusted earnings per share diluted in the first half decreased about 1.6% to $1.87 per share. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow, at the end of the second quarter, net trading capital increased versus last year's second quarter by $80 million. Accounts receivable were higher by $20 million and remain extremely current. Inventory was higher by $19 million and accounts payable declined by $41 million. Total capital additions, including software, were $90 million in the second quarter. For the year, we continue to expect total capital expenditures to be about $375 million to $400 million, including the capital related to the Johor, Malaysia project of about $110 million. During the second quarter, depreciation and amortization was $60 million, in line with our estimates. Dividends paid were $115 million. Earlier today, we announced a dividend increase of 9%. We have strong North American marketplace position and remain confident about the long term growth potential of our business. In the second quarter, no shares have been purchased against the $250 million authorization approved in February 2015. In the second quarter, the company repurchased $9 million of common shares, or $143 million year-to-date, to replace shares issued in connection with the exercise of stock options. Cash and short term investments at the end of the second quarter were $402 million. This is lower than a year ago, primarily due to the Krave and Golden Monkey acquisitions. The company continues to generate substantial free cash flow and has a strong balance sheet. It is well positioned to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements and acquisitions. As J. P. summarized, over the remainder of the year, net sales will be driven by strong Halloween and holiday seasonal programming and the continued rollout of new products in North America. In addition we have made adjustments to the China business strategy to address the changing environment. In North America, advertising and related consumer marketing is expected to increase about two times the organic net sales growth rate. These investments will enable us to build on our North America momentum, positioning us to deliver on our objectives. As a result, the company estimates full year net sales will increase about 1.5% to 2.5%, including a net contribution from acquisition and divestitures of about one point and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of about 1.5 points. Excluding unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, full year net sales are expected to increase about 3% to 4%. We continue to have a significant focus on gross margin and expect solid North America price realization and productivity and cost savings to result in 2015 gross margin expansion of 135 basis points to 145 basis points. Combined with the $10 million to $15 million in savings from the productivity initiatives announced in June, we expect adjusted earnings per share diluted to be in the $4.10 to $4.18 range, an increase of 3% to 5% versus last year. This includes dilution from acquisitions and divestitures of about $0.20 per share. Thank you for your time this morning. J.P., Mark and I will now take any questions you may have. Operator : Our first question is from Matthew Grainger from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Mark K. Pogharian - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, Matthew. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Matthew. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Thanks. J.P., I just wanted to ask two questions, which I guess point a little bit toward setting our expectations for the next 12 to 18 months. Just firstly on the international and other business, you've faced some structural issues in the category, but obviously a fair number of temporary headwinds as well. And just as we're thinking about your expectations for the margin profile of that segment, is there any guidance you can give us just to help set our bearings for where things could correct to in 2016 once promotion subsides, once all the inventory absorption is behind you? John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Specifically on that, I think I would make two comments. The first comment is we're always gross margin focused, and we're always very aware of how can we ensure that the activities that we have outside the U.S. are directionally constructive for us from a gross margin standpoint as we continue to build our manufacturing footprint around the world. We continue I think to head in a positive direction there. In terms of investment and structure, we want to make sure that we continue to pace ourselves to right-size for what we see as the opportunity. So as you know, we currently have this project in place where we're looking at the structure of the organization, so we'll be very mindful of that. And then as we specifically look at a market like China and we think about investments in the second half, we want to make sure that the profile that we have in terms of DMEs, et cetera, is appropriate to what we see as the opportunities and where we continue to expand our brand. So we're going to be working on building our core distribution. We want to continue to deepen our distribution coverage. But at the same time, based on that pace we'll also dictate how we activate our brands from a DME standpoint, et cetera. So I think those are some things that you'll continue to see. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks, J.P. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And then just with respect to share repurchases, Patricia, you talked about the fact that you've done relatively little this year other than offsetting the options dilution. But as a result of working through some of the issues that you've been facing and the impact on the stock, is your thinking regarding the opportunity to utilize the share repurchase authorization shifting at all? What's the argument against increasing leverage a bit and becoming a bit more active on the buybacks? Patricia A. Little - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I would point out that long term we really haven't shifted our point of view. Our first goal is to invest in the business both organically and through M&A. Then we're going to look to the dividend and then to share repurchase. But I take your point. I think it's a good one, and it's one of the things that we're looking hard at in this space. So basically in the second quarter, we're very focused on China, making sure that we had good line of sight on that and that we really could see our way forward on that. But it's certainly something that's on my radar screen, and I'd say watch this space. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you both. Operator : Our next question is from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Mark K. Pogharian - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, Bryan. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Bryan. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Good morning, everyone. J.P., my question is about your long-term growth objectives. And I guess when you set them originally, there was better growth, especially in the international markets you were targeting, so the macro was better. And since then, the growth has slowed. And also, frankly, you've made an acquisition which isn't going to turn out to grow as fast as you thought. And you made that acquisition with the assumption of it helping you achieve your growth objectives. So I guess my question is, A), why not, or are you considering, and why shouldn't the long-term growth objectives come down? And second, if they're not, what's going to be better to help you get there? Because the goodwill write-down in and of itself suggests that Golden Monkey won't deliver as much growth as you thought, and also it seems like the macro is slower. So if you could just square those for us, that would be helpful. Thanks. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : It's probably a bit too early to talk about some of the long-term guidance as we continue to look at a number of the forces and factors that we're dealing with. At the same time, we continue to be very positive on a number of pieces of our business. Certainly, we feel like North America is firming and heading in the right direction. We want to continue to invest there. And our other international markets, ex-China things are about where we thought they would be. Obviously, FX is a headwind and is beyond our ability to predict perfectly. And so before we add specificity, I would say, to how we want to think about the long term, we really need to get our hands around some of these shorter-term issues. But in terms of our business model strategies that we have, we're still very committed to that. And I guess one of the things I would say is, when you look at a focused strategy like we have in our international businesses around some very attractive core markets, we don't have a legacy of businesses in every corner of the earth. We get the significant advantage of those markets when they're doing really well, and we feel that when there could be some bumps along the way, but we still think it's the right approach. We're still very early in building our brands. And so I continue to be really optimistic about the long-term forecast. And usually, we talk about that in the fall, and we'll add specificity at that time. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : But fair to say that's part of the process that you're going through your planning process for next year and your evaluation phase, it's something you are evaluating? John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Absolutely. And I think it's important to remember that North America is probably growing at a 3% to 4% range. That's really healthy. We feel good about our innovation pipeline. So as we talk about our growth algorithm, that is still in place. We continue to grow market share. So let us get back to you with the specificity in the fall, and just assume that we want to have the best sense of how we see the business coming out of this year. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, thank you. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Ken Goldman. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Operator, do we have another question? Operator : Yes. Our next question is from Ken Goldman. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Can you hear me? Operator : Our next question is from Ken Goldman. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Ken. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning, everyone, so two questions. This was the second biggest 2Q gross margin in company history, just by higher inputs. Your gross margins are going up at a time when many food companies are heading the other way. You have cocoa and milk dropping next year, which is possible, and you keep getting productivity, you're going to see another gross margin jump again. So I just wanted to pick your brain a little bit, not to criticize actually, it's obviously a great trend, but how sustainable is that? Because I know the chocolate category has very little private label, but the history of food, right, is when gross margins get too high, eventually value-oriented competitors are going to sniff out an opportunity here. So I'm just curious, how do you balance that between the goal of taking margin and growing it and making sure you're not creating a price umbrella to create or attract competition? John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think a couple of things that I would just point to is we always talk being gross margin focused, but we also at the same time don't really set for ourselves a specific level of gross margin that we have to be at. And if you look at the scale that we have in North America and the value of high quality chocolate that's available in North America. It's the best cost per pound of chocolate really anywhere in the world across the major manufacturers. And I think that's one of the things that the value that the category offers has really been one of the things that's insulated it from significant owned label or private-label entry points. So that's really the biggest thing that's probably kept it there. I think another thing that we're thinking a little bit differently about, Ken, that may be from some of the things we've said in the past, while we still have the majority of our portfolio which is both a good value and really mass-position, we also are really spending a lot of time thinking about the premium segment as well, and so we're really thinking about it a little bit more broadly in terms of total available share across the categories. So I think that's another way that we look at within our core business expanding our footprint. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That's helpful. Shifting quickly, one of the reasons Golden Monkey was bought was for the distribution right, and the ability of Hersey to flow its legacy product into some new regions or channels. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I realize Golden Monkey itself has been disappointing, but has that other element of its appeal, right, that opening of new paths for Kisses, et cetera, been, I guess, impaired in any meaningful way? John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think the strategy and intent we have with Golden Monkey is still intact. I think what we're really looking at is understanding the rightsizing and some of the business model practices that we have on a global basis and how do we integrate the broadest spectrum of distributors into that. So I think in terms of if you look at that business on a weighted basis and do we still have value within some of those distributors, the fact of the matter is, yes, and the strategy is right. At the same time, as you can imagine, as you take a significant number of distributors and you try to align them into a new business model, there's things that you've got to make changes, and we're addressing that quite transparently upfront. We want to get moving ahead with building the business, so all the reasons that drew us to that business and being able to expand our footprint in China, still are there. We just have to get all the business practices aligned with what we believe is appropriate and what's required of us as a U.S. corporation. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks, and congrats on the new headquarters, too. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. Your line's open. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. I was just looking at the forecast for what the implication is for what North America has to do in the back half. And so if you have \u2013 I think you said international sales would probably come in around $1 billion for the year, and so it's pretty easy to paint that out for international. I'm getting something along the lines of like 3.5% top line growth for North America, then. And that would be an acceleration from the first half, and I just want to understand if I'm getting the numbers right and whether you're expecting the business to be better in the second half? Mark K. Pogharian - Vice President- Investor Relations : Hey, Rob, it's Mark. I know going back to even the January and the April calls, we've been saying we would expect North America organic sales to be up 3% to 3.5%, and we're certainly tracking towards that today, and the retail takeaway is in line with that. I think through the first half of the year, we're pretty close to actually 3%, and you're right, it is greater than that in the second half, and I know there are a number of new products and fees in that, J.P. or Michele can address. But I think you're thinking about it the right way. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Let me \u2013 Michele Buck, as you know, is the President of our North American business, he's here with us this morning, why don't I ask her to give us a little bit of perspective on the business in North America. Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Michele G. Buck - President- North America : Hey, hello. Good morning, guys. Let me talk a little bit about North America overall, and then I'll hit some of the highlights of some of the great programming that we have coming in the back half so that you can get a little bit more color underneath what's going on there. As we look at the year, certainly our core brands are doing really well, and a healthy core is a key foundation to our business. We believe our advertising is working, we're investing, as you know, this year incrementally behind that to really support the pricing conversion. Our advertising appears to be working. We have shifted some of our spend to digital. We think that's a really smart move and while we don't have all of the robust analytics we have on base advertising, it appears to be working quite well. We have a new campaign on Hersey that appears to be resonating really well with millennials and driving some nice growth there. As we came into the year, we said a lot of the year would be dependent on us having successful execution of the pricing and the price conversion is on track, so we feel great about that. As I look at innovation, and I'll speak a little bit to the back half of the year, there's a couple of factors that give us confidence in the back half, and I'd say that's innovation, continued momentum on the core and strong visibility to our seasonal sell-ins. Both Halloween and holiday, we have very strong sell-ins. We have the visibility to what the customers are going to buy, so we know what those numbers look like, so feel great about that. And as we look at our innovation, as you recall we launched in Q2 Hershey's Caramels, Ice Breakers Cool Blasts, so they're really just hitting the marketplace, and the results to date have been very positive. Cool Blasts, our trial and velocities are exceeding expectations, and the distribution was a bit slower than we anticipated so we have more to come in the back half, so that should accelerate. Brookside Snack Bars is just launching now, and again, the velocities in market look quite strong, but all the benefit of that volume will come in the back half. We've Kisses Deluxe that hits in Q4, Snack Bites and Snack Mix launching now, and then the acquisitions, especially Krave, will really accelerate towards the back half of the year as Hershey gets more involved with the integration and execution. Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, thanks for all the detail. One quick question also on tax rate. If I run through the numbers on the tax rate guidance for 30% for the next two quarters, but then it's offset by other expense, the other expense is really high. I'm getting something along the lines of $40 million of other expense. Patricia A. Little - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, in fact a little bit higher than that, so we would expect that other expense to be $55 million to $60 million. It's the structure of these investment tax credits where you write them off in the top part of your P&L and the credit part comes in the tax rates. Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): So it's a write-off? Patricia A. Little - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes. In the other income and expense will be the write-off piece and the full benefit of the credit will be in the tax rate. Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Eric Katzman from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Eric. Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, everybody. I guess let me ask a bigger picture question, J. P. In terms of the company's, let's say, M&A capabilities, because I know, and this goes back a ways, but I know that at one point in time years ago when you tried to establish a business in China it disappeared overnight and there was a small write-off. The company's history in Europe was one of failure, and now we have this SGM mess. So is there, say, like is there \u2013 given the M&A, it seems like it's still going to be part of your future as you move globally, like is there something like culturally missing or on the due diligence process that you've done in the past that's just for whatever reason seemingly made the company deal with M&A problems kind of after the deal is signed? John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think, Eric, certainly some of the comments you've made about whether it was Europe or some of these other things, those are certainly pieces of the history. I think also inside there, you look at Brookside, obviously we're on the early side of Krave, Pelon has been a good one. We've had some joint ventures, some have gone quite well, and others we've chosen at particular times to exit from. The thing that I would tell you and I think what's important is we look at this, we've \u2013 if you were to put it within the context of our due diligence process, I don't think we've gone about it in any errant way. We use the best advisors, the best names and family names that you can think of in terms of who you would partner with on looking at these things. I think the landscape in China is certainly a challenging one, and we're certainly finding that out. At the same time, we're being, I think, appropriate in terms of recognizing things when we understand them, and I don't think it's as if there's no value to the strategies we have in Canada. I think the other thing, Eric, that you don't see is that there's a lot of things that we do work on that we pass on, and we pass on it for exactly the kinds of things that you would expect that either once we get under the hood they don't yield what we anticipated or there's things that we're concerned about. So in terms of rigor and so forth, I don't think there's any lack of that. Our goal is to get as many of these things right as we possibly can. You're correct, M&A is going to be important to our overall growth, and you can rest assured that we're reviewing every aspect of everything along the way with regard to this particular acquisition to make sure we learn as much as we can going forward. I'd like to think that we don't have some dark cloud that follows us and somehow we are jinxed, but at any rate that's really kind of how I think about it. Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, thanks for that. And then as a follow up, it just seems like in the second half, I guess, were there some, I guess, maybe one time issues, and I'm just kind of wondering initially how we should think about that to next year. Are these tax structures that you're, I guess, benefiting from or unwinding or however you want to describe it, do those go away next year? And is your comp expense being lowered in the second half and therefore is likely a headwind to next year? John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So let me deal with part of it and probably it's more appropriate if Patricia deal with part of it. As we look at our performance this year, certainly as we accrue for comp, we take into consideration what we believe our performance might be and how that works with our comp plans. But we accrue comp at a rate that assumes what our plan rates are, so we typically don't find big swings there, although if you have a year where adding comp is lower and your performance is higher in the subsequent year, that's a cost but usually the momentum of the business really takes that into consideration. And so usually those are things that aren't that challenging to overcome. And then on the tax bit, I'll let Patricia speak to that. Patricia A. Little - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So you're right, the tax credits that we're doing this year are a period. We can do them again next year, so we'll have that opportunity. And frankly, I'm just getting into our tax attributes and looking forward to finding places to improve upon them. I'll just add one point to the comments J.P. made about some of the other things going on in our expense lines, and that is we're really pleased with the execution on our restructuring that we're in the middle of right now. We're very much on plan, on track to get the expected benefit from that next year, so that will be positive momentum for us next year compared to this year. We'll get a piece of it this year, but the bulk of it will come next year. Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, thank you. I'll pass it on. Operator : Our next question is from David Driscoll from Citigroup. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, David. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you and good morning. So I wanted to go back to China here and just ask a couple of questions. The first one, J.P., is just, and this has nothing to do with Shanghai Golden Monkey. I want to focus on the chocolate operations. The chocolate category in that market is still a very small category relative to the size of the country, $2.7 billion. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Correct. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Your operation is even smaller there. I think last year it was $185 million or something like that. So I suppose what's so hard to understand from the outside is why aren't ongoing distribution gains the dominant factor in driving the business? Why is it that we're looking at \u2013 I think in your script you gave like a 4% number for Hershey and a 6% number for the category. I feel like Hershey's story in China is you're in 14 cities where you advertise or something like that, and you should be in 100 cities. So what am I getting wrong here, and why is this growth not being dominated by distribution expansion across this incredibly large and hopefully hungry for chocolate country? John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, David, I think your comments are certainly appropriate and interesting, and I think we think about it the same way. I guess the execution of accomplishing it is a bit of the pace and challenge. So let me just reset a little bit. If you think about our business in China and distribution build, as you rightly say, we continue to build out our distribution. It's largely \u2013 if you look at our business, about 60% to 65% of our business is done in three channels. It's done in Tier 1 hypermarkets. It's done in supermarkets, and about 15% of the business in both B2C and B2B is done in e-commerce. So our Tier 1 development is pretty significant and specific, and so we've been building \u2013 if you go back over the last five years, you've heard us talk about 10 cities and 35 cities and 110 cities. But a lot of that is really focused in very narrow channels versus maybe what we ultimately want to have happen. And those channels also happen to be ones that were most impacted by some of the macroeconomic influences. And then our portfolio in China tends to lend itself a bit more towards gifting than it does the everyday business. So when you put all of those things together, and our portfolio there is still relatively narrow, it has made us a bit more volatile to some of these forces and factors than I would like to see going forward. So your hypothesis of the importance of growing distribution is absolutely right, and that's what we're focused on and that's what we want to ultimately be able to do with Shanghai Golden Monkey and HISL is to be able to get into the best distributors with the best footprint and push a broader portfolio of our brands into distribution. So that's really where we're headed. That hasn't changed. While we're all frustrated sometimes by the bumps in the road along the way, certainly we're experiencing some of that. But I think as we look over the long term, I continue to have the same commitment and confidence of how we're going to grow our business there. And your first comment is the one that I'd like to end on. This is about category building. It's not about fighting for market share. It's about participating in the growth of this category for the future in a very large and attractive market. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): I appreciate the comments. Thank you. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Growe from Stifel. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Chris. Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Can you hear me okay? John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You bet, thank you. Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. I just had a quick question, like a follow up on China and then one question on the U.S. I just wanted to be clear on the inventory situation in China, what's out there, if you know where a lot of the goods may be, and just what effect it may have on revenue in the second half of the year? John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think that what you're seeing in the second quarter is that we are recognizing where we've identified inventory and where we want to have in food in every category. You want to have the freshest, best stuff out there. So wherever we believe we've had inventory issues, we're trying to remove that product from the marketplace, make sure that we've got the freshest possible product in place, and so hopefully we've addressed most of that. There could still be some cats and dogs here and there, I suppose. But we think we've done a pretty good job of confronting those types of issues, and that's why you're seeing some of the things you're seeing in our second quarter results. Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And just a question for you then as well or separately on the U.S., just to understand, in the second half of the year as you transition to the seasonal merchandise and some pricing coming through there, do you expect elasticity to increase in the second half around the pricing that's coming through now on the seasonal merchandise, just to get a better sense of how the revenue growth will play out in the U.S. in the second half? John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So I think that if you look at the way we modeled pricing elasticity and some of the things that were in my comments, we feel really good about how it's progressing. We should get the benefit of pricing in Halloween because that would be with all of the pricing in versus last year where it was. And so again, as we move through the year, we've always said that as we get to the beginning of 2016, we felt as though we would get back to pre-price increase levels, and that appears to be accurate. Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, thank you for the color. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Alexia Howard from Bernstein. Your line is open. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good morning. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey. Good morning, Alexia. Mark K. Pogharian - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, Alexia. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi there. I just had a couple of questions. First of all on China, are you able to quantify for us how much of a headwind to company-wide organic sales growth the Shanghai Golden Monkey deal is going to be in the second half? Once we lap the anniversary of the acquisition in September, it's going to become part of the organic sales growth base, so is that already built into expectations? And how much of a headwind is that likely to be? And then I have a follow up. Mark K. Pogharian - Vice President- Investor Relations : Yes, Alexia, it's Mark. And we can run through some the math after, but I know in J.P.'s remarks, he talked about excluding China chocolate and all the acquisition and FX. But North America and Rest of World, on an organic basis, we will be up 3.5% to 4%. So outside of China, I mean, I would qualify it as everything else is going pretty well. The 0.5 point reduction in net sales contribution from M&A was obviously all Monkey related. So I can help you back into some of those numbers after the fact. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great, thank you. And then just a quick follow up. At the beginning of the year you were a little uncertain about the outlook for the U.S. chocolate category, I think some concerns about premiumization and just different trends. Have you become more confident in the outlook as the year has progressed? And are you still planning further diversification moves a similar to Krave? Thank you. And I'll pass it on. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, so I think we do feel good about category and we certainly feel good about our performance within the category as we continue to grow share. As you think about the overall snacking continuum, we continue to be enthusiastic, both with some of our R&D pipeline, which we reviewed with our board, in fact, this past week, and I think it was enthusiastically received, and we'll be introducing some of those to the market later in the fall and certainly into 2016. And we continue to see that as an important opportunity. So I'll just end with this. We love the business we're in. Confectionary is at the heart of everything that we do, and it's on one end of the snacking continuum, and we think is one of the greatest categories there is. At the same time, we also see that consumers have a changing relationship with food. We see snacking as an important occasion and we think we have a go to market capability and an RD capability to meet those needs. So if on one hand you look at indulgent and you were to imagine on the far end functional, we see that we have a broadening role to play across that entire continuum, and I'm enthusiastic to share with you as we go forward what some of those things are. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great, thank you. I'll pass it on. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Mark K. Pogharian - Vice President- Investor Relations : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Okay. We'll take our final question is a follow up from Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. Your line's open. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Rob. Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Sorry. Can you clarify, is your tax rate going to stay at 32.5% next year because of the tax credit, or is this just this year? Patricia A. Little - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : That particular impact is a single-year impact. But again, it's another tool in our tool chest that we can certainly reuse next year as well. Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): You can do it again next year? Patricia A. Little - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes, we could. That's a discrete event \u2013 a decision that we'll make for next year. Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): So the write-off, it's positive from the cash flow perspective. Mark K. Pogharian - Vice President- Investor Relations : Yes. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Patricia A. Little - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Absolutely. Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): All right, thank you. Mark K. Pogharian - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you for joining us today. We'll be available for any follow-up calls you may have later on. Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today's program. You may now disconnect at any time.",

Bernstein & Co. LLC Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Operator : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to The Hershey Company's third quarter 2015 results conference call. My name is Lindy, and I will be your conference operator today. All participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please note this call may be recorded. Thank you. Mr. Mark Pogharian, you may begin your conference. Mark K. Pogharian - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Lindy. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to The Hershey Company's third quarter 2015 conference call. J.P. Bilbrey, Chairman, President and CEO; and Patricia Little, Senior Vice President and CFO, will provide you with an overview of our results, which will then be followed by a Q&A session. Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2014 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the Note section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. As a result, we will discuss third quarter results, excluding net pre-tax charges of $140 million or $0.47 per share-diluted, primarily related to the productivity initiative announced in June, a non-cash impairment charge in China and costs associated with the early extinguishment of debt. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges. With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Mark. In the third quarter, our efforts were focused on ensuring successful execution of our seasonal plans, which are on track and should result in good Halloween and holiday seasons. We were pleased with North America gross margin expansion that resulted in solid operating profit growth; however, organic net sales growth was less than expected. North America organic net sales increased 3.2%, ahead of CMG marketplace performance, primarily due to the timing of seasonal shipments and snack sales that don't get captured in the Nielsen CMG database. Hershey U.S. candy, mint and gum, or CMG, retail takeaway in the third quarter was about plus 0.3%, less than category growth, resulting in market share loss of 0.4 points. Lower than expected levels of merchandising and programming in select retailers led to consumption trends that were below our estimates. Mainstream snacking categories like salty, snack cakes, and meat snacks also saw consumption slow in the third quarter versus the June year-to-date trends. Additionally, consumer retail trips in the third quarter were lower, down almost 4%. By channel, trips performance was mixed. On a percentage basis versus last year trips, they declined high single digits in drug and convenience stores, low single digits in grocery, and were up mid-single digits in club. Trends appear to have improved as we exited September. And in October, CMG in-store merchandising and programming has been executed and should result in Hershey share gains in the important Halloween season. Third quarter CMG category performance by segment was mixed. ICE BREAKERS COOL BLASTS is doing very well. The ICE BREAKER brand continues to drive both gum and mint category growth, and this period was no exception. Specifically, our third quarter gum and mint retail takeaway was about 9% and plus 16%, leading to solid market share gains in these segments. Chocolate category performance was soft in the third quarter, up 0.4%. Hershey chocolate retail takeaway was off, minus 0.5%, resulting in a market share decline of 0.4 points. We believe our performance was impacted by a later than normal Labor Day, the aforementioned lower levels of trips and in-store merchandising and programming. We also had lower year-over-year advertising GRPs. In the fourth quarter, U.S. advertising GRPs will reach the highest level of the year, and seasonal merchandising and programming is in place. Combined with the Reese's NCAA College Game Day promotion and the launch of Hershey's Kisses Deluxe, we expect improvement in chocolate marketplace trends in the fourth quarter. Non-chocolate candy, or NCC, category growth in the third quarter was plus 3.3%. In-store activity and merchandising within this segment of the category was greater than what we've seen in many years. Given the 2014 activity that we're lapping, the prior-year launch of Lancaster Caramels and JOLLY RANCHER line extensions, Hershey's NCC third quarter market share was off one point. We expect our NCC performance to improve in 2016 as we leverage The Allan Candy capabilities and the brands. We're also making progress within snacks and grocery. Brookside bars are now available with initial demand and velocity on par with the category leaders. And we'll continue to build on Brookside's equity in 2016 with the launch of three flavors of Brookside yogurt, fruit and nut bars. We also had a limited introduction launch of Hershey's Reese's and PAYDAY Snack Bites and snack mix products. These sweet and salty offerings are off to a strong start and, in some cases, we've extended the brand and secured space in addition to the confectionery aisle. The early read is positive in the C-stores, where we have distribution at front-end checkouts. Switching to meat snacks, as I stated earlier, category growth here also slowed a bit in the third quarter, although it was primarily due to under-performance of the mainstream portion of the category. Looking at premium or artisan meat snacks, where KRAVE plays, this sub-segment of the category increased about 40% in the third quarter and was relatively in line with the growth rates of the four, 12 and 52-week periods. The KRAVE business and integration is progressing well, and retail takeaway is significantly outpacing the category, driven by velocity and distribution gains. Items per store and merchandising is growing, and net sales should nearly double this year. We feel good about our snacking and adjacency initiatives and believe meat snacks, snack bars, as well as snack bites and snack mix products, give us an opportunity to source volume and sales across the broader snacking category. Now for an update on our International business, given the macroeconomic environment in our focused markets, broad category and Hershey growth was challenging. Combined, third quarter constant currency net sales in Mexico and Brazil increased mid-single digits on a percentage basis versus last year in a very tough environment. Constant currency net sales in India declined, in line with estimates. And recall, this was expected as we phased out our sales of edible oil products. Importantly, India core brand sales increased high single digits on a percentage basis versus last year. The Shanghai Golden Monkey integration is progressing. And we've increase our resources on the ground as we move forward. We're very focused on integrating the business and executing against our selling plan. It's a bit too early to discuss our 2016 initiatives, but we're cautiously optimistic that we'll be able to leverage the core Golden Monkey products in the Chinese New Year period, given that 2016 is the Zodiac Year of the Monkey. In the third quarter, China chocolate net sales were relatively in line with our expectations; however, Q3 chocolate category growth of 4% was less than June year-to-date growth of 6%. It appears that the category continues to be impacted by macroeconomic challenges and trends that are affecting consumer shopping behavior and the acceleration of e-commerce and on-line purchases of broader consumer staples. These factors are leading to lower sales velocities in tier one hypermarkets, where the majority of our chocolate sales are derived, and impacting the impulse-oriented chocolate category. We expect marketplace trends to slightly improve in Q4, but no longer expect the category to increase high single digits for the full year. We're making progress against the initiatives we discussed earlier in the year. Distribution and velocity in the smaller format super and mini channels is on track and Brookside ACV is increasing. As we entered the fourth quarter, Brookside advertising is on-air, displays are being activated at retail, and a digital campaign on WeChat has been established. And we continue to build on our e-commerce momentum. We're particularly pleased with our online business, which in August was up 112% and was focused on Chinese Valentine's Day. For the year-to-date period, our China chocolate e-commerce retail takeaway is up about 55%. We have specific activity for the upcoming Singles' Day and holiday season and believe we're doing some of the right things here, as evidenced by our market share gains in this evolving and important channel. So, while challenging, China is a priority market for us and I believe we're executing against the right fundamentals and are focused on building our business for the long-term. In Mexico, net sales in local currency for the quarter and year-to-date periods are up high single digits on a percentage basis versus last year, driven by our chocolate and Pelon Pelo Rico business. Within the chocolate category, we're seeing good investments by all major manufacturers in the form of new products and core brand investments. As a result, our chocolate marketplace performance has lagged the category. Chocolate market share in the modern trade in Mexico for the year-to-date period is off, as our retail takeaway of about 6% has lagged category growth of about 13%. In Brazil, local currency net sales have sequentially improved versus last quarter and are up low single digits, although retail takeaway slowed in the third quarter, given the challenged macroeconomic environment and increased competitive activity. Brazil chocolate market share for the year-to-date period is up 0.4 points; however, given my aforementioned comments, we would expect the macroeconomic environment in Brazil to pressure Q4 performance. Now to wrap up, our number one goal is to regain momentum in terms of Hershey's marketplace performance as it relates to retail takeaway and market share. Our fourth quarter and 2016 plans are focused and the investment profile is concentrated in the areas where Hershey is advantaged. Specifically, you'll see core brand investments in the form of innovation and marketing, especially a greater focus on digital and a focus on in-store execution as it relates to merchandising and programming. Without getting into specific details related to 2016, our initial plans are balanced from a top and bottom line perspective. Next year, we lap charges in China related to trade promotion that have pressured results this year. We'll also benefit from the productivity initiatives related to the organization simplification program announced in June, and have good visibility into our cost structure as it relates to raw materials. We believe this setup gives us the flexibility to invest in core initiatives that drives growth while also building on our equities within the snack mix, snack bar, and meat snack categories. At the same time, we're also doing strategic planning work and assessing our long-term targets. Acquiring the remaining 20% of Shanghai Golden Monkey impacts this. So when this occurs, we'll be able to share our integration plans and potential cost savings as it relates to our combined businesses in China. In the fourth quarter, our seasonal business plans are strong and complement the activity related to core brand merchandising, programming and innovation. Per my earlier comments, North America advertising and related consumer marketing expense accelerates and we expect CMG retail takeaway trends to improve. Patricia will provide you with all of the details related to the full-year outlook, but, excluding unfavorable FX, 2015 total company net sales are expected to increase 1.5% to 2.5%. Solid gross margin expansion, driven by the very profitable U.S. business and other productivity and cost savings, more than offsets greater than expected dilution from acquisition and divestitures, and should result in 2015 full year adjusted earnings per share-diluted growth towards the low end of the 3% to 5% range. 2015 hasn't unfolded the way that we had planned, but we remain focused on strong execution of our plans. Candy, mint and gum has been one of the better performing categories in the store for many years. It's a destination category, impulsive, and very profitable for retailers. As a result, it typically garners key floor space within the store as it relates to merchandising and programming; however, over the last two years, it appears that income bifurcation and expanded choice among snacking is having an impact on generating consistent CMG category growth. While overall consumer confidence is trending up, lower income consumers continue to be fragile as income and wage growth has been minimal. Higher income and more confident consumers are driving premium growth, while cost-conscious consumers are driving the value segment. As indicated last quarter and in my remarks today, in 2016, we'll introduce candy products and programs that will leverage our ubiquitous distribution, specifically targeting our core everyday candy business, as well as the mass premium and value segments where we're currently under-represented. I look forward to sharing these plans with you in January. We have strong financial resources and technical capabilities and I have a passionate team of leaders and coworkers who are committed to winning in the marketplace. I'll now turn it over to Patricia, who will provide some additional detail on our financial results. Patricia A. Little - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thank you, J.P. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Third quarter net sales of $1.96 billion were in line with prior year and generated adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.17, an increase of $0.12 or 11.4% versus last year. Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates of two points, about half a point greater than our estimates, net sales increased 2%. Pricing in net acquisitions and divestitures were a 5.8 points, a half a point benefit, partially offset by 4.3 points of lower volume related to pricing elasticity in North America and lower sales in China. As J.P. stated, North America gross margin and operating income growth was solid; however, U.S. marketplace consumption trends were less than our estimates, and as a result, sales shipments were softer than expected. Excluding the 1.1 point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates in Canada, North America net sales increased 3.5% versus the year-ago period. Net price realization was a 6.9 point benefit, and volume was off 3.7 points, due to elasticity related to the pricing action. The volume impact was in line with estimates, when adjusted for the trip declines that J.P. referenced. On a net basis, The Allan Candy and KRAVE acquisitions and the Mauna Loa divestiture were a 30 basis point benefit. Total International and Other segment net sales for the third quarter declined 15% versus last year. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates were a 7.9 point headwind, and the Shanghai Golden Monkey acquisition a 2.3 point benefit. The International and Other segment core business volume was off about 10 points, due primarily to China chocolate business performance, where sales declined $18 million. Turning now to margins, adjusted gross margin increased 220 basis points in the third quarter, driven by net price realization and supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by international trade allowances, primarily in China. Operating profit in the third quarter increased by 9.1% versus last year, resulting in operating profit margins of 21.2%. The increase was driven by gross margin gains and lower SM&A, selling, marketing and administrative expenses. SM&A, excluding advertising and related consumer marketing, increased about 2.8%. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, SM&A expenses, excluding advertising and related consumer marketing, declined 2.8% as we remain focused on nonessential spending and look to leverage existing resources. By segment, North America operating profit increased low double digits on a percentage basis versus last year and is on plan. This was partially offset by International performance, primarily China. Now, let me provide a brief update on our International business. China chocolate category performance continues to be below the historical CAGR growth rate of 11% to 12%. In Q3, chocolate category performance was sluggish in both hyper and small format stores, and impacted all major manufacturers, including those whose innovations been driving the market. Over the remainder of the year, we're focused on the broader rollout of Brookside chocolates, distribution into smaller format stores, and our e-commerce business. We're making progress in areas that will benefit the business over the long-term. However, in the short-term, chocolate results in China could remain pressured if lower hypermarket trips and category growth continues to track at these lower levels. This scenario could have an impact on our Chinese New Year sell-in assumptions over the remainder of the year. Shanghai Golden Monkey integration is slowly continuing and we're finishing work that will indicate which distributors we'll invest with going forward. Golden Monkey gross sales for the full year are in line with previous estimates; however, we had some true-ups on sales promotions and the current net sales estimate for Golden Monkey in 2015 is now around $80 million, less than our prior expectations. These true-ups, plus an adjustment to the tax rate, which I'll discuss in a few moments, are the primary drivers of the increase in M&A dilution from about $0.20 to $0.35 per share-diluted. On a local currency basis, combined net sales in Mexico and Brazil increased mid-single digits on a percentage basis versus last year. Year-to-date, local currency sales in Mexico and Brazil are up about 10% and 5%, respectively. The macroeconomic environment and competitive dynamics in Latin America continue to be a challenge, and we would expect it to be a headwind as it relates to fourth quarter performance. India third quarter local currency sales were off about 20% as we began the phase-out of edible oils, which were discontinued at the end of the third quarter. Excluding the edible oil business, India core business sales increased 7%. The brands that we're investing behind, JOLLY RANCHER and SOFIT, continue to do well in the marketplace. Moving down the P&L, third quarter interest expense of $18.6 million declined $2.5 million versus last year, or 11.9%. For the full-year, we expect interest expense to be at the low end of the $75 million to $80 million range. The adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 33.5%. This is greater than our previous estimate of about 30%, due to the timing of the U.S. Government investment tax credits we discussed last quarter, and an adjustment to the tax rate related to Golden Monkey net operating loss carry-forward. As a result, we expect the fourth quarter and full year tax rates to be about 31% and 33.5%, respectively. In the fourth quarter, we expect to record $35 million within the other income and expense line related to the U.S. Government investment tax credits. Hence, the net effect on full year net income of the tax credits is about $5 million. For the third quarter of 2015, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 220 million shares, down $3.8 million versus last year and a $0.02 benefit in the quarter, resulting in adjusted earnings per share-diluted of $1.17, or an increase of 11.4% versus year ago. Let me now provide a quick recap of year-to-date adjusted results. Year-to-date net sales increased 1.2%. Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates, net sales increased 2.7% versus the year-ago period. Operating profit increased about 2%, resulting in an operating profit margin of 20%. Year-to-date adjusted gross margin was 46.4% versus 45.2% last year, or 120 basis points higher, as a result of net price realization and supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by higher input costs and obsolescence. Year-to-date adjusted earnings per share-diluted increased about 3.1% to $3.04 per share. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow, at the end of the third quarter, net trading capital decreased versus last year's third quarter by $39 million. Accounts receivable was lower by $26 million and remains extremely current. Inventory was lower by $87 million and accounts payable declined by $74 million. Total capital additions, including software, were $86 million in the third quarter $238 million year-to-date. For the year, we expect total capital expenditures to be around $350 million. This is less than our previous forecast of $375 million to $400 million, due to lower capital requirements related to the Johor, Malaysia project, which is now estimated to be about $80 million in 2015. During the third quarter, depreciation and amortization was $64 million and dividends paid were $124 million. In the third quarter, the company repurchased $230 million of outstanding shares against the $250 million authorization approved in February, 2015. For the year-to-date period, the company repurchased $403 million of outstanding shares. In addition, the company repurchased $22 million of common shares in the quarter and $165 million year-to-date to replace shares issued in connection with the exercise of stock options. Cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $344 million. This is lower than year ago, primarily due to acquisitions and the share buyback. The company continues to generate substantial free cash flow and has a very strong balance sheet. In the fourth quarter, North America in-store seasonal merchandising and programming is secured. And on-air advertising reaches its highest point of the year, but as J.P. mentioned, lower consumer trips and the macroeconomic environment continue to be a challenge within the retail environment as we wind down the year and look to 2016. We're confident in our ability to execute at the retail level and provide consumers with CMG and snack products that can drive growth. As a result, we do expect North America marketplace performance to improve over the remainder of the year. Given year-to-date results, the aforementioned challenges in international markets, and slightly higher than expected FX headwinds, we estimate that full year net sales will be about the same as, to slightly up, versus 2014. Including a net contribution from acquisitions and divestitures of about a point, and excluding an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of at least 1.5 points, net sales are expected to increase 1.5% to 2%. This is less than the low end of the previously-provided outlook of 3%. We continue to expect solid gross margin growth in 2015, driven by North America price realization; however, given year-to-date results and the impact of higher levels of international trade promotion, the company expects margin expansion at the low end of the 135 to 145 basis point estimate. We're also focused on nonessential SM&A expenses and will leverage existing resources and given performance will also benefit from lower than estimated other employee-related costs. In addition, expected 2015 savings from the business productivity initiative announced in June is estimated to be around $25 million versus the previous estimate of $10 million to $15 million. As a result, we expect adjusted earnings per share-diluted to be at the low end of the 3% to 5% range, or approximately $4.10 per share-diluted. This includes dilution from acquisitions and divestitures of about $0.35 per share, which is greater than the previous estimate of about $0.20 per share-diluted. Thank you for your time this morning. J.P., Mark and I will now take any questions you may have. Operator : Our first question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Ken. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, everyone. So we've now had about two years of performance that's come in, I think it's fair to say, worse than initial expectations. And I realize a lot of it's China, but some of it's domestic, too, right? I guess my question is this. You're guiding to better performance ahead, but why should we on the outside have a particularly high amount of confidence in that outlook? Because I know you said you're seeing better trends in October, but it feels like every quarter something unexpected starts to bite this category. So why should we have really a high level of confidence that 4Q will come in sort of as you're expecting? Is there anything particular that you're looking at that gives you that sort of upward trend in your outlook maybe? John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well I think, Ken, first of all, if I talk about the last couple of years, is clearly we've been in an environment which has been a bit different than we were in some of the previous years. So I think that as we continue to get greater clarity around at least our thinking, we think that consumer bifurcation has been an important driver. We're also seeing that there's expanded choice across the broader snacking continuum. As an example, snack bars, there's about 30% more SKUs in the category than there has been over the last couple of years. So we think we've had some trial there on some of those brands that has impacted some of our CMG brands. And then, of course, we've had the trips issue, where we've seen a continuing decline in trips across the category. And on an everyday and instant consumable basis, that's had a trending impact against our business as well. So, I think those are some things that we have to solve for. I feel good about the contribution we've had from innovation into our business over that period of time, so it's continued to contribute as we have hoped it would. And then, I think as we move into 2016, we have to have a balanced approach, continue to execute against the fundamentals. I think the pricing is actually coming through about as we would have anticipated. And so, really it's about the magic elixir of volume and how do we continue to drive and bring consumers into the category. And I think those are all things that, as I look to 2016, will be in our favor. I would expect the international \u2013 the biggest impact we have against the business is, of course, FX. I don't know that we'll be in that environment forever. And then, we really hope to get ourselves in a good place in China that we can begin to benefit for the reasons that we had the acquisition there. So I agree with you. It's been unusual in 2015, been some macroeconomic winds, but I think the fundamentals in the category for retailers continue to be attractive as a category. And we have to execute well. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you for that, but aren't those fundamentals getting less attractive? I mean, I'm just confused about why the optimism, if trips are down at a time when crude oil is down and fuel is down. Usually trips are up in that kind of scenario. So I'm just a little confused about what's driving some of the headwinds you're seeing right now? John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think that if you look at the merchandising that we've seen on the floor, so quality merchandise at some large retailers. They've had a bit more of a clean floor policy than they've had, so we have to adjust and make sure that we're doing the best we can to get our fair share of that merchandising. And then, as we move into Q4, we've got, I think, attractive investments from a GRP standpoint against our brands and we'll continue to build our brands as we go into 2016. So, I can't tell you that on a single Monday morning the world changes, but I think the dynamics of the category continue to be attractive. Consumers are snacking more than they ever have before. We have to make sure our portfolio is attractive, and then we have to build brands within that. And I think history would suggest that we know how to do that and as the consumer participates, we're going to definitely win against our programs. Operator : Your next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Athlos Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jonathan P. Feeney - Athlos Research : Good morning. Thanks very much. Just to follow up on Ken's question a little bit, real specific, in North America where you had a little bit disappointing volume, can you talk about not only this quarter, the difference between your everyday business and your seasonal business? And then you talked about programming going into the fourth quarter. How is that looking? How is your level of confidence in the everyday business looking versus that seasonal business that's been so steady for the company over the past couple of years? Thanks very much. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we know one of the biggest drivers of the everyday business is effective advertising. And we have strong programming in Q4 that we think will support the everyday business. And that's one of the areas which we really have to focus against on some of our core brand growth and ensure that our advertising is working hard for us. That's a part of Q4. We continue to execute well against seasons, so we expect in the important Halloween period that we're going to win share there. So I feel, as you say, we've done well there. I feel good about that. And the everyday business is really impacted by trips. So we really are going to have to see an environment where across retailers, that trips begin to help us a bit, where I think it's been a drag on the business overall here over the last 12 to 18 months. Jonathan P. Feeney - Athlos Research : That's helpful, J.P. So just so I'm clear, relative to expectations, it sounds like the everyday business has been a little bit tougher than seasonal has been relative to expectations. Is that right? John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I think that's right. Yes. Mark K. Pogharian - Vice President- Investor Relations : Yeah. I think what you saw, Jon, that year-to-date June, I think trips were down roughly 2% across xAOC+C. And in the third quarter, you saw trips down 4%. And you saw, as J.P. referenced in his remarks, C-store, for example, was down 9%. Now, it feels like and the early look on the data looks like September and October got better, but it's that kind of choppiness that we historically haven't seen and that's been with us now \u2013 or really, the retail environment in CPG space all along \u2013 going on a year and a half, two years now. Jonathan P. Feeney - Athlos Research : And since, by definition, people are stocking-up for seasonal, like Halloween trick-or-treating or whatnot, it's a little bit less affected by trips, right? John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Correct. Jonathan P. Feeney - Athlos Research : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Mark K. Pogharian - Vice President- Investor Relations : Morning, Chris. Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good morning. I had just two quick questions, if I could. I want to understand, first of all, in the U.S., with consumption being down a little bit, but your revenue is being up in the quarter, just the shipments versus takeaway and I guess maybe this is a better indication of the seasonal shipping that occurred in the quarter. I just thought I'd get a little more color around that gap that occurred in 3Q. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. So you saw a bit of a benefit just trying to get seasons on the floor as early as we could, given some of the other things that we're seeing. So we did have good seasonal shipments in Q3 to support some of the merchandising that's happening in Q4. And then the other thing you don't see in those numbers, which was also a benefit, is some of our snacks and adjacencies, which don't get measured in the CMG numbers, and I think those were close to a point benefit to our business. Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you for that. If I could ask a quick question really around the guidance and this incremental dilution occurring from acquisitions, the $0.35, I think you've been on $0.20 previously. Does that incremental gap in relation to the reduction in earnings guidance you have for the year suggest more dilution that what you've lowered your guidance for the year? Does that imply a better North American performance, I guess, essentially or better overall, let's call it, non-SGM performance? Patricia A. Little - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Hi. It's Patricia. Yes. So it definitely reflects better performance in our bottom line to overcome that added dilution. I think of it in sort of two buckets. One is in the expense line, where, as I mentioned before, we have greater savings from our restructuring project that we announced in June. We've kept a very tight lid on discretionary spending, and that's probably about half of the difference. I would say that the other half of the difference is more sort of technical things related to movement within the range, as well as, as I mentioned in my remarks, interest at the lower end as well as the buyback. So those are the two big buckets that we're using to make up that difference. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, John. John J. Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Good morning. J.P., wondering if you could speak more to China in terms of maybe what you're seeing with the competition as it concerns price promotion and innovation and then maybe where you see the bottom occurring as this all plays out. And from an expense perspective, I realize you haven't provided 2016 guidance, but how should we be thinking about incremental cost in China as you focus more on the small format retailers or maybe even opportunities to adjust your cost structure lower for the lower sales base? John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Let me take the China piece and I'll talk specifically about our Hershey business in China. So as you probably heard us talk before, we are heavily weighted to the hypermarket channel in China versus having deeper distribution. So even as we've grown our distribution, it's largely been in the Tier 1 cities and it's also been more weighted to hypermarkets. And the hypermarket channel has been more negatively impacted over the last 12 months than have other channels, although the total category across channels is down. But we're not as well represented and some of those channels have actually done better than the hypermarket channel. So we have a weighting mix issue that's really impacted our business there, which is one of the things that interested us so much in Shanghai Golden Monkey is it gives us better and deeper distribution across smaller stores, supermarkets and then also Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities where appropriate. So we think those factors are still relevant and that we'll benefit from that. Obviously, we've had some struggles in terms of the start-up of Shanghai Golden Monkey, but the real drivers of why we made the acquisition still exist, the distributions channel's there, the manufacturing's there, the brands, et cetera. So we think as we go forward and gain control of that business, we'll definitely benefit from the greater penetration across all the channels. But that's how I would think about what's happening there. And then you have a faster evolution there probably than any place else in terms of e-commerce. So in our category, about 15% of the business is sold in e-commerce. We're right about where the category is. That piece of our business is growing very nicely. So we're participating in that channel development quite nicely. And so those are several things that I would mention about China. John J. Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So as your China recovery plan unfolds, it sounds like you can get more mileage and better leverage out of the inherited Shanghai sales force as opposed to investing more feet on the street yourself? John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. I think that's correct. John J. Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. Thanks, J.P. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Eric. Eric Richard Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Morning, everybody. So I guess two questions, sorry Mark. The first one is, I mean, I know the outlook is a little more challenging than you'd like, but I'm a little bit surprised that the decision to not give an adjusted long-term guidance is hinging on the 20% of Shanghai Golden Monkey that you don't own. I mean, you're already consolidated and just back out the 20%. So that seems like that's just a financial exercise. So is there something about this last 20% that is a real like impact to what you think you can do long-term on a global basis? And then I guess for Patricia, the higher commodity costs that were mentioned as a negative to gross margins this past quarter, I'm a bit surprised. I mean, it seems like most of your inputs are down. So maybe you could give a little bit more color there and maybe a little view into 2016 as you see your hedged inputs. Thanks. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. So, Eric, let's take this in two pieces. I'll start and then Patricia can follow up. So I think that we're being as thoughtful as we possibly can around how we think about our long-term guidance. And I want to move us to an environment where we talk about a little bit long-term guidance and then we can talk about where we think we are within that range. Sometimes we'll be above, below, whatever. But given all of the moving parts that we've seen historically, we've given our guidance on this third quarter call. There's a lot of moving parts. I wouldn't put it, by any means, all of that weighted into what's happening in China. I think it's really we want to make sure that we have a good sense of what 2016 and beyond looks like from a category standpoint. And we'll go from there and we'll probably talk about that in January. Patricia A. Little - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : And it's Patricia, I'll talk about the higher commodity. We did have a little bit of cocoa price inflation in the third quarter, but I just want to go back to the fact that on a net basis, obviously, we're ahead because that cocoa inflation is why we priced. We have good visibility into 2016 and I don't really want to get into this commodity or that commodity because where we remain focused is an overall gross margin focus and you can see that coming through in our third quarter results. Eric Richard Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. All right, I'll pass it on. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, David. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks a lot. Good morning. And thanks for the question. Patricia, I hate to do this, but I got to go over some old ground here. I still don't understand the 2015 guidance reconciliation, so $4.10, when you're barely moving the EPS number, but it's like a tsunami of negatives. You guys, say U.S. sales are weaker. China chocolate sales are weaker. Shanghai Golden Monkey negative $0.35 versus, $0.15 worse than before; tax rate's worse. These are large numbers, so for this EPS number not to move. You then gave some comments to \u2013 and I forget who asked the question -- but you said like the expense line, greater savings. That savings number is $10 million better \u2013 that's like $0.03 or something like that? It's de minimis. Mark K. Pogharian - Vice President- Investor Relations : Well, David, first, one thing, you're double counting on the tax because it's included in the dilution. You don't know where we were in the $10 million to $15 million restructure savings in June, so we could have been at the low end and now at the high end and that's a $15 million delta. Patricia talked about the interest expense. That's now at the low end because we ended up doing the bond deal in August, but. Patricia A. Little - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. And just overall, while you're right in terms of the savings related to the restructuring that we announced in June, as I also mentioned, we're just overall holding the line on discretionary spending beyond that specific impact. And you could see that in our third quarter, where, ex-M&A, we were actually down year-over-year in our SM&A, excluding marketing-related expenses. So it's all of those movements, and it's a pretty big number. Yeah, I was going to make the same point Mark did. Just to be really clear, the tax impact related to Shanghai Golden Monkey NOLs is part of the walk of the dilution number moving from $0.20 to $0.35. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. So just final follow-up here for me then, J.P., there's a lot of moving parts. It seems to me then that the focus is still just back on the sales line, and you've got slightly weaker than expected U.S. sales and, clearly, weaker China sales. But you seem to be giving us the statement or this confidence that 2016 is clearly better and will be better. And I think is that the message here, is it that some of the things that are been happening, that you just have a very strong line of sight to that the company will do better in 2016 on the top-line? John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, you know, I think, David, we want to go execute against the fundamentals in the business. We continue to be optimistic about the category and the role the category plays with retailers. We have a pretty balanced look at 2016, from both a top and bottom-line standpoint, and we'll talk a bit more about that in January. At this point, with some of the things we're seeing with the consumer, I think it's important that we focus on the things we can control. We've got to make sure that our portfolio is compelling and we participate where we think that the consumer is going. And we'll continue to read those things, but we have to get in a position where we're winning share every day, and growing our brands. And we feel good about the plans we have. We feel good about the innovation contribution to our business. So from those standpoints, I am optimistic. I do think there are some macro issues that are impacting retailers as well as our business. And so we've got to operate within that environment. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks for the comments. Operator : Your next question will come from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thank you. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Morning, Rob. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning. Maybe you could give us a little more detail, J.P., on your comment about being under-leveraged in the value segment. Are you considering introducing newer products or new initiatives to get bigger in dollar stores? Is that kind of what you're hinting around at? John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, yeah, sure. I'd love to talk about that. So in the chocolate segment, we believe we've been under-represented in the premium part of the category. While it's a relatively small piece, less than 10% of the total category consumption, we recognize that we have to do a better job there. In the value segment, a lot of what happened this year was really around sugar confectionery and sweets. And we think The Allan Candy acquisition will enable us to do well there. We also think there were some manufacturers that probably benefited from the spot price of sugar. And based on where things are manufactured, that could have given them an opportunity to invest in the category more so than in the past. So the beauty of The Hershey brand is, is it's one of the most accessible brands that there is. Chocolate in our country from all manufacturers, it's the best value per pound of any place in the world. So I think frequency is something we have to make sure that we're driving. I think the portfolio is largely attractive in chocolate, but we need to work on the high end. And in the low end, we need to work on the sweet side. And that can be channel-specific, as well as across many other retailers. So that's how I'd like you think about it. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): And can I ask a quick follow-up? The lower merchandising levels, it just kind of feels like that's kind of a new normal, especially for one big retailer. But your guidance, you're kind of talking about it as if merchandising can reaccelerate. How are you thinking of merchandising practices at retail for the category? Do you think they accelerate next year? John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we like to think that we work well with all of the retailers across their different needs and the changing initiatives and things that they may have. So, we'll continue to focus on the places in the store where retailers want the merchandise and then we have to win that. And if the way that we bring consumers to the category changes, we have to adapt to that. And some of that could be advertising; some of it could be different types of merchandising and so on. So we always have to be flexible in the way we go to market and win where retailers have strategies and how that they want to connect with the consumers. So, I would expect us to do that. It's not the first time in the history of the world that people have had clean floor policies or tried to clean up merchandising and get things out of the back room and a whole list of different things. So, we'll adjust with that and we'll win wherever we can. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Kenneth Zaslow with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey. Good morning, everyone. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey. Good morning. Mark K. Pogharian - Vice President- Investor Relations : Hi, Ken. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Two questions; one is, over the last several years, many packaged food companies have shifted its algorithm to more of a margin focus. And your repeated commentary about balance, is there maybe not a sea change, but a shift in how you're thinking about your algorithm more to a cost restructuring, even in both in the U.S. and China? And my second question is, in terms of category adjacencies, you've had mixed performance on certain category adjacencies, so trying to figure out how you're getting more confident in moving into the snack bites, the snack bars categories, and how do you assess the adjacencies. Mark K. Pogharian - Vice President- Investor Relations : Yeah. I mean, one thing, Ken, and I think on the balance, how we were thinking about it is, yes, I know we're lapping a lot of one-time type of costs related to China this year, but I think the way we've always thought about this business and even before we got into snacks, there's never a shortage of places to invest around here. And I think we have a lot of good, big buckets that you'll see us continue to invest in on not only our core business, which is always number one, but always some of the snacks and adjacencies that we're talking about. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think good examples of that are KRAVE. We've got our Brookside bars. We mentioned Allan a little bit earlier. And as we continue to look at snacking in total, we've got a number of things that are on the innovation front that, as appropriate, we'll be bringing those things to market. So I think as Mark says, a lot of places to invest that are attractive and, as appropriate, we'll continue to expand our portfolio. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): So there's not going to be a heightened focus on restructuring or cost savings? John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No. I think the way to think about it is, is that first of all, I think it's important that we always act with a scarcity mentality. And certainly, you've seen some of that in the numbers that we're talking about today in terms of where we're spending and choosing to spend. So I think we'll continue that, that way. We also want to invest in markets where we're trying to grow our brands, and volume is always the magic elixir, so pace is important to think about. So where we see there's opportunities, we need to go to the ball there. And when growth is a little tougher or less attractive, we need to moderate in those places as well. We'll continue to do that, but we want to be a consumer-centric brand-building company, and we'll invest appropriately. Operator : And we'll go next to Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Jason. Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks for squeezing me in. Real quick housekeeping question and then back to some of the other stuff we've been talking about; the second installment for Shanghai Golden Monkey, where do we stand on that? John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, we're still working through and negotiating our position with them around the second closing. We're still trying to bring clarity to a number of different issues where we may have different points of view around some things. And so that's all still in process, but we feel good about the progress that we're making. Operator : And we'll go next to Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good morning, everyone. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Can I ask about as you look forward, the algorithm for sales growth in North America has been pretty heavily price-focused for the last 10 years or so. I think you've taken three either high single digit or low double digit price increases for good commodity-based reasons. It seems as though the cocoa commodity prices have been reasonably steady, albeit at peak levels for the last few years. Going forward, does it have to become much more volume mix-based, because it will be harder without a commodity-driven step-up to take more pricing? How are you thinking about the U.S. sales growth formula going forward? Thank you. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think the first place that we would start is that we continue to believe that the category historically is going to grow in the 3% to 4% range. So that's a starting point. If you look over the last decade or even longer, growth has always been a combination almost equally split between price and volume. And as we go through this current period, it continues to track around that model. So what we believe is, as I said earlier, the real influencers on the category are really around this trips issue that has impacted the business more than it has been on price. So I don't think the historical norms have changed. Obviously, in chocolate, where we're a 45% share in the category, we have a lot of responsibility in terms of category growth. So we have to innovate and grow and compete for consumer occasions, which are growing all the time across day parts. And so we have to participate in that. But I don't think there's anything around the category itself that would cause us to think that price, et cetera, is different. Now, to your point, if we move into a period of time where commodities are less of a driver around the price piece, as we've said historically, you know we're a gross margin-focused company, and we would have to make sure that we continue to do that to maintain the attractive gross margins that we have today. But I wouldn't see us thinking about that significantly different. Operator : And we'll go next to Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, good morning, everyone. Patricia A. Little - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning, Bryan. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just one question, I just wanted to get a little bit of clarification on the true-up on trade promotions in China. I just want to make sure I heard this right. It's $80 million less than your expectation, so I guess the gap between gross and net sales... Patricia A. Little - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. I'm glad you asked for the clarification. No, what we're saying is after the true-up, our current net sales estimate is about $80 million. Mark K. Pogharian - Vice President- Investor Relations : Yeah. I think it was around $90 million, Bryan, last time we spoke to you guys. Patricia A. Little - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Time we talked. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. So the true-up in the quarter was about a $10 million differential? Patricia A. Little - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : For the year. Mark K. Pogharian - Vice President- Investor Relations : For the year. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : For the year. Okay. And then, just as we think about that for next year, does it imply that whatever your expectations were for net pricing at the start of the year, you just have a different base net price? And so as you go into next year, it's not that you necessarily add that back, it's just your net price is lower than what you were originally assuming or is there something about that true-up that your net price realization that you'll recognize will be a little bit better next year? Mark K. Pogharian - Vice President- Investor Relations : Yeah, I mean, on a hypothetical basis, Bryan, if gross sales are the same year-over-year, net sales would be up, because I have all this trade running through between gross and net sales this year. So in a hypothetical situation where gross sales are the same year-over-year, net sales would be up, assuming there's no more trade. Patricia A. Little - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : But I think it's also fair to say that it is overall just a rebase to a lower level as well in terms of the gross sales. Operator : And this concludes our Q&A session. I'd like to turn our program back to our speakers for closing remarks. Mark K. Pogharian - Vice President- Investor Relations : Great. Thank you for joining us for this morning's call. I'll be available all morning and afternoon, too, for any follow-ups that you may have. Operator : And this does conclude today's program. You may disconnect at this time.",

Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse First Boston Pamela Kaufman - Morgan Stanley David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets, LLC Robert Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research Operator : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to The Hershey Company\u2019s Fourth quarter 2015 results conference call. My name is Keith, and I will be your conference operator for today. All participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question, so we can get to as many of you as possible. Please note this call may be recorded. Mr. Mark Pogharian, you may begin your conference. Mark Pogharian : Thank you, Keith. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to The Hershey Company\u2019s fourth quarter 2015 conference call. J.P. Bilbrey, Chairman, President and CEO; and Patricia Little, Senior Vice President and CFO, will provide you with an overview of our results, which will then be followed by a Q&A session with them; Michele Buck, President, North America and Myself. Let me remind everyone listening that today\u2019s conference call may contain statements which are forward-looking. These statements are based on our current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, because of factors such as those listed in this morning\u2019s press release and in our 10-K for 2014 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the Note section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. As a result, we will discuss 4Q results, excluding net pre-tax charges of $39 million, or $0.10 per share-diluted, primarily related to the productivity initiative announced in June, a non-service related pension expense, and acquisition and integration charges. Our discussions of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges. With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey. John Bilbrey : Thanks, Mark. We made progress against many of our strategic initiatives in 2015. And despite a difficult environment in the second-half of the year, we delivered adjusted earnings per share diluted growth within the targeted range we provided during our second quarter conference call. Fourth quarter net sales on a constant currency basis was slightly below our expectations and declined about 3%. North America gross margin expansion resulted in solid operating profit growth and we continue to hold the line on overall expense control. Hershey U.S. CMG retail takeaway sequentially improved from Q3 to Q4, and increased plus 2.5%, although market share was up about 0.2 point. Seasonal performance was good and we gained market share in both Halloween and holiday. Our fourth quarter marketplace performance was similar to the full-year. Specifically combined fourth quarter retail takeaway at one of our largest retailers and within the dollar and drug channels was a solid plus 6%. The drug class of trade was driven by our precision initiatives, while the other two channels were winners from a consumer trips perspective. However, in the remaining channels, our combined retail takeaway was only slightly up, while small, we also had meaningful gains in non-measured channels, such as e-commerce and food service. For the full-year, Hershey U.S. CMG retail takeaway increased 2.4% and was largely in line with category growth. As a result for the 52 weeks ended December 26, 2015, Hershey U.S. market share was an industry-leading 31.3%. Following a period of relatively consistent marketplace success where we outperformed the category, our momentum slowed in the second-half of 2015, and was relatively in line with the CMG category as a result of increased competitive activity within CMG and broader snacks. Over the last three years, the average growth rate of the CMG category was about 2.3% below the long-term historical average of 3% to 4%. As we previously discussed the category is being impacted by many of the same issues facing other food categories, including changing shopping habits like channel shifting, increased competitive activity and some retailers adjusting their merchandising practices, and a proliferation of broader snack SKUs. As a result going forward, we estimate that CMG category growth will be in the 2.5% to 3% range. Our goal is to outpace the category and gain share on an annual basis. Additionally, we have good visibility into our developing snacks portfolio and expect positive sales contributions from it in 2016. Given our solid CMG position in North America and the investments we will continue to make in our snacks business, we expect our North America segment to generate long-term constant currency annual net sales growth of 3% to 4%. As we look to 2016 and beyond, we\u2019re taking actions that we believe will enable us to regain our North America marketplace momentum over our strategic planning cycle. Some of the things you\u2019ll see in the marketplace in 2016 to address broader snacking, income bifurcation, and lower trips include a broad-based launch of substantial snacking items, including Brookside Bars, Snack Mix, and Snack Bites canisters, as well as increased distribution of Krave meat snacks. You\u2019ll see incremental investments related to core CMG merchandising in display activity and the introduction of branded pods that bring our brands to life in-store. Although note that this will result in higher trade promotion as we strive to maintain the right mix of quality merchandising and related promotional price points. We\u2019ll also launch Cadbury Chocolates to the stand-up pouch targeting the mass premium market and begin a 500 store test featuring Scharffen Berger and Dagoba organic brands. And we\u2019ll introduce Allan Candy sugar confectionery items in peg bags to appeal to a cost conscious consumer. This is just a brief summary, excuse me, of some of the activity we have in North America this year. Now for an update on our international business. In late December, we reached an agreement to acquire the remaining 20% of Shanghai Golden Monkey. The acquisition is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2016 subject to government approval. While the category in business has experienced slower growth, we\u2019re committed to the China market and the acquisition of Golden Monkey is important to Hershey\u2019s future growth. We believe in the complementary advantages of Hershey and Golden Monkey and the opportunity that we have with these businesses together. Earlier this month we kicked off the year of the Golden Monkey campaign. The key elements of the campaign include activating TV and mobile advertising and executing merchandising and display at retail. This is well underway, as it started in early January. Our China Chocolate fourth quarter net sales results were less than our expectations, as we adjusted our sell-in for Chinese New Year given category softness. In Q4, the contraction of the China Chocolate category accelerated and was down about 13%. As a result for the full-year, the category was about flat versus last year. In a slowing category and our overweighting in hypermarkets, this has impacted our performance negatively. In 2015, Hershey retail takeaway was off a 11% and market share declined 1.1 points to 8.5%. Similar to what we discussed over the last year, category performance is being impacted by macro economic issues and the related impact it\u2019s having on consumer shopping behavior and confidence. And given the China news flow that we\u2019ve all seen, it continues to be difficult to gauge the consumers behavior. We\u2019re focused on the integration of our businesses in building distribution on our portfolio. And while small, our e-commerce business in China is a bright spot. In the fourth quarter, our e-commerce business increased over 75%, driven by solid China singles day performance. For the year, our China Chocolate e-commerce retail takeaway outpaced the category. In 2016, we\u2019ll continue to invest in our e-commerce platform, increase Brookside distribution and trial, and focus on channel development. In Mexico, net sales in local currency for the quarter were about flat versus previous year. For the full-year, local currency sales increased 6%. Within the chocolate category, we\u2019re seeing investments by all major manufacturers in a form of new products in core brand investments. As a result, our chocolate marketplace performances lagged the category. Chocolate market share in the modern trade in Mexico for the year is off as our retail takeaway of about 4%, lagged category growth of about 12%. In 2016 within the modern trade, we\u2019ll concentrate on portfolio core chocolate Hershey\u2019s and Kisses franchises and our small but profitable grocery branded items. Our traditional trade initiative with Sigma is progressing, and we expect our market share here to improve this year. In Brazil, local currency net sales in Q4 were slightly down versus last year, given the macroeconomic environment and competitive activity. In 2015, we were the fastest growing chocolate company in Brazil, as retail takeaway increased about 13%, resulting in a share gain of 0.2 point. In 2015, we successfully exited Bauducco JV and established our own sales team and secured logistics agreements. In 2016, we expect the growth will be driven by Hershey\u2019s brand mainly through pricing and core innovation. Constant currency net sales in India declined in line with estimates around the phase out of our edible oils products. This completes our transition to a confectionery and snacks-based portfolio. We believe the macroeconomic environment and competitive activity in the international markets where we operate will continue to be a headwind for the chocolate category and Hershey in 2016. Therefore, we estimate constant currency international and other segment net sales growth of mid to high single digits in 2016. Over the long-term, we expect global economies when category trends to improve and our national business \u2013 and our international business on a constant currency basis will contribute about one point to our overall long-term sales target. Despite the aforementioned macroeconomic issues facing consumers and competitive activity, we believe the global confectionery category will continue to grow. We\u2019ll continue to invest in our core brands in the U.S., as well as capabilities related to knowledge and insights. And despite the slowdown in the international markets, we will build on the strategies that we\u2019ve established, as they will benefit the company over the long-term. We\u2019ll also make incremental investments in our existing snacks platform, as it will provided us with another lever of growth. These initiatives should enable us to achieve long-term constant currency net sales growth of 3% to 5%. Given the scale advantages of our North America business and a balanced approach to international investments, the company expects to generate long-term earnings per share diluted growth of 6% to 8%. Patricia will provide you with all of financial details that we believe are innovation, advertising, consumer investments and insights, work within our confectionery and snacks business should enable us to deliver on our 2016 objectives. Although note that sales and earnings will build throughout the year, as our Q1 profile will continue to be pressured. For the full-year, excluding unfavorable foreign currency exchange of about 1 point, constant currency net sales growth is expected to be around 3%, resulting in an increase of adjusted earnings per share diluted of about 6%. As we look to the long-term, I remain encouraged by our prospects. Hershey has many opportunities to leverage its U.S. scale, global brands, and core capabilities. Additionally, we\u2019re continuously examining our manufacturing footprint and overall cost structure and believe opportunities exist to maintain and improve margins. Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong and we\u2019ll continue to be disciplined in open to sources of growth via M&A. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Patricia, who will provide you with some additional details on our financial results. Patricia Little : Thank you, J.P. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Fourth quarter net sales of $1.91 billion decreased 5% versus last year and generated adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.08, an increase of 3.8% versus last year. Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 1.9 points, net sales declined 3.1%. Pricing and net acquisitions and divestitures were 1 point and a 40 basis point benefit respectively, offset by 4.5 points of lower volume, due to slightly lower sales in North America versus estimates and the expected sales decline in China. Fourth quarter North America net sales were slightly below expectations, due to a decline in spreads and baking chips sales due to increased competitive activity. Our focus on inventory levels at select retailers most likely looking to manage working capital and slightly lower seasonal sales than anticipated. Excluding the 1 point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates in Canada, North America net sales increased 1.2% versus the year-ago period. Net price realization in this segment was a 2.3 point benefit and volume was off 1.4 points. On a net basis, the Allan Candy and Krave acquisitions in the Mauna Loa divestiture were 30 basis point benefit. Total international and other segment net sales for the fourth quarter declined about 27% versus last year. Foreign currency exchange rates and trade promotion were unfavorable by 5.7 and 4.2 points, respectively. In October, Shanghai Golden Monkey acquisition sales were 1.1 point benefit. The international and other segment core business volume was off about 18 points, due primarily to the Chinese chocolate business and Golden Monkey November and December performance that was less than a year-ago. Turning now to margins. Adjusted gross margin increased 80 basis points in the fourth quarter, however, this was less than our forecast. Gross margin expansion was driven by net price realization, which was off versus our estimates. Supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives partially offset by obsolescence, other supply chain costs due to lower volumes and slightly higher commodities. We did benefit from lower dairy, however, this was offset by the higher cost of simple ingredients. We called during fourth quarter, we nationally debut Holiday Hershey\u2019s Kisses Milk Chocolates and Hershey\u2019s Milk Chocolate Bars made with simple ingredients and no artificial flavors. These are some of the first products in Hershey to transition to simple ingredients of commitment announced last year. Operating profit in the fourth quarter increased 1.3% versus last year, resulting in operating profit margin of 19.9%. The increase was driven by gross margin gains and lower SM&A, selling, marketing and administrative expenses. SM&A excluding advertising and related consumer marketing and acquisitions and divestitures declined 5.9%, driven by the implementation of the business productivity initiative announced in June and the company\u2019s continued focus on nonessential SM&A spending. Total advertising and related consumer marketing expense declined around 7% versus the fourth quarter of 2014; driven by planned reductions in international spending. North America on-air advertising was higher in the fourth quarter, although advertising and related consumer marketing expense for the quarter was in line with the year ago period, as production costs were less than anticipated. For the full-year, North America advertising and related consumer marketing expense increased 3.1%. Now, let me provide a brief update on our international business. As J.P. mentioned earlier, we reached an agreement in late December to acquire the remaining 20% of Shanghai Golden Monkey. The agreement is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2016, subject to government approval. We are concentrating on bringing the businesses together and focused on optimizing the structure for top line growth. This is still a work in progress and we\u2019ll share our plans with you in the future. In the near-term, the business will not get back to the operating income level of 2014, and will be a drag on total company operating profit in 2016. China chocolate category performance continues to be below the historical growth rate of a 11% to 12%. In fourth quarter, the China chocolate category was down about 13%, as marketplace trends slowed across all channels affecting all major manufacturers. This contraction impacted our Chinese New Year sell-in, China chocolate category growth in 2016 is expected to be flat to slightly up versus 2015. We estimate that our retail takeaway will be relatively in line with category performance. In 2016, our China chocolate operating loss is expected to improve versus 2015, as we expect trade promotion to be lower. However, margins will be pressured, given the decline in growth sales volume. Mexico fourth quarter net sales in local currency were about flat versus last year. For the full-year, local currency sales increased 6%. Brazil fourth quarter local currency net sales were down slightly versus last year, given the tough macroeconomic environment and competitive activity. As a result, we are managing our costs and focusing on core brand SKUs that we think will enable us to improve our profitability in these two markets. India fourth quarter local currency sales declined about 60%, and we are in line with estimates, as we phased out sales of edible oils at the end of the third quarter. We expect this to continue to be a headwind for the first eight months of 2016. Moving down to P&L, fourth quarter interest expense of $19.2 million declined $2.1 million versus last year, or 9.7%. For the full-year, interest expense was $76 million and was in line with our previous estimate. In 2016, we expect interest expense to be about $85 to $90 million. The adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 29.3% and 33.2% for the full-year, slightly better than our estimates. In the fourth quarter, we recorded $25 million within the other income and expense line related to the previously mentioned U.S. Government investment tax credits. In 2016, we expect to purchase about the same amount of tax credits as we did last year, which should result in an adjusted tax rate that\u2019s similar to 2015. For the fourth quarter of 2015, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 219 million shares, down 5 million versus last year and about a $0.02 benefit in the quarter, resulting in adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.8, or an increase of 3.8% versus a year ago. Now, let me provide a quick recap of year-to-date results. Year-to-date net sales decreased 0.5%. Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates, net sales increased 1.1% versus a year ago period. Operating profit increased 1.8%, resulting in operating profit margin of 20%. Year-to-date, adjusted gross margin was 46% versus 44.9% last year, or a 110 basis points higher as a result of net price realization and supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by higher input costs and slightly higher commodity costs. Year-to-date, adjusted earnings per share diluted increased about 3.5% to $4.12 per share. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the fourth quarter, net trading capital decreased versus last year\u2019s fourth quarter by $40 million. Accounts receivable was higher by $2 million and remains extremely current. Inventory was lower by $50 million and accounts payable declined by $8 million. Total capital additions, including software were $119 million in the fourth quarter and $357 million for the year in line with our forecast. This included capital related to the manufacturing facility in Malaysia. In 2016, we expect CapEx to be in the $285 to $295 million range. During the fourth quarter, depreciation and amortization was $62 million and dividends paid were $123 million. No shares were repurchased in the fourth quarter under approved program and to-date $230 million of outstanding shares have been repurchased against the $250 million authorization approved in February 2015. For the full-year, the company repurchased $403 million of outstanding shares. In addition, the company repurchased $15 million of common shares in the quarter and a $180 million year-to-date to replace shares issued in connection with the exercise of stock options. This morning, we announced that the Board approved an additional $500 million share repurchase program that will commence after the current program is completed. This authorization is the result of the company\u2019s strong balance sheet and confidence that we\u2019ll deliver long-term earnings per share diluted growth of 6% to 8%. We believe, this business model will enable the company to generate meaningful and predictable cash flow from operations. As such, we\u2019ll continue to have Board level discussions related to capital structure, including dividend increases, value-added share buybacks, and M&A opportunities. Cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $347 million. This is lower than a year ago, primarily due to acquisitions and share buyback. In 2015, we faced a number of challenges as a result of changing shopping behavior and greater levels of competition. Our plans for 2016 and beyond reflect the reality of the current retail and consumer environment. We are confident in our ability over the long-term to execute at retail and provide consumers with CMG and snack products that can drive growth. As J.P. mentioned, we\u2019ll continue to invest in our core brands in the U.S. and key international markets and build on the strategies we have established, as they will benefit the company over the long-term. We\u2019ll also make incremental investments in our existing snacks platform, as it will provide us with another level \u2013 lever of growth. These initiatives should enable us to achieve long-term constant currency net sales growth of 3% to 5%. Given the scale advantages of our North America CMG business, snacks margins that are lower than the company average and a balanced approach to international investments, the company expects to generate long-term adjusted earnings per share diluted growth of 6% to 8%. For the full-year, excluding unfavorable foreign currency exchange about 1 point, constant currency net sales growth is expected to increase around 3%. The company expects gross margin to be about the same as last year. The business productivity initiative announced in June is on track and the company is also focused on nonessential SM&A spending, as it continues to leverage existing resources. Additionally, we\u2019ll continue to invest in advertising and related consumer marketing, including a greater shift to digital and mobile communications. As a result, the company expects adjusted earnings per share diluted to increase around 6%. Before we open it up to Q&A, just a couple of thoughts on some of the items pressuring the first quarter. First, Easter is a week shorter this year. Also, merchandising in display space will be lower at select retailers, as we will not lap their new floor designs until late in second quarter. And as I mentioned earlier, some of them are also focusing on caring lower levels of inventory. As J.P. stated, direct trade will also be hired to ensure that we maintain the right mix of quality merchandising and promotional price points. Competition for this space in the store is robust. And we continue to listen to the consumer and invest in simple ingredients, which were currently purchasing at a slight premium to traditional ingredients. Thank you for your time this morning. And we\u2019ll now take any questions you may have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Please note this call is recorded. And we can take our first question from John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. John Baumgartner : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. Patricia Little : Hey, good morning, John. John Bilbrey : Good morning, John. John Baumgartner : John, [indiscernible] I think Michele spoke to the plans for 2015, it was pretty specific in terms of the improvements in the retail coverage and space acquisition and sourcing from snacking. And in Q4, you also had a bump from marketing, but we didn\u2019t really see much aware ofshare gains, as the year unfold us. So maybe just in hindsight, how did your execution evolve relative to that CAGNYplan, and what\u2019s holding back your share gains there? Michele Buck : Yes. So, John, thanks for the question, it\u2019s Michele. I would say two things relative to Q4. First of all, our biggest shortfall in Q2 \u2013 in Q4 was really around our grocery and snacks business. So we saw a lot of competitive activity, both in baking and as well in spreads. And I would say on spreads to some degree, we\u2019ve really learned our way to where we will win in that category, where we\u2019ll focus. We\u2019re doing well in jars and we\u2019ve seen some price value issues in the instant consumables. And then I would say the other pieces when it comes to CMG, we gained share in the season, so we had solid growth. But we didn\u2019t gain as much as we anticipated, because frankly, we saw more competitive activity during the marketplace, and we have adjusted our plans coming into the year, this year to really dial up to be even more competitive to regain that share momentum. John Baumgartner : Is there a sense that it involves more trade promo going forward or balance between advertising and promo? Patricia Little : There absolutely is more trade promotion and more trade investment. And as we look to this year, you will see us investing more in trade. There are more snack options out there, so there\u2019s more competition. As you know, there are some retailers who are going to cleaner floor policies and so there is a little bit less space and more competition for it, so. John Bilbrey : One of the things, John, you would have seen over the course of the year, if you just look at CMG pricing relatively modest as we got into the fourth quarter, you could see a bit of lower pricing versus some of our average pricing as well and we believe that may have had an impact on some of our business. John Baumgartner : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we can take our next question from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead. John Bilbrey : Good morning, Bryan. Bryan Spillane : Hey, good morning, everyone. So I guess just one question related to the change in your long-term growth algorithm. And I guess, could you describe, I think in the previous algorithm, there was some explicit expectation that M&A would be a contributor to the growth algorithm? So could you talk about in the 3% to 5% sales growth expectation, is there any expectation for M&A? And also I guess within that how much are you expecting in North America sort of the non-confections business to contribute to growth? So the expansion of things like Krave and other snacks, how does that build into the 3% to 5%? Thanks. John Bilbrey : So for clarification, we would not have had M&A in any of our previous guidance, nor would it be in the current algorithm. The way you think about it broadly without breaking out the Krave pieces of the business, which are \u2013 some of those is relatively small. You should really be looking at three to four in North America, one in international. So if you think about this year, it certainly falls within that range. But I think as you saw in our comment, we talked about 2.5% to 3% and a point. So I think that\u2019s a good way to think about it in terms of 2016. Patricia Little : And specifically on snacking we\u2019ve looked to have that at between 0.5 point and a point off of the CMG. John Baumgartner : Okay. Thank you. John Bilbrey : Yes. Operator : And we can take our next question from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. John Bilbrey : Good morning, Ken. Ken Goldman : Good morning. Hey, everybody. According to Nielsen, I know it doesn\u2019t tell a whole story. It looks like there were some share losses for Hershey in both the Halloween and Christmas Seasonal Candy or at least especially Chocolate. First of all, is that accurate? And second, could you give us a little color about what happened and what the company is doing, if it is an issue to remedy the problem this year? John Bilbrey : So if you look at both of those on a volume basis, if you look at all of our seasons over the course of the year, we were up about 3.7% on a volume basis. If you look at Halloween, it was about, I think about 7.5, and it was about half that I think it was 3 point, so 3 something on holiday. But it\u2019s about a 0.25 point in terms of share, which is below what we would have set our targets. But we did gain share in both of those at a modest level, but we did gain share. Ken Goldman : Okay. John Bilbrey : And if you just \u2013 so I\u2019ll just leave it at that unless Michelle has anything she wants to add. Michele Buck : No, I would just go back to the comment I made about some increased competitive trade dollars to get merchandising during the seasons and we\u2019ve adjusted that in terms of our offerings going forward. Ken Goldman : Okay. I\u2019ll follow-up after the call. Thank you. John Bilbrey : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank. John Bilbrey : Good morning, Eric. Eric Katzman : Hi, good morning, everybody. I guess on the \u2013 my first question has to do with the Premium. I think J.P. you mentioned going with Dagoba and Scharffen Berger? John Bilbrey : And also we\u2019d be introducing a Cadbury item as well that Cad \u2013 the couple of those would be think \u2013 you think about those as mass premium and then Scharffen Berger would obviously be in super premium. Mark Pogharian : Yes, and remember, Eric, there was a \u2013 the latter Scharffen Berger and Dagoba more of a 500 store test market right now. Michele Buck : 500 selected kind of retail environment test. But Cadbury is a broader offering since it plays in mass premium. Eric Katzman : Okay. And then just a follow up more of an accounting question, I guess, for Patricia. So now that you own a 100% of SGM. Does that mean that there\u2019s greater EBIT losses that have to be recognized versus, I guess, maybe you had a minority interest kind of a back out on the net income line, or on a pre-tax basis. But this International EBIT get negatively affected by the fact that you now own a 100%, and then I\u2019ll pass it on. Thanks. Patricia Little : No, it doesn\u2019t. So first just to be completely technical, we haven\u2019t yet closed the rest of the Golden Monkey, and it\u2019s been a 100% consolidated from day one. John Bilbrey : Day one yes. Eric Katzman : Okay. John Bilbrey : So a 100% of their sales and a live loss Eric has been in our P&L since day one. Eric Katzman : Okay, okay. Thank you. Pass it on. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Alexia Howard with Bernstein. John Bilbrey : Good morning, Alexia. Alexia Howard : Good morning, everybody. Can I ask about the outlook for 2016 on the Chocolate category in the U.S.? It looks from the Nielsen data though it\u2019s been very on-again, off-again a lot more precarious I guess that we\u2019ve seen in previous years. What do you think happening in there in terms of consumer behavior, retailer behavior, and are you confident that or where do you see the category gets back to as we get back maybe into the middle of the year and past the Easter pressure? Thank you. John Bilbrey : Well, I think that we would see Chocolate by itself being somewhere between 2 and 2.5, it\u2019s a fairly broad range. I think, Alexia, what we think about in our 2016 plan is, we\u2019re going to have a strong focus on our core brands and then we also think there\u2019s an opportunity for us as we\u2019ve looked at quality merge over 2015, that innovation plays an important role and being able to get that incremental quality merged even and be competitive. So we\u2019re also very focused on that. So, I think what we\u2019ll see is as long as there is a strong focus against big core brands and then we can achieve good quality merge against our innovation activity, that becomes the incremental activity that makes us competitive, not only within chocolate specifically, as you asked, but it also makes us competitive against any potential trial at least you\u2019ll get from competitive brands, so\u2026 Patricia Little : Alexia, I would just add to that. We also know chocolate is really a destination for the seasons, during the seasonal periods, and that will continue. So I think, we kind of think about it, that\u2019s a solid foundation and base that consumers are looking for chocolate in particular around those times, in addition to all the other comments J.P. made about how we\u2019re seeing the year. Alexia Howard : Thank you. In the interest of time, I\u2019ll pass it on. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from David Driscoll with Citi Research. John Bilbrey : Good morning, David. Alexis Bornin : Hi, good morning. This is actually Alexis Bornin in for David this morning. John Bilbrey : Okay. Greetings. Alexis Bornin : Hi, international. So Hershey\u2019s international segment was profitable in 2013 and 2014. How obviously the segment took a big step backwards in 2015. When do you expect the segment to return to profitability? Patricia Little : That is not something that we layout an exact timetable on. But clearly, we are not going to be back to those 2014 levels in 2016. Alexis Bornin : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we take our next question from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. John Bilbrey : Good morning, Jason. Jason English : Hey, good morning, folks. How are you? John Bilbrey : Good. Patricia Little : Good. Jason English : in : John Bilbrey : Well, I think what you\u2019re going to see in total is that, it will be a more of competitive environment and that you\u2019ll see a greater trade spin in 2016 than you would have seen in 2015, which could lead to some lower net prices. And so obviously that makes \u2013 that obviously has a mix effect in terms of the P&L. Michele Buck : The other thing I would just add to that, I think it is important to note some of the trade spending will go into promoted price points, but some of that will also be investment to really get spaced in other ways. John Bilbrey : Yes, because, Jason, Michelle\u2019s last point it\u2019s pretty important, with more snacks, we\u2019ve all seen them coming on over the last few years, I don\u2019t think that will abate. Everybody is trying to get to the perimeter of the store. So that\u2019s based \u2013 it\u2019s not expanding anymore let\u2019s face it. It\u2019s just very competitive to get. Jason English : Yes, got it. And then one other quick follow-up question. You mentioned the cost upgrades weigh in our margins in terms of simple ingredients, as well as the mixed impact from lower margin snacking items. Can you give us a sense of the magnitude of margin headwind you\u2019re anticipating in 2016 from those initiatives? Michele Buck : I mean, we typically don\u2019t talk about inflation, the inflation as a percent looking forward, we\u2019ll always tell you what it is. When we report for various competitive reasons, we don\u2019t want to get into that level of specificity right now. But we do have net inflation this year. Jason English : Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Jonathan Feeney with Athlos Research. Jonathan Feeney : Good morning, everybody. John Bilbrey : Hey, good morning. Jonathan Feeney : I want a little bit more detail about the competitive landscape, not only within chocolate candy. You mentioned pretty high levels of competition a couple times in the narrative, but also some of yourcompetitive sort of pushback and different behavior you might have gotten from some of this extension into other categories with Krave and some of the non-candy snacks? Michele Buck : Yes, I think, so I think we\u2019ve been fairly clear in terms of how we\u2019ve talked about the confectionary environment. If I go beyond broader snacks, the comment I would make specifically to meat snacks is that in the premium segment that we compete, the meat snacks business continues to be up about 25%, overall meat has slowed a bit in terms of growth, and of course a core part of our focus is to continue to build distribution around the Krave business and then also you\u2019ll us introducing some extended items to the current line that we have as we built out that distribution. So from that standpoint, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a significant, difference is probably a positive for us. If you think about broader snacking, I think I said on a previous call that as you look over the last 18 to 24 months, there\u2019s about 80 SKUs, which have been added in that segment. And therefore, it\u2019s more fragmented it has before gives the consumer different alternatives for trial. And therefore, we\u2019ve seen some competitiveness and a little bit of a competitive pressure from there. But I think, again, it comes back to making sure in each segment that we compete that we\u2019re winning merchandising and display, as we talked about earlier. But those would be a couple of things that I think are part of the existing landscape that we face. Jonathan Feeney : Thanks, J.P. John Bilbrey : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. John Bilbrey : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Lazar : Good morning. Hershey obviously talks a lot historically about being a gross margin focused company. I guess, this year you\u2019ve got to reinvest a little of that into trade promotion and you\u2019ve got some ingredient cost you\u2019ve talked about from some of the new products and things. I guess, is it a shift at all in Hershey\u2019s long-term emphasis on gross margins, or more getting the base right and moving from there? And then last thing would be with the reduction in the long-term growth outlook, I guess, does it change management\u2019s or the Board\u2019s view on thinking about maybe creating even if it\u2019s larger scale partnerships, or in pieces of the business, whether it would be overseas or in the U.S. to, I guess, help compete and grow, it\u2019s kind of a broader question? John Bilbrey : Yes. So I think if you think about your first question around gross margin, we\u2019ll always defend our brands and we\u2019ll be brand building consumer centric company and invest in our brands. But I would tell you that it\u2019s not a change in philosophy. We continue to be a gross margin focused company. And there maybe years of periods of time when you have to change the way you get there. But we\u2019ll always have the gross margin at the top of our list and again there can always be a mix effect of how you get there. I\u2019m not going to speculate around any kinds of comments from partnerships and things like that. We continue to look for ways to grow and build our business and things that are good for our shareholders. And so, we\u2019re continuously looking at our strategic options in terms of how we build our business. And so that would be the only comment that I would make. Andrew Lazar : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. John Bilbrey : Good morning, Rob. Robert Moskow : Hey, good morning. Thanks for the question. I thought that the guidance for 2016 sounds very reasonable and sets a logical base. But the one assumption I wanted to ask you about was China, I think, going back to kind of flat to up a little bit from a category perspective. And then just in the broader context of international being down as much as it was. What are the drivers that that you think helps China stabilize especially given your modern trade exposure? And then the other countries too, you have economic issues in Brazil. Mexico was very competitive. It seem like this is an area where you\u2019ve been surprised in the past. Did you consider something a little more cautious just in the near-term for international? John Bilbrey : Yes. There is a couple of things that I would say and maybe Patricia and I both talk about this a little bit. But if you look at the total international business about 80% of the impact of that business really occurred in China. And so we know that that was a very unique event. About another 10% of that was really India in the oils business and then, of course, you have the impact of the FX. And then in a local currency basis, of course, you had both Brazil and Mexico, which were positive contributors albeit modestly. So that\u2019s a little bit of where you see us come out. Also and I mentioned this a bit earlier, as we look at our different opportunities, I think what you\u2019ll see us is moderate our pace and approach to where we think we could best allocate capital and still be consistent with our long-term investments and strategies. And so, that also has an influence, I think, and I think it\u2019s quite pragmatic actually to go to where you think the ball was going to be. So those are a couple of comments that I would make. I don\u2019t know Patricia has anything or perspective that she want to add to that. Patricia Little : Yes, I think that we \u2013 clearly, it was a tough year in China overall and it was this combination of macroeconomic forces in China that we\u2019re not alone in experiencing, as well as the added complexity of an integration that didn\u2019t \u2013 an acquisition and acquisition that frankly didn\u2019t go the way we wanted. We certainly can start to see our way moving through those two aspects. And while I think the macroeconomic environment in China is not something I\u2019d ever want to predict. Some of this is in our control, as we start to bring the businesses together and understand what we have in terms of brands, in terms of supply footprint, in terms of channels, in terms of distribution. And that\u2019s where we are going to be focused on the things that we can control. Robert Moskow : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. John Bilbrey : Good morning, Matt. Pamela Kaufman : Hi, this is \u2013 good morning. This is actually Pam Kaufman calling in for Matt. I was hoping that you could elaborate on the stable advertising and marketing expense that you saw in North America during the fourth quarter? And the company\u2019s previous commentary about plans for increased advertising and programming during Q4? Did it have the anticipated impact on your non-seasonal business in the U.S.? John Bilbrey : Well, first of all a comment I would make is that if you look at the numbers part of what you have to recognize there is GRPs were actually up in the fourth quarter. And some of our actually administrative costs and non-working costs were actually what was lower. So the brand investment actually in terms of eyeballs on brands and attention to brands was up. And so as you parse through the numbers, that\u2019s an important piece to understand. Michele may have a point that you were talking about effectiveness or anything beyond that. But it\u2019s important that you understand that as you look at the absolute numbers. Michele Buck : Yes, so the \u2013 that \u2013 it was the non-working kind of production costs that actually we just had some timing shifts on. And then relative to impact on the business, we felt good about our every day takeaway in Q4. So while we don\u2019t have all of the analytics back on the spend based on what we know to-date, we feel pretty good about it. And one other thing I would just point out is, as you look at the takeaway as we\u2019ve launched Snack Mix and Snack Bites, which is key innovation on our core brand. It\u2019s actually the Snack Mix piece is rolling into the salty snack category and not CMG. So, as you look at every day takeaway just keep that in mind. Pamela Kaufman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. John Bilbrey : Good morning, David. David Palmer : Good morning. I\u2019ve seen data from the NPD Group, which points to decline in volume for the sweet snacks mega category. And I guess we\u2019ve seen some falling in the chocolate category as well. I\u2019m wondering, I mean, clearly, we can see some things that might be more category specific like packaging innovation that\u2019s run its course. But when you\u2019re thinking and looking at the consumer, I know you do a lot of consumer insights work. Do you see a big mega reasons or shifts by the consumer that are things you can just to, you mentioned in the release today that your \u2013 that the consumer want simpler ingredients. But could you comment on certain other invisible things perhaps on a short-term basis that you think you could push against to cause category growth improve? Thanks. John Bilbrey : Yes, I\u2019ll make a couple of comments. So if you look at what the overall category trends and I\u2019ll kind of give you where we were. If you look at the chocolate category, it was up. We were up pretty consistent with the category. If you look at non-chocolate, we actually lagged to the category and then if you look at gum and also mint, we would have outperformed the category on those segments. We have deemphasized a little bit the level of activity that we had in some of our sweets business. And so that\u2019s certainly showing up in the business one brand in particular was a great brand. But if we just look at the absolute programming we had on a brand like TWIZZLERS, it is a little bit lower and that ended up showing up some in the overall business. If you look at the sweets business and some of the channels where it does well, you can also follow that with call it income cohorts. And one of the things that we\u2019re doing in 2016 is using our Allen Candy acquisition to leverage our portfolio there on pegged bags and where in select places where we think that can really benefit us. So we did see within that segment an opportunity and we\u2019re going to try to leverage that as well. And then some of our competitors also had the emphasis on some of those brands, which also would have had an influence on our performance as well. David Palmer : Thank you. Operator : And will take our last question from Rob Dickerson with Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead. John Bilbrey : Good morning, Rob. Robert Dickerson : Hello, good morning. I just had a kind of a larger question around your debt capacity and how look at leverage. I know previously you spoken to that 1.5 to 2 times levered to adjusted EBITDA. But I mean how do you think that over time is running a lower level of leverage relative to your peer set? And one could argue potentially an inefficient capital structure is the right way to go, or if you\u2019re talking about snacking opportunity and leveraging your distribution network in the asset base. Then why not increase your leverage a bit more than you have historically actually grow a bit more quickly via acquisitions and not in China, I mean, more on the snacking side in the United States. Thank you. Michele Buck : Great. Thanks for the question. We really like where we sit right now on a leverage basis is something that we go back and pressure test every year. And one of the benefits that it gives us is that, it gives us a lot of capacity to do something incremental. It\u2019s something big and attractive and incremental came along in the category. We would be very open to it, I don\u2019t think that our leverage would be a constrained in that situation. But as we sit here today with opportunities in front of us, we feel very good about where we are. Robert Dickerson : Okay, thank you. And just very quickly, I\u2019ve seen some material on your SOFIT brand. I haven\u2019t heard you mentioned much, but I think I believe it\u2019s selling on Amazon. Is that something we should see more of in the future such that SOFITwould be rolling out like a Krave, or like a Brookside into mass retail, or is that for the time being to sell on price? John Bilbrey : Yes. I think SOFIT is test and learn. It\u2019s a brand out of India. It\u2019s soy protein and it\u2019s part of our efforts to learn about the protein segment plant-based. And so you\u2019re seeing it more \u2013 from a test and learn standpoint, we\u2019re going to be able to make that in the U.S. versus obviously try to ship it from India. So, as you know with beverages and so forth closed on is always a good idea. But it\u2019s a brand, we think is very interesting. But it\u2019s really about us having a learning approach. Patricia Little : And I\u2019m delighted you found it on Amazon, because we just\u2026 Robert Dickerson : Yes. Okay. Thank you very much. John Bilbrey : All right. Thank you. John Bilbrey : Thank you for joining us today I\u2019ll be available for any follow-up calls that you may have. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

LLC John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Operator : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to The Hershey Company's First Quarter 2016 Results Conference Call. My name is Lindy, and I'll be your conference operator for today. All participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. This call is scheduled to end at about 9 :30 a.m., so please limit yourself to one question so we can get as many of you as possible. Please note this call may be recorded. Thank you. Mr. Mark Pogharian, you may begin your conference. Mark K. Pogharian - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Lindy. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to The Hershey Company's first quarter 2016 conference call. J.P. Bilbrey, Chairman, President and CEO; and Patricia Little, Senior Vice President and CFO, will provide you with a review of results, which will then be followed by a Q&A session. Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2015 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance within GAAP. Within the Note section of the press release, we have provided adjusted or pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. As a result, we will discuss first quarter results excluding net pre-tax charges of $27.8 million, or $0.04 per share-diluted, which are primarily related to derivative mark-to-market losses and business realignment charges. Both of these are defined in the Appendix of this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website at www.hersheycompany.com. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges. And with that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Mark. In North America, adjusting for the shorter Easter, we were pleased with our seasonal performance. However, non-seasonal candy, mint and gum, or CMG, business was below expectation. The non-seasonal softness was more than offset by the timing of some merchandising and programming net sales that occurred in the first quarter that were initially expected to ship in the second quarter, netting to on-plan net sales delivery in North America. Most of you are aware of the soft retail takeaway performance across most of the CPG sector in the first quarter, especially in February. Easter timing in the current and year-ago period makes it difficult to properly discern the current non-seasonal or everyday candy trends. As a result, our full year net sales forecast reflects a tempering of non-seasonal everyday candy net sales growth. As I'll discuss in a bit, North America CMG investments, including new products, advertising and increased levels of merchandising and display, accelerates in the second quarter and over the remainder of the year. Given the quality and level of these investments, there could be upside to our outlook. In the first quarter, we're pleased with the gains we're making in Mexico and Brazil. As expected, China net sales declined in the first quarter, and more about this in a minute. In January, I told you that we continue to look at our total cost structure. Building on that, today, we announced that we increased our annual savings target from continuous improvement and productivity programs from about $50 million to $70 million per year to about $100 million per year for the three years beginning in 2017. Using the midpoint of the historical target, the incremental $120 million in savings results in a three-year $300 million initiative that should enable the company to continue to invest in its brands, while also delivering its earnings objectives. We are off to a good start and expect that we'll exceed our initial 2016 productivity and savings target by $10 million to $15 million. Program savings will be generated from cost optimization across all segments of the business. Our focus on the cost structure enabled us to exceed our first quarter earnings expectations and deliver EPS growth versus the year-ago period. This morning, we also announced that we're building on our better-for-you snacks portfolio expansion strategy with the purchase of the barkTHINS snacking chocolate line. Since its launch in 2013, barkTHINS has quickly become a favorite snack brand, due to its commitment to using simple ingredients, fair trade cocoa and non-GMO certification; barkTHINS is a very attractive and uniquely crafted brand that essentially created the chocolate thins category, a new form of chocolate stacking. We look forward to building barkTHINS by leveraging Hershey's scale at retail. This acquisition builds on our snack strategy and complements our strong core confectionery portfolio, the heart of our company. And it adds strength and diversification to our offerings that allows Hershey to satisfy more consumer needs. In the current environment, customers and consumers may seem increasingly focused on other snack categories, but the $25 billion CMG category is the largest segment of the $85 billion U.S. snacks market. Customers and consumers, especially high-income consumers, are increasingly looking for snacking alternatives; however, confection remains one of the top-selling snacking categories, with household penetration of 94%. So, as you would expect, the majority of our time, efforts and investments are focused on the CMG category. For example, we've done some extensive R&D and consumer market research over the last year that will result in a meaningful new product launch by year-end. And the barkTHINS acquisition will give us a chocolate stacking platform, or, as we like to call it, snackfection, to build upon. We're focused on organic innovation and growth, as well as acquisitions that meet the needs of the candy loyalist; CMG's variety-seeking consumers who like to try new things and consumers looking for better-for-you reassurance. Looking at U.S. marketplace performance, Nielsen retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ended March 26, 2016, benefits from an early Easter. Recall, Easter was March 27 in 2016 and April 5 in 2015. As a result, CMG category growth was 8.7% for the 12 weeks ended March 26, 2016, within the xAOC+C channels. Hershey's first quarter CMG retail takeaway in the x-AOC+C universe increased 8.2%. Market share performance was in line with our expectations. Importantly, chocolate market share increased 0.1 point in Q1; however, this was offset by non-chocolate candy performance. As a reminder, the April Nielsen data will be impacted by the timing of Easter in the year-ago period; therefore, CMG and Hershey performance for the April year-to-date period will be less than Q1. Let me now build on my earlier comments and give you some details on our brand and in-store activity over the remainder of the year. Though we have already made investments, results have been solid. Specifically, Reese's market share is up 0.4 point in 2016, driven by new and refreshed television and digital marketing campaigns. Other brands that we're investing in include Kit Kat, where we launched a new Big Kat Kit Kat candy bar that is now available. And look for some interesting millennial-targeted creative TV and digital campaigns using a Big Kat, literally, storming the streets of New York. The Reese's Snack Mix and Hershey's Snack Bites instant consumable items are off to a fast start with industry-leading innovation velocities. They're highly incremental to our base business and we're following it up with take-home canisters. And we're also excited about some of the big in-store programming events, such as our classic S'mores promotion, our new Team USA Summer Olympics sponsorship and Hershey's cross-category in-store events, which leverages our new mega brand strategy. In the second half of the year, we'll also begin to communicate our simple ingredients message that will focus on Hershey bars and Kisses milk chocolate. And we also continue to gain share in gum with our category-leading Ice Breakers brand. We've added additional capacity to meet demand and will be supporting it with a new advertising campaign in Q2. This is just a brief summary of some of the strong activity we have in North America that will grow the business in the rest of the year. Now, for an update on our International business, net sales were in line with our plan. Excluding China, where we knew sales would be down year-over-year as we lap the slowdown that occurred after the 2015 Chinese New Year sell-in and the discontinued India oil business, constant currency net sales increased about 3.6%. I was pleased with Mexico and Brazil, where constant currency first quarter net sales increased 4.2% and 9.6%, respectively. And in both markets, chocolate category growth was in the high single digits. In Mexico, we're optimizing mix to focus on global chocolate brands and building on our Sigma relationship to accelerate coverage and share in the traditional trade. In Brazil, we're continuing to focus on the Hershey mega brand milk chocolate tablet bars, cookies and cream and the Mais wafer product. Constant currency net sales in India declined versus the year-ago period, due to the discontinuance of the edible oil business. The media invested brands, Jolly Rancher, Sofit (11:19) and Hershey's Syrup, where we are focusing our efforts and investments, both all increased double digits. As we enter the second quarter, a new chapter for Hershey's business in China begins, as we've merged the two teams into one united organization. Our initial plans impact some of our people in functions where there is some overlap. Savings here are not material at this point, but we're working towards balancing our business model in China versus our opportunities. Importantly, in 2016, Golden Monkey got off to a good start, with net sales below last year but in line with our plans and expectations. Most of these sales were made to quality distributors who paid cash on delivery. We're executing against our plans to bring variety, news and excitement to the Golden and Munching Monkey candy and snacks business. Confectionery innovation is focused on milk candies targeting young families, the better-for-me segment, and Chinese classics, while protein-based snacks is concentrated on additional bean curd flavors and the introduction of a vegan and soy sausage. China chocolate category sales in Q1 declined about 10%, the low end of our forecasted range. Given the slow start to the year, we adjusted our outlook for the year, but still expect double-digit net sales growth in 2016 as we lap the trade funds that were necessary in the second and third quarters of 2015. Additionally, over the remainder of the year, we'll be focused on establishing our new Houten over brand message (13:05) to reengage Hershey's and Kisses consumers. This is tied into a fully-integrated campaign including TV advertising, digital communications, and in-store merchandising that will bring the brands to life. While small, our e-commerce business in China continues to do well. In the first quarter, our e-commerce retail takeaway increased by 45%, driven by Chinese New Year gifting sales. We continue to outpace the category, and have a plus 10% share of the e-commerce chocolate market. Over the long term, we expect global economies and category trends to improve, and that the investments in our International business to contribute about one point to our overall long-term sales target. Now to wrap up. From time-to-time, there are different confluences in the marketplace that can impact snacks and CMG growth. Hershey has always navigated and invested in its core CMG business throughout these cycles, and has always ended up in a more solid position. We are a consumer-centric, brand-building company focused on innovation and growth in every category where we participate, especially confectionery, and we want to satisfy the needs of our retail customers and new and existing consumers. We take a long-term focus, and continue to believe that investing in our business will benefit the company this year and well into the future. I'll now turn it over to Patricia, who will provide you with details on our financial results. Patricia A. Little - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thank you, J.P. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. First quarter net sales of $1.83 billion declined 5.6% versus last year, relatively in line with our forecast, although partially due to the timing that J.P. referred to. Adjusted earnings per share-diluted came in at $1.10, an increase of about 1% versus last year, due to greater-than-expected productivity and cost savings versus our January estimate. Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 1.2 points, net sales declined 4.4% and was relatively in line with our forecast. Price realization on seasonal CMG products was more than offset by increased levels of direct trade, resulting in a net price realization headwind of 50 basis points. Volume was off 4.3 points due to a shorter Easter season and planned lower sales in China. Net acquisitions and divestitures were a 40 basis point benefit. By segment, first quarter North America net sales declined 4.3% versus last year, due primarily to the shorter Easter season. Excluding the 40 basis point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates in Canada, North America net sales decreased 3.9% versus the year-ago period. Volume was off 3.7 points and the list price increase on seasonal CMG products was more than offset by increased levels of direct trade, resulting in a net price realization headwind of 70 basis points. As we mentioned in January, the direct trade was primarily related to programs in the marketplace; however, the aforementioned softness of everyday non-promoted items resulted in greater-than-expected unfavorable price mix. The combined Allan Candy and Krave acquisitions, as well as the Mauna Loa divestiture, were a 50 basis point benefit. Total International and Other segment net sales for the first quarter declined 15.4% versus last year. Foreign currency exchange rates were unfavorable by 7.3 points. The International and Other segment volume was off 8.4 points, due primarily to the net sales decline in China, as sell-in related to Chinese New Year season was lower than last year. International net price realization was a one point benefit, and the impact of the Mauna Loa divestiture a 70 basis point headwind. Turning now to margins, adjusted gross margin increased 20 basis points in the first quarter, driven by greater-than-expected supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by unfavorable sales mix and other supply chain costs. On a net basis, commodity and packaging costs were slightly favorable. For the full year, we expect gross margin to be slightly down, as greater productivity and cost savings, and a slightly better dairy environment, at least for the time being, is more than offset by inflation and unfavorable sales mix, given the update to our non-seasonal and instant consumable candy outlook in North America. Operating profit in the first quarter was in line with the year-ago period, resulting in operating profit margin of 21.5%, an increase of 120 basis points versus last year. The increase was driven by gross margin gains and lower SM&A selling, marketing and administrative expenses. Total advertising and related consumer marketing expense declined about 10% versus the first quarter of 2015, due to timing. North America advertising and related consumer marketing expense is expected to increase over the remainder of 2016. SM&A, excluding advertising and related consumer marketing, declined 9.3%, driven by the implementation of the business productivity program announced last June and the company's continued focus on efficiency and cost savings initiatives. Now, let me provide a brief update on our International and Other segment. I'm pleased that our total International business delivered on their Q1 plans. As J.P. stated, we're executing against our plans in the key markets of China, Mexico, Brazil and India, and making good progress. Adding to J.P.'s commentary on China, chocolate category contraction was greater than our estimate. Our updated forecast for the year reflects a return to growth, albeit at a lower level. If the broader economy doesn't improve, there could be further risk to our full year china chocolate and Golden Monkey sales forecast. Distributor demand and net sales of Golden Monkey items have been consistent for the last two quarters, driven by programs and products that are leveraging promotions associated with the lunar calendar Year of the Monkey. Given the increased level of in-store programming and innovation, we expect similar results over the next couple of quarters. Combined with the higher level of trade promotion that we'll be lapping, we're targeting Golden Monkey net sales to increase around 20% this year. Moving down the corporate P&L, first quarter interest expense of $21 million increased $1.8 million versus last year. For the full year, we expect interest expense to be in the $90 million to $95 million range, greater than our previous estimate of $85 million to $90 million, due to the use of commercial paper related to the barkTHINS acquisition. The adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was 35% and in line with last year. In 2016, we expect to purchase about the same amount of tax credits as we did last year, which should result in an adjusted tax rate that's similar to 2015. In the second quarter, we expect the adjusted tax rate to be about 30%, due to the timing and purchase of tax credits. For the first quarter of 2016, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 217.5 million shares, down 5.2 million versus last year, resulting in adjusted earnings per share-diluted of $1.10, or an increase of about 1% versus a year ago. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow, at the end of the first quarter, net trading capital decreased versus last year's first quarter by $25 million. Accounts receivable was lower by $63 million and remains extremely current. Inventory was higher by $25 million and accounts payable declined by $13 million. Total capital additions, including software, were $41.4 million in the first quarter. For the full year, we expect CapEx to be in the $285 million to $295 million range. During the first quarter, depreciation and amortization was $60 million and dividends paid were $122 million. In the first quarter, the company repurchased $304 million of outstanding shares. $20 million were repurchased against the $250 million authorization approved in February 2015, and $284 million were repurchased against the $500 million authorization approved in January 2016. Cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $286 million, slightly lower than a year ago. As J.P. mentioned earlier, today, we announced the acquisition of the barkTHINS snacking chocolate line. We expect that the acquisition will be dilutive in 2016 and 2017, primarily due to the book amortization of intangibles before turning accretive in 2018. The all-cash purchase price and the near-term earnings dilution is partially offset by about $50 million to $60 million in cash flow net tax benefits associated with the tax amortizations of intangible assets in the basis step-up. The tax amortization provides a future cash flow benefit. As a result, netting the benefit against the growth acquisition purchase price results in a deal multiple that is similar to other high-growth CPG assets. As J.P. summarized, over the remainder of the year, we have a lot of innovation, variety and news going into the marketplace. In-store merchandising and program activity is greater than last year. And advertising and related consumer marketing is expected to increase mid to high single digits on a percentage basis versus last year over the next three quarters. Therefore, for the full year, excluding unfavorable foreign currency exchange of approximately one point, and the barkTHINS acquisition of about 0.5 point, net sales growth is expected to accelerate and increase to around 2%. This is less than the previous estimate of about 3%, due to the previously-mentioned lower than expected U.S. non-seasonal CMG growth and macroeconomic headwinds in China. The company expects gross margin to be slightly lower than last year, due to unfavorable mix related to lower non-seasonal sales. The business productivity initiative announced in June and the incremental CIP savings are on track and should result in a reduction in SM&A expenses as we continue to leverage existing resources. As a result, the company expects adjusted earnings per share-diluted to increase 3% to 4%, including dilution from acquisitions of $0.05 to $0.06 per share and be in the $4.24 to $4.28 range. Before we open it up to Q&A, just a couple of thoughts on the second quarter; we expect constant currency net sales growth in Q2 to be greater than our full-year outlook; however, the impact of unfavorable sates mix is greatest in the second quarter and may result in gross margin decline of 50 to 100 basis points. Additionally, advertising and related consumer marketing is expected to increase the most on a percentage basis versus last year in the second quarter. This is one of the levers in our marketing mix model that we believe will result in improved pull (25:27) or retail takeaway in the second half of the year. Therefore, we expect that EPS will be pressured in the second quarter. Thank you for your time this morning, and we'll now take any questions you may have. Operator : Our first question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning, everybody. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning, everybody. Thank you. Yeah, just one question from me, I think based on the full-year guidance change on sales that you've talked about, most of which seems to be in North America, I guess based on just some admittedly back-of-the-envelope math, I guess, it seems like North America would need to show, call it, 3% to 3.5% constant currency sales growth from here on out versus the minus sort of 4% plus in the first quarter. So I guess the question is just sort of how do we get from here to there, particularly if, I guess, as the press release seems to suggest \u2013 I could have it wrong \u2013 that North America takeaway is expected to be sort of flattish moving forward? Thanks. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. So I think, Andrew, you're in the right ballpark on the April to December take to make. If you look at North America, it'd be probably a little over 3% to get there. So I think you've got that right. If you look at our plans in North America, they really do accelerate in the second half of the year, so a number of the investments that we've made really against a combination of innovation and advertising should begin to show up there, lots of solid in-store merchandising. So I think that's why we're optimistic on the second half of the year. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Athlos Research. Please go ahead. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Jon. Jonathan P. Feeney - Athlos Research : Good morning, guys. Thanks very much. I'm trying to understand how the advertising and consumer marketing expense changes this quarter effect of the quarter maybe the rest of the year. Am I right just going through some disclosures for last year, that for the full year, I see you disclosed advertising and then it gives us some rates of change that that advertising and consumer marketing together is about 13.5% of sales? Does that sound about right? Mark K. Pogharian - Vice President- Investor Relations : Yeah, Jon. I think you only see advertising in the 10-K, so there's other consumer marketing-related stuff that we include in the disclosures in the release this morning related to consumer promotion and some other in-store activities. So, I don't have that number off the top of my head, but I'll try and help you out later on. Jonathan P. Feeney - Athlos Research : Okay. I guess then just one clarification. Is all of that advertising and consumer marketing expense \u2013 and you're talking about year-over-year change \u2013 all of that actually expense or is some of those like net revenue items, like some of the in-store promotion costs, that would be recognized as offsets to revenue? Patricia A. Little - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : No. This is Patricia. That would be in the trade as a reduction between gross and net sales. The comments that we were making this morning are the pieces that are in the SM&A line. Jonathan P. Feeney - Athlos Research : Okay. So separately, when you made the comment that a little bit more trade spending, it looked like because of some change from quarter-to-quarter, some products that were initially expected to ship in the second quarter in the first, that wouldn't be reflected in that decline because that would be trade spending? Patricia A. Little - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : That's right. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That would be correct. Jonathan P. Feeney - Athlos Research : Great. Okay, that helps me out a lot. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Eric. Eric Richard Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, good morning. I have actually two kind of specific, I guess, accounting questions. Maybe it's for you, Patricia, but I'm a little bit surprised that, unless there's some kind of patent or large foodservice component, why would the non-cash amortization expense be so high on this acquisition? And then the second, the change in the accounting, I guess, from comprehensive other income to what you're now doing, which is the exclusion of the volatility on the mark-to-market, so the $0.10 loss that you've excluded, was there a similar type of loss a year ago or how do we kind of treat that relative to how you've been billing it in the past? Patricia A. Little - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, happy to answer that. Let me start with that one. So up until last year, we used and met all the requirements to use GAAP hedge accounting. That allowed us to put the volatility related to mark-to-market into our other comprehensive income, or essentially on the balance sheet. It didn't flow through the P&L. We proactively decided to go off of hedge accounting. You may or may not know this, but it's a very onerous FASB requirement to make. A lot of our peers have done this. And when we looked at the cost benefit of doing this, we just didn't feel that it was worth it, especially since the standard kept getting tougher and tougher to meet. So what we decided to do \u2013 and we talked about this, I think, in the third and the fourth quarter \u2013 is we would stay off of hedge accounting and allow that volatility to flow through the P&L, but we also want to call that out for you so that you can see that because it's volatility that's not consistent with the earnings that we use internally as well as prior periods. So that's why we adjusted it out in our adjusted earnings. So when you look at the impact in the first quarter, there was no comparable piece of it to be adjusted out last time. However, on an adjusted basis, the two numbers are comparable. We got there by different means. Going forward, as we lap all those quarters, you'll continue to see it coming out of the adjustment in both periods. Eric Richard Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So you're going to exclude it from quarter-to-quarter and then in the fourth quarter, just have one big number, I guess, that adjusts for the year or something like that? Patricia A. Little - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : No, every quarter is different and they net out. You can have a quarter where it's positive. You can have a quarter where it's negative. What we want to do is match the ultimate mark-to-market that we have on the hedging contract with the period that we actually buy the underlying commodity. So, for example, if we buy cocoa forward and in one quarter it might be positive, in the next quarter it might be negative, by the time we buy the cocoa, that's when we want to recognize the net impact of that volatility, so that it ties to the time that we're actually buying the cocoa and we get the net overall hedged price for the cocoa. And that's the most common approach now in CPG in terms of the complexity related to commodity hedging. Eric Richard Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, and then, on the second piece, on the bark... Patricia A. Little - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Oh yeah, the barkTHINS, sorry. So yeah, we called out the fact that there are some very specific tax things related to the barkTHINS acquisition. If you net that out, you would find that we're paying really in the same kind of multiple for a high-growth CPG asset that we, as well as others, have paid in the past. Typically, that's a three to four times. And that, of course, since what you're buying in all of these companies essentially is a brand, creates the amortization of intangibles going forward, as well as other costs related to integration. But it's primarily the intangibles which get amortized over the period that the accounting requires them to, and that's what leads to the dilution. Eric Richard Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. All right. Thanks for taking the time. I'll pass it on. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel. Please go ahead. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, good morning. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I just had a question for you, if I could just talk about the new or incremental cost saving programs. The level of incremental savings coming through, is that meant to offset inflation? And I should say, are the overall savings meant to offset inflation, with the remainder then sort of reinvested back in the business? I'm trying to get a sense of how much of this can flow to the bottom line and how much of this should can sort of be available for you to reinvest? And maybe if I could ask, just related to that, you talked about, I think, $10 million to $15 million of incremental savings in 2016. Again, is that sort of earmarked for reinvestment? I'm just trying to understand how those incremental savings are going to be used this year. Patricia A. Little - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. It's Patricia again. So the way I think about it is this, we've always had about $50 million to $70 million of productivity that's come through, primarily in the supply chain arena. And those guys have done a terrific job of offsetting underlying COGS inflation, so we end up with flat or good margin expansion based on their efforts. What we've done, starting in June of last year, is we also had a productivity program that we announced, and have been executing on here more in our corporate functions. And we got some benefit of that last year, and we're going to get another $40 million of benefit from it this year. That's at the high end of the range, by the way, of what we announced. We've been over-delivering on that. And then, what we announced today is incremental savings, again in the SM&A category, of $10 million to $15 million. Now, as you know, most of our cost in SM&A, besides specific costs for advertising, are salary (35:39) cost-related. And we do have inflation, salary cost inflation and benefits inflation, that hit us every year. Think of that as it being about 3%. So what we'd like to do is be able to offset that, but, in general, we're focusing on taking that discipline and continuous improvement mindset that the supply chain guys have done so well, and really migrating that over to all of our corporate functions, to help them and help all of us, offset the inflation the same way that the supply chain guys have done. And, yeah, I would say that that absolutely gives us the fuel to have those marketing and other advertising expenses that we need to ignite the market and push that second half growth that we're looking towards this year. So it's absolutely a big help for us in achieving that. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And just to be clear then, Patricia, you mentioned $40 million this year from a productivity program, so is it $40 million and then $10 million to $15 million on top of that? Patricia A. Little - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : That's right. Mark K. Pogharian - Vice President- Investor Relations : Well, no. It's, actually \u2013 we get $50 million to $70 million... Patricia A. Little - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. Mark K. Pogharian - Vice President- Investor Relations : Normal productivity, Chris. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Mark K. Pogharian - Vice President- Investor Relations : So it puts us at the high end of that $70 million. There's $10 million to $15 million on top of that, plus the $40 million, $35 million, or whatever it is, from last year's June initiative as well. Patricia A. Little - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So think of it... Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Patricia A. Little - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : As totaling $120 million to $125 million, but also pointing out that the $70 million is at the high end of what we've typically gotten every year, whereas the other two are specific to this year, and less comparable to prior years' activities. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you for your time. Operator : Your next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Bryan. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, good morning, everyone. Just a question, follow-up on the cost savings initiative, or the expansion of it that you announced this morning; think in the press release, or maybe in the prepared remarks, you talked a little bit about how maybe some of that might be related to China, but I guess it just seems like, given how different the sale, the revenues are in that business now versus the original expectations, that maybe there might be a bigger opportunity on cost savings. So can you just talk about, I guess, how much of the expansion of the savings program is related to China? And I guess, is there a potential that there'd be something even above and beyond, as we kind of look out into the future? John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So let's \u2013 both Patricia and I'll take that. First of all, as we continue to look at our China business, you heard in my remarks that we want to balance our investments there with what we see as the opportunities. We know that the market right now is certainly challenged, but, at the same time, we're in the midst of working through our integration. We want to make sure that we make good decisions there for the long-term. And as we continue to get familiar with our overall go-to-market strategy and how we brought the two businesses together, we just want to be prudent, in terms of making sure we're making good decisions. At the same time, we do believe that there is opportunities, within our China business, to go further than we have at the current point in time. So I'll let Patricia, if she wants, to add any additional perspective. Patricia A. Little - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : The one thing I'd add to that is really pointing out the progress that's been made in bringing the two organizations together. While there were clearly some disappointments in our acquisition of Golden Monkey, the fundamentals of why we bought it are still there. We really like the access (39:09) to the traditional trade. We really like the two brands that they bring to us as Golden and Munching Monkey. And we think that's a very good complement to our strength in the three brands that we have in the chocolate business in China and our focus there on the modern trade, a little bit over-indexed to hypermarket, which we can certainly see in our results. So the team there has done a nice job of bringing that together. While that's generated some cost savings and, frankly, we're still looking and I think we'll find some more, I think the really important thing is bringing the two businesses together to exploit the strengths that they each individually have. And that's what I would add to J.P.s remarks about balance. That's the part that we're balancing. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Rob. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning. Hey, J.P., the article in The Wall Street Journal today and also your comments in your acquisition point to a lot of strategic efforts to expand snacks, but the comments on the call are about slowing category growth in candy, mint and gum. And I'm just wondering. This seems like a pretty critical time for the category. You say that you need to re-accelerate the growth. Can you give us a little more color on this meaningful launch that you talked about in the back half of the year? What's the marketing objective of that launch? What's the risk that you're taking, the investment you're meaning to make, and are you worried that your core operations might take their eye off the ball a little bit if all of the efforts are on snacking? Thanks. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, first of all, thank you for the question. And I'll try to add as much perspective as I can. On some level, I'm not going to go into as much detail as you'd like, just for competitive reasons, but let me put it in perspective that snacks today, if you look at the pure snacking type stuff outside of confectionery, and outside of our grocery business, is really only 2% of our total business. If you put in those other pantry-type businesses, spreads, et cetera, it's about 9% of the business. So confectionery is at the core of who we are and what we do. What we've seen as we've continued to do some demand landscape work, is there's an interesting area around what we call snackfection. And if you look at some of our recent, like the Reese's Mix and Bites products, those have been terrific for us. They don't show up in our market share because they're actually captured in snacks, but we're very, very pleased with how we've progressed there. So I think that what you should take away is, is that we are very focused against our core, innovating around our core and executing against the fundamentals in a very competitive and changing snacking environment, but we really see an immediate opportunity in this area of snackfection for the company. And then, as you look at how consumers' relationship with food has changed, we recognize that the snacking continuum has grown. And so products like Krave, which we're learning a lot from and are very pleased, will always be part of our test and learn and grow strategies, but it doesn't take away from our core focus. And so around affordability, one of the things that you see is there's new users and consumer occasions that we see as a big opportunity. So confection has always been a part of snacking. I think there's been some confusion around when we talk about snacking, is if it's something different than confection. And the fact of the matter is confection has always been snacking with the biggest part of the snack wheel. And so as these new occasions arise and new opportunities arise for the company, we want to be able to take advantage of them, succeed with the brands we have and then also be able to expand in some of these new segments. And there's a significant blurring across this total snacking category that we think has added some of the lumpiness and challenges to the categories. You see so many new items and choices for the consumer. And I think as that all sorts out, the single most important thing for us is to continue to build on our brand relevance and the fact that consumers have relationships with our brands. And that's why we like to talk about being a consumer-centric and brand-building company. We don't think we've lost anything there, but we certainly would tell you that there's lots of opportunities and we have to be at our best to take advantage of them. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Can I ask a quick follow-up? Brookside Farms, the data hasn't looked very good. Can you tell us what's happening there? John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think there's a couple of things and I'll let Michele join in here as well, if she has anything to add, but as we look at the Brookside brand, we've been really pleased with the growth of the brand. It's done terrific in terms of establishing itself as the number two or three dark chocolate brand in the category. It's got great repeat purchase of somewhere in the range of like 50%, which is really, really high. It's ahead of our acquisition strategy. Now, we have lost some distribution in the club channel. We also believe that as we have expanded it, we need to continue to work on the brand positioning some. And you'll see that we've got a whole new advertising effort there. And then, we also probably would tell you that we have expanded some of the offerings maybe a little bit ahead of ourselves. And we need to make sure that we just continue to work on the base brand proposition. So as we do that, we continue to have a lot of confidence in the brand. I don't know if Michele wants to add anything, but those would be my comments. Michele G. Buck - President- North America : I think you covered it pretty well. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from David Driscoll with Citigroup. Please go ahead. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Morning, David. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thank you and good morning. I had a couple of follow-ups and then a question. So just to be clear to Chris Growe's question, will the incremental cost savings be reinvested back into the business in 2017 through 2019? So forget the 2016 numbers. You answered that well, but I'm not clear on the 2017 through 2019 period. Patricia A. Little - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. I guess I'd say it in this way. It's a part of our long-term EPS guidance, but at the base of that long-term EPS guidance is an investment philosophy about growth in our core and adjacent categories. That's the fundamental driver. So I would say, yes, it's absolutely part of our whole algorithm. It needs to be a balanced algorithm between sales growth and cost discipline. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): I mean, it's not a small number. I mean, at the high end, it's 3.5 points of EPS growth, so I appreciate that, but it's a large number. Second follow-up is on China, when I just do some rough math, I mean, it feels like that business is losing like $30 million in the quarter, something like that. I mean, I think all your other businesses are profitable, so it's quite a large loss. You mentioned, J.P., that you would align the cost to the opportunity, but really simply, are the savings that you would expect to happen in the China operations, are they embedded in this new cost savings program? Patricia A. Little - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I'll start with that and then maybe J.P. can give a little more color around China. Yes, it's part of the $10 million to $15 million incremental savings that we announced. And as I think we've also made clear, we're continuing to look at balancing the cost structure against the opportunities in the market and then that may result in further savings going forward, but that's a work in progress and not something we were going to talk about or announce today. With that, let me turn it over to J.P. to talk about how he sees the overall long-term opportunity in the market. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I think, David, there's a couple of things that I would say. First of all, China, for us, is probably an invest market for a period of time. While that profile may change, I think that we'll, for some period of time, continue to be in a brand-building type mode. Let me just take a step back and maybe clear up a couple of things in terms of how I view what we're currently doing in China. So the first, most important, thing we needed to do following the recent acquisition was just gain control of the business. As we've all been quite open and talked about, there were some surprises there and things that we weren't very pleased with, but we feel very good about the efforts the team has made and that we've gained control of what we have there. Now, we're in the process of creating a solid foundation. It's around org structure. It's around the systems we need to run the business and a big piece of the integration, and so that creating the foundation is really where we're at. And then the third phase is, is that we have to execute against the business we have. Unfortunately, it's a volatile market with some uncertainty right now, so when I talk about being balanced, we have to make sure that we can afford the organization structure and our go-to-market strategies there. But, listen, we believe in a merging middle class. We believe in urbanization. We think these are markets that, over time, we want to be in. So from a quarter-to-quarter basis, it may be tough to make some of those strategic decisions. And then, if we execute well, results come. And we'll be able to then do the things that we do well and grow our brands in the market and grow with the category and overcome some of these, what I would believe are more short-term challenges. I think, importantly, that's how I think about it. And so that's the best way for, I think, you guys to think about it, as well. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): If I could sneak one last clarification in, you mentioned in both your script and in the press release, there's the potential for upside to the outlook. J.P., it's kind of unusual when a company is reducing guidance to then mention upside to the outlook. And so I feel like you're really trying to tell us something here, but it's not that clear to me. Are you saying that Q1 trends are just kind of not representative and you really need to get into the rest of the year to understand where the sales growth is and you've taken it down because of what Q1 has done, but it's almost like you don't believe it or something with this upside to the outlook comment? Can you help me out? John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, no, I think, David, what I would tell you is, is that as we look at the marketplace and what we see is happening in Q1, that we're being prudent in the comments that we're making. We're optimistic within our plan that we always want to grow share ahead of the market. And that's what we're going to be challenged with. And, again, if we also believe that we deliver against some of the other cost initiatives and things that we have, that we'll be able to meet the guidance that we've given you. So I don't want you to take that comment differently than what we've said with regard to our guidance, other than we have some optimism. And I'll let Michele talk a little bit about the second half and give you a sense of how she's thinking about it as well. Michele G. Buck - President- North America : Sure. As we look at the year to go, we have a lot of activity. As you know, DMEs were not up versus prior year in Q1, so we've really lined up a lot of our investment with what's to come. We're rapidly expanding gum behind the capacity expansion investment we made last year. And the advertising, we have a new campaign that's just going on air now. Snack Mix and Snack Bites, we've actually been constrained and not actually even able to service enough. We've had to cut off all merchandising because of how well those items have done, so we're really going to be able to get behind that in a bigger way as the year goes on. Big Kat's just launching. We're a sponsor of the Olympics, which is going to be huge from a merchandising perspective. And, as we told you guys last year when we started to see some softness in share at the end of the year, we made a decision to invest to be more competitive. And just given the timeline it takes to get those dollars in the marketplace, that really kicks in beginning in May. We have the birthday execution that's really going to expand, so just a lot of activity coming in the back part of the year that we have a lot of confidence in, and we're cautiously optimistic about some of the potential anomalies we may have seen in Q1 in February, but we want to be prudent about the marketplace and balancing that with the aggressive programming we have rest of year. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Patricia, I just wanted to better understand the approach toward trade spending. Over the balance of the year as you talked about direct trade that was already in place, that seems to have been a headwind to pricing, but not necessarily a material source of support on the non-seasonal side. So given that, are you comfortable with the returns you're getting on incremental promotion? And how does this play into the outlook for trade spending, specifically on promoted price points, over the balance of the year \u2013 not on the new product offerings? Patricia A. Little - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, we're comfortable. Of course, we're always looking at that. Michele and her teams do a great job of balancing out the right ways to do trade promotion, merchandising, advertising. I mean, it needs to be a holistic marketing model, and I think she's doing a good job on that. And I'll let her talk a little bit more about how she's thinking about trade promotion. Mark K. Pogharian - Vice President- Investor Relations : Yeah. One thing on the math, sorry. Patricia A. Little - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Oh, go ahead. Mark K. Pogharian - Vice President- Investor Relations : Sorry, Patricia. It's Mark, Matt. One thing to think about, though, I think in the release and in the remarks, I think you could tease out, but hopefully you teased out that some of the programming that we thought was going ship in April shipped in March. So with that comes some typical promotion \u2013 not discounting, but typical promotion. And because that replaced what we thought at the time was going to be everyday or non-promoted prices, that's the negative impact you're seeing on the price mix. So it's not because there was a lot of trade because of deep discounting or anything, it was just that mix that ended up happening in the first quarter that had price being negative at the end of the day. Sorry, Michele. Michele G. Buck - President- North America : No. No, that's okay. And as I think we mentioned on the prior question, the incremental investments we've made to really drive against merchandising begin middle of Q2 to hit the marketplace, and a lot of big events like Olympics, et cetera, that we're investing in, the ability to merchandise Snack Mix, as I mentioned. So I think we've covered that. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks, everyone. Operator : And your next question comes from Kenneth Zaslow with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey, good morning, everyone. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Morning, Ken. Patricia A. Little - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Morning, Ken. Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I just had two follow-up questions. One is, what is the opportunity in barkTHINS in terms of, it's $65 million to $75 million? How big could it actually become, and what are you thinking about the possibility for that? And what are the avenues for growth for that? I'm just trying to figure out, is it just distribution? What is the actual outlook for that business? Michele G. Buck - President- North America : Yeah. We think we have the opportunity. I mean, it's a very viable consumer proposition that's grounded in the very on-trend area of clean label and fully sustainable profile. It's a less sweet kind of taste profile. So yeah, we think we have the opportunity to take a great proposition and leverage our Hershey muscle and scale to expand distribution to make it more available, and also to increase brand awareness. I would liken it somewhat to Brookside, and what we did with Brookside when we purchased that. It allows us strategically to expand into mass premium, to have a product that is very well-liked by Millennials, and to capture that opportunity to just expand beyond that. Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): And then, my next question just is, how do you decide on what you think is structural versus short-term issues? And what evidence do you have that says some of these issues are short-term? I'm just trying to figure out where you guys are coming from, in terms of \u2013 how your long-term growth strategy in terms of sales, but you keep on saying there's some headwinds and they're short-term. I'm just trying to figure out how you think about them as being short-term versus structural, and what evidence do you have? John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well I think that, if you look across what's happening in the total space, I think these are more cyclical versus structural issues. We continue to have a lot of enthusiasm for all the advantages of the category that we're in. I think if you look at the history of, I'll call it, snacking as well as confectionery, it's always been changing. You've seen a number of different types of trends and things in the market. I think one of the events that makes this current period of time unique is the amount of choice that there is in the market relative to what I think we've historically seen. That means that trial has moved around a lot. At the same time, you have some different things impacting retailers. And we've come out of a period of time of some uncertainty in economies. And so I think all of those things have made it a more challenging environment, but I don't think those are structural things, where major changes have taken place. Now you've heard me talk about, consumers have a changing relationship with food. So much of that is really around transparency as much as it is anything else, where people are wanting to understand ingredients better than they ever have before. And as manufacturers, we're all responding to that. Certainly we are as well. But, as I take a step back and just look at the overall industry as well as the category that we compete in, I think many of the things that are happening are far more cyclical than I would think about them as structural. Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good morning, everyone. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, good morning, Alexia. Patricia A. Little - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. So are you able to estimate the underlying CMG category growth in North America if you flush out all the timing shifts and so on? Are you able to get at that number? And as a quick follow-up, can you comment on how you're planning to respond to the Vermont requirement for the mandatory labeling of foods containing genetically modified ingredients that's due to come in in July? Thank you very much. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. So, I'll start with the latter and then go to the first part of your question. So, I'll speak specifically to Hershey. We have products that will need to meet the Vermont labeling requirements of, contains GMO ingredients. And then we have some products that don't need to be labeled. So appropriately, we will abide by what's happening in Vermont and label as appropriate. And then, I hope that, at the Federal level, there's clarity brought to this question, because it becomes an interstate commerce issue. If you have different states taking different approaches, it would make it very confusing for manufacturing, manufacturers. And so I do hope that there's some clarity around how labeling happens if it's a required on a broader basis. And then, as you know, we've committed to transparency. We're very big supporters of SmartLabel, which gives consumers the ability to engage with our brands and understand what are in the ingredients, et cetera. So that's how we'll deal with Vermont. And then on the category growth rate, I'll let Michele talk to that with regard to North America. Michele G. Buck - President- North America : Yeah, so we're estimating that the category growth rate in North America would between 2% and 2.5%, which is about where we've seen it over the past couple years, a little bit on the lighter side if we go down to the 2% range. We anticipate that our takeaway will be greater than that, such that we will gain a little bit of share. And obviously, with the Easter timing issue that occurred on a year-to-date basis and some of the softness that we saw in Q1, we are still waiting to see how that plays out, but that's our long-term estimate is 2% to 2.5% and that's what we're thinking it'll be for the year. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on. Mark K. Pogharian - Vice President- Investor Relations : Operator, we have time for one more call and then we'll call it a morning. Operator : And your final question comes from John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, John. Mark K. Pogharian - Vice President- Investor Relations : Morning, John. John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Thanks for the question. J.P. or Michele, just sticking with the trade promotion bigger picture, if I look at your promotion as a percentage of sales, in 2015, it wasn't much higher than the levels you were spending seven or eight years ago, yet the broader category snacking environment's much more competitive. I mean, how would you assess your current levels of trade spend and maybe your thoughts on the notion that Hershey's is going to be under-investing a bit in promo, given the impulse nature of the category? John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, again, we can kind of tag team this, but I do think that we are seeing a more competitive environment than we have seen for a period of time. We know that in 2015, we probably lost a little bit on quality merch versus where we'd have liked to have been. And so as we look at the opportunities and landscape in 2016, we don't want to have that happen to us again. One of the comments I would just make is, is that there's less space as retailers have clean floors, so the competitiveness to get that space is not just within our category. It's really across multiple categories. And that's put a premium on the cost of, I'll call it, doing business in some classes of trade. John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Thanks, J.P. Thanks for the question John P. Bilbrey - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, thank you. Mark K. Pogharian - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you very much for joining us this morning, and the IR team will be available for any follow-up calls that you may have. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's program. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you, and have a great day.",

My name is Keith and I will be your conference operator today. [Operator Instructions] Please note this call maybe recorded. Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn the program over to Mr. Mark Pogharian. Please go ahead, sir. Mark Pogharian : Thank you, Keith. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to The Hershey Company\u2019s second quarter 2016 conference call. J.P. Bilbrey, Chairman, President and CEO and Patricia Little, Senior Vice President and CFO will provide you with an overview of results, which will then be followed by a Q&A session. Let me remind everyone listening that today\u2019s conference call may contain statements which are forward-looking. These statements are based on our current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning\u2019s press release and in our 10-K for 2015 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and the summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance within GAAP. Within the notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. As a result, we will discuss second quarter results excluding net pre-tax charges of $13.9 million or $0.17 per share diluted which are primarily related to derivative mark-to-market losses and business realignment charges. These charges are defined in the appendix of this morning\u2019s earnings release, which is available on our website at www.thehersheycompany.com. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these items. With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey. J.P. Bilbrey: Thanks, Mark and good morning to everyone on the phone and webcast. Second quarter sales and earnings performance was slightly better than our expectations primarily due to timing in the U.S. International and Other segment operating and marketplace performance was a bit greater than our expectations, and we\u2019re making progress against our strategic initiatives. The integration related to the barkTHINS acquisition is well under way, and we\u2019re excited about the opportunity here and how it fits into our broader Snackfection strategy. Work continues on the snacking insights and consumer market segmentation that I mentioned last quarter. We are making progress and I look forward to sharing what we have learned in the near future as it will be a catalyst of our go-to-market confectionery and Snackfection strategy over the upcoming strategic planning cycle. The feedback we have received from consumers to date is that sweet snacking, think chocolate and textural ingredients, as well as other food value inclusions, such as nuts, seeds, cookie pieces, berries, etcetera, are high value components that are a gateway to permissible indulgence and sweet snacking throughout the day. In fact, some of the initial work done here has resulted in an exciting Snackfection item that we will be launching late in the fourth quarter. Looking at U.S. marketplace performance, total Hershey U.S. retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ending July 9, 2016 within the xAOC+C channels increased 0.5%, with market share off 0.1 points. This represents all Hershey manufactured products sold at retail, such as candy, mint, gum, salty snacks, Krave, chocolate syrup and snack bars. For the year-to-date period ending July 9, 2016, candy, mint and gum, or CMG, category growth was 0.8% and was impacted by a shorter Easter season. Non-seasonal CMG category growth progressed in the second quarter. However, it was less than estimated as we anticipated better results given both competitive and Hershey activity in the marketplace. For the 12 weeks ending July 9, 2016, CMG category growth was plus 1.2%. Hershey\u2019s U.S. CMG market share in the second quarter was 30.8%, off 0.7 points versus the same period last year. We believe the initiatives that we are executing against in the second half of the year and into 2017 will result in improved marketplace performance. Our number one priority is to restore Hershey\u2019s marketplace momentum within the very profitable U.S. market, where we have combined solid execution that leverages our scale with strong innovation and investment, our business is responding, more on this in a bit. Our response in go-to-market strategy to fast changing retail and consumer trends over the last year or so has not been sufficient to deliver consistent top line growth that we expect from our business. To overcome the current low growth environment that\u2019s impacting much of the center of the store, we\u2019re focusing on 3 important areas of our business model. That\u2019s innovation, our marketing mix modeling and our cost structure. Innovation is a big opportunity for us. Over the last 4 to 5 years, we had good confectionery success. Some products over-delivered versus our expectations and are still doing well today. And some of the new items from last year have under-delivered with lower volumes than we modeled. While innovation is hard work, our best innovation has been tied to consumer insights coming from our demand landscape work and leveraged across big brands and platforms and driven by our go-to-market capability. Combining this work under the leadership of Michele Buck as COO will add both focus and speed to the process. As consumers\u2019 relationship with food and shopping habits, have evolved we have tested different concepts of our marketing mix modeling. There continues to be a lot to learn with regard to efficiency and effectiveness as we balance our efforts across levers like direct trade, advertising, digital communications and consumer promotion. Technology will also play a role as we leverage predictive analytics and new tools that indicate the optimal ratio related to promotional spending and long-term brand-building initiatives. As I have said many times, we are a consumer-centric, brand-building company and we will invest in our brands and people. To do this and deliver on our financial commitments, we continue to examine our cost structure. We will deliver approximately $135 million in cost savings this year and at least $100 million per year from 2017 through 2019. Furthermore, we have intensified our focus on analysis of our global cost structure and business model to determine additional cost savings opportunities that we believe exist. While early, the initial work under way indicates that there are bigger opportunities to unlock these cost savings. Our overall goal in all of this is to create a streamlined structure that enables us to invest for growth and serve our retail customers and consumers in the most efficient and effective way possible while increasing our margins and profitability. Looking at some of our 2016 innovation and advertising successes, I am pleased with the early results related to the launch of Kit Kat Big Kat, Reese\u2019s Snack Mix and Hershey\u2019s Snack Bites as new products. Performance of our Reese\u2019s Snack Mix and Hershey\u2019s Snack Bites products has been strong and recent data indicates an acceleration behind TV activation. Additional gains are expected in the third quarter as canister merchandising constraints were lifted and we have more capacity that\u2019s come online to meet demand. The Kit Kat Big Kat is an example of an instant consumable-focused launch combined with new core branch advertising, which is driving growth of the entire franchise. Big Kat is the number one new item at some of our largest customers and in the C-store channel it\u2019s exceeding our expectations. And we are also excited about the Reese\u2019s Pieces Cup, which will only be available as an instant consumable item. Demand from retailers has been double our planning. Product began shipping earlier this month and is available in stores now. As it relates to the second half of the year, we believe we will see a sequential improvement in our marketplace results over the remainder of the year, driven by new advertising copy, innovation and higher levels of in-store merchandising and display, starting in July with the Summer Olympics in Rio. Our company, for the first time ever, is an official sponsor of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic teams. Packaging that proudly displays patriotic coloring such as red, white and blue lettering on our iconic Hershey\u2019s Milk Chocolate bar began in the second quarter. And our namesake brand, Hershey\u2019s, recently launched its first ever team USA named advertising campaign, Hello From Home, which is an extension of our Hello Happy Hershey mega brand campaign that we discussed last quarter. For this campaign, we have a trio of team USA athletes that includes gymnast Simone Biles; gold-medal wrestler, Jordan Burroughs; and 2012 U.S. Paralympic gold medalist, Mallory Weggemann. Reese\u2019s is also participating in the Olympics with a new ad campaign featuring Winter Olympics gold medalist, Lindsey Vaughn, trying out various summer sports. To do summer like a winter Olympian added a lighthearted humorous campaign that shows Miss Vaughn attempting event including archery, dressage, fencing and rhythmic gymnastics, with just a bit of humor and spoof. Some of the other Olympic related activity that we are excited about includes our Krave Meat Snack adding swimmer, Michael Phelps and soccer player, Carli Lloyd, to its promotional team. Sponsorship of the U.S. Women\u2019s National Field Hockey team in his bid to compete in Rio and to celebrate the success of team USA, we are providing fans with once-in-a-lifetime experience to congratulate the athletes upon their return from Rio during the special visit to the U.S. Olympic Training Center. This is a just a brief summary of some of the activity we have planned in North America that we believe will result in improved retail takeaway trends over the remainder of the year. Now for an update on our international business, where second quarter net sales growth was slightly better than planned and up about 14% versus last year. Excluding China, whose gains were driven by lower levels of direct trade and returns, discounts and allowances as well as the discontinued India oil business, constant currency net sales increased about 2%. I was particularly pleased with Mexico and Brazil, where combined constant currency second quarter net sales increased about 13%. And in both markets, year-to-date chocolate category growth is solid, up mid single-digits. In Mexico, our market share is off versus last year as we look to optimize product mix with a focus on global chocolate brands that will deliver sales, better profitability and market share growth over the long-term. In Brazil, market share was up slightly for the year driven by our focus on the Hershey mega brand and our differentiated portfolio that includes milk chocolate, Cookies \u2018n\u2019 Creme as a consumable and tablet bars and Hershey\u2019s Mais wafer products. Net sales in India declined versus a year ago product due to the discontinuance of the edible oil business. The media invested brands Jolly Rancher, SOFIT and Hershey\u2019s syrup, where we are focusing our efforts and investments, were up and continue to do well in the marketplace. In China, gross sales declined in line with our estimate. The summer months are typically the low season for chocolate consumption. China chocolate category performance in the second quarter sequentially improved versus the second half of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. In fact, the category was fractionally higher in June and we are cautiously optimistic that it gets better from here. We are executing against our plans to bring variety, news and excitement to the Hershey\u2019s Milk Chocolates, Hershey\u2019s Kisses and Golden Monkey and Munching Monkey candy and snacks brands as we expect will drive solid growth and net sales growth in the second half of the year. Over the long-term, we expect global economies and category trends to improve and that the investments in our international business will continue about and contribute 1 point of our overall long-term sales algorithm. Now to wrap up, we are a consumer centric, brand building company focused on innovation and growth in every category where we participate to satisfy the needs of our retail customers and consumers. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to analyze our cost structure as we look for additional margin enhancing opportunities that give us the flexibility to offset higher input costs and invest in our brand. We take a long-term focus and believe that investing in our business will benefit the company this year and well into the future. Now I will turn it over to Patricia, who will provide you with details on our financial results. Patricia Little : Thank you, J.P. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Second quarter net sales of $1.64 billion increased 3.7% versus last year, slightly greater than our estimate due to timing in the U.S. and better international performance. Adjusted earnings per share diluted came in at $0.85, an increase of about 9% versus last year, greater than our estimate due to the timing of investment tax credits, more on this in a bit, sales that were slightly great than forecast and lower advertising expense versus our previous estimate. Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 80 basis points, net sales increased 4.5%. Net price realization was relatively in line with our estimates and a 90 basis point benefit. Lower International and Other segment direct trade and returns, discounts and allowances, as we lap year ago challenges in China, more than offset higher North America direct trade supporting in-store merchandising and display and related promotional price points. Volume was a 3.1 point contribution in net sales growth driven by North American performance. Acquisitions were worth 50 basis points due primarily to barkTHINS. By segment, second quarter North America net sales increased 3.2%. Excluding the 30 basis point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates in Canada, North America net sales increased 3.5% versus the year ago period. Volume was a 4.5 point contribution to sales growth and slightly benefited from the timing of select merchandising program net sales that occurred in the second quarter that were expected to ship in the third quarter. Increased levels of direct trade supporting greater levels of in-store merchandising and display resulted in net price realization headwind of 1.6 points. Acquisitions were 60 basis point benefit. Total International and Other segment net sales for the second quarter increased 7.6% versus last year and were better than our estimate. Foreign currency exchange rates were unfavorable by 5.5 points. International and Other segment volume was off 7.2 points due primarily to lower sales in China and the discontinuance of the edible oil business in India. Net price realization was a 20.3 point benefit as direct trade and returns, discounts and allowances in China were meaningfully lower as we lap the year ago challenges. Turning now to margins, adjusted gross margin declined by 120 basis points in the second quarter as productivity and cost savings were offset by higher commodity costs, including a favorable purchase price variance versus standard in the year ago period, unfavorable sales mix and higher supply chain cost related to the startup of the Malaysia manufacturing facility. For the full year, we continue to expect the gross margin will be slightly down versus a year ago. We remain focused on our cost structure. The productivity initiatives we have discussed over the last year are on track and delivering the targeted savings. Our efforts here are yielding further opportunities, as evidenced by our full year savings of about $135 million, which is now more than our previous estimate. Adjusted operating profit in the second quarter increased 2.1%, resulting in adjusted operating profit margin of 18.1% versus 18.3%. The decline in adjusted operating profit margin was driven by our lower gross margins. Total advertising and related consumer marketing expense increased about 5%, less than our previous estimate as we continue to analyze the components of our marketing mix modeling to determine the right level of direct trade, TV advertising, digital marketing and consumer promotion. North America advertising and related consumer marketing expense was up meaningfully in the second quarter and is at healthy levels in the second half of the year to drive net sales and retail takeaway growth. SM&A, excluding advertising and the barkTHINS acquisition, declined 2.6%, while unallocated corporate expense was lower by $200,000 versus last year. Savings from the business productivity programs and the focus on efficiency and cost savings initiatives that we outlined last quarter drove the declines although this was partially offset by the timing of employee-related costs and unexpected corporate fees that were about a $0.02 headwind in the second quarter. Now, let me provide a brief update on our International and Other segment. I am pleased that our total international business delivered on their Q2 plans. Adding to J.P.\u2019s commentary on China, chocolate category performance in Q2 was in line with our forecast. We remain optimistic about the long-term outlook in China and for our brands. However, consumer spending still appears to be mixed. Therefore, our full year sales outlook in China is slightly lower than our previous estimate. Specifically, China gross sales are forecasted to decline in 2016. However, net sales are expected to increase 10% to 20% as we don\u2019t anticipate the same level of direct trade, returns, discounts and allowances as last year. Constant currency net sales growth of core brands in Mexico and Brazil increased nicely. Excluding China, International and Other segment operating profit increased about 5%. Moving down the P&L, second quarter interest expense of $21 million increased $2.4 million versus last year. For the full year, we continue to expect interest expense to be in the $90 million to $95 million range. The adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was 31.4%, relatively in line with our estimate and lower than the prior period \u2013 year ago period of 35.3%, largely as a result of investment tax credits. However, due to timing differences, the corresponding book expense for a portion of the credit investments, which is recorded in the other income and expense line, will not be recognized until the second half of the year. We estimate this was about a $0.03 benefit in Q2, but this is just timing. And for the full year, we expect to purchase about $50 million of investment tax credits, which should result in an adjusted tax rate that\u2019s slightly lower than 2015. In the second half of the year, we expect the tax rate to be about 32% and other income and expense of about $35 million related to the corresponding book expense for the purchase of tax credits. For the second quarter of 2016, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 214.5 million shares, down 5.1 million versus last year, resulting in adjusted earnings per share diluted of $0.85 or an increase of about 9.1% versus a year ago. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow, at the end of the second quarter, net trading capital increased versus last year\u2019s second quarter by $5 million. Accounts receivable was higher by $40 million and remains extremely current. Inventory was lower by $3 million and accounts payable increased by $32 million. Total capital additions, including software, were $62.7 million in the second quarter. For the full year, we expect CapEx to be in the $265 million to $275 million range, about $20 million less than our previous estimate. During the second quarter, depreciation and amortization was $97 million and dividends paid were $121 million. In the second quarter, the company repurchased $117 million of common shares against the $500 million share repurchase authorization approved in January 2016. There is $100 million remaining on this authorization. In addition, the company repurchased $32 million of common shares in the second quarter to replace shares issued in connection with the exercise of stock options. Cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $250 million, slightly lower than the year ago. As J.P. summarized, over the remainder of the year, we have a lot of innovation, variety, news and in-store merchandising and programming in the marketplace. And we continue to refine our marketing mix modeling to ensure we have the optimal level of direct trade, advertising and consumer promotion supporting our brands. Advertising and related consumer marketing expense is lower versus our previous estimate. We feel good about our marketing mix modeling investments in 2016 and believe we have the right balance of spend in second half of the year that will result in a sequential improvement in marketplace performance. The company estimates that full year 2016 net sales will increase around 1%, including a net benefit from acquisitions and divestitures of about 50 basis points and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates of 1 point. Constant currency net sales growth of around 2% is less than the previous estimate of about 2.5%, primarily due to our expectation of lower U.S. CMG category growth over the remainder of the year and macroeconomic challenges in China impacting purchasing behavior. The business productivity initiative announced last year in June and the incremental cost savings we discussed in April and today are on track. As a result, we continue to expect that adjusted earnings per share diluted will increase 3% to 4%, including dilution from acquisitions of $0.05 to $0.06 per share and be in the $4.24 to $4.28 range. Thank you for your time this morning. And I will now turn it over to Mark. Mark Pogharian : Thank you, Patricia. Before we get into the Q&A, I want to remind everyone that we are here to discuss our financial and operational results for the second quarter and our outlook going forward. We know there has been a lot of market chatter surrounding Mondelez\u2019s preliminary nonbinding indication of interest. As we stated on June 30, our Board of Directors unanimously rejected the indication of interest. We are not going to comment further on this matter. We appreciate you keeping your questions focused on our operations and our financial results. J.P., Patricia, Michele Buck and myself, are now ready to take any questions you may have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Thank you. We will take our first question from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please go ahead. Andrew Lazar : Good morning, everybody. J.P. Bilbrey: Good morning. Andrew Lazar : J.P., can you talk a little bit about just where inventory levels might be, just given I think you had received a benefit in shipment timing versus consumption both in the first quarter and then also in the second quarter as you have talked about? And then what\u2019s driving the expectation of incrementally lower CMG category growth at this point? I know you were more cautious coming into the quarter already. And I guess what are you seeing now that has you more concerned? J.P. Bilbrey: Yes, Andrew. Michele and I will take a whack at that. Michele, you want to talk first about the category? Michele Buck : Sure, absolutely. Andrew, as you know, as we look at the total box, both the total box and center of store were really soft as we got into the year and certainly in Q2 as well. We are encouraged that snack wheel continues to grow ahead of the total box and certainly that\u2019s really \u2013 the marketplace in which we compete is that broad snack wheel. So you really need to look at our \u2013 kind of look at year-to-date snack wheel performance as the opportunity for us. We know that the shorter Easter-impacted the category this year. That\u2019s really a \u2013 more of a one-time or every couple year impact. We have seen some more activity in some of the indulgent categories in the second quarter. And frankly, there was a little bit greater interaction with some of those categories than we had anticipated. And we do believe we have some opportunities to further optimize our marketing mix modeling, as J.P. discussed. But over the long-term, I guess as we look at the category, clearly over the past several years, the category has been running at about that 2.5% growth rate and we continue to believe that, that will be the outlook going forward. J.P. Bilbrey: Yes. Andrew, if you look at inventories, we align, obviously, with our customers on where inventory should be. There is nothing different about that. And if you look at the first half in terms of takeaway as well as net sales, I mean, it\u2019s largely in line. So, we don\u2019t think there is anything there that would be different than what we would expect or what we planned for. Andrew Lazar : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from David Driscoll with Citi. Please go ahead. David Driscoll : Great, thank you and good morning. J.P. Bilbrey: Good morning, David. David Driscoll : So, Mark, sorry, I got two things I wanted to ask. The second one is super short I promise. The big picture question, J.P., is given that you have a formal bid can you provide some commentary on the margin potential of the business? So, it\u2019s not a big question, but it does relate to these kinds of things. The question here is kind of what\u2019s the upside to operating margins over time? And this really aids investors at moments like this in understanding what do they actually own and how to frame any and all offers when you are kind of \u2013 investors are put into that situation? That\u2019s the big question. And then just a little one on the International segment, can you give us some thoughts on how profits flow going forward on International? Thank you. J.P. Bilbrey: So, I will take the first part of that and Patricia and I can talk about your short one, but Andrew [ph], we are just not going to speculate around things that we would have to do with hypotheticals there. So I mean over time, we can talk about how we continue to be margin focused. You have heard us talk about our focus against the cost of our operations coming up. We talked about the $135 million we want to deliver this year. So I would just come back and say, as you know, we are a margin focused company. We want to make sure that our opportunities and our costs are well aligned and we want to continue to be able to invest in our brands and our people as we go forward. But as it might relate to something hypothetical, I just can\u2019t comment on something like that. Patricia Little : On the international piece, first I really want to call out that, as I said at the beginning, a piece of our over-performance on EPS was driven by great results internationally. We are very focused especially on China right now as they continue to sequentially improve their business. They also have a lot of focus on making sure that we have the right cost structure aligned to the opportunities in that market and they are doing a lot of work on that. So we continue to expect improved results internationally over time. J.P. Bilbrey: Hey David, I am sorry that I said Andrew. They have told me here, so I apologize for that. Trust me I had your face in my mind perfectly. David Driscoll : Not a worry at all. Thanks so much for the thoughts. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. David Palmer : Thanks. Good morning. J.P. Bilbrey: Hi David. David Palmer : You released \u2013 you had mentioned marketing to authenticity and simplicity of ingredients, are consumers telling you that this is a friction point for your brands and for the category, are you solving that perception issue and do you intend to do a renovation of any of your products associated with this message? Patricia Little : So for certain consumers in the marketplace, certainty authenticity and simple ingredients is clearly something that they are looking for And so our approach is really to think about our \u2013 the holistic portfolio that we have and make sure that we have choices for everyone along the spectrum, so certainly barkTHINS, clean label, simple ingredients and that appeals to that consumer. And as I believe you are aware, we evolved our Hershey product, which was very close to simple ingredients, took it all the way there and we are actually going to begin advertising on that in the third quarter. So we believe that certain products of ours, certainly like a Jolly Rancher, are never going to be simple ingredients. So we will have a full portfolio that gives consumers meaningful other choices. David Palmer : And just a follow-up, is the Snackfection innovation that you are talking about for later in the year, is that an extension of the confectionery brand into healthier snacking and if so, do you feel like indulgent brands can move into better for you? Patricia Little : So I would say that it is \u2013 the innovation that\u2019s coming up is really what I would call Snackfection in terms of blurring \u2013 the blurring that\u2019s occurring between various snack categories. Think salty snacks and confection or other categories, cookies and confection, etcetera. So it\u2019s really leveraging the fact that consumers are looking for more of those complex eats and opportunities to play at the seams between categories. I think there \u2013 that largely our confection or hardcore mainstream confection brands will continue to offer primarily indulgent benefits. But there are some places where I think there is a little bit of crossover. For example, Snack Mix certainly has nuts, pretzels, etcetera and consumers are seeing that a little closer to having some food value than a straight chocolate. David Palmer : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Bryan Spillane : Hi, good morning everyone. I guess the question I mean just following-up on Andrew Lazar\u2019s question, Michele can you just tease out for us how much of the category weakness or the category being sort of softer than it had been historically is coming from immediate consumption versus at-home consumption, I mean I guess the idea being it just seems like there is a vast amount of choice as a consumer goes to the front end with a lot of products that are near or somewhat close to what your base products are, so just trying to get a sense for how much of the work you need to do is really in getting immediate consumption changed or is it really equal, both at-home and immediate consumption? Thanks. Michele Buck : Yes. I mean I don\u2019t think that we are seeing a strong skew to one type of consumption versus the other. So as we look at our instant consumable business, it\u2019s relatively flat. So a lot of that can be skewed by the support that goes behind the business relative to merchandising. And certainly, the clean floor policies have probably impacted the take-home side of the business a bit more. So we continue to focus on big scale events, focus on our core brands and core pack types, both in terms of take-home as well as instant consumables, but we aren\u2019t really seeing a dramatic trend one way or the other on that front. Bryan Spillane : Okay, thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Alexia Howard : Good morning everyone. Can I ask about the recent CVS announcement that they are going to be putting quite a lot more better-for-you snacking in the front area of the store, I think they talked about replacing about 25% of the area that was previously targeted at candy, I guess what \u2013 how do you react to an announcement like that, is there a risk that those kinds of moves might spread elsewhere in the industry? Thank you very much. Michele Buck : So first of all, we partner with our retail customers very closely, so announcements like that aren\u2019t surprises to us. They actually look to us to help them to optimize their total box and their total sales across snacking. If you look at that CVS example, that \u2013 you might be surprised to learn that, on that one, for example, we are netting out in a neutral position from an SKU perspective. So as we have broadened our portfolio to have offerings like barkTHINS, Krave meat bars, think about refreshment portfolio, those are actually allowing us to remain neutral on an SKU basis and really just offering consumers broader choice, both for across the CVS portfolio, but also the Hershey portfolio. So certainly, it\u2019s something that we are focused on. I wouldn\u2019t tell you that it\u2019s not something that we are \u2013 that we have an eye on. But we are really thinking about the fact that, that is out there and making sure that we have the right plans in place to continue to drive our confectionery and broader snacking portfolio. Alexia Howard : Thank you very much. I will pass it on. Operator : Our next question is from John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. John Baumgartner : Good morning. Thanks for the question. Maybe to ask the U.S. consumption question a different way, just going back to your consumer analytics around segmenting out into various buckets, the loyalists, occasionalists and so on, of the categories\u2019 deceleration, can you pinpoint where on that spectrum the pressure has really emerged, maybe as the first pass. And then as a follow-up, in terms of the course correction from here, how should we think about the need to maybe spend more back against the brands, either promo or advertising, given the substitute pressure coming into your \u2013 the snacking categories? Michele Buck : Yes. So I would say I mean relative to the marketing mix, as J.P. mentioned I think we are really still working through with evolving consumer choices and the evolving retailer landscape, just really optimizing that mix. So I would tell you that we continue to learn every quarter. We have gotten more sophisticated models in place to help us to better understand the interaction between all of that. But that\u2019s an area we will continue to work on and I think make some continuous improvement going forward. J.P. Bilbrey: So one thing that I would add to that is that as we have seen innovation across the snack wheel, so remember what we said earlier is the box is up about 1.8%. Snack wheel is actually running ahead of that. And then there is parts of the snack wheel that are obviously outperforming others. And what you could link that to in almost every instance is the quality of the innovation. So I would actually say that has been a more critical element in a more competitive and space constrained world that that\u2019s giving certain brands and categories an opportunity to be available and consumers are responding to that. But for me, the really good news is that the snack wheel continues to do well. We just have to make sure that we are working hard and winning our part of it. John Baumgartner : Okay, thank you. Operator : We will go next to Mario Contreras with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. J.P. Bilbrey: Good morning Mario. Mario Contreras : Good morning. So I wanted to ask, with respect to China, can you give us an update on how you stand with your current distributors, are you satisfied with the setup that you have, are they meeting expectations. And then beyond that, given the recent Mondelez announcement about their entry into that market, do you anticipate any changes to your strategy or to overall category dynamics in the upcoming quarters? J.P. Bilbrey: Well, first of all, in terms of any entrants into the category, the China market is still a young market relative to consumption per capita. So really, as long as we are all working hard on category development, that\u2019s probably a good thing. So frankly, that\u2019s how we think about it. In terms of our acquisition and integration work there, I would tell you that we are making really good progress against the integration. Some of that work is still continuing obviously, but we have really gone through and done the sales organization work and combined those. That\u2019s gone well. We have taken what was the Hershey piece and the Golden Monkey piece and really tried to consolidate those distributors. So, it\u2019s a bit blended from where we started with Golden Monkey and Hershey, but we really feel as though our go-to-market position is in the best shape that it\u2019s been. We are selling things. So, as I like to think about it kind of in a simple way, are we making stuff, shipping it, selling it and collecting money? And all of those things are working for us. So, I think that the market in China, as you have heard from a lot of companies, is pressured. I think we would align with that. The consumer obviously has to show up, but we feel good about where we are at. And we will continue though I would say to as I have said before, make sure we are rightsizing all of our businesses to the opportunities. And certainly, we will continue to focus against that. And then as you think about the overall P&L, the impact of China restructure on our P&L this year is really relatively limited. So, we think that will continue to also help us as we go forward. Mario Contreras : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Jonathan Feeney from Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead. Jonathan Feeney : Thanks very much. J.P., I wanted to circle back for a second on your answer to Andrew Lazar\u2019s question on inventory, even though I am picturing David Driscoll in my mind. The \u2013 like you, I just \u2013 like you, J.P., I just can\u2019t stop picturing him, but the \u2013 what kind of \u2013 when we look at like both the category and your takeaway, what sort of consumer takeaway in North America for the third quarter, fourth quarter, maybe into next year, do you have in mind when you think about the kind of \u2013 this kind of shipment growth going in? I am just trying to get \u2013 and what does that mean for kind of market share and what would be sort of good success metrics for you going forward for the next 6, 12 months there? J.P. Bilbrey: Yes. If you think about the second half of the year and first of all, the inventory perspective I gave you, I am not sure I can add a lot to that. That\u2019s certainly how it is. If you think about the second half of the year, with Halloween and seasons, we have very good visibility to that. We know what that\u2019s going to look like. Same thing would be with holiday. And then also remember, as we have talked about a significant innovation in Q4, we benefit from the volume of that as we begin to build distribution and of course, the merchandising activity is after that. So, as we move through the year, you have the benefit of that volume that won\u2019t necessarily be a piece of the takeaway, so you might have a bit of a disconnect there in the second half. It shouldn\u2019t be significant. But as we have talked about our expectations in terms of the balance of the year, it does take into consideration the first half of the year and where we have seen the category growth be and that\u2019s probably where you also have seen some of the moderation on the outlook and expectation there. I don\u2019t know if anyone else wants to add something to that. Michele Buck : Yes. I mean, I would just say we expect to continue to see kind of a slow sequential build in takeaway as we move further into the year. Mark Pogharian : Yes. I think the fourth quarter will be better than the third obviously just because of our strength in seasons. And then to J.P.\u2019s point, net sales, intuitively, should be a little bit better than takeaway because of the big launch that we have late in the year that we are getting to later. Jonathan Feeney : Great. Well, thanks very much everybody. J.P. Bilbrey: You bet. Thank you. Operator : We will go next to Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Matthew Grainger : Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for the questions. J.P. and Michele, you talked about the pipeline of innovation that you have coming up in chocolate and snacking in the second half. And when we look at the CMG trends at a subcategory level, we are actually seeing some of the strongest growth in non-chocolate and your own sales there have been dramatically weaker. And I know you have been in a position of needing to be selective about where you are focusing your investments. But can you just speak to your approach toward how you are thinking about non-chocolate at the moment? Any concerns that you are starving that side of the business and losing too much market share in the short-term? Thanks. Michele Buck : Yes. So, I would say yes to that question. As we made prioritization choices across the portfolio, we made a decision to pull back a bit in non-chocolate and I think we are reevaluating that choice certainly as we speak. I think we pulled back at a time that some others in the marketplace actually accelerated. So as we look to next year, we are certainly adjusting our approach. We think that variety and news are absolutely key and that\u2019s really where our focus will be to dial up efforts in combination with the strong innovation that we feel really good about on chocolate, around things like core news, like Big Kat, Reese\u2019s Pieces Cup and then big sustainable scale innovation on chocolate, like the big one that we have coming towards the end of the year. But you will see us dial up the focus on non-chocolate next year. Matthew Grainger : Okay. And just I am not sure if it\u2019s possible to talk more about timing there. I mean, how quickly can you replenish the innovation pipeline? Is that something that takes a few quarters or is it possible that it might \u2013 given where your efforts have been that it might take longer? Michele Buck : Yes. On non-chocolate, I would tell you I wouldn\u2019t expect to see activity this year. It will be into next year. I would rather not go into the specific timing just for competitive reasons, but definitely it would be a couple of quarters. We have a pipeline in place and so it\u2019s really a matter of dialing that up and getting it into the marketplace. Matthew Grainger : Okay, understood. Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. J.P. Bilbrey: Good morning, Jason. Jason English : Hey, good morning, J.P. Thank you guys for the question. So, a couple of questions. Let me start one sort of higher level. A lot of talk on the call and I have clearly seen the data of sort of shifting growth within \u2013 I think you called it a snacking wheel. I guess I have a question on pricing within confection. Is there any concern that price gaps between alternative snacking solutions may be an issue? And any implications in terms of pricing power going forward as we certainly see a number of your key inputs, moving higher recently? J.P. Bilbrey: Yes. So, let me talk about the pricing piece a little bit and then we can touch again on sort of the snack wheel stuff. But I think what we have seen is that if you recall on the last call we talked about the number of new entrants that\u2019s happened, especially in snack bars relative to the whole snacking space. And some of those entrants, I think have gotten trial not only because they are new, but I think there has also been a different pricing delta that the obstacle to trial has been lowered. And so I think the level of activity probably speaks more to what the net value to the consumer could have been across all of the different options and opportunities available to them. So I think going forward, while we are looking a lot at our whole revenue management approach and making sure that we really got that right, we\u2019re thinking a lot about this particular question. And I do think there\u2019s some influence there as there\u2019s been trial in the category. And I would just come back to my other comment around innovation, is it\u2019s is very clear that those brands and companies who have done well in innovation have gotten a disproportionate share of the consumers\u2019 attention. And those \u2013 that\u2019s the real quality driver, in my mind. So if you come back to what I said earlier, we are really, really focused against three things in our business model. And it\u2019s the innovation. We are really looking at our marketing mix model, because based on the previous question, you are right, allocation and resources across different pieces of the business I think there are some things we learned there. And then of course we want to run a frugal business and invest in our brands and our people. And those are the three things I think you should take away from what we are really talking about today. Jason English : That\u2019s helpful. One more then I will pass it on. On the innovation front, it\u2019s been a long time since we have seen a successful new candy bar launch sustain the market, so can you talk a little about what\u2019s differentiated about this Cookie Layer Crunch product that leads you to believe that it can really be a sustainable success? J.P. Bilbrey: Yes. Listen, why don\u2019t I ask Michele to talk about that, but I think if you go back to how she talked about it within the seams of a pure confection and as you might think about other snacking opportunities, that that\u2019s what we think is really unique about how this is positioned. We would like to see it source volume from maybe some new places that stretches us a bit from just the core, but I will let Michele speak to that. Michele Buck : Yes. So our most successful innovations are clearly grounded in deep consumer insights, and we have certainly gone \u2013 leveraged a lot of insights and research as we have developed this proposition and feel quite good about it. As J.P. said, it really does play between those themes in Snackfection of marrying cookie and chocolate obviously. And also it really plays on some deep insights around palate. If you think about the kind of the creamy crunchy palate, sweet and salty we see in the marketplace has demonstrated a lot of growth. And we are seeing with younger consumers in particular, there is strong interest in complex eats that this really delivers upon that will provide incremental usage versus our portfolio, which tends to be more of a \u2013 kind of a straight, creamy palate. So if you think about the textural experiences consumers are looking for and the new users that we are able to bring in, we are feeling really good about it. Jason English : I look forward to trying it. Thank you very much. Operator : Next, we will go to Chris Growe with Stifel. Please go ahead. J.P. Bilbrey: Good morning. Chris Growe : Hi, good morning. I just had two questions if I could or just really follow-ups. I guess I want to be clear, back to an earlier question, if you quantify the effect on U.S. sales in the second quarter and like what could come out of the third quarter as you pull forward those sales. And maybe if I could add just a follow-up question to an earlier question, as you think about all these cost savings, is there a level of marketing you are trying to achieve or how should we frame at least the potential to reinvest some of these savings back into the business? Thank you. Patricia Little : Yes. So let me start by \u2013 we are not going to quantify the sales impact, but I think you might be thinking it might be larger than - by the nature of your question, it sounds like you might be thinking it\u2019s a little larger than it is. On the cost savings piece, we really want to look at all the levers of our costs. I think we have done a historically good job of looking at our COG savings. We continue to focus on that and that will actually be the biggest driver. We need to extend that into other areas, including our SM&A that excludes our marketing part of our business. And then on marketing, it\u2019s going to be a combination of continuing to want to invest as a brand building company, but doing that in an ever smarter way and making sure that every one of those dollars works for us. The world is changing pretty quickly and we are just going to need to continuously reevaluate the roles of each of our \u2013 each lever that we have in marketing. Chris Growe : Okay. And then just Patricia, one quick follow-up then, I think in the U.S., you had 3.5% growth and I look at your takeaway in the quarter, it\u2019s around 0.5%, so I am trying to put those numbers together, am I looking at it the wrong way or...? Patricia Little : Yes. I think it\u2019s \u2013 because of timing of some of the things, it\u2019s probably easier to look at it on a year-to-date basis. And when you look at it on a year-to-date basis, there is actually virtually no gap between our \u2013 there is a very small gap between our takeaway and our sales. Chris Growe : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We will go next to Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Moskow : Hi. Thank you. What can we expect to hear from you folks on your Analyst Day coming up, assuming you are still going to have it, do you think you will give us a little more clarity on the cost structure reductions that you are planning and maybe even some more details on all this marketing mix modeling and I think people are going to care Michele, if this is a message that advertising and promotion or really just advertising kind of comes down a little bit, I think we all remember 2005 and 2006 when it went down too far, so will you give us more clarity in that regard also? Mark Pogharian : Hey Rob, I mean it\u2019s Mark and I will let Michele and J.P. talk to those \u2013 to the business \u2013 some of the business drivers and investments that you referenced. As it relates to the Analyst Day, you are right there hasn\u2019t been a date put out there. I mean there is obviously a lot of moving parts. And you know that we are absolutely focused on the business and doing all the right things for the near and long-term, as we continued to do. But as soon as we have a date, we will communicate it. J.P. Bilbrey: Yes. I would just very quickly talk about on the cost side, we have talked about very clearly what we expect in 2016. It\u2019s a bit early to get into some of the specifics of the additional work that we are doing, but we are \u2013 we have a process in place and we are looking at all the costs and opportunities we have literally across the entire business, line by line. And we want to ultimately make sure that we can make up the investments in our brands, aligned with the opportunities that are in front of us. I think you will continue to hear us be very consumer and brand focused and yet at the same time, we will always be very margin focused. But we have to be able to afford those investments. But as we think it\u2019s appropriate to build brands, I think you would see us want to be able to invest at within the kinds of ratios that we have talked about in the past. And as I always say to the team here, volume is the magic elixir. It\u2019s a great category and we get really good returns on the investments we make versus our brands. But clearly, we have got to be driving volume to make that story look optimal. Michele Buck : I would say our focus is really optimization. How do we optimize and continue to be consumer centric and brand building, so not really a big change in that piece of the business model. Robert Moskow : Okay. Thank you. J.P. Bilbrey: Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : And we can take that question from Erin Lash with Morningstar. Please go ahead, Erin. J.P. Bilbrey: Good morning Erin. Erin Lash : Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to follow-up. There has been a lot of discussion about innovation on the call and obviously, you have expressed a commitment to bringing new products to market to drive category growth. But I was wondering if you could speak to the pace of innovation in terms of the timing and the ability to get an idea or a product from development to shelf, it sounds like some of your competitors and some of the more, I guess smaller niche operators have been bringing new products to market in a quicker fashion and I wonder the extent to which you have thought about, is your pace of innovation timely enough to respond to consumer trends? Thank you. J.P. Bilbrey: Sure, thank you for the question. I think it\u2019s more about the productivity of innovation than it is the pace of innovation. And so when you look at things like hand-to-mouth that we were very successful with and it continues to be productive for us, it\u2019s what I always call sticky innovation. It\u2019s innovation that lasts. It\u2019s many times a platform and it allows you then to expand even across brands because you have identified a need state that\u2019s really important. If you look at how we classify innovation, actually our numbers versus our innovation targets are actually pretty good this year. I mean it\u2019s not that they are wildly different, but what you have to really achieve is that stickiness and then the thing that it gets you to the platform innovation. So we have a really good pipeline of things in front of us. And so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about all of a sudden having to start focusing against innovation. It\u2019s really making sure that we are bringing the right innovation to the market with the right investment and productivity. So that\u2019s really how I think about it. And Michele may have something she wants to add, but that\u2019s how I think about your question. Michele Buck : No, I agree. I think it\u2019s about quality and sustainability, just making sure that we have \u2013 we stick true to our model on that front. Erin Lash : Thank you very much. J.P. Bilbrey: Thank you very much for your questions today. Investor Relations group will be around for any follow-up questions you may have. Operator : And this will conclude today\u2019s program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

Bilbrey - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Patricia Little - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Michele Buck - Chief Operating Officer Analysts : Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research Ken Goldman - JPMorgan Rob Moskow - Credit Suisse David Driscoll - Citi Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Jason English - Goldman Sachs Andrew Lazar - Barclays Alexia Howard - Bernstein David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets John Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Steve Strycula - UBS Operator : Good morning, everyone and welcome to The Hershey Company\u2019s Third Quarter 2016 Results Conference Call. My name is Roxanna and I will be your conference operator today. [Operator Instructions] This call is scheduled to end at about 9 :30 a.m. So, please limit yourself to one question till we can get to as many of you as possible. Please note this call maybe recorded. Thank you. Mr. Mark Pogharian, you may begin your conference. Mark Pogharian : Thank you, Roxanna. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to The Hershey Company\u2019s third quarter 2016 conference call. J.P. Bilbrey, Chairman, President and CEO and Patricia Little, Senior Vice President and CFO will provide you with an overview of results, which will then be followed by a Q&A session. Let me remind everyone listening that today\u2019s conference call may contain statements which are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning\u2019s press release and in our 10-K for 2015 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the Note section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items provide additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. As a result, we will discuss third quarter results, excluding net pre-tax charges of $72.4 million or $0.23 per share diluted, which are primarily related to derivative mark-to-market losses and business realignment charges. These charges are defined in the appendix of this morning\u2019s earnings release, which is available on our website at www.thehersheycompany.com. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges. And with that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey. J.P. Bilbrey: Thanks, Mark and good morning to everyone on the phone and webcast. Before we discuss the details of our third quarter results, I\u2019d like to add some context to the press release we issued on October 14. It\u2019s been an honor and a privilege to be the 11th CEO of The Hershey Company. I\u2019m proud of all that we\u2019ve accomplished as a team over the last 5 to 6 years and plan to be fully engaged on a day-to-day basis as CEO over the next 8 months or so as we drive the business forward and regain momentum. I will also continue to work closely with my management team as we review our global go-to-market approach that we discussed in July. We are making progress and expect to discuss these value-creation strategies with you in early 2017. Importantly, we believe that The Hershey Company will continue to be successful in the marketplace. We have a solid framework in place related to customer capabilities and consumer insights, especially in the North American segment that should enable us to execute against the demand landscape work that we\u2019ve been updating. This is in conjunction with the progress that we\u2019ve made in our R&D pipeline and faster innovation cycle in our core CMG business and snackfection initiatives. As part of our overall commitment to research and development, we are very pleased to announce our participation in the new University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Pennovation Center, whose grand opening is today. The Pennovation Center is a bridge that brings together corporations with the need, curious educators and student scientists in the university\u2019s new hub for innovation that will focus on research, development and entrepreneurialism. Let me add some perspective to our international operations. We have experienced macroeconomic challenges and slowdown in some of our key development markets. With this said, under the right conditions, we know our brands can be successful, as evidenced by the market share gain that we\u2019ve attained, where we focused on our core brand-building efforts. However, given an uncertain outlook in these markets over the near term, we will continue to assess our investment mix across the enterprise to align with both our long-term strategic intent and best growth and margin-enhancing activities. We believe that it\u2019s appropriate to continuously assess market opportunities and evolve the best approach to meet our growth and profit focus. We simply see this as part of our ongoing operating philosophy. We plan to share further details with you at our investor event early in the year. For now, I can tell you that we are striving for an organization that\u2019s more agile, flexible and focused on the consumer, brand-building and cost efficiency across our entire business. This will drive improved gross margin and EBIT margin. Our commitment to growth and cost control will enable us to continue to deliver strong cash flow growth and generate value for all shareholders. As it relates to 2017, it\u2019s a bit early to discuss specifics, but we think there is a setup to deliver top quartile performance versus the peer group. A longer Easter season and planned innovation driven by Hershey\u2019s Cookie Layer Crunch and barkTHINS\u2019 acceleration should benefit top line growth. We have visibility into our cost structure and $100 million in productivity savings that we discussed earlier in the year that should lead to EBIT margin expansion in 2017. Third quarter sales, marketplace performance and operating income were relatively in line with expectations. Earnings per share exceeded our forecasts, driven by a lower tax rate, and Patricia will have more on this in a bit. As we anticipated, U.S. marketplace performance sequentially improved versus last quarter and was within our targeted range. Total Hershey U.S. retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ended October 8, 2016, within the xAOC+C channels increased 0.6%, with market share the same as the year-ago period. This represents all Hershey manufactured products sold at retail, such as candy, mint, gum, salty snacks, Krave, chocolate syrup and snack bars. Importantly, trends in our chocolate business improved due to a shorter Easter and the timing of innovation, chocolate retail takeaway was off about 0.5% in the first half of the year and was up 0.6% in the third quarter, resulting in a market share gain of 0.5 points. We expect that the fourth quarter total Hershey and CMG performance will continue to sequentially improve. Our brands responded positively to the investments we discussed last quarter. Specifically, marketplace results in the quarter were driven by our performance in August as in-store merchandising and display activity and on-air advertising GRPs were solid, supporting U.S. Olympics programming and the launch of Reese\u2019s Pieces Cups. Our marketing mix for these programs was balanced between direct trade in both TV and digital advertising. You will see more of this next year as we look to optimize our marketing mix model. Innovation in targeted 360 degree programs, where we got our marketing mix right, has worked for us so far in 2016. Variety and news on the Reese\u2019s franchise, driven by our NCAA relationship, which has been extended to the fall football season, and the launch of Reese\u2019s Pieces Cup, has resulted in the Reese\u2019s brands retail takeaway of close to 8% in the third quarter. End results were similar for the Kit Kat franchise, given the success of the Big Kat new product launch. And Hershey\u2019s Kisses, up 7.2% in the recent 12-week period, is also quietly having a good year, driven by birthday-themed packaging and programming. We are getting incremental quality merchandising in other parts of the store, where wrapping paper and birthday cards can be found leveraging the emotional connectivity the brand has with consumers. And our Reese\u2019s Snack Mix and Hershey\u2019s Snack Bites continue to do well and give us confidence that our close-in snack strategy will gain traction over time. The same successful principles will be applied to Hershey\u2019s chocolate, where current brand performance isn\u2019t where we really want it to be. We believe the launch and related support of Hershey\u2019s Cookie Layer Crunch will reenergize and make the brand fresh. Consumer demand for multi-textural eating experiences across varying snacking occasions is increasing and this product fills whitespace opportunity and should partially source volume from the cookie category. We are leveraging our iconic Hershey chocolate bar and pairing it with layers of cookie \u2013 crunchy cookie bits and decadent fillings to offer an indulgent textured snacking experience, easy for me to say. This is one of the most anticipated innovations from the iconic Hershey\u2019s brand in many years. Based on pre-launch testing, Hershey\u2019s Cookie Layer Crunch earned some of the highest consumer scores of any product ever launched by the company and will come in three flavors : caramel, vanilla cream and mint. Each piece is perfectly portion controlled at 90 to 100 calories and will be available at select retailers starting in December. So, we are making progress, but there is still a lot of work to do as we enter the fourth quarter and look to 2017, where our priority is to restore Hershey\u2019s marketplace momentum with the very profitable U.S. market. We believe these initiatives and ones that we have yet to disclose will result in improved and consistent marketplace performance over this strategic planning cycle. As such, we believe the candy, mint and gum is an attractive category capable of solid growth over the long term when supported with the right mix of customer and consumer marketing. Net sales in India declined versus the year ago period due to the discontinuance of the edible oil business. The media-invested brands, Jolly Rancher, SoFit and Hershey\u2019s Syrup and Spreads, where we are focusing our efforts and investments, increased about 20%. In China, the modern trade hypermarket environment continues to be challenging across many categories. Our gross sales in China declined in line with our estimate, with net sales up about 15% on a constant currency basis. Chocolate category performance in the third quarter was sluggish and down about 4%. Our marketplace performance was in line with our expectation, with market share off about 1 point. We\u2019re executing against our plan and over the remainder of the year, have a balanced consumer proposition of variety, news and marketing across the Hershey\u2019s Milk Chocolate, Hershey\u2019s Kisses and Golden Monkey candy and snack brands. Our China e-commerce business has been relatively consistent and continues to post solid results, albeit off a smaller base. We estimate that our e-commerce business has about a 10 share of the market in China and look to build on that over the remainder of the year, driven by Singles Day in November. Now, to wrap up, despite the macroeconomic challenges facing the consumer, the broader snacks category, including indulgent snacks, continues to grow across retail channels. We are committed to our marketing mix modeling, trade, TV advertising and digital media as well as investments related to innovation, consumer marketing and insights that we believe will enable Hershey to deliver consistent and predictable top and bottom line growth. As I stated earlier, we feel good about our preliminary 2017 plans that are still taking shape. We\u2019re a growth and EBIT margin-focused company with a goal of increasing margins on an annual basis via both cost control and importantly, top line growth. Hershey has many opportunities to leverage its global brands in U.S. scale. We are optimistic about our future and focused on what we need to do to succeed. Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong, and our executive management team and the Board of Directors are confident that we\u2019ll continue to build value for all Hershey\u2019s shareholders. Now, I will turn it over to Patricia who will provide you with details on our financial results. Patricia Little : Thank you, J.P. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Third quarter net sales of $2 billion increased 2.2%, in line with our forecast. Adjusted earnings per share diluted came in at $1.29, an increased of about 10% versus last year, greater than our estimate due to shift of advertising and related consumer marketing expense to the fourth quarter and the 280 basis point decline in the adjusted tax rate that was greater than anticipated, more on both of these in a bit. Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 20 basis points, net sales increased 2.4%. As expected, net price realization was relatively in line with our estimates and a 70 basis point benefit primarily due to lower international and other segment direct trade and returns, discounts and allowances as we lap the year ago challenges in China. Volume was a 1 point contribution to net sales growth, driven by our performance in the U.S. Acquisitions were a 70 basis point benefit due to barkTHINS, which we acquired in the second quarter. By segment, third quarter North America net sales increased 1.8%. Volume was a 1.1 point benefit and driven by the U.S. business, where volume was up 1.7 points. Canada net sales and volume were off as planned as solid new product performance was more than offset by select SKU rationalization. Acquisitions were an 80 point \u2013 80 basis point benefit and net price realization, a 10 basis point headwind. Total international and other segment net sales for the third quarter increased 5.3% versus last year. Foreign currency exchange rates were unfavorable by 2.2 points. International and other segment volume was up 10 basis points, as solid Latin America and select export market performance was partially offset by lower sales in China, the discontinuance of the edible oil business in India and a little softness in the global retail and licensing business. Net price realization was a 7.4 point benefit as direct trade and returns, discounts and allowances in China were lower. Turning now to margins, adjusted gross margin declined by 40 basis points in the third quarter as productivity and cost savings were offset by unfavorable sales mix from excess packaging and higher supply chain costs, driven by initial year absorption of overhead related to the Malaysia manufacturing facility. For the full year, we continue to expect that gross margin will be slightly down versus a year ago. As J.P. mentioned, we remain focused on our cost structure. The productivity initiatives we have discussed this year are on track and we plan to deliver approximately $135 million in cost savings this year and at least $100 million per year from 2017 through 2019. Adjusted operating profit in the third quarter increased 7.6%, resulting in adjusted operating profit margin of 22.3% versus 21.2% last year. The increase in adjusted operating profit was driven by an increase in gross profit and lower marketing expense. As expected, total advertising and related consumer marketing expense declined about 9.6% in the third quarter. This is partially due to timing. Recall, advertising and related consumer marketing expense increased about 5% in the second quarter and we expect that it will increase in the fourth quarter as well. North America and international and other segment, SM&A, excluding advertising in the barkTHINS acquisition, declined 5.5%, driven by savings from the previously discussed business productivity programs. Unallocated corporate expense increased 3.5% or $4 million as efficiency and cost savings initiatives were offset by higher employee-related costs, an increase in corporate depreciation and amortization and JV minority interest expense. Now, let me provide a brief update on our international and other segment. I am pleased that our total international business delivered on their Q3 plans. As J.P. stated, we are executing against our plans in the key markets of China, Mexico, Brazil and India. Adding to his commentary on China, chocolate category performance in brick-and-mortar continues to be choppy. Consumer spending still appears to be mixed within the modern trade box. China gross sales are forecasted to decline in 2016. However, net sales are expected to increase as we don\u2019t anticipate the same level of direct trade, returns, discounts and allowances as last year. Constant currency net sales in Mexico and Brazil increased nicely. International and other segment operating profit increased meaningfully and I am pleased with the progression. As J.P. said, we are committed to profitability in this segment. Moving down the P&L, interest expense of $24.4 million increased $5.7 million versus last year. For the full year, we continue to expect interest expense to be in the $90 million to $95 million range. The adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 30.7%, lower than our estimate as R&D tax credits were greater than anticipated. As expected, the other income and expense line item includes the book expense related to corresponding tax credits that we mentioned last quarter. For the full year, we expect the tax rate to be about 100 basis points lower than last year. For the third quarter of 2016, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 215.2 million shares, down 4.9 million versus last year resulting in adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.29 or an increase of about 10.3% versus a year ago. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow, at the end of the third quarter, net trading capital increased versus last year\u2019s third quarter by $20 million. Accounts receivable was lower by $1 million and remains extremely current. Inventory was higher by $30 million and accounts payable increased by $9 million. Total capital additions, including software, were $64.1 million in the third quarter. For the full year, we expect CapEx to be at the low end of our $265 million to $275 million range. During the third quarter, adjusted depreciation and amortization was $61.5 million and dividends paid were $128.6 million. In the third quarter, the company did not repurchase any common shares against the $500 million share repurchase authorization approved in January 2016. There is $100 million remaining on this authorization. In addition, the company did not repurchase any common shares in the third quarter to replace shares issued in connection with the exercise of stock options. Cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $333 million slightly lower than a year ago. As J.P. summarized, over the remainder of the year and into 2017, we have a lot of innovation, variety and seasonal merchandising and programming in the marketplace. We have good visibility in the holiday orders and demand related to the upcoming launch of Hershey\u2019s Cookie Layer Crunch. We feel good about our marketing mix modeling investments and believe that we have the right balance of spend over the remainder of the year as total trade and advertising is higher in the fourth quarter versus last year. We believe these investments should result in a continued sequential improvement in U.S. retail takeaway. For the full year 2016, net sales will increase around 1%, including a net benefit from acquisitions and divestitures of about 50 basis points and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates of 75 basis points. We continue to expect that gross margin will be slightly below last year due primarily to unfavorable sales mix. Business productivity and cost savings programs are on track with our targets. And as we discussed earlier, the tax rate is expected to be slightly favorable versus our previous expectations. As a result, the company expects adjusted earnings per share diluted for 2016 to increase 4% to 5%, including barkTHINS\u2019 dilution of $0.5 to $0.06 per share and be in the $4.28 to $4.32 range versus the previous estimate of $4.24 to $4.28. Thank you for your time this morning and we will now take any questions that you have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead. Jonathan Feeney : Thanks very much. J.P. Bilbrey: Good morning, Jonathan. Jonathan Feeney : I wanted to ask a little bit about the Q4 and maybe some thoughts going forward. Obviously, I mean, you mentioned a little bit in the script there are some timing issues with the reductions to SG&A. So, I\u2019d first like you to maybe parse how much of that is kind of reduction in advertising versus maybe structural SG&A that\u2019s just going to be lower? And when you think about Q4 and 2017, are there things going on? Can you give us a sense of like what your \u2013 what\u2019s the right level of relative advertising for the business right now, because obviously, you spend well ahead of your peers? You have a launch going on. But on the flipside, a lot of people are maybe looking more critical with the kind of investments that they are making and there is other ways to push it and promote right now. Thank you. J.P. Bilbrey: Yes. Sure, Jonathan. Thanks. What I am going to do is ask Patricia and Michele Buck, who, as you know, is our Chief Operating Officer, is also with us. So, I will ask the two of them to talk about the fourth quarter, because I think that will be something that comes up for several of you. Thanks. Patricia Little : Thanks. Let me start off by talking first about SG&A, excluding advertising and related marketing. You could see that it was down and has been down since we have gone through the year both on a divisional level and on a year-to-date level in corporate. When \u2013 we did have a little bit of an uptick compared to prior year in the third quarter. That really had more to do with some timing issues that we had last year\u2019s third quarter than any change in our fundamental run-rate. And I expect to see this focus on cost in our SG&A, excluding marketing and related advertising expense to continue. In terms of the advertising and related marketing expense, we \u2013 as I said in my remarks, we have been running above in the second quarter. We dipped below a little bit in the third quarter, but we expect to have that backup again in the fourth quarter. And that, combined with added investments in trade promotion, we believe will continue to drive momentum in the marketplace. And I will turn it over to Michele to talk a little bit more about that. Michele Buck : Yes. So, I would say we continue to believe in investing with the consumer and focusing on getting that right balance between advertising and trade that lets us really deliver in the marketplace. If you think about Q4 overall, we have very good visibility into our holiday orders as those are already sold into customers. We will be shipping Hershey\u2019s Cookie Layer Crunch and that will be a bigger benefit to net sales than it will be takeaway. You will see more of the takeaway towards the end of the quarter and into 2017 and you can think about that as being roughly 1 to 2 points growth for us in Q4. And then lastly, the balance of our growth will really come from overall takeaway across our international and U.S. business. And we believe that we will continue to see some sequential improvement in Q4 behind the investments that we are making. Jonathan Feeney : Thank you very much. Operator : And we will take our next question from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Ken Goldman : Hi, good morning everyone. J.P. Bilbrey: Hi, Ken. Ken Goldman : J.P., I know it\u2019s early. I know you are not ready to give an exact number yet. But just in terms of you talked about some potential margin growth coming from some of the unique activities you maybe undertaking in the next year or two, people are speculating anywhere from 50 basis points to 400 or 500 basis points. Is there any help you can give us just sort of bracketing what the opportunity might be? I am sure you are not going to go full 3G on us, but any thoughts about the opportunity and how we should think about that would helpful at this point? J.P. Bilbrey: Yes. I think there is a couple of things, Ken, that I would say is that you are going to continue to see us talk about the importance of being both growth and EBIT margin-focused. And so we have got to have the right balance there. We continue to be optimistic about the category. And the things that we have talked about so far, I think we have been transparent about, but what you will really hear more with greater specificity is when we get together on March 1 at our meeting. So, a lot of this work is still in process, I would say. But the way we think about it, Ken, is we really have more of a business model philosophy around how we want to have that right balance. But we also believe that if you noticed in my remarks, I have talked about getting the right mix of growth opportunities and where we invest. And I think it\u2019s just basic that we always have to revisit some of those. And given some of the macroeconomic challenges, I think you will see us try to get those right going forward. And then again the greater specificity will come in March. So, if you work with us on that, I appreciate it. Ken Goldman : No, I appreciate that. Mark, if you don\u2019t mind, if I can ask a quick second question. Mark Pogharian : Sure, go ahead. Ken Goldman : J.P., I think you mentioned that you are looking for both top quartile performance in 2017 as just sort of an early outlook into next year. One, I wanted to make sure that, that was EPS that you were talking about just in case I missed it. And two, what are you looking at when you are looking at performance? Are you basing that versus 2016? What are you thinking about performance? What will that be on average? Just trying to get a sense of \u2013 I guess it\u2019s my job, this entire call, trying to get numbers out of you, but trying to figure out what those numbers might be a little more specifically? J.P. Bilbrey: Yes. So I think you have to think about that as both from a growth standpoint and then also from an EBIT margin standpoint that will be a significant focus for us going forward. Ken Goldman : Alright, thank you. J.P. Bilbrey: You bet. Thanks, Ken. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Rob Moskow : Thank you. As a follow-up I think to Ken\u2019s question, you will probably get questions about the sustainability of your gross margin, which is at \u2013 still at a \u2013 close to a peak. And I guess I can see a lot of room for SG&A kind of efficiencies, but I\u2019m still curious as to what you think gross margin can do and if there\u2019s expansion from here given that you are expanding into snacks, which I believe are lower margin. And I think commodities were probably about as low as they can go. They probably can\u2019t get much lower. So \u2013 but what are you looking at in that regard? Patricia Little : Hi, Rob. It\u2019s Patricia. Let me take a crack at that. I think you have laid out some of the parts to our gross margin that we are very focused on. I agree with you that the snacks and some of the international margin \u2013 gross margins are lower than they are. In our core U.S. chocolate business, there is not much that does better than core U.S. chocolate in terms of margin. And you see some of that mix impact in terms of what\u2019s in the base right now. You have mentioned commodities. Commodities will go up and they will go down and we keep our eye on them. And we always look to have some visibility going forward in our commodity expenses so that we can price accordingly and respond accordingly. But I don\u2019t subscribe to the fact that there aren\u2019t improvements we can make in our gross margin. And I want to call out one of the things that our U.S. plants are doing here in terms of the methodology we call lean, which is really wringing even more costs out of the production process and that\u2019s something that we are in the process right now of \u2013 we have in several of our plants and were rolling out to more plants. Another thing that we can look at is really on our SKUs and making sure that we have the best, most optimal SKU mix in our portfolio. So, while I agree with you there is a little bit of a headwind in terms of the portfolio evolution, I think that we wouldn\u2019t want to say that there is nothing that we can do about it. We need to remain enormously focused on gross margin. Michele Buck : Yes, I would build on that. I think we also believe we have some opportunity relative to the work that we are doing on revenue management and optimizing trade as well as price mix that could help us as well. Rob Moskow : Okay, J.P., congrats on your retirement. Looking forward to March 1. Thank you. J.P. Bilbrey: Thanks a lot. Look forward to seeing you as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi. Please go ahead. David Driscoll : Great, thank you and good morning. I wanted to ask a little bit about the Cookie Layer Crunch, you gave some nice comments in the opening, but can you discuss just kind of why this product is so important? And how incremental do you expect it to be to Hershey and the category? So let me just start there and a follow-up, if I may. Michele Buck : Sure, David. It\u2019s Michele. I will take that one. As we have talked a bit before, we really view our competitive landscape as being that whole snacking world. We know that snacking is growing faster than the total food market. And within that, we are seeing a lot of growth in indulgent snacking and we think it\u2019s a real opportunity for us to leverage our trademarks and play as broadly as we can. And what we have seen is a strategic opportunity to source revenue more broadly and also to provide some incremental texture that we are seeing based on our consumer demand landscape that certain consumers are looking for so that it really expands the footprint of our Hershey trademark. So as we had mentioned, this is an area where we do a lot of testing. We did the BASES test that looked at concept, product delivery as well as our marketing investments behind the proposition. And all signals have indicated that it is a big nice kind of scale platform opportunity for us and that\u2019s why it\u2019s really important. It\u2019s going to help us to refresh the Hershey brand to bring relevant news and capture new snacking occasions. David Driscoll : Can I just follow up with a question that\u2019s a little bit bigger picture? When you guys look over the last couple of years on innovation within the U.S. chocolate category, kind of how do you grade it? And how do you consider that to be the primary culprit in \u2013 resulting in the much lower and slower category growth that we have seen? And then is Cookie Layer Crunch one of the key components to reaccelerating the category for Hershey? Michele Buck : So David, I would say, as we think about the key priorities that are necessary for us to drive the business and maximize our results, they really focus on portfolio, which does have a lot to do with innovation. On marketing mix, we have talked about this category as very responsive category, so getting the right balance between advertising and trade and also within advertising, how we spend our dollars and then, of course, cost control, where we are \u2013 have always been focused and as you know are focused on some additional platform work going forward there. So, I would say that innovation is absolutely key. Scale platform innovation has proven to be one of the greatest drivers for our category. I am encouraged about some of the innovation that we had this past year and I think that we have seen the results of that in the marketplace. And a lot that didn\u2019t launch until the second half, but Big Kat, Reese\u2019s Pieces Cup has done incredibly well. And Snack Mix was also a great innovation that drove incrementality. Of course, it wasn\u2019t shared to the confection category. It\u2019s actually health and salty snacks. So, it is a key lever. And having that sustainable big platform innovation gives us sustaining innovation over a multiyear period of time and that\u2019s one of the biggest focuses for us is making sure that we have sticky innovations, so that it doesn\u2019t just launch and come out. But I agree with you that as we look to next year, both in terms of our business as well as the category, we think that the level of innovation is really going to help to drive CMG category growth and bring consumers to our category. So we are really excited about that. David Driscoll : Well, I really appreciate the answer. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Matthew Grainger : Good morning. Thanks, everyone. I wanted to ask about the margins in the international segment. I think it\u2019s the first quarter in about 2 years, you have been profitable there. And I don\u2019t expect you to comment on longer term targets for where you see that at the moment, but just if you could walk a bit more through what contributed to the improvement and the profits turning positive in that segment. And do you feel you have turned the corner and are now at the point where you can sustain positive margins, positive operating profit in international over the next few quarters? Patricia Little : Yes, I will take a crack at that. And let me start by saying that you may recall last year, we had a lot of issues in China with trade, where we really had to readjust our inventory out in the trade to market conditions. And so what you are seeing \u2013 a lot of what you are seeing is the non-recurrence of that. We have some great results in our Mexico and Brazil operations that I feel really good about. In Brazil, we are having a very good year as we have taken over from our Bauducco JV and have now control of our \u2013 over our distribution and are seeing great results from that even given the difficult operating environment in Brazil, so great job from the Brazil team. In Mexico, we have increased distribution opportunities using our Sigma distribution partner, so great result there. India has been taking care of some products that are lower profitability and you can really see that helping our margin and we need to continue to do that going forward. I think China will continue to be a work in progress as we assess our opportunities against the marketplace that we have there, whether that\u2019s in chocolate, which has been a little bit weak or in the more traditional candies that we have with our Golden and Munching Monkey brands. So, we are focused on gross margin there. And getting to healthy gross margin is a big part of the story of returning that whole segment to profitability. Matthew Grainger : Okay. And the restructuring that\u2019s going on in China, is that \u2013 are we seeing the impact of that flowing through or is that being largely offset by some of the category challenges still? Patricia Little : It\u2019s \u2013 I am sorry \u2013 go ahead. Mark Pogharian : No. I mean, I was going to say we have done some initial integration work with Monkey. I don\u2019t think there is \u2013 we didn\u2019t say anything about any restructure work underway, so I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what you are referring to. I mean, there is again a broader assessment going on right now. As J.P. referenced around what \u2013 it\u2019s really a global review across all functions in all geographies. So, we will come back to you with further details on the where and the how. Matthew Grainger : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Bryan Spillane : Hey, good morning everyone. J.P. Bilbrey: Good morning, Bryan. Bryan Spillane : A question for Michele. Can you just give us a little bit of color in terms of how business is performing in the U.S., instant consumable versus future consumption? And I know the instant consumable has been a bit of a drag over the last, I guess, year or so, but it sounds like some of the innovation or some of the work you have got going into the market next year is going to address that. But if you can give us some color of kind of the difference between the two would be helpful? Thanks. Michele Buck : Sure. So, instant consumables is always a priority for us, given its strong profitability and so as we look at the past couple of years, we are really focused going forward and how we can continue to drive instant consumable a little bit harder. There has been a bit more competition in that area from some healthy instant consumable offerings. But where we feel good about where we are making progress is the results we have seen from some of the innovation that was instant consumable focused, both in terms of our Ice Breakers gum, capacity expansion and then the Reese\u2019s Pieces Cup and Big Kat. And then you will see that with Cookie Layer Crunch as well and some other offerings into next year. We have also focused on optimizing some of our merchandising strategies in a way that we think will continue to drive instant consumable a bit harder. So it\u2019s certainly a key focus for us. Bryan Spillane : And just in terms of how it\u2019s trending right now, is it still lagging your future consumption business? Michele Buck : No, it\u2019s not. Bryan Spillane : Okay. Thank you. Michele Buck : Absolutely. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead. Jason English : Hey. Good morning folks. Thank you for the question. You mentioned earlier about innovation to try to rejuvenate next year so \u2013 and the platform optionality. Tactically, I was hoping you could elaborate a bit more on this Crunchers product and how it fits in, in terms of that and maybe some specificity about when and what is coming on that. And then stepping up beyond innovation, we crunched some of the numbers over here, it looks like another big source, so the category weakness has been just a crowd-out in terms of merchandising, display \u2013 and display space, quality merchandising space within retail, if you can elaborate a little more, what do you think is driving that and what do you think can try to reverse the course of that one, I appreciate it? Thank you. Michele Buck : Sure. So I will address both of those. So first of all we will look at Crunchers, this fits right in the strategy. We have spoken to you a bit about around snackfection, which is thinking broadly about where our core confectionery trademarks, which are so powerful, can play to bring in new users and be utilized across even more snacking occasions with consumers. So if you look at Crunchers, you can see the product has our great trademarks and great chocolate, but very different eating experience, which is much more of a munchable crunchy product, which will put those propositions in a whole different consumer use education. So it really fits in that strategy of expanding snacking occasions across the broader marketplace. And you will see that in the marketplace sometime mid first half of the year. But we are really excited about that. Relative to your broader question on some of the other factors at play in the category, one that I would bring up is just the timing of Easter is always a key factor for the category. And certainly, some years that\u2019s a benefit. And some years, it\u2019s not. This year is one of the shortest Easters. Next year, we have that going in our favor, so we are excited about that. And relative to display, there has been some pressure on the category as some of the biggest retailers have gone to clean floor policies. And given how much floor space confection has received. I think this category has taken a little bit of a bigger hit than some other categories potentially. We believe that we are now behind us with lapping a good piece of that and we believe that having great innovation is one of the best ways to gain display and space. And we are feeling good about some of the initiatives that we have put in place for holiday, where we are seeing share gains and also the share gains that we saw in Q3. And display has been a piece of that. Jason English : Thank you very much. I will pass it on. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please go ahead. Andrew Lazar : Happy National Chocolate Day, everybody. J.P. Bilbrey: Thank you, Andrew. Andrew Lazar : I must have made I was not aware that was a thing, but I just figure that out today, so that\u2019s good. So J.P., just a quick one, I am curious on, I guess your thoughts on all the activity in the space this coming year. We have got a new chocolate launch in the U.S. by Mondelez, you have got margin rate we are now better able in theory to kind of integrate their efforts, I guess more fully in a category that remains relatively slower versus historical run rate, so I am trying to get a sense if you think all of that is enough to accelerate the category growth rate in \u201817. And obviously, if what Hershey has planned both what we know and don\u2019t yet know is enough to either hold or gain share in that sort of a more active environment? J.P. Bilbrey: Yes, sure. So we \u2013 as we look at 2017, we believe the category has indicators that it will continue to expand. I wouldn\u2019t describe that as a planning stance that says it\u2019s a hockey stick, but I think we can see that there is firming in the category. Consumers are in stores. And I just think overall, at the macro level, we think people are across all income cohorts beginning to spend a little bit more confidently than they have before. What I think of that I am very optimistic about is if you just look at the total snack wheel, snacking continues to progress. I think it\u2019s largely driven by occasions. So we have to compete and do well against those new occasions that exist in the market. But I think innovation will be an important driver. It\u2019s good for the category if you think about it within the total snack wheel that we have great competitors. And so frankly, as there is good innovation, I think it just reminds consumers the relevance of CMG in total and so I think that\u2019s good for all of us. And then we of course have to win as well. So what I think you will hear from us as we get more specific about 2017 is we are optimistic about some improvement in the category growth rate as relative to snack wheel. We think occasions certainly benefit us as well and then we have to win market share. And that\u2019s why we are focused against an overall business model that helps us win as a part of the top quartile of our peer group. And then we also want to win market share, obviously within our specific categories. So I am pretty optimistic about 2017 and those are some of the reasons why. Michele importantly talked about the competitiveness in-store. That was all true. But listen, we are all in the business of growth and meeting the wants and needs of consumers. So we are going to be really focused against executing. We are going to win every day from a market share standpoint and then the category growth rate should take care of itself. Andrew Lazar : Great. And as it relates to in-store competitiveness, you may get into this more at your meeting in March, but where you do think Hershey stands now at the sort of the in-store effort or the feet on the street, you made a lot of investment there over the last couple of years, is that in the right place or does there need to be some maybe some additions and further investment on that part of it? J.P. Bilbrey: Well, in my comments, I talked about being flexible and agile. And that\u2019s something that we look at all the time. And so we are constantly reviewing where we think the opportunities are with our organization. We believe strongly in the resource that we have and the effectiveness of our sales organization, our overall go-to-market effort. So you would continue to see that as something we just view as really important to winning every day. Andrew Lazar : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Alexia Howard : Good morning everyone. J.P. Bilbrey: Good morning Alexia. Alexia Howard : Hi, can I ask about how you are thinking about the acquisition strategy from here, I would love to hear what your sort of views, historically on the Brookside acquisition and then Krave were. And I am focusing on North America here, as you think forward, are you thinking about larger scale opportunities and how are you thinking about diversification maybe in the direction of Krave and more into the non-sweet snacks area or is it going to be more of the bolt-on box and Brookside type of activity? J.P. Bilbrey: Yes. So Michele and I will both talk about that. Let me take the more macro piece of that. So we believe that we want to grow and we look at acquisition as an important piece of that. Obviously, if we can find large, meaningful assets that align with the categories that we are in, we are very open to that. As we have talked about before, we are very aware of all of the different things that exist. We look at a lot of things. At the same time, we believe we have a great business model and we don\u2019t want to do anything that doesn\u2019t really help us build there. I think that when you would see us do smaller things, it\u2019s because we believe they fit within a larger platform or have a brand positioning that we can really build around. I don\u2019t think we are going to be in the business of just getting a lot of disconnected small things that we can\u2019t figure out how to knit together. So, we are very thoughtful about how we think the emerging consumer trends are and does that help us get into some of these different places. So, M&A is an important thing for us. At the same time, we want to be very, very thoughtful about how we approach that. I will let Michele talk a bit more about Krave and Brookside and some of her thoughts there. Michele Buck : Sure. So, we feel good about each of those acquisitions if I look to Brookside, Krave as well as barkTHINS though that one obviously is early. And really, our strategy there is looking at how we can expand our portfolio to either bring in new users or new usage occasions, something that we perhaps aren\u2019t able to do with our current existing portfolio of brands. So, we really think about buying a brand and a full proposition. As I look at Brookside, we have been really pleased with how we have delivered against that acquisition model over the years. We certainly have grown the business. It continues to be important strategically in terms of delivering and getting us more into the mass premium space. And right now, we are focused on consumers love the products. We have great repeat. And our next wave of growth there needs to be to continue to drive incremental trial and bring in additional users to that product that folks love. Krave, we are feeling good about. And if you look at all three of these acquisitions, as we create value, we certainly start by creating value by expanding distribution and that\u2019s been the clear first piece of the model by achieving cost synergy and then third, by unleashing and expanding the brand and that\u2019s really the model we think about each one. Krave, we have nearly doubled the sales on that, likewise, nearly doubled distribution and are feeling good about where our velocities are in the marketplace and the innovation pipeline we have behind that. And we are seeing similar results that would certainly again allow on barkTHINS. So, we feel like we have got a model that is helping us to continue to have a portfolio that meets the growing, expanding needs of consumers. Alexia Howard : Thank you very much. I will pass it on. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. David Palmer : Thanks. Good morning everyone and congratulations, J.P. J.P. Bilbrey: Hey, thank you. David Palmer : As a follow-up on an earlier question, how would you compare the new cookie fused products to past innovation maybe in your consumer testing or the trade buzz, it can be compared against the platforms like Minis, Pieces or Reese\u2019s Stuffed with Pieces or Hershey caramel? And I have a quick follow-up. J.P. Bilbrey: Well, first of all, all of the different things that we look at there, we believe they are consumer tested and we want to make sure that they are meeting a need. We have done a lot of demand landscape work that helps us think about where these products belong. And I think we are \u2013 I would tell you that I think the rigor we have and the new demand landscape work that we are doing is pretty exciting and it gives us some real insights into some of the things we are doing in our R&D work. So I would tell you we are very confident about the things that you will see us working on as we go forward. And I am sure that in March, we will reveal a little bit more of our demand landscape work and you will see where we are positioning some of these products. So obviously we have always been thoughtful and we are always optimistic, but we just try to get better every year. And we are pretty excited about the things we have in front of us. David Palmer : And then with regard to SKUs, back in 2015 I think you were talking about SKU rationalization being part of the plan. Earlier in the year, it looked like SKUs were flat. Now, they are coming back up again. Are you in a good place with the trade on SKUs and velocities or how are you thinking about that as you enter into \u201817 and have new products coming on shelf? Thanks. Michele Buck : So, we know that it\u2019s a highly competitive marketplace and I think we are always trying to achieve that balance between having the right amount of news to fulfill those consumer and retailers\u2019 needs and be competitive in the marketplace, but also balance that with being very disciplined and really making sure that we have got the right focus on profitable SKUs that allow us to deliver the best margin. So, I would tell you that we have got a lot of focus on that right now. We have continuing focus on that and we will look to continue to optimize there. David Palmer : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. John Baumgartner : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. J.P. Bilbrey: Good morning, John. John Baumgartner : Michele, just in keeping with the theme of generating your own growth in the U.S., how much more can you maybe lean into the seasonal businesses whether it\u2019s in C-stores or other channels? I mean, that seems to be a reasonably incremental segment that Hershey hasn\u2019t executed against significantly in the past? Michele Buck : We think very broadly about seasons and seasons are really celebratory occasions. So, we certainly look to max out each individual traditional season opportunity, but we really try and think more broadly about how we can apply that model more broadly. So for example, the S\u2019mores occasion is a great opportunity of almost \u2013 of the S\u2019mores season. And then more recently, we built the birthday opportunity, which we just started shipping in the marketplace in the second half of this past year. It\u2019s one of the reasons why Kisses is doing so well, because we have now found a way to get that Kiss and some of our chocolate products into a new occasion, where we really help create and shape that occasion for consumers and the need for our product during that occasion. So, we see that as one of the big opportunities just to continue to expand on that occasion focused strategy in addition to winning the traditional seasons and continuing to uncover new insights that allow us to do that. John Baumgartner : Thank you. J.P. Bilbrey: Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Okay. The last question will come from Steve Strycula with UBS. Please go ahead. Steve Strycula : Hi, good morning everyone. J.P. Bilbrey: Good morning, everyone. Steve Strycula : So, two quick questions one for Michele and one for J.P. For Michele, I think I heard you say earlier in the call that Cookie Layer Crunch, which you are excited about should be about a 1 to 2 percentage point lift to baseline sales in the fourth quarter. Is that right? And if so, should we expect it to kind of endure through the first half of next year as you kind of bump up that baseline into 2017? Michele Buck : I don\u2019t [indiscernible]. Mark Pogharian : I don\u2019t know if we want to get into that level of specificity yet. I mean, obviously, the fourth quarter, you are backing into it, so it\u2019s a little bit different. But a lot of this \u2013 it\u2019s a big brand, a big launch and we hope to get trial and repeat. And then as J.P. loves to say, repeat a repeat. We will certainly provide more color there, but I mean it\u2019s the biggest news on the brand in a long time. So let\u2019s put it that way. Steve Strycula : Great. And then J.P., a quick follow-up, just wanted to see \u2013 you commented earlier on the call that you are seeing broader based spending habit pickup across the income spectrum it seems like because you said traffic seems better in the stores. And I think this time last year, you are talking down saying traffic was a little bit of a pain point in some of your occasions. So, can you kind of explain the evidence as to why you are seeing kind of like a broader based pickup in your core consumer and even the category? Thanks. J.P. Bilbrey: Well, first, you have to take a step back and remember, with our brands, we have very high household penetration. We have high market share. And therefore, we can see across and we have ubiquitous availability. So as we look at all of the different channels and how consumers are \u2013 put traffic into stores and then how they are spending per trip, it\u2019s all things that we follow pretty closely. And so you are starting to see such. So imagine that some retailers probably have relatively stable traffic on a going basis than others depending who their income cohorts are. You might see a bit of a different traffic pattern. So, what\u2019s happening is, first, you begin to see people come back into the stores and then you begin to see the basket broaden a little bit. So, I just want to be cautious that it\u2019s not as if everybody is out high-fiving. But as we talk to some of our retailers and as we follow those metrics, there is evidence that the consumer on a more broad base is having a greater frequency in the store. And then we follow what I would simply call the breadth of the basket or the trend \u2013 or the value of the basket and we are seeing some improvement there as well. It\u2019s different by channel and you would see some retailers having different experiences. In some retail segments, still talk a little bit about volatility that they are seeing. But again, the good news is that fairly broadly, we are seeing an uptick in trips. And then as the economy I think continues to firm a bit, there will be some confidence around the spend of those consumers. And that\u2019s part of what makes us optimistic about 2017 is if you think about the three elements of our business, seasons, the everyday business and then, of course, instant consumable, instant consumable is very much influenced by people obviously being in the store. We are going to have our products on the floor when they are in the store. When our advertising is working hard for us, you see that everyday business, which is a wonderful margin business for both us and the retailers, do well. So, it really comes back to these elements, Michele talked about earlier for us, strong innovation, making sure we have got the right marketing mix modeling and then the business model that we have talked about. And we will explain more in \u2013 when we get together in the spring. It\u2019s really going to be the three buckets of focus for us as a company. Steve Strycula : Well, congratulations on a good quarter. J.P. Bilbrey: Thanks a lot. Mark Pogharian : Well, thank you very much for joining us today. The IR team will be available for any follow-up questions you may have. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s call. You may disconnect at anytime and have a wonderful day.",

Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC Joshua A. Levine - JPMorgan Securities LLC Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Operator : Good morning, everyone and welcome to The Hershey Company's Fourth Quarter 2016 Results Conference Call. My name is Keith, and I'll be your conference operator today. All participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. This call is scheduled to end at about 9 :30 AM, so please limit yourself to one question so we can get to as many of you as possible. Please note this call may be recorded. Thank you. Mr. Mark Pogharian, you may begin your conference. Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.: Thank you, Keith. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to The Hershey Company's fourth quarter 2016 conference call. J.P. Bilbrey, Chairman, President and CEO; Michele Buck, Chief Operating Officer; and Patricia Little, CFO will provide you with an overview of results which will then be followed by a Q&A session. Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2015 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income, prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believe the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. As a result, we will discuss fourth quarter results excluding net pre-tax charges of $148.9 million, or $0.62 per share diluted, which are primarily related to derivative mark-to-market losses. These charges defined in the appendix of this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website at www.thehersheycompany.com. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges. With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. John P. Bilbrey - The Hershey Co.: Thanks, Mark. Good morning to all of you on the phone and the webcast. And I apologize for my voice, as I'm fighting a head and chest cold. In 2016, we made progress against our strategic plans that strengthened our business model and positions the company for future growth. Our productivity and cost savings initiatives drove EBIT margin expansion in full year EPS growth of 7%, the midpoint of our long-term target. And we continue to generate solid operating cash flow, about $1 billion in 2016, which gives us a lot of financial flexibility. Looking at marketplace performance, our core U.S., CMG and snacks business progressed as we anticipated. Retail takeaway and market share performance in the second half of the year was better than the first half of the year, which was impacted by shorter Easter and merchandising and display strategies at select customers. This resulted in full-year snacking market share growth of about 10 basis points. We also began a strategic review of our global cost structure that should result in solid margin expansion and EPS growth. We look forward to talking about our business in these plans in more details on the March 1 at our investor update. Let me now provide you with some detail on our fourth quarter results. Net sales and marketplace performance, both retail takeaway and market share, were relatively in line with expectations. Operating income and earnings per share diluted exceeded our forecast, driven by the early implementation of some cost savings efficiencies and a lower-than-expected tax rate. Patricia will provide you with more details on this in just a bit. As we anticipated, U.S. marketplace performance sequentially improved. Total Hershey U.S. retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ended December 31, 2016, within the xAOC+C channels increased 2.2%. This represents all Hershey snack products sold at retail such as candy, mint, gum, salty snacks, Krave and snack bars. Importantly, Hershey's U.S. CMG, that's candy, mint and gum, retail takeaway increased more than three times the rate of the category, driven by chocolate and was up 1.9%. Our fourth quarter U.S. chocolate performance was solid with retail takeaway up 2.9%, resulting in a chocolate market share gain of 0.9 points. Despite the slow start to 2016, we gained 0.4 points of chocolate market share for the full year. Our brands responded positively to the investments we discussed in July and October. Reese's, our biggest brand, continued to gain momentum driven by variety, news, core two-cup advertising and in-store merchandising and display. The Reese's Pieces Cup innovation, NCAA football, in-store merchandising and strong Halloween and holiday performance generated retail takeaway of 7.2% this quarter. Results were similar to last quarter and impressive, given that this is nearly a $2 billion brand at retail. In 2017, we'll look to expand and improve upon our NCAA basketball and football relationship via innovation and targeted 360-degree activation programs given the customizable promotional entitlements available to us with this sponsorship. We were also pleased with the Kit Kat franchise. Fourth quarter and full year retail takeaway of 5.5% was about the same for both periods, driven by the success of the Big Kat new product launch, as well as the core Kit Kat instant consumable item that benefited from TV and digital marketing programs such as Chance the Rapper and Kit Kat thief. In 2017, we'll continue to bring variety and news to the brand with limited edition red velvet flavor for Valentine's Day. The wafer sticks are not red like the classic southern cake, but the candy itself is red velvet flavored and coated in white cream. In the first half of 2016, The Hershey mega brand campaign didn't work as hard for us as we anticipated. However, in the second half of the year, results improved driven by Olympics, S'mores and seasonal programming. In the fourth quarter, Hershey's franchise retail takeaway increased low single digits on a percentage basis versus last year. The launch of Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch is underway, and we believe this will reenergize the brand. While early results are encouraging, distribution continues to build and advertising is scheduled to begin in early February. As we previously have mentioned, our consumer demand for multi-textural eating experiences across various snacking occasions is increasing, and this product fills a white space opportunity. You'll see additional innovation in the marketplace this year that also delivers on a textural experience in Reese's Crunchy Cookie Cup and Hershey's and Reese's Crunchers. Our consumer research has indicated that millennials want new flavors and textures, especially the Reese's consumers. Reese's is the fastest growing largest instant consumable franchise, so we do a lot of work here trying to bring the right level of investment to the core two-cup and variety news to the brand. In 2017, we'll launch Reese's Crunchy Cookie Cup in an instant consumable pack type. Within the cup are cookie bits versus a solid cookie, which consumers told us was less intrusive in terms of texture. The result is a product that delivers on all the sensations consumers want : smooth, creamy, sweet and crunchy. And the Crunchers product line is targeted for that shareable snacking hand-to-mouth occasion, leveraging the appeal of sweet and texturally complex snacking. These light, crispy and crunchy combinations are a perfect bite-sized snack for a different and unique eating experience. So, we're making progress, but there's still a lot of work to do. We're not satisfied with our non-chocolate candy. In Brookside performance, the work is underway to improve their trends. Although it will be a multi-step process, we continue to believe that candy, mint and gum is an attractive category capable of solid growth over the long-term, when supported with the right mix of customer and consumer marketing. Now for an update on our international markets, where fourth quarter net sales growth was relatively in line with our expectations and up about 3% on a constant currency basis versus last year. I was particularly pleased with Mexico and Brazil, where we generated solid constant currency net sales growth. In Brazil, our growth was fueled by distribution gains in core brands and the continued rollout of the Hershey's Special Milk and Hershey's Special Dark bars, which was launched in Q3. As a result, in Q4, market share increased 0.5 points. And in our Mexican business, chocolates, spicy sugar, confectionery and drinks are tracking relatively in line with our initial plans. Our marketplace performance improved in the fourth quarter, with chocolate retail takeaway up about 9.5%. And our traditional trade initiative with Sigma is progressing, and we're gaining chocolate momentum driven by Kisses. Net sales in India, driven by the brands we're investing behind, Hershey's branded syrup, spreads and milk booster, as well as JOLLY RANCHER and Sofit, increased about 25%. Late in the fourth quarter, we launched Brookside, primarily in the modern trade where we don't expect much of an impact from demonetization. While small, this launch gives us exposure to a value-added segment with above average margins for the India business. In China, the modern trade hypermarket environment continues to be challenging across many categories. In Q4, China chocolate category sales declined about 4%, the same rate as the second and third quarter declines. Our Q4 net sales in China declined about 11% on constant currency basis, slightly lower than our estimate. Sell-in related to Chinese New Year drove Q4 net sales, and advertising and in-store programming occurred just as we had planned. Our e-commerce business continues to progress, and our market share here is estimated to be greater than our share in brick and mortar. Now, I'd like to pause briefly here to just say thank you. It's been an honor to lead The Hershey Company and these quarterly conference calls as Chairman and CEO. I'm so proud of our company and what we've accomplished. I've always appreciated the questions and feedback we've received on these conference calls, and in all of the various meetings that we've participated in with you. I've shared many of your thought-provoking questions and insights with my team, and I feel it's made me a better leader and Hershey a better company, so I say thank you. And now, I'm proud to turn the call over to Michele Buck. As we announced in December, Michele will become Hershey's 12th CEO on March 1, and I'm pleased to be staying on as Chairman. I know that many of you have met Michele and know her, and agree that she's an experienced executive with excellent operating, marketing and strategic capabilities. Now, let me turn the balance of the call over to Michele. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Thanks, J.P. I am very honored that on March 1 I will become the next CEO of The Hershey Company. As you know, Hershey is a special company with great brands, people, capabilities and processes. Combined, these attributes make up a business that over the long-term has delivered sustained results and will continue to do so going forward. We've a team of remarkable employees who come to work every day with a sense of purpose, fostered by our Founder, whose values and legacy are still part of our culture. This has served the company well and resulted in solid financial and marketplace returns. I want to say a special thank you to all of our colleagues across the business, many of whom listen in to this call. I believe it's their passion and dedication, along with our strong brands, advantaged retail sales presence and supply chain capabilities that will contribute to our further success. I was pleased with the progression of our business in 2016. After a challenging start to the year, we did not lose focus. We executed against our plan, and we gained momentum as the year progressed. As we look to 2017, I'm excited about our innovation, our activation plans for Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch and the investments we're making in expanding the Reese's franchise. The targeted and precision-based approach we've taken to growing Reese's with the Crunchy Cookie Cup and into the hand-to-mouth snacking area via the Crunchers product line will provide incremental growth to our business. I'm also pleased with our balanced approach to marketing mix as it relates to trade and advertising. We're continuously improving analytics to enable us to further optimize investments within these two areas, and we'll see some of the benefits of this in 2017. As we've mentioned before, we started to take a fresh look at our business operations and our investment choices in 2016, and we'll share more about this in March. The goal of these margins for growth efforts is to improve overall margins, particularly in our international and other segment. We expect that this will be a multi-year program, enabling us to achieve strong margin and EPS growth in 2018 and 2019, and provide us with the fuel to deliver consistent annual net sales and EPS growth post implementation. The impact and benefits related to these efficiencies in 2017 is modest, given that we accelerated some of the non-restructure related work into Q4. This enabled us to deliver additional operating income growth and margin expansion earlier than planned, resulting in full-year EBIT margin of 20.4%, about 30 to 40 basis points greater than what we had anticipated. We're focused on EBIT margin expansion and expect that it will expand again in 2017, although the gain may not be as great as it was in 2016 as a portion of the savings are being reinvested back into the business. We believe the investments we're making this year are in areas of the business that set us up for continued growth over the long-term. Investments are underway in IT capabilities and additional analytic approaches that will enable operational effectiveness and efficiency, and be a differentiator in the marketplace over the next few years. I'm also excited about the concepts we're testing related to the commercialization of our integrated demand landscape. I look forward to discussing all of this and our long-term vision with you on March 1. I want to underscore my optimism about Hershey's future. We have many opportunities to leverage our globally recognized brands, our capabilities and our U.S. scale. I couldn't be more excited to lead Hershey into the future. I look forward to continuing to work with all of you, as we focus on building value for all Hershey's stakeholders. I'll now turn it over to Patricia who will provide you with details on our financial results. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Thank you, Michele. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Fourth quarter net sales of $1.97 billion increased 3.2%, in line with our forecast. Adjusted earnings per share diluted came in at $1.17, an increase of 8.3% versus last year, greater than our estimate due to savings from our continued focus on our cost structure and 110-basis-point decline in the adjusted tax rate. Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 50 basis points, net sales increased 3.7%. Net price realization was relatively in line with our estimates at a 60-basis-point headwind, primarily due to higher levels of trade and merchandising activity related to our core and seasonal businesses as well as new products. Volume was up 3.4 points, driven by our performance in the U.S. Acquisitions were a 90-basis-point benefit due to barkTHINS, which we acquired in second quarter. By segment, fourth quarter North America net sales increased 3.8%, driven by a 4.1-point contribution from volume. Acquisitions were a 1-point benefit, and net price realization a 1.3-point headwind due to planned higher levels of direct trade supporting increased in-store merchandising and display activity, new products and seasons. Our U.S. seasonal business was relatively in line with our expectations with Halloween and holiday market share up 30 basis points and 25 basis points, respectively. Turning to the international and other segment, excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 3.2 points, net sales increased 2.7%. Volume was off 10 basis points, as solid Latin America, India and select export market performance was offset by lower sales in China. Net price realization was a 2.8-point benefit, as direct trade and returns, discounts and allowances in China were lower. Turning to margins, adjusted gross margin declined by 50 basis points in the fourth quarter, as productivity and cost savings were offset by unfavorable manufacturing variances, the aforementioned unfavorable trade rate and slightly higher supply chain costs driven by initial year absorption of overhead related to the Malaysia manufacturing facility. For the full year, adjusted gross margin declined about 40 basis points, relatively in line with our original plan. We have good visibility into our 2017 input cost basket and don't expect inflation. Additionally, we have productivity and cost savings initiatives in place that should enable adjusted gross margin expansion of about 15 to 25 basis points in 2017. Adjusted operating profit in the fourth quarter declined half a point. As expected, advertising and related consumer marketing expense increased in the fourth quarter of 2016. Selling, marketing and administrative, or SM&A expenses, excluding advertising and related consumer marketing increased 6.6% in the quarter, driven by higher employee-related costs and increased depreciation and amortization. Note that this includes SM&A related to the barkTHINS acquisition. Unallocated corporate expense increased 11%, or $12.6 million, as efficiency and cost savings initiatives were offset by higher employee-related costs and an increase in corporate depreciation and amortization. As we've stated throughout most of 2016, we're focused on our cost structure. We're instilling an ROI mentality to ensure that every dollar we spend works as hard for us as it can. As a result, in the fourth quarter, we generated about $20 million in efficiency savings related to the margin for growth initiative. This enabled us to partially offset higher levels of trade, benefits inflation and other employee-related expenses, as well as manufacturing variances in overhead. As a result, full-year adjusted EBIT margin expanded 40 basis points to 20.4%. Now, let me provide a brief update on our international and other segment. As J.P. stated, we're executing against our plans in the key markets of China, Mexico, Brazil and India. Constant currency net sales in Mexico, Brazil and India increased nicely. Adding to his commentary on China, overall CPG performance in the modern trade is not where we thought it would be. As a result, many categories were sluggish, including chocolate where the category declined about 7% for the full year. As expected, our China gross sales declined in the fourth quarter. Given the soft retail takeaway in the quarter, net sales were slightly off versus our previous forecast. While our Chinese New Year sell-in was good, we'll have to wait until sell-through data is available to determine our net seasonal results. For the full year, excluding China, international and other segment operating profit increased nicely, and I'm pleased with the progression. As we mentioned last quarter, as we look ahead we're committed to profitability in this segment. Moving down the P&L, interest expense of $23.4 million increased $4.2 million versus last year. For the full year, interest expense was $90.1 million and in line with our estimate. In 2017, interest expense is expected to be in the $95 million to $100 million range. The adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 28.2%. The decline was due to the mix of fourth quarter international operating results and increased favorable tax credits and other incentives, including research and development. The full year tax rate of 31.3% was about 90 basis points less than our expectation of about 32.2%. In 2017, the company anticipates its effective tax rate will be between 28.5% and 29%. The reduction versus 2016 is driven by favorable international taxes, investment tax credits and other incentives as well as a 75-basis-point benefit to the tax rate from the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 for the accounting of employee share-based payments. The fourth quarter other income and expense amount of $7.5 million was primarily driven by investment tax credits. In 2017, we'll continue with this strategy and estimate that the investment tax credit expense will be in the $45 million to $50 million range. For the fourth quarter of 2016, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 213.9 million shares, down 4.6 million versus last year, resulting in adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.17 or an increase of about 8.3% versus a year ago. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the fourth quarter, net trading capital declined by $71 million, accounts receivable was lower by $17.7 million and remains extremely current. Inventory was lower by $5.3 million and accounts payable increased by $48.3 million. Total capital additions, including software for the fourth quarter and full year, were $101 million and $269.5 million respectively. For the full-year 2017, we estimate the CapEx will be in the $270 million to $290 million range. Total adjusted depreciation and amortization in the fourth quarter and full year was $67.3 million and $253.3 million, respectively. Dividends paid in the fourth quarter were $127.8 million. In the fourth quarter, the company did not repurchase any common shares against the $500 million share repurchase authorization approved in January 2016. There is $100 million remaining on this authorization. In the fourth quarter, the company repurchased $140 million of common shares in connection with the exercise of stock options. Cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $297 million versus year ago at $347 million. Now to summarize. Work related to the margin for growth program is progressing. As mentioned early, fourth quarter implementation of certain efficiency initiatives related to this work enabled us to exceed our profitability targets in 2016. Note that this is a multi-year program designed to improve overall operating profit margin through supply chain optimization, a streamlined operating model and reduced administrative expenses. However, the impact in benefits related to these efficiency initiatives and included in our 2017 guidance is modest as greater levels of savings and margin expansion is anticipated in 2018 and 2019. As J.P. and Michele summarized, in 2017 we have a lot of innovation, variety and seasonal plans in place. We'll benefit from a longer Easter and have good visibility into these orders. Additionally, Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch is off to a good start. We continue to refine our marketing mix modeling and expect advertising and related consumer marketing expense to increase in 2017. And as Michele outlined, we're also making investments in other parts of our business. As a result, for the full-year 2017, we expect net sales to increase around 2% to 3%, including a benefit from acquisitions of about 50 basis points and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates of about 25 basis points. As I stated earlier, we expect adjusted gross margin expansion of 15 to 25 basis points and the tax rate is expected to be lower than last year. As a result, our expectation is for 2017 adjusted earnings per share diluted to increase around 7% to 9% and be in the $4.72 to $4.81 range. Thank for your time this morning, and we'll now take any questions you may have. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our first question from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead, your line is open. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, good morning, everybody. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Good morning. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And congratulations to you, Michele, and all of the best to you, J.P. John P. Bilbrey - The Hershey Co.: Thank you. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So, I guess maybe just one question, related to the operating leverage, I guess, in 2017. Can you maybe talk about in terms of gross margins with inflation being basically non-existent or commodity inflation being pretty benign this year, why there isn't more maybe gross margin leverage in this year? Is it trade spend or is there something else happening that's kind of holding back more a growth margin expansion in 2017? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Patricia, why don't you take that one? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. Thanks for the question. Yeah, so as we said, we see commodity inflation is relatively benign as you said. Yes, we are continuing to invest behind our brand, our innovation, our seasonal activation. And so, we have pretty good visibility into our gross margin. We're also very focused as being a gross margin company. And I'm pleased that given the investments we're making in the brands that we do have leverage on that line. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And, I guess, just as a follow-up. As we're thinking about your marketing spend or your investment this year, some of it happens at the sales line, and some of it's happening within marketing. Is that part of the way we should think about it? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Yes. I absolutely think about it that way. A lot of the work that we've been doing this year, and will continue into 2017, is really getting the balance of those different kinds of spend right. We have good capability improvements in both of those to make sure that we're putting the right \u2013 and Michele talked about this, the marketing mix model as well as some revenue management improvements in our capabilities to look at the way we spend our trade promotion. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we can take our next question from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please go ahead. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Morning, everybody, and congratulations J.P., and best of luck, Michele. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Thank you very much. John P. Bilbrey - The Hershey Co.: Thank you, Andrew. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Quick question on EBIT margin expansion, or the outlook for 2017. I think, Michele, you said you expect some EBIT margin expansion, though, not necessarily at the rate that we saw in 2016. And, I guess, I'm trying to get a sense of whether that's a shift at all in thinking, maybe relative to last quarter. I think on the third quarter call, company was talking about top quartile performance on the top line, and I think from a profitability standpoint. And I guess, now \u2013 so it struck me maybe that you didn't necessarily view 2017 as a reinvestment year per se. And now it does sound like maybe you've got, Michele, some specific or discrete things that you want to reinvest in. So, I'm trying to get a sense of is that a little bit of a shift or maybe I'm reading that wrong. And if so, what are really those key items where some of that reinvestment has got to come into play? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Sure. So I'll take that first, and then if Patricia has anything she wants to add. As we think about our financial goals, clearly we want to be in the top quartile from a net sales perspective, net sales growth amongst the S&P food group. We're very proud of our EBIT margin, around 20%, certainly one of the highest out there. We want to continue to grow that. So, we want to be in the top quartile relative to EBIT margin. John P. Bilbrey - The Hershey Co.: That's absolute. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: The absolute, not the gross. So, we've some work to do, as others have focused on their EBIT margins to expand that and to get even more a higher rate there. As we think about the business versus Q3 when we spoke to you, I guess I'd say two things. First of all, probably the biggest change is, we really got an accelerated delivery of margin expansion. So, we had started a real focus on margin expansion across the company. And hey, our organization over-delivered versus our expectations. So, some of the margin expansion we expected we'd get in 2017, we actually got in 2016. Then on top of that, there are several areas that we do want to invest and are investing for future growth. One of the biggest areas is around technology in the new ERP system and enterprise connectivity, which we'll talk to you more about in March, as well as some marketing related expenses around the demand landscape, packaging, et cetera that you'll see in the marketplace. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Okay. Thank you. See you in March. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Okay. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good morning, everybody, and congratulations to J.P., and looking forward to working with you, Michele. So, can I ask about the outlook for commodity costs? We've obviously seen the cocoa price on the CME come down fairly substantially over the last several months. Is that going to benefit you in the near term, or are you hedged out for a couple of years as I think you've typically been in the past? How are you thinking about the commodity cost outlook at this point? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: So, Alexia, if you look at us, we've got a pretty big cost basket of inputs, and certainly every year some are up and some are down. Definitely, we've seen cocoa prices come down. And the real goal of our commodity hedging program is to make sure that we don't have a lot of volatility in those input costs, because that makes it easier for us to manage. And I think that we stated before, we typically have between 3 months and 24 months of coverage for various raw materials. And so, drops that you see right now don't necessarily translate into the current year P&L. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on. Operator : Thank you. And next we'll go to David Driscoll with Citi. Please go ahead. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you, and good morning. And congratulations, Michele and J.P. Really appreciate everything over the years, and certainly with your role going forward, we hope to still continue to get to talk to you. I'd like to ask Patricia about the tax question, the tax rate. So, there is a lot of questions on this from clients this morning. And Patricia, is it just fair to say that the old guidance used to be like an ongoing rate of like 33%, and that's what we were modeling. So then the differential to, say, the top end of 29%, your guidance, looks really big. It's like a 400-basis-point delta. But on this other line, that's where you purchase those tax credits, and it's a significant $50 million expense I think you said in your script. But I think it's correct that you got to net these two things together to really understand what's going on, on taxation for the company. Did I state those things correctly? And can you maybe give any clarity where I've made a mistake? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Thanks for the question, David. Let me start by just saying that in total on taxes, yes, you're right, the investment tax credits that we've been purchasing for the last couple of years are a driver of our tax improvement, one of the drivers. We have other drivers as well. We continue, as we said, to be very focused on our international operations, improving those. So the mix of international is part of it as well, plus we are doing a good job, I think, of taking advantage of our R&D investments that we're making, things like the new ERP system that Michele answered. So, we have a number of things that we've been focused on in tax, and we're also making sure that the changes that we make are sustainable, and not highly volatile to our tax rate. And, Mark, did you want to clarify anything on the...? Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.: Yeah, David, you're right. The other income and expense related to the investment tax credit is there. It's about the same amount in 2017 versus 2016, give or take. And that got you down to that 33-ish, 32-ish range on the tax rate. Some of the other initiatives Patricia talked to, as well as making sure we take advantage of all our legal entity structure is what drives it to where it is now, and that we think you can use going forward. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: One follow-up for me. You guys have mentioned these efficiency initiatives, and then previously you had upgraded, I think you call it the CIP program, your cost savings, continuous improvement program. Can you just give us a rundown of where these numbers stand for what's in your 2017 guidance right now? I think it wasn't so clear. We know they're positive, but can you just run us through the savings that you actually expect to realize in 2017? Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. I mean, what we've said to-date, Dave, and we'll obviously give more color on March 1 on this margin for growth program. Our normal productivity program was $50 million to $70 million, and we upped that to about $100 million a year for 2017 through 2019. I think Patricia had mentioned there was about $15 million or $20 million in the fourth quarter we got around this margin for growth program. It'll be probably around that same range around there for 2017, and then we'll provide you with some broader ranges and outlook as it relates to 2018 and 2019 on March 1. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: But the correct characterization is that the $20 million of efficiency that shows up in 2017, it's just a very small part of this much bigger efficiency program that you will reveal to us in March, is that fair? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Yes. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: And to be clear, the $20 million was in the fourth quarter. So, we were calling out the pull-ahead that Michele referenced earlier. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thanks so much. I'll pass it along. Operator : And our next question is from Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, there. Thank you, and congratulations to everybody. When I was thinking about 2017, one of the bigger savings that I had assumed was in China, because I thought that China's overhead expenses had been built up under the assumption that it was going to be a much bigger business in terms of sales. And it's obviously \u2013 the expectations are much different now. So, can you focus a little bit more on what to expect for your overhead and spending in China in 2017? Is there an opportunity in 2017 to reduce that overhead, or is it really 2018 and 2019 when that would happen? Thanks. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Sure. So, we're going to talk more about that in a lot more detail in March. Certainly, we're focused on profitability there. There are certain measures we can take to increase profitability as we go. There are others that take a bit more time. But we'll get into a lot more details on that in March. But it is a focus, for sure. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. I'll pass it along. Operator : And we'll go next to Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Thanks. And J.P., congratulations, and Michele, look forward to a great run. One question with a couple of parts. I think looking at the gross margin for 2017, there's a couple of pieces, right? You got manufacturing leverage, and you got costs. Now, on the latter, obviously, cocoa prices have declined somewhat precipitously in the fall. You've given any color you can give us about what that means for the P&L, how that typically flows through. And maybe if you don't want to give numbers, fine, but you'll give us a sense of how far you're typically hedged, and how you'd expect to move like that to kind of roll through in any offsets. And on the first part of it, I guess, I would think Cookie Layer Crunch is a positive price mix. And I would think doing more North America than international is also a positive, I say, I mean, gross margin mix. I would think Cookie Layer Crunch is a positive gross margin mix. So, I guess, I'm struggling a little bit. If you're going to grow volume in 2017, is it just that you're going to promote away what would apparently be gross margin lift? Thank you very much. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: So, I'll address the first part of the question first. And relative to cocoa, as I mentioned before, we typically hedge 3 months to 24 months out. And so, the cocoa prices aren't going to directly relate what's happening in the cocoa market with the current P&L. So, that's really a longer term impact. Relative to mix, certainly you're right that North America has strong margins. Cookie Layer Crunch we feel good about. We also have some investments we're making in expanding the portfolio to participate more broadly in other snacking occasions, things like Krave and some other snack initiatives that are lower margin than the core very high margins we have in the core confectionery business. And we continue to believe that those are important investments to drive growth for us into the future. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Got you. Thank you very much. Operator : And we'll go next to David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks, and congratulations J.P. and Michele. First, a question on the Hershey Cookie Layer Crunch. You said it was having encouraging early results. In the scanner data, it looks like the sales mix was maybe less than 50 basis points in the fourth quarter, but it's been building to over 1% in recent weeks. Do you see that ramping more quickly as the advertising hits? And where do you think distribution can build to from here? And I have a follow-up. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: So, yes, I would say, we haven't begun advertising. Advertising is just starting. And so, I would expect that we will see another lift in velocity as we go on air. We did have a strong push as we went into distribution to get merchandising on the floor, to attract consumers to the proposition, but I would expect that we'll see another lift with advertising. And I would expect we're going to have pretty broad distribution. We have a strong focus on getting broad distribution as quickly as we could. But I think if you look at many of our new product launches, I would expect that we'll get to 80%-ish kind of distribution on this one, as we have with most others. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : If I were to have a second question, it's about the Reese's brand. You've kind of kept it simple over the years, and advertised a lot against that brand. And it's perhaps your best power brand and it feels like if there is a way to describe 2017 other than the snackfection and with different mouth feels and different constructs, it could be the year of Reese's, because you have the Reese's Pieces Cups, Reese's Crunchers, Reese's Crunchy Cookie Cup. It seems like the year of the Reese's extension. Is that fair? And do you think that this could be something that you could push on a multi-year basis? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: So, first of all, I would agree with what you're saying on Reese. Given that it is our largest $2 billion-ish type of brand, any lift we get on that brand obviously is very meaningful for our P&L. Strong profitability. We feel really good about the lineup of activity we have on Reese. We also feel good that we have done a lot of work to optimize how we're spending our marketing dollars, and we're seeing a lot of benefit from that on the base. I would also say, though, I look at 2017 as a strong year for Hershey, with the focus that we have against that. We always focus on driving our core. So, those big brands with high profit margins critically important for us to deliver the year, Hershey, Reese, Kit Kat, et cetera. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Joshua A. Levine - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, this is Josh Levine on for Ken. Thanks for the question. Just a quick question. I may have missed this. But just on the Cookie Layer Crunch and Crunchers innovations, have you mentioned how much you expect they sort of be pipeline filled this year versus the replenishment? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: No, we haven't talked about that. I don't think that we usually typically go into that. I mean, if you think about the Cookie Layer Crunch, we obviously got off to a strong start in Q4. So, if you look at even the results of takeaway, you can assume that there was a lot of pipeline for Cookie Layer Crunch that came in Q4, and Crunchers is all coming this year because we had no distribution last year. John P. Bilbrey - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. I mean, we give the volume breakout in North America Josh. So, if you were to look at North America, the volume and subtracted the takeaway, I mean, it's not perfect math, but it would get you to how we thought about it in the fourth quarter in December. Right in line with what we thought. Joshua A. Levine - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. And just to make sure, I mean, are there any other pipeline fill comps that we should be sort of thinking about as we look at modeling the volume cadence for this year? Thanks. John P. Bilbrey - The Hershey Co.: So, as we've talked, the first quarter should really drive a lot of the growth. I think if you look at the sales, first half, second half will be quasi similar, although the first half will be driven by the first quarter. We had a lot of, I'll call it, productivity and cost savings in the second half of 2016. So, again, if you were to think of EPS growth probably more first half, first quarter driven. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: The other thing you might think about is, because of the way Easter is structured this year, the difference between takeaway and sales, last year with the Easter being earlier there was a disconnect there. You'll see the reverse of that this year. Joshua A. Levine - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Very much. Operator : And we can take next David Driscoll with Citi. Please go ahead. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks for taking the follow up. I wanted to ask J.P. and Michele, J.P. you've commented so much on this in the past about the competition in the grocery store and in the perimeter in getting display, and I feel like the characterization last year, I mean, it was so tough, in the first year it was so tough, and now things just feel so much better. Could you just give us some color as to kind of what's changed? I know you put in a little bit more promotion to get more space. But can you just give us more color here on things, because it really feels different today. And I'd like to hear your perspective, and Michele, your perspective on how things have changed. And then is this something that we can feel good about as sustainable that the sales growth in North America and the United States, in particular, is not going to be under as much pressure as we saw, say, back, I remember end of 2015 and beginning of 2016, it was just so tough. Thank you. John P. Bilbrey - The Hershey Co.: Hey, David, I'll give you a macro comment and then Michele can follow up if she wants. I was at FMI last week. And one of the things that seemed to be pretty broad based across a number of retailers, and as I was hearing comments across manufacturers is that people were optimistic in terms of their plans, and I felt as though people were looking to really invest in their business from a merchandising standpoint and promotion. I'm really speaking about retailers as they were talking to us as well as others. And so, I felt really good that people really wanted to go out and execute against good plans. It didn't feel quite as conservative, I would say, as it did the previous year. So, I just took that as a fairly optimistic tone that people see their destiny as in their hands, and they're going to go execute against their business. And I don't know, Michele, if you want to add to that? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. I'll add two things. I mean, you specifically asked about merchandising as one part of the question, and I would say, there were some big retailers that implemented cleaner floor policies, and it really took us through mid-last year into Q3 to kind of lap that. And I think once we did we started to see similar momentum there. And I'd also say the other thing I'm encouraged by is, where there has been strong activity in certain categories or with certain brands, there have been strong results. And I look at the high-single digit results we saw on Reese, on Kit Kat, on Ice Breakers this past year, so I feel confident that where we have those we can really drive impact. And I think the results we're seeing on Cookie Layer Crunch speak to that as well. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: So, one follow on then, Michele. The Cookie Layer Crunch, this looks like this could potentially be a $100 million product for you all. We haven't seen that in a while. Do you guys believe you've gotten the innovation machine at Hershey kind of back on track, and then it'll be more consistent than maybe in the last couple years where innovation just fell? I mean, it was, what, 2011 when we had the Reese's Minis, and that was a blockbuster. The Minis franchise was great, but it finally petered out. And now it feels like you're back here with CLC, but can you characterize innovation? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Sure. So, first of all, I'd say, we're very bullish on Cookie Layer Crunch, yet at the same time it's early. So, we need to make sure that we get repeat and see the response to advertising, but we remain optimistic. I do believe that based on our research results that can be a big platform for us. And I also believe, I guess I'd say two things. First, I feel really good about the innovation we have in the pipeline. I think back half of last year, if you look at snack mix, Reese's Pieces Cup, Big Kat, Cookie Layer Crunch and Crunchers this year, I think we really are building momentum there. But at the same time, I'd say innovation is hard, and it's hard to get the homerun. So, we're focused on trying to keep at it, and I feel good about what I see for 2017 into 2018. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And we'll also take a follow-up from Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning, everyone, and congratulations to everyone as well. I guess two questions if there's time, first is a follow-up to Driscoll's question, I guess. But your sales guidance, obviously, incorporates an expectation of stronger contribution from new product innovation than we had this year. And there's also some noteworthy new products activity that's been launched by competitors and probably will be merchandised. So, I'm just curious if you could characterize the sales contribution from innovation in 2017, relative to what you'd expect on a normalized basis going forward? Is this going to be kind of a peak year? And then more generally, the 2% to 3% sales outlook, what kind of improvement in category trends that predicated on? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Yes. So, as we look at the category, based on everything that you've mentioned and certainly those same things that we've seen at industry shows, it looks like it's going to be a big year of innovation for the category. And if we look historically, whenever there's been a lot of innovation in this category, given the variety-seeking nature of consumers, the accessible price points, it tends to be a pretty strong category year. So, as we look at the category, we anticipate that we might see growth around 2% or 2.5%, certainly accelerated growth versus what we saw in 2016. We expect that it would perhaps be more in line with what we saw back in 2014, 2015. So, we think that all of those things are good for the category. And certainly as we look at our business, we like getting a nice chunk of growth from a big innovation. So, we like to see that. It's a big focus within our P&L. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. So, it would be fair to say that you're optimistic about your market share prospects, but your 2017 guidance doesn't necessarily embed a level of certainty around market share gains, if you expect the category to improve? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: I'd say, that we would expect that we'll see some gain in market share. I think at the same time, we try and be realistic about where the overall macro environment looks like, and some of the volatility that we've seen in the marketplace, it's harder to predict than it's been in the past. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And, Patricia, just a quick one on barkTHINS. I think there is still some amortization headwinds in 2017 that will result in dilution there. But, as you ramp up investment and some of the amortization subsides, what are you expecting in terms of lower dilution or improved earnings contribution on that business? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. Thanks. You're right. We do have the amortization of barkTHINS. We had some of it in 2016, we'll have it in 2017. Overall, we're really pleased with the way that integration is growing. We've been particularly doing well with the synergy part of it, the supply chain savings is becoming greater than we expected. So, we feel really good about that acquisition. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks, everyone. Operator : And we will take our last question from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. I don't know if I'm jumping ahead of others in the queue, but I would like to know about all these IT investments that need to be made. Can you talk a little bit about \u2013 do you think that you fell behind your peers in terms of IT investments? Like, why is all of this happening now? And how do you think it will help you improve marketplace performance? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: I'd look at the opportunity that's in front of all of us right now of what data and analytics and technology can enable. And as we've talked about before, we've always believed that that's critically important in our business, the knowledge that we have has an advantage. And so, we're very focused on looking at all the applications of data that can create competitive advantage in the marketplace. And we believe that needs to be a big focus of ours. So, we really are focused on that right now. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: And can I assume that that goes into corporate expense? And if so, will corporate expense be higher in 2017? John P. Bilbrey - The Hershey Co.: Well, Rob, we'll talk to a lot of this on March 1, especially some more detail around what some of these IT investments are at the business level, to ensure people are working most efficiently as possible, as well as at the corporate level. So, I think you're going to see a little bit of both. I don't want to get out ahead of ourselves on March 1 here, but there's a lot of things in the market changing very faster than they ever have before, and we're trying to bring solutions to retailers and be where the customer is going. So, I think you'll see more of this on March 1. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. We'll share some specific examples. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Thanks. Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.: All right, operator. We'll end the call here. We thank everybody for their participation, and we'll be available for any follow-up calls that you may have. Thank you. Operator : And this will conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Leo, and I will be your conference operator today. All participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. This call is scheduled to end at about 9 :30 AM, so please limit yourself to one question so we can get to as many of you as possible. Please note this call may be recorded. Thank you. Mr. Mark Pogharian, you may begin your conference. Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.: Thank you, Leo. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to The Hershey Company's first quarter 2017 conference call. Michele Buck, President and CEO; and Patricia Little, Senior Vice President and CFO will provide you with an overview of results which will then be followed by a Q&A session. Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2016 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income, prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the Note section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as a key metric for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. As a result, we will discuss first quarter 2017 results excluding net pre-tax charges of $216.6 million, or $0.71 per share diluted, which are primarily related to business realignment cost and long-lived asset impairment charges. These charges are defined in the appendix of this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website at www.thehersheycompany.com. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges. And with that out of the way, let me turn the call over to Michele Buck. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Thanks, Mark, and good morning to all of you on the phone and webcast. Hershey's first quarter results were solid and I'm pleased with our performance. Net sales growth was 2.8%, delivering our fourth consecutive quarter of at least 2% sales growth, which we're happy with, given the choppy food industry retail trends in the U.S. and the macroeconomic challenges in some international markets. Gross margin was up nicely in Q1 and is expected to increase for the full year, fueling higher levels of advertising and other brand building initiatives. Adjusted EPS was $1.31, a strong start to the year and puts us in a position to deliver on our commitments. The Margin for Growth Program we discussed on March 1st is on track. This will not be a big benefit to our 2017 results. However, this multiyear program should enable us to achieve strong margin and EPS growth in 2018 and 2019 and provide us with the fuel to deliver consistent annual net sales and EPS growth post implementation. Preliminary analysis of Easter data indicates that we had a good season with sell-through in line with estimates, putting us in a position to gain share in this important season. We believe this will result in total Hershey U.S. candy, mint and gum, or CMG, April year-to-date retail takeaway of about 2.5%. While we don't like getting ahead of ourselves before results are final, given the timing of Easter, we thought this was an important metric to share. Hershey U.S. retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ending April 8, 2017, in the xAOC+C-store channels declined 7.9%. As we stated on last quarter's conference call, first quarter net sales would be greater than retail takeaway due to Easter timing. Recall that Easter occurred on April 16th in 2017 compared to March 27th in 2016. Perhaps the easiest way to assess performance given seasonal timing, and therefore, noise in the data, is by looking at absolute market share results. In the first quarter, we gained market share, both with and without the Easter seasonal activity. In total, including the headwind from the year-ago seasonal activity, Hershey U.S. CMG market share increased plus 0.4 points. Our core power brands, Reese's, Hershey's, Kit Kat, Kisses and Ice Breakers, which had 2016 retail sales of $5 billion, continue to perform well. In the first quarter, combined non-seasonal retail takeaway on these brands increased 5.6%. Our Reese's NCAA basketball program and the launch of Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch, or CLC, helped drive results. While we're pleased with our first quarter market share gains, non-seasonal CMG retail takeaway was softer than we anticipated, resulting in Q1 net sales coming in less than our plan. As you are all aware, Q1 marketplace performance across most of the U.S. food group was soft. While the perimeter continues to grow faster than center of the store, its growth rate also slowed. Our analysis points to several factors contributing to the softness. Some of them appeared to be Q1-specific, such as the tax refund delay while others are a continuation of the challenges like benefits inflation or channel shifting that we've been living with and we continue to solve for. Additionally, retail trips within xAOC+C-store channels was about the same as the year-ago period, although dollars per trip were down. Dollars per trip were better in March. And as I mentioned earlier, preliminary Easter sell-through is in line with our estimates. We have a lot of variety, innovation and in-store programming over the remainder of the year as well as higher levels of advertising. We think categories within the snack wheel will outpace center of the store products given the impulsivity and percentage of merchandising and display allocated to snacks. As a result, we expect Hershey non-seasonal U.S. CMG marketplace trends to improve. However, given the uncertainty regarding overall U.S. brick-and-mortar retail trends, our updated full year U.S. net sales growth rate is lower than our previous forecast. Looking at some of our 2017 activity, it starts with Hershey's CLC, which has gotten off to a good start. In the first quarter, CLC net sales and marketplace results were in line with our estimates. Internally, we refer to CLC as a vertical launch, as our goal was to attain 80% distribution by early February. We achieved this in eight weeks and had product available in all major channels to coincide with the beginning of TV and digital advertising. The take-home stand-up pouch is doing very well followed by the king-size pack-type. Sales by class of trade are tracking as expected. C-store results are particularly strong with retail sales two times that of any other channel. While early, repeat purchases are tracking nicely. Although retail sales trends did slow in April given the Easter period as there's not a seasonal pack-type or packaging for this product yet. With the launch of Reese's and Hershey's Cookies 'n' Cr\u00e8me Crunchers, we are looking to expand our power brands to capture broader snacking occasions. Our research continues to show that snacking occasions have increased throughout the day. The modern snacking model indicates 90% of consumers snack multiple times throughout the day. We expect that Crunchers will capture a portion of these snacking occasions as it combines powerful growing brands with sweet and crunchy textures to deliver a light, crisp eating experience. The take-home stand-up bag is currently available at a few select retailers, and the instant consumable tubes will be available by the end of June. We have a strong integrated Crunchers marketing plan to build awareness and trial, including a national FSI in Q3, in-store merchandising and display, as well as advertising. I'm also excited about the late Q2 launch of Reese's Crunchy Cookie Cup. The excitement of this launch started in February when the Reese's brand team started using social media to engage consumer with clues to a new chocolaty Cupspiracy. The team posted various graphics and videos to hype the followers; and in March, announced the upcoming launch of the Reese's Crunchy Cookie Cup, a peanut butter cup infused with crunchy pieces from a chocolate cookie. This product, only available in an instant consumable pack-type, begins to ship in Q2. And I think you'll find that the crunchy cookie bits are a complementary texture with the peanut butter that makes it a very satisfying experience. Additionally, our Reese's Snack Mix and Hershey's Snack Bites products continue to do well, and we're leveraging some other equities as well such as ALMOND JOY and TAKE5. These items have enabled us to expand our breadth across the snack wheel and capture new usage occasions. That was just a brief summary of some of the activity we have in North America that we believe will grow our business over the remainder of the year. We feel that our brand support, innovation, consumer spending and investment and go-to-market capabilities will enable us to deliver our full year net sales objective. Snacks, which confectionery is a large part of, is performing better than many of the center of store categories, and we expect that to be the case going forward. Investments in the CMG category in the form of advertising and innovation are present from most major manufacturers. Therefore, given the high household penetration and the impulsive nature of the category, as well as affordable price points and solid margins, retailers continue to value the confectionery category. As a result, we would expect the category to continue to secure key merchandising and programming space. Now, for an update on our International and Other segment. Net sales were essentially in line with our plan and on a constant currency basis up 4.2% versus the first quarter of 2016. I was particularly pleased with Mexico, Brazil, and India, where constant currency first quarter net sales increased a combined 15%. In Mexico, our chocolate retail takeaway increased solid double digits, although slightly less than the category growth of about 15%. Constant currency net sales increased 13%, driven by a combination of volume and pricing. Sales were strong across all categories and brands, particularly Kisses and Hershey's chocolates, Hershey's milk drink box, and Pelon Pelo Rico. Our new Hershey's CHOCOYOGO and Hershey's milk sticks are resonating with consumers and gaining traction. In Brazil, while preliminary, we estimate that the chocolate category increased 7% to 8%. Our retail takeaway in Brazil was about two-and-a-half times the category growth rate, fueled by distribution gains on core brands and the continued rollout of the Hershey's Special Milk and Hershey's Special Dark Bars, which were launched in the second half of 2016. As a result, in Q1, our market share in Brazil increased 0.6 points to about 4.5%. Constant currency net sales in India increased about 16%. Growth in the brands we're investing behind Hershey's branded syrup, spreads, and milk booster as well as Brookside, JOLLY RANCHER and SOFIT increased more than 50%. The launch of Brookside, primarily in the modern trade, is progressing and on plan. While small, this launch gives us exposure to a segment with above-average gross margin for the India business. Importantly, the transition of the portfolio is enabling a higher-margin business, which should put us in a position to invest and win in the marketplace with a sustainable operating model. As we end the second quarter in China, we'll begin to implement the Margin for Growth Program we discussed earlier this year. The program includes an initiative to optimize the manufacturing operations supporting our China business. Patricia will discuss and review the impact of our impairment test of China's long-lived assets. But the overall goal of this program is clear and will focus on improving global efficiency and effectiveness, optimizing the company's supply chain and streamlining the operating model. China chocolate category sales in Q1 were about flat versus a year ago, and better than our estimate. This was similar to trends of other impulse products, which declined. Given the typical inventory levels we had post-Chinese New Year and the soft category in March, the temporary plant closure of about three weeks to four weeks due to an unscheduled inspection by regulators did not have a big impact on our business. Our chocolate business in China underperformed the market in the first quarter, with market share off one point. As we right-size our business and portfolio over the next year or two, we're looking to prioritize cities, classes of trade, brands, and innovation to satisfy the needs of this dynamic market. We're working closely with our local team, including our e-commerce group, which continues to show promise. Now to wrap up, I'm excited about our future, and I believe The Hershey Company has a long runway ahead of it. I'm supported by a great team of leaders, who have a lot of broad-based CPG experience. As we've shared with you on March 1st, we know what we need to do to succeed. We are executing on our model to expand margins by reallocating resources to initiatives with a higher rate of return. We're investing in capabilities like go-to-market and building on our intellectual capital while also leveraging our core power brands and equipping our organization with the resources and tools to win in the marketplace. These investments in growth and capabilities should put us in an advantage position to win with retailers and consumers, and ultimately, deliver on our financial commitments on our strategy of balanced top and bottom line growth and build shareholder value. I'll now turn it over to Patricia, who will provide you with details on our financial results. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Thank you, Michele. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. First quarter net sales of $1.88 billion increased 2.8% versus last year. Adjusted earnings per share diluted came in at $1.31, an increase of about 19% versus last year, driven by solid gross profit margin growth as well as the timing of some SG&A investments that are expected to flow through over the remainder of the year. Excluding favorable foreign currency translation of 10 basis points, net sales increased 2.7% versus the year ago period. Net price realization was a two point benefit due to lower levels of trade. Net volume increased 70 basis points, including the contribution from the barkTHINS acquisition of 90 basis points. By segment, North America net sales increased 2.7% versus the same period last year. Volume was a 30 basis point contribution to sales growth, driven by seasonal growth; and as anticipated, net price realization was a 1.2 point benefit due to lower direct trade. The barkTHINS acquisition and foreign exchange currency rates were a 1 point and 20 basis points benefit, respectively. We were pleased with seasonal results, the initial rollout and off-take of Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch, and Reese's NCAA basketball programming. However, similar to trends experienced by the broader U.S. food group, other portions of our everyday or non-seasonal business were softer than the anticipated. Importantly, in the first quarter, retail trips within xAOC+C-store channels were about the same as the year-ago period. Our preliminary Easter sell-through is in line with expectations, and we expect non-seasonal U.S. CMG trends to improve over the remainder of the year, although the growth rate is slightly lower than our previous forecast. Over the remainder of the year, we feel good about the level of innovation, brand investment and in-store merchandising and display to deliver on our forecast. Total International and Other segment net sales for the first quarter increased 3.7% versus last year. Excluding the 50 basis point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, International and Other segment net sales increased 4.2% versus the year-ago period. Price realization was an 8.7 point benefit, primarily driven by lower trade in China. Turning to margins : Adjusted gross margin increased 70 basis points in the first quarter, driven primarily by favorable trade, lower input costs, and supply chain productivity, and cost savings initiatives were essentially offset by unfavorable manufacturing experiences, initial year absorption of overhead related to the Malaysian manufacturing facility and higher freight and warehousing. For the full year, we expect adjusted gross margins to increase about 50 basis points. This is somewhat greater than our previous estimate of 15 basis point to 25 basis point increase. The full year gross margin is driven by productivity and cost savings initiatives as well as improved input costs. Adjusted operating profit in the first quarter increased 10.5% versus the year-ago period, resulting in operating profit margin of 23.2%, an increase of 170 basis points. The increase was driven by the higher gross profit and by lower SG&A. Investments in technology and go-to-market capabilities as well as higher depreciation and amortization were more than offset by cost savings and efficiency initiatives. Total advertising and related consumer marketing expense was about the same as the first quarter of 2016. We continue to expect that advertising and related consumer marketing expense will be higher in Q2 and for the full year. Now let me provide a brief update on our International and Other segment. I'm pleased that our total international business delivered on their Q1 plans. As Michele stated, in China, we're beginning to implement the Margin for Growth Program we discussed earlier this year. The program includes an initiative to optimize the manufacturing operations supporting our China business. We deemed this to be a triggering event requiring us to assess whether the value of our China long-lived asset group is recovered by its related cash flows. As a result of this testing and our revised estimate of fair value for the asset group, we recognized impairment charges, totaling $106 million to write-down certain intangible assets that have been recognized in connection with the 2014 Golden Monkey acquisition. And we wrote down property plant and equipment by $102.7 million. During the first quarter, we also recognized estimated employee severance and related charges relating largely to our initiative to improve the cost structure of our China business, as well as our initiative to further streamline our operating model. China chocolate category performance in Q1 was relatively in line with our forecast. We remain optimistic about the long-term outlook in China. However, consumer spending still appears to be mixed in the modern trade and impulse categories underperformed. Therefore, our full year sales outlook in China is slightly lower than our previous estimate. We expect China net sales in 2017 to decline single digits on a percentage basis versus last year. Because direct trade, returns, discounts and allowances should be lower than last year, gross sales will be down by a greater amount. However, given the choppiness in the China market over the last 22 years, this outlook could change if there's a pullback in the market. We're executing against our plans in Mexico, Brazil, and India where constant currency net sales in these three countries increased a combined 15%. First quarter International and Other segment operating income of $1.7 million improved nicely, and I'm pleased with the progression. As we stated on March 1st, we are driving a strong profit-focused mentality in this segment and expect the bottom line trends to improve meaningfully in 2017. However, the exact timing and implementation of the Margin for Growth initiative impacts when we get fully back into the black. More on this as the year progresses. Moving down the P&L. First quarter interest expense of $23.7 million increased $2.7 million versus last year. For the full year, we continue to expect interest expense to be in the $95 million to $100 million range. The adjusted tax rate declined in the first quarter to 31.5%. The lower tax rate versus the first quarter of 2016 was driven primarily by a favorable rate differential related to international operations. For the full year, the company anticipates its effective tax rate to be between 27.5% and 28%. This is about 100 basis points lower than our previous outlook as we continue to look at various tax strategies and to secure higher income tax credits. As such, in 2017, other income and expense is expected to be around $55 million. For the first quarter of 2017, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 214.5 million shares, down 3 million versus last year, resulting in adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.31 or an increase of about 19% versus a year ago. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow : At the end of the first quarter, net trading capital increased versus last year \u2013 last year's first quarter by $14 million. Accounts receivable were higher by $52 million due to higher Easter sales. Inventory was higher by $25 million and accounts payable increased by $63 million. Total capital additions, including software, were $33 million in the first quarter. For the full year, we estimate that CapEx will be in the $270 million to $290 million range. During the first quarter, adjusted depreciation and amortization was $65 million, and we paid $128 million in dividends. The company did not repurchase any common shares against the $500 million share repurchase authorization approved in January 2016. There is $100 million remaining on this authorization. Additionally, we did not repurchase any shares in connection with the issuance of stock options. Now to summarize. The Margin for Growth Program is on track and progressing. We continue to forecast strong productivity and cost savings initiatives in 2017, and don't expect input cost inflation. Over the remainder of the year, we're focused on driving our North America core brands forward and achieving trial and repeat targets related to new product launches such as Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch, Reese's and Hershey's Crunchers and Reese's Crunchy Cookie Cup. We expect non-seasonal U.S. CMG trends to improve although the growth rate is slightly lower than our previous forecast. As a result, for the full year 2017, we estimate full year net sales growth around the low end of the 2% to 3% range, including a net benefit from acquisitions of about 0.5 points. We expect the impact of foreign currency exchange rates to be minimal versus our previous estimate of a 25 basis point headwind. As I stated earlier, we expect adjusted gross margin expansion to be greater than our previous estimate. Additionally, our brands typically respond positively to marketplace investment, and we expect that advertising and related consumer marketing expense as well as SG&A will increase for the full year 2017 versus 2016. Combined with the lower tax rate, we expect 2017 adjusted earnings per share diluted to be towards the high end of the 7% to 9% range. Before we open it up to Q&A, just a couple of thoughts on the second quarter. Given the timing of Easter and the expected lower sales in China, second quarter net sales growth is expected to be lower than the full year growth rate. In Q2, we're targeting investment tax credit expense that flows through the other income and expense line to be about $10 million. And that should result in a second quarter tax rate of about 26%. Additionally, Q2 advertising and related consumer marketing is expected to increase mid to high single digits on a percentage basis versus last year. Therefore, we expect the Q2 increase in EPS to be lower than the full year EPS growth rate. Thank you for your time this morning, and we'll now take any questions you may have. Operator : We'll take our first question from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, thank you, everyone. Question \u2013 two for me. First, you've reduced your sales guidance, raised your gross margin guidance. Thank you, I appreciate some of the color you gave on the call today about that. I'm just curious maybe if you could help us bucket how much of that change in terms of the increase in the gross margin or maybe I guess the decrease in the COGS is due to cost savings versus maybe some commodity costs like dairy coming in maybe a bit more favorably than what you were looking for. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Patricia, do you want to handle that one? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. The overall year-over-year increase is primarily driven by the efficiency and cost savings initiatives that our supply chain is delivering for us in COGS. The change between what we gave guidance to you on a few weeks ago, the biggest driver of that is the lower expectations around input cost inflation. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Follow-up for me would be, last week, and I know they've talked about this before, but CVS has been discussing a little more aggressively moving some candy away from their checkouts. I appreciate Hershey's, there are some offsets there in terms of what Hershey can add to the front of store and so forth. And I'm just curious a little bit how you're looking at the risk of other customers may be following CVS' footsteps, or maybe you're thinking this is more of a one-off situation. Just trying to get some of your thoughts on what's happening there. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Absolutely. So as you know, we work closely with all of our retail customer partners. And I think we mentioned last July that we were partnering with CVS on some of the work that they were doing around evolving their store layouts. And we partner with all of our retailers along those lines. And March 1st, we mentioned a different customer we're also working with those efforts on. I guess how I would tell you to think about it is, we service a broad range of retail customers. They all have very different strategies. And as some of our customer partners are making certain decisions on portfolio regarding store layout or front end, we have other of our customer partners who are actually looking to add incremental space behind confection, who are looking to take some other non-durable goods off the front end and put increased consumables and edibles; either overall at the front of store or as they have built their self checkouts and they hadn't yet built impulse around those. So we feel good about the growth we're seeing in the marketplace in indulgent categories. And if you look at the growth in categories, in indulgence and better-for-you, we're seeing growth across both and we have several customers who are really looking to leverage that growth. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. We'll move next to David Driscoll of Citi. Your line is open. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you so much. Good morning. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Good morning, David. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: I wanted to ask about the revenue guidance. If the April year-to-date is expected to be at 2.5%, then maybe I'm just curious why guide to the low end of the 2% to 3%. Why guide to the 2% number? Said differently, if the full year average is 2%, doesn't that mean like the second half of the year would need to be something like 1.5% in order to kind of weight it out? And basically, this just comes down to why do you expect this to be a slowdown from this 2.5% rate of growth that you talked about year-to-date through April? Thank you. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Thanks, David. No, I would say two things. First of all, if you think about year-to-date, a large part of the acceleration of growth was driven by Easter. So, Easter is a big piece of what you see year-to-date. At the same time, we really look at the impact of the slowdown that we saw in the total box in Q1. And we saw that have an impact on everyday. So as we look at the balance of the year, we are looking for our everyday business to accelerate. And we believe that that takes to make for the back half of the year is very achievable. We'll be looking at ensuring we have adequate investments. So we'll actually have some higher levels of spending in the back part of the year to drive that acceleration in the form of advertising. And we feel good about that. But a lot of it is that Easter, the big boost in Easter and we really are looking and calling for an acceleration of everyday as we go into the back part of the year. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Growe of Stifel. Your line is open. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, good morning. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Good morning. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning. I just have two quick ones. One is just a follow-up to David's question. When you look at the 2.5% year-to-date sales growth through April, could you disaggregate that between like seasonal growth and non-seasonal growth, kind of, how is it going year-to-date? If you did that already, I'm sorry I missed that. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. If you \u2013 without getting in too many specifics, if you think about that year-to-date performance, you would see seasonal items grew about double digits. So think about that in that double-digit range. And if you look at our non-seasonal core power brands, kind of the biggest five brands, they were up mid-single digits. So, obviously, there was a little bit of softness across some of the non-core piece of our portfolio. But really double-digit growth on seasonal is what's a big component of 2.5%. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then just to... Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.: This was all planned to be the driver of Q1 no matter how the box started the year. I think looking out over the remaining parts of the year and where the in-store merchandising and programming from S'mores to the innovation, that all comes the remainder of the way. So I think we feel pretty good about that. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up then on the level as SM&A that's down in the quarter. So when I see advertising flat, trade promotion down and then SM&A overall down. I guess what you're telling me is that in Q2 it's going to start to pick up. So as I think about this being more of a reinvestment year, it sounds like that really starts in earnest in the second quarter. Is that the right way to look at that? So SM&A probably will be up as a percentage of sales? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Yes, that's right. So in the first quarter, trade was down as we lapped some incremental trade merchandising that we had shared with you last year. We made some big investments in incremental trade. And as we have constantly worked to optimize our blend across trade and advertising, we made some different decisions this year. And yes, our advertising expense was closer to flat in Q1. And as we go out to the balance of the year, we'll see increases. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you for the time. Operator : We'll take our next question from Alexia Howard of Bernstein. Your line is open. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good morning, everyone. Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.: Good morning, Alexia. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Two really short ones on the input costs side of things. Are you already starting to see some deflation on the cocoa side within that or is it other ingredients that you're seeing release on? And then on price realization in the U. S., you've obviously got good price realization this quarter with the cutback in promotional spending. Do you anticipate that, that will continue throughout the year even if competition steps up and maybe given further deflation on the input cost side? Thank you and I'll pass it on. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Thanks, Alexia, it's Patricia. Let me talk about the input cost first. So, as you know, we hedge a number of our input costs, our commodity basket out somewhere between 3 months and 24 months. We don't hedge all of them. There a few commodities for which there is not a good market to do that and those obviously flow-through directly in the year. So it's a mix of both of the pieces that you're talking about. And that's what we're seeing come through that allowed us to raise our gross margin guidance. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And then on the pricing? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: On the price realization, you definitely saw the biggest impact of that in the first quarter. As Michele said, we're lapping some heavier direct trades that we put in, in the U.S. We're also not seeing a repeat of a lot of trade and recurrent discounts and allowances that we had in China last year. So the biggest impact of that price realization is absolutely in the first quarter and we would expect it to moderate over the rest of the year. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. I'll pass it on. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Your line is open. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning everybody. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Just two things. One, with your margin targets that you laid out at the Analyst Day going out to 2019. I know you've given some pieces here and there to help put it together. But if we take it sort of all in and we think about how that margin comes through in either from gross margin versus SG&A. Just trying to get a better sense of holistically whether it's more heavily weighted out to 2019 between one or the other or fairly equal? And then just curious if some of the lower tax rate you've talked about, given some of the reorganizations you're doing. Is that thought to be more sustainable going forward as well? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: I'll go ahead and tackle those. So what we said is that we would expect improvement in our operating margin to be about half COGS and about half SG&A. And we're on track to continue to deliver that. Yes, I would expect that, overall, the tax rate, all things being equal in the tax world to be sustainable going forward. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning. Thanks, everyone. I guess just to follow up on some of the snack, sort of the snackfection initiatives that you have had in place for the past few quarters, perhaps if you could just give us an update on the momentum of KRAVE and barkTHINS. And given some of the weakness you saw in non-seasonal and the confectionery part of the portfolio, how immune were takeaway trends in these adjacent categories to the broader weakness that we saw across food industry in Q1? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: So, we have continued to see some very strong growth on barkTHINS as we are still in the process of driving against expanding distribution and gaining trial amongst consumers on that franchise. So, I would say given the big piece of the growth curve that we're on, on that business; we've continued to see very strong growth there. And I think we mentioned that it was a pretty significant piece of growth for us in Q1. And as I look at KRAVE, we're continuing to feel good about the momentum that we are seeing there. So we've continued to gain share. We feel good about where velocities are. Like any new brand, we're learning in terms of really optimizing how we make sure that we drive that hardest in the right \u2013 to the right consumers and into the right channels. So, in some cases, we overextended distribution, and we've right-sized that a bit. But we continued to see very nice growth there. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks Michele. Operator : We'll take our next question from Rob Moskow of Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, thanks. I just wanted to try to get a sense of how aggressive the assumptions are for back half growth in North America. A couple of headwinds I thought I saw was, unlike in the first half, where you were shipping ahead of consumption, you're probably going to ship behind consumption in the back half, because you're up against a December launch from the Cookie Layer Crunch item? And then the second element, I guess, I would raise is, it requires every day confectionery to start reaccelerating. And I think it also seems to imply that the non-core piece also gets better, too. Is that correct that all those things kind of have to happen and to what degree? Is it \u2013 does your consumption have to improve also? Or can the consumption kind of continue on at 2.5 points in the first half and 2.5 points in the second half. That's a lot of questions, but I hope you can help. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: So \u2013 yeah. Our consumption and retail takeaway does not have to be at 2.5 points. So we're actually planning for the takes to make there to be less than that, closer to slightly below 2 points. Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.: More in line with the takes to make. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Yeah, exactly. In line with the takes to make on that sales end. And we anticipate that generally, our net sales and our takeaway are directionally pretty in line. So you're right that we had a big benefit in shipments in Q4 behind Cookie Layer Crunch. But as we look out to the back half of the year, across all the quarters, we think that we'll be relatively in line, plus or minus in that 0.5 point range. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got you. Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Baumgartner of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. Michele, I'm wondering if you could speak a bit more on the top line algorithm in terms of the net pricing contribution? I think since the start, we've seen Hershey's implement a sizable list price increase every few years. But it seems that now trade promotion is becoming a larger component. And looking at the price points of some of the recent launches, mix is also now a much larger factor as well. So as you think about those levers on pricing, list prices, the mix, the trade support, how is the category or consumer changing, and maybe what are your analysts telling you about managing that balance going forward? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. That's a great question. I mean, obviously, we can't speak directly to pricing or any kind of foreshadowing around the pricing piece. But I would say that we think about all of those as very viable levers and probably even more so today than we did in the past. So I think you're right that price mix is something we aggressively have our teams focused on, which we can drive through, focus on pack-types, focus on channels, build it into the innovation. And I think perhaps that's a lever that we have not used as aggressively in the past. We've spoken to you before about our whole focus on strategic revenue growth management and a lot of that as well is about really maximizing that net price realization by really, really scrutinizing all of the investments we make in trade and getting the value equation right on every pack-type and brand. So, we're putting more focus there than we have in the past. Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. And I'd add if you remember on March 1st that we talked about 2018, and we just talked about looking at the most productive SKUs and do we need to have all these different pack-types out there. We said, no. It could be a little bit of a headwind in 2018. We're, actually \u2013 there's a little bit in 2017 less than what we had expected from 2018. But to your point, that's how we're thinking about it. John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. So, maybe just to build on that. In terms of the cognizance around the year-to-date softness in your non-core brands thus far. Is that softness more a function of reduced brand support on your end, or maybe just managing that as expected, or is it more of a change in consumer preferences where these drags are continuing for the non-core part of the portfolio? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Well, I guess I'd say if I think about the first part of the year, I'd look and say Easter drove a lot of sales. And there is some sourcing from Easter across the base portfolio. So, I think it's hard to look just at the everyday business trends because there's interaction there with Easter. Certainly, I feel good about the fact that we have increased consumer investment as we go into the rest of the year, because we know that our category is very responsive. We continue to get very strong lift, and I feel really good that that combined with the very strong innovation that we have this year and customers are very excited about consumers are \u2013 are really going to help to drive consumers to the category and really boost the everyday business. John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Pablo Zuanic of Susquehanna International Group. Your line is open. Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thank you. Just two questions. First up, can you comment on your exposure to the border adjustment tax either in terms of what percent of your sales in the U.S. or Mexico, or what percent of COGS come from outside the U.S. and contingency plans that you could have around that, please? And then the second question, are there any plans for J. P. Bilbrey to become a member of the Hershey Trust Board? Thanks. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Hi, Pablo, it's Patricia. I'll answer that. We continue to stay very close in monitoring all the proposals for tax reform out there. In terms of the border adjustment tax, specifically, the vast majority, over 85% of our U.S. product is sourced here in the U.S. We really want to do that to provide the freshest product sourced closest to our consumer. And that's an important part of satisfying our customer and our consumer. As I said, we keep close look at all of our responses that would happen to any kind of tax reform. Frankly, without any details out there, it's hard to know what we would actually do. But we have a lot of contingency plans in the event that something does come out. In terms of your question about J.P., no, we would never comment on the Trust. That's a separate entity from us. Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Right. And I just have a very quick follow-up. Regarding last week's announcements about all these adjustments you are making in terms of low-calorie in the various products that you sell. Would you say that these concerns are bigger than they were \u2013 with the consumer are bigger than they were one year ago or five years ago, or is it just this part continuing? It's just there seems to be a bigger issue now with the consumer than before. But correct me if I'm wrong. Thanks. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: So I would say, Pablo, we continue to see, if you at look category growth of various snack categories across the store that there is strong growth. There's growth in indulgence and there's also growth in health and wellness. So I don't know that I see a greater acceleration. We always start with the consumer in mind. And we are delighted to delight consumers with our indulgent portfolio. At the same time, we've been a leader in choice and transparency, and we always want to provide options to consumers. Now our Hershey's Kiss was one of the first forms of portion control at 25 calories for a Kiss. We led the smart labeling initiative in the industry. So we are just constantly evolving and updating our portfolio to help to meet consumer needs as best possible. Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Your line is open. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, good morning, everyone. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Good morning. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I'm not sure if I caught this or if you said this earlier. So if you have, forgive me. But I guess in terms of just total snacking in North America in the first quarter, appreciate your comments about the CMG category and the non-seasonal maybe being a little softer than you thought. But was total snacking also just sort of softer in 1Q than you expected? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Yes, it was. It was consistent with the total box. If you look at every category in the box, the trend was the same across the board. And as we mentioned in the comments, we think that there \u2013 I think everybody's been looking to say, okay, what was that factor that really drove that across the board, and common thinking tends to be the tax refund delay had a big impact. There were some lapping issues on a year-to-year basis. And then there's some continued pressures. But we feel good that we still see a rebound in March really. And we are focused on watching that very closely going forward. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. That's what I was just going to follow up on. It seems as we've gone through this reporting cycle, even Pepsi earlier today. It seems like it was better coming out of the quarter. Again just thinking about total snacking not specific categories, but it did seem like it improved coming out of the first quarter. And I guess that's what underlies your sort of confidence that it gets better throughout the rest of the year? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Yes. And dollars per trip were actually up in March after having been down. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: So yes. We have started to see that rebound and agree with that. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then just one last one for me. In terms of the Easter holiday sales, was there any notable impact at all from a change in channel mix or sales from e-commerce? Is there anything that you've begun to see there where more of the sales might have shifted to online than previous years? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: No. Nothing that we saw there at all. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steven Strycula of UBS Securities. Your line is open. Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : Hi, good morning, guys. Two quick questions for you. The first would be on China. If I'm listening to Patricia's comments accurately, I think that the gross sales in China for the year sounds like Hershey \u2013 you're forecasting to lose implicit market share in China. If that is the case, can you clarify whether that's to local or multinational brands? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Thanks. Yeah, we are anticipating lower gross sales in China. And that would be a combination of competitive activity but also the overall impulse category in China and the way that's being addressed by the modern trade in particular. As Michele has laid out, we have a lot of change going on in our go-to-market model in China, looking at different brands, distribution models, cities, channels. And we expect that that will have some impact in our business in China for the rest of the year. Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And a quick follow-up would be for the other expense and income item. What are you expecting that to be for the full year? You said the second quarter should be about $10 million. Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.: We said around $55 million. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: $55 million. Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Got you. All right. thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Just one question on sources of growth in the U.S. It looks like if you look at the data, the chocolate continues to be a key driver for you and you're getting very good contribution and have continued to do this from Reese's and now doing so with line extensions. And you're getting nice smaller contributions from snack, mix is great, barkTHINS and a drag perhaps from non-chocolate candy. Do you see the general growth drivers remaining the same through the year? And what is your outlook to maybe improve the things that aren't working for you and improve upon maybe tough comparisons for Reese's and other? Thanks. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Thanks for the question. Yeah, we continue to feel really good with the programs that we have on the core brands. And so I think in terms of the continuing the growth on something like Reese's, it is continuing the news. And some of our incremental investments in advertising towards the back part of the year will be made against those core brands to continue to leverage the momentum. And then at the same time, we are absolutely focused on turning around and accelerating our growth trajectory on some of the other pieces of portfolio, namely on the non-chocolate sweets area. So we will be increasing our investment there. Although at the same time, we've right-sized those brands a bit. So as Mark mentioned, SKU rationalization, there are some areas where we have extended those brands and we had items in the marketplace that just weren't productive or profitable. And so we made a decision to take the hit on pulling back on some of that. But we do have teams very focused on accelerating the growth there. And I think that's an opportunity for us going forward. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Is your thinking on non-chocolate confectionery that that's simply not as well-positioned as some of your other categories and there's sort of a tip of the hat to the consumer trends in the day? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: No. I don't really think it's not as well-positioned. I would say, I think that we have opportunities to just fix our execution on that piece of the portfolio. There was a little bit more competition from smaller players last year where they went really aggressively on price. Some of the things that we weren't willing to do given our focus on margin. So I really think it's more about what we do versus that there's any kind of consumer trend issue there. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Edge. Your line is open. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Thanks very much. Just a follow-up, kind of, detailed question and another detailed question. Do you ship any Easter at all in Q2, because I know when I go back to the quarter with the exact same calendar split in 2014, it looks like you shipped some Easter in Brazil in Q2, and that was 20 days in the second quarter. Now you have 16 days in the second quarter. If you could kind of clarify that. And if there's any shipment impact at all to Easter from it moving later? And second question, if you don't mind, is how much of what's going on in China, you talked about, you took some PP&E write-down and this coincides with the ramp up of this Malaysia plant. Do any of those PP&E write-downs relate to the Malaysia plant costs? And how much, if you could \u2013 anyway of giving us a ballpark of how much of the absorption cost of that plant, which are presumably at below plant capacity, impacting gross margin on the quarter? Thank you. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Sure. So, let me start, and then I'll transfer it over to Patricia. There is almost no \u2013 there is no shipment impact from that timing of Easter. I mean, we shipped almost nothing in terms of Easter into the second quarter. So that's not an issue at all. And relative to the write-offs, we feel great about Malaysia. So the write-offs that we talked about are not at all related to Malaysia. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: And in terms of the cost base, that came online April 1st of last year. So that impact will be getting smaller going forward or really going away in terms of fixed cost absorption. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : So you already would have taken the \u2013 I guess most pain for that that wouldn't really be a possibility going forward? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. It's all in the base now. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Okay. Operator : Thank you. We'll take a follow-up question from Rob Moskow of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Just a quick one about second quarter. I think you said it's your tougher comp on the revenue side also. I know its North America in particular has a tough comparison. Is it possible that revenue for the overall company would go negative in second quarter, or do you still think you're in positive territory? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. We still feel good that we're in positive territory. Yeah, the quarters always come in a little bit different depending on the promotion and innovation calendar. But there's nothing that we'd be fallen off that kind of a cliff in the second quarter. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it. All right. Thank you. Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.: Well, great. That's all we have operator. We'll thank everybody for joining us for today's call, and we'll be available for any follow up questions you may have. Operator : We do have a follow up if you're available. Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.: Okay. Well, patch in. Operator, thank you. Operator : Very good. We do have a question from Kenneth Zaslow of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open, sir. Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): He, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I'll keep it short. On China, can you guys just talk about what is the key steps and timeline for us to get a better understanding of which markets you're going to go into? And how are you going to assess that situation? Can you talk about how we're going to be thinking about this in the timeline? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: So as part of our Margin for Growth and Margin Expansion Program, we've started immediately in terms of taking the necessary steps to reset our investment in that marketplace and make some of the tough decisions. At the same time, the local teams have built very focused plans in terms of where we are focusing to grow and build a sustainable business model. So we are focused on multiyear program. But beginning now to really focus on a couple of key provinces on our core portfolio and on a profitable mix of brands across the portfolio. As you all know, the cost structure in some of the channels in China have changed and so we are shifting to more profitable channels and really try to capture some of the growth both in the second and third tier cities as well as e-commerce. So it's a multi-year program that's underway now and I'd say we can continue to update you as the year goes on. Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Do you plan on letting us into the information as you kind of feel like which cities, which avenues, which products or is it going to be one of the things we'll see in the results as they come? I just don't know what's the timing and how we should think about the strategy there? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. I mean, I think for competitive purposes, we prefer not to go into all of the details. But we can give some thoughts to you, what we can share that might help you as you're building your model. Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): And just my final question on China. The online side of it. How \u2013 what type of infrastructure do you have? Is that enough to offset some of the weaknesses across the other part of it and how do you see that growing over the next two years to three years? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: We see \u2013 we've done very well with online e-commerce in China. As it's a big piece of the marketplace, it's been a nice growth driver for our business. We've continued to see nice growth there and it is clearly amongst the channels, probably our number one area of focus from a channel perspective in that marketplace. So we have \u2013 we've built some infrastructure and that will continue to be a place that we'll want to invest in China going forward as in the U.S. Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. I appreciate. Thank you. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Okay. Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.: Thanks so much for joining us today. And like I said earlier, we're available for any follow-up questions you may have. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's Hershey Company's First Quarter 2017 Results Conference Call. You may now all disconnect your lines, and everyone have a great day.",

Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Operator : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to The Hershey Company's Second Quarter 2017 Results Conference Call. My name is Keith, and I'll be your conference operator today. All participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. This call is scheduled to end at about 9 :30 AM, so please limit yourself to one question so we can get to as many of you as possible. And please note this call may be recorded. Thank you. It's my pleasure to turn your conference over to Mr. Mark Pogharian. Please go ahead, sir. Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.: Thank you, Keith. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to The Hershey Company's second quarter 2017 conference call. Michele Buck, President and CEO; and Patricia Little, Senior Vice President and CFO, will provide you with an overview of results, which will then be followed by a Q&A session. Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2016 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income, prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the Note section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. As a result, we will discuss second quarter 2017 results excluding net pre-tax charges of $28.9 million, or $0.14 per share-diluted, which are primarily related to business realignment cost and derivative mark-to-marketing losses. These charges are defined in the appendix of this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website at www.TheHersheyCompany.com. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges. And with that out of the way, let me turn the call over to Michele Buck. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Thanks, Mark, and good morning to all of you on the phone and webcast. Hershey's second quarter results were solid, with particular strength in market share and EPS delivery. And we made solid progress against the initiatives that we discussed with you earlier this year. I was pleased with our innovation performance and solid second quarter U.S. retail takeaway of 4%, driven both by our core brands and Easter, where we gained 1.6 market share points in this important season. Constant currency net sales increased 1.8% and were greater than our previous estimate, driven by the timing of new stand-up packaging as well as distributor changes by several customers. Gross margin was up nicely in Q2, and we continue to expect it to increase around 50 basis points for the full year. This will enable us to maintain investments in initiatives that should benefit the company in the near and long-term and drive future growth. Adjusted EPS of $1.09 was greater than our previous estimate, due to higher sales, gross margin expansion and the timing of advertising and related marketing investments versus our forecast. We continue to expect that full year advertising and related marketing will increase versus last year. The Margin for Growth Program we discussed on March 1st is progressing nicely. And we believe the benefit in 2017 will be a little bit better than our initial thoughts. Importantly, year-to-date adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS increased 13% and 23%, respectively. This puts us in a position to deliver solid full-year EPS growth at the high-end of our 7% to 9% range, while also enabling important investment in the business. Our core power chocolate brands, Reese's, Hershey's, Kit Kat and Kisses, continue to perform well, with retail takeaway up 6% and market share up 1 full point year-to-date. Nielsen's second quarter measures do not encompass the entire Easter season in both the year-ago and current periods. Therefore, the majority of my remarks today will refer to year-to-date marketplace performance for the 24 weeks ended July 8, 2017. Year-to-date, CMG, that's candy, mint and gum, category growth in the xAOC+C-store channels, was up 1%. Importantly, within the chocolate and non-chocolate candy segment, where we derive the majority of our U.S. sales, year-to-date category growth is about 2.1%. Turning to Hershey takeaway, total Hershey U.S. retail takeaway for the year-to-date period through July 8, 2017, was up 1.4%, driven by solid CMG growth of 2%. This more than offset some softness in grocery items such as baking chips and syrup, as well as lapping last year's successful snacks performance. Our year-to-date CMG market share was up 0.3 points, resulting in a market-leading share position of 31%. Importantly, our CMG non-seasonal retail takeaway and market share adjusted for Easter cannibalization increased. Year-to-date, xAOC+C-store chocolate category growth was plus 2.3%. Hershey's xAOC+C-store chocolate retail takeaway was plus 2.9%, resulting in a chocolate market share gain of 0.3 points. While we feel good about the progress we've made and strong market share gains, our year-to-date takeaway is lower than we anticipated, driven by the challenges we are seeing broadly across the total box. As a result, we have updated our full-year net sales forecast to reflect this change in shopping patterns and behavior that will most likely continue over the remainder of the year. We have good visibility into our second half seasonal orders and have strong consumer support that we expect will drive second half retail takeaway of about 1%. This will outpace second half net sales, which we estimate will be around the same as the year-ago period, due to the second quarter timing I mentioned earlier. Our response and go-to-market strategy in this fast-changing retail environment must continue to evolve. Work is underway to determine how to further leverage our advantaged capabilities and knowledge to enable us to deliver the consistent top-line growth that we expect from our business. We believe the CMG and broader snack wheel will continue to outperform the center of the plate shelf-stable part of the store. CMG and snacks have inherent advantages such as impulsivity, seasons and multiple pack types for usage occasions. This facilitates merchandising and display within different parts of the box where there is foot traffic, like the perimeter and check-out. We will keep building on our expertise as we continue to encounter greater levels of competitive snacks innovation and related in-store merchandising and programming. So we're focusing on three areas of our business that we control where we can drive growth. One, CMG and snacks innovation; consistently delivering meaningful, sustainable, candy and snacks innovation on an annual basis is an important lever of our overall growth algorithm. We're testing products and concepts from the snacks demand landscape work, and we're encouraged with the early results. The demand work is also pointing to an opportunity around branding. Our core candy brands have appealed to other snack consumers. However, there remains an opportunity to more effectively target this group. We'll leverage this work in the near future and look forward to sharing the insights with you. Leading this effort will be Mary Beth West, who joined Hershey in May as our new Senior Vice President and Chief Growth Officer. Mary Beth will oversee the company's growth strategy, including insights and analytics, strategy, innovation, R&D and M&A. She is an accomplished leader who is considered one of the best food executives and marketers in the industry. Her deep experience in growing some of the world's best-known consumer brands and demonstrated ability to transform consumer engagement will be a tremendous asset to Hershey as we chart our growth agenda. Two, we're accelerating our efforts in collaboration with key brick-and-mortar retailers related to their click-and-collect and omni-channel initiatives, as well as with established e-commerce players. This is a fast-evolving and continuously-changing space. And we're partnering on digital front-end design to drive category and Hershey growth. We are making investments over our strategic planning cycle that we believe will lead to solutions to ensure that Hershey and the category remain top-of-mind with consumers, no matter where and how they shop. The build-out of this strategy should help ensure that we have a compelling message and product that connects with the consumers of our major retail partners in all channels. Our absolute annual e-commerce net sales dollars are small, low single digits on a percentage basis, but it's the fastest-growing platform of our business. As shopping and consumption patterns change, there's been an acceleration of online snacks purchases in 2017. We're expanding and further developing our e-commerce CMG and snacks business. We have a dedicated cross-functional team responsible for the strategies and execution of our e-commerce plans that report directly to Todd Tillemans, President of our U.S. Commercial Group. Within our supply chain, initiatives are underway to create more efficient pack types and packaging to accommodate the needs of e-commerce and click-and-collect retailers. And we'll leverage the learnings from our digital and social marketing teams with the goal of converting every consumer connection into a purchase opportunity. The seasonal component of our core business gives us an opportunity to engage with consumers and potentially leverage this into subscription or occasion-based purchases. While we have come a long way, we believe we're still in the very early innings, with a long runway of opportunity ahead of us in the e-commerce space. Three, we need to leverage and commercially-activate the incremental consumer data that is becoming increasingly available due to technology advancements. We have advantaged capabilities today; however, we need to continue to develop them. Our analytics and consumer insights have historically focused on traditional methodologies based on qualitative and quantitative shopper feedback. Predictive analytics, machine learning and big data sets to identify candy and snack growth opportunities is getting better. And we're constantly exploring how to leverage and further our capabilities using this technology. So there are a lot of exciting growth initiatives under way that we believe will help ensure Hershey remains a top quartile performance. Now, for an update on our International and Other segment, we are driving growth while meaningfully improving profitability. Excluding China, our International and Other segment constant currency net sales are expected to increase mid-single digits this year. We're making measured investments in our core markets of Mexico, Brazil and India, where we're seeing solid marketplace gains while improving on operating income trends. Net sales for the quarter were greater than our estimate, although on a constant currency basis, slightly lower versus the second quarter of 2016. Mexico and Brazil continue to deliver against plan and achieved constant currency net sales growth in Q2 of a combined 12%. And in India, where we have evolved our portfolio, shifting to higher-margin value-added products to strengthen our business model. We're sharing these learnings with our team in China, who's focused on doing the same. In the second quarter, implementation of the Margin for Growth Program in China commenced. We have begun to optimize the manufacturing operations and the related support functions as we strike the right balance between in-country investments and near-term market opportunities. China chocolate category sales sequentially improved from Q1 to Q2, increasing plus 1.9%. Small format stores continue to show growth and more than offset hypermarket softness, resulting in a year-to-date chocolate category growth of about 0.5%. Our e-commerce team continues to make progress, and we estimate that our online market share increased 0.6 points in Q2 to 8.6%. Going forward, we have a disciplined strategy in China that is focused on effective Hershey brand messaging, continued e-commerce penetration and smaller store format expansion to enable us to capture the opportunity in this emerging market. Now to wrap-up, we're making progress against the many growth initiatives we outlined when we were with you on March 1st. In the second half of this year, we're lapping a solid comp versus the year-ago period. However, we have a lot of innovation and activity, including the continued rollout of Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch bars, the late Q2 launch of Reese's and Hershey's Crunchers Candy and Reese's Crunchy Cookie Cups, as well as solid Halloween and holiday plans, all of which should enable us to achieve our goals. We have much work to do. And there are always refinements along the way, especially now, given the consumer and retail environment seems to be changing at an accelerated pace. With this change, I see tremendous opportunity, opportunity to evolve our business model, to advance our capabilities to new heights, and to create new vectors to unlock future growth. As evidenced by the market share gains of our core chocolate products, our brands resonate with consumers in an increasingly competitive environment. Consumers have an emotional connectivity to this category. And when combined with our go-to-market capabilities and knowledge, I feel we're positioned nicely for future growth in measured and evolving non-measured outlets. The Margin for Growth Program should provide us with the fuel to invest in the initiatives that we believe will create long-term value for our shareholders. We'll continue to invest in our brands and in the capabilities that give us a competitive edge at retail and with consumers. We believe our margins are sustainable and are forecasted to increase over a strategic planning cycle. And our strong operating cash flow gives us many options to grow our business and reward shareholders. I'll now turn it over to Patricia, who will provide you details on our financial results. Patricia? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Thank you, Michele. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Second quarter net sales of $1.66 billion increased 1.5% versus last year. This was greater than the estimate we spoke to you about in April, due to the timing of some customer shipments that Michele discussed earlier. As implied in April, we did not expect a big acceleration in Q2 from a net sales and retail takeaway perspective, given the late Easter and the lapping of successful new product launches like Kit Kat Big Kat and Reese's Pieces Cups in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings per share-diluted came in at $1.09, an increase of about 28% versus last year, driven by the higher sales, by solid gross margin expansion, OI improvements in the International and Other segment, driven by our Margin for Growth Program savings, which are coming in a little faster than we anticipated, a decline in corporate expenses and a reduction in the year-over-year tax rate that was in line with our estimate. Excluding unfavorable foreign currency translation of 0.3 points, net sales increased 1.8% versus the year-ago period. Volume was a 1.2 point contribution to sales growth, and net price realization was a 0.1 point favorable. The barkTHINS acquisition was a 50 basis point benefit in the second quarter and is relatively on track with our plans. By segment, North America net sales increased 2.2% versus the same period last year. Excluding Canada's unfavorable foreign currency translation of 0.3 points, net sales increased 2.5% versus the year-ago period. Volume was a 1.7 point contribution and net price realization was a 0.2 points favorable. The barkTHINS acquisition was a 60 basis point benefit. Given the level of competitive activity in the CMG category and the timing of innovation and promotions impacting year-over-year comparability, we were pleased with our U.S. market share performance. However, similar to trends experienced by the broader U.S. food group, 2Q CMG category growth and Hershey retail takeaway was less than our forecast. The company forecasts growth in U.S. retail takeaway and market share in the second half of the year, despite the broader industry retail challenges that are expected to persist. Due to the timing of some Q2 shipments, our net sales in the second half of the year are expected to be about the same as a year ago. As is typically the case, the company expects full-year U.S. retail takeaway and net sales growth to be similar. Total International and Other segment net sales for the second quarter decreased 3.6% versus last year. Excluding the 10 basis point impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange, International and Other segment net sales decreased 3.5% versus the year-ago period. Volume was off 2.1 points, due to planned declines in China and net price realization was a 1.4 point headwind. Turning to margins, adjusted gross margin of 47.1% increased 160 basis points in the second quarter, driven primarily by lower input costs and supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives. This more than offset unfavorable sales mix and a slight increase in obsolescence. For the full year, we continue to expect adjusted gross margin to increase about 50 basis points, driven by lower input costs, greater than our previous estimate, and by productivity and cost savings initiatives. This is expected to offset second half fixed costs volume absorption due to lower sales, unfavorable product mix and the rollout of new packaging formats. Adjusted operating profit in the second quarter increased about 16.9% versus the year-ago period, resulting in operating profit margin of 20.8%, an increase of 270 basis points. The increase was driven by the higher gross profit and lower SG&A due to productivity and cost savings, both at the corporate level and in China, driven by our Margin for Growth Program. Total advertising and related consumer marketing expense was about the same as the second quarter of 2016. Our forecast back in April called for mid to high single digits percentage increase. However, given the retail environment, the forecasted second quarter increase in advertising and related consumer marketing expense is now planned to occur in the second half of the year. The company continues to expect that full-year advertising and related consumer marketing will increase in 2017. Now, let me provide a brief update on our International and Other segment. On a constant currency basis, net sales declined 3.5% versus last year, although revenue performance was slightly better than our forecast. Michele discussed our China operations, but let me add that I'm very pleased with the Margin for Growth Program work that is underway. While this has pressured sales, the rightsizing of the cost base is beginning to come through at the operating income level. Looking at our other focus markets, we continue to execute against our plans in Mexico, Brazil and India, where combined constant currency net sales in these three countries increased 10%; more on this in a minute. Second quarter International and Other segment operating income of $8.4 million increased nicely, driven by the implementation of the Margin for Growth Program. As we stated previously, we are driving a strong profit-focused mentality in this segment and are beginning to see the bottom-line trend improve in 2017. And we now expect International and Other segment operating income to be around the breakeven area for the year. In Mexico, chocolate progress continues, with solid double-digit retail takeaway that is in line with chocolate category growth. Q2 constant currency net sales in Mexico increased 17%, driven by a combination of volume and pricing. Sales were strong across key brands, particularly Kisses and Hershey's chocolates and Hershey's milk drink box. Our new Hershey's CHOCOYOGO product is off to a good start. We continue to build distribution in the modern trade, with repeat purchases and market share tracking with our estimates. In Brazil, our team is focused on profitable growth, despite the challenging operating environment. Q2 constant currency net sales increased by 3%, driven by about 6 points of pricing. We estimate that year-to-date, chocolate category growth in Brazil is about 10%. Our retail takeaway was about 2.5 times the category growth rate, fueled by both distribution gains and higher velocities, resulting in a market share gain of about 40 basis points. We do expect retail takeaway to temper in the second half of the year, due to increasing competitive activity from wait-outs and price-driven activities. Constant currency net sales in India increased about 2% and was in line with our plan. Importantly, growth in the brands we're investing behind, Hershey's branded syrup, spreads and milk booster, as well as Brookside, Jolly Rancher and SOFIT, increased more than 40%. The launch of Brookside, primarily in the modern trade, is progressing and on plan. Our transition of the India portfolio is enabling a higher margin business. And we are on track to expand gross margins here by 1,000 basis points in 2017. This is enabling investments in the marketplace that should result in a sustainable operating model. Moving down the P&L, second quarter interest expense of $24.1 million increased $2.8 million versus last year. For the full year, we continue to expect interest expense to be in the $95 million to $100 million range. As expected, the adjusted tax rate declined in the second quarter to 25%. The rate versus the second quarter of 2016 was driven primarily by a favorable rate differential related to supply chain and international operations, some discrete items, as well as the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 for the accounting of employee share-based payments. For the full year, the company now anticipates its effective rate to be between 26.5% and 27%. This is about 100 basis points lower than our previous outlook, due to the discrete tax items and slightly higher income tax credits. Specifically, in 2017, we expect other income and expense related to the corresponding tax credits to be about $60 million versus our previous estimate of $55 million. For the second quarter of 2017, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 214.6 million shares, in line with last year, resulting in adjusted earnings per share-diluted of $1.09, or an increase of about 28% versus a year ago. Total capital additions, including software, were $51.4 million in the second quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect that CapEx will be in the $270 million to $290 million range. And during the second quarter, adjusted depreciation and amortization was $60 million. In Q2, we paid $128 million in dividend. And earlier today, we announced that we increased the dividend by 6%. The company did not repurchase any common shares against the $500 million share repurchase authorization approved in January, 2016. There is $100 million remaining on this authorization. The company did repurchase $100 million of common shares in the second quarter to replace shares issued in connection with the exercise of stock options. Now to summarize; as Michele stated, we have a lot of activity over the remainder of the year. While our second half of the year profile is not as robust as we'd like, recall that we're lapping our strongest period of quarterly sales growth. Combined with the macroeconomic and consumer challenges at retail, we believe the plans we have in place will enable us to achieve our full-year sales target of around 1%, including the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates of 25 basis points. As I mentioned earlier, we don't expect input cost inflation and continue to forecast adjusted gross margin expansion of about 50 basis points. The Margin for Growth Program is progressing, and we now expect 2017 savings of about $25 million versus our earlier forecast of about $15 million. Additionally, our brands typically respond positively in marketplace investments and we continue to forecast that full-year advertising and related consumer marketing will increase in 2017. Although lower than our previous estimate, SG&A, excluding advertising and related marketing expense, is expected to increase for the full year 2017 versus 2016, as our ERP expense will be ramping up in the second half. Combined with the lower tax rate, we continue to expect 2017 adjusted earnings per share-diluted to be towards the high-end of the 7% to 9% range. Thank you for your time this morning. And we'll now take any questions you may have. Operator : We'll take your first question from Andrew Lazar. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning, everybody. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Good morning, Andrew. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Hi, Andrew. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: My question is on marketing and advertising spend. I guess would you anticipate that the full-year spend that you plan is consistent with what you had initially targeted, just now concentrated in the back half of the year, as opposed to the increase that you thought previously in 2Q? And then, given that your brands in your business historically have been so responsive to the marketing spend, and you've got a lot of new stuff out there like the Cookie Layer Crunch and you've got some EPS flexibility in the 2Q, I guess. I guess I'm curious to get a little more color on why not spend earlier in the year behind some of these initiatives when your brands really are so responsive? Thank you. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: So Andrew, as you know, we are big believers in investment in our brands. It's a key piece of our business model. We are fortunate to participate in a category that is very responsive to investment. So as we look at our investment in advertising and consumer-related spend, our impressions will be up, so we look both at the dollars, but we are also trying to get seated more impact from the dollars we spend. And our impressions will be up comparably both in half two as they were in half one. So even though there was a little bit of shifting in dollars, our spending is definitely in line with what we had forecast for the year; in fact, it's up a bit. And we continue to feel good that what we're getting from that spending is even higher, based on the marketing mix modeling that we're doing. So we're always making trade-offs and balances as we manage the year in terms of where we think we can get the biggest bang for our buck. So we are committed to the dollars, but sometimes we will shift it if we see an opportunity or we have some innovation. We had some in Q2 that actually the ship timing pushed out a little bit further than we anticipated and, therefore, we needed to push out the advertising. So I wouldn't think about it as much as a pull-back of us consciously pulling back on spending, but more making sure that we're getting the most and aligning it to the activity that we have and the quality of copy, et cetera. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Alexia Howard. Please go ahead. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good morning, everyone. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Good morning, Alexia. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Good morning, Alexia. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. So, I guess my main question is you had a pretty hefty and clean beat this quarter versus expectations, yet you're not raising your formal guidance on the EPS range for the year. I know you're saying it's coming in at top-end. Is there anything that's getting tougher going forward than you expected, aside from the uncertainty around the store traffic here in the U.S.? Thank you very much. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. Alexia, I would say there's not any one big thing that we are trying to protect ourselves against. I actually think what we really want to do is make sure that we have the opportunity to invest into this marketplace. There are a lot of new capabilities. We're investing in e-commerce. We've mentioned before continued investments in activating some of the learnings from our demand landscape, work that we're doing around aisle reinvention, packaging updates, investing in emerging brands. So we're really looking at where those vectors upshift in evolution in the marketplace and how do we make sure that we are investing appropriately there and also still able to maintain all those critical investments in the core that drive our profit engine. So that's really what we're trying to do there. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: The other thing I'd add to that, Michele and Alexia, is really what I'm pleased about is that we were able to hold our EPS guidance, given that we took our net sales guidance down. And that really reflects the company's good cost discipline, which is allowing us both to maintain that as well as invest even more in the second half than we planned to. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: I agree. The other thing, Alexia, just as a data point I should point out, ERP is another big investment. And as we look at our investments there, we'll actually be spending twice as much in the second half, behind ERP, as we have in the first half and that's meaningful. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, good morning, folks. Thank you for the question. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Good morning. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Congratulations on a solid first half. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Thank you. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: One thing you highlighted, however, that's concerning is just the ongoing softer-than-expected category growth rates. You also mentioned e-comm, the impulsivity of the category, presumably, ongoing shift to e-comm threatens traffic; maybe it threatens the category with that impulsivity. So in context of the realities of slower category growth and maybe some risk on the forward, I'm surprised that we haven't heard you talk about your strategic focus on diversification to other snacks. So can you shed a little bit more light on where you're going? I know there's chatter or news out there on expansion into ready-to-eat popcorn. Could you just touch on some of the initiatives, whether or not there's a heightened sense of urgency in context to category, and what it means both from an organic and inorganic strategic direction? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Absolutely. So let me start with, first of all, we feel really good about this category and, particularly, about chocolate if you look at the chocolate takeaway numbers that were delivered this year, because the category softness was primarily driven by gum and mint. And, as you know, chocolate is the biggest piece of the category. The way that we think about the business is we need to win with growing customers. Our goal is always to outperform the marketplace and to gain market share, so that if there is softness, we get even more of our growth from market share gains. And we're heavily focused on that because it's our profit engine. At the same time I would tell you, I think about this marketplace as a time where we have a great core business that we're going to continue to drive. And at the same time, we have some opportunities to evolve, to evolve our product and brand portfolio and also to evolve our channel mix to adapt to the changing marketplace. Snacks is important in our strategic agenda. And the way that I think about it is we are a large player in snacks by being number one in the biggest category within snacks. What we now want to do is expand our portfolio so that we can participate in even more snack occasions and ensure that we have the right portfolio and channel development to maximize those opportunities. So I would say it is important. You will see us both doing snacking innovation and also continuing to evaluate and consider M&A as a lever in that growth agenda as well. Our snacking demand landscape that we completed really helps us to lay out and see the future opportunity, both for confection and for snacks to make sure that we're building our portfolio incrementally. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you. I'll pass it on. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Baumgartner. Please go ahead. John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks for the question. Good morning. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Hi, John. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Hi, John. John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Michele, just to continue with the snacking discussion, in the first half in North America, there was a 60 basis point differential in your retail takeaway between the total portfolio and then just the CMG business, which grew faster. So can you speak a bit to some of the performances and observations at KRAVE and barkTHINS in terms of just distribution and competition? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Sure, absolutely. So first of all, we feel great about our core brand CMG performance. As you know, that's really the stable part of our portfolio that is really our profit engine, so feel great about that. As I look at the remainder of our portfolio, I'd say that we saw some pressure in two areas. First of all, baking chips and syrups were softer than anticipated, in line with, I think, what we're seeing in center of the store categories. And then, as we go and look at our portfolio of smaller emerging brands, I would say it's a little bit of a mixed bag. We're really pleased with how barkTHINS is doing. And as we look at some of the rest of the pieces of the portfolio, we've learned a lot since we made the Brookside and KRAVE acquisitions and we're trying to leverage that learning along the way. So we've had to right-size distribution on some of those brands where we think we overextended both the distribution and perhaps the portfolio a bit. So we're really self-correcting on that. And we're applying learnings to make us even more stronger in the marketplace. I would view this piece of the portfolio as one that we expect growth from, but I think it's going to be a little bit lumpier and inconsistent as we leverage big learnings and expand along the way. As part of that snacks portfolio, I would add we feel really good about Snack Mix and those products that we've put in the marketplace, as they've demonstrated a lot of stability and pretty strong growth. John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Thanks, Michele. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Sure. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Driscoll. Please go ahead. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you and good morning. Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.: Hi, David. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Hi, David. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: I had probably just two questions that I wanted to ask. A follow-up here on the sales, so in the most recent Nielsen data, the last two quad weeks, either a month ago, it was up 0.6% and the most recent data, up 2.2%. So it actually looked like things were getting better. So maybe I'm a little surprised that you're thinking net sales will be flat in the back half. And then maybe when you just talk about that a little bit, the strength in this recent Nielsen data and why it does suggest that things flatten out. Can you quantify the impact of the inventory build? And then to Patricia, can you talk about the margins a little bit? I think operating margin's up 210 basis points in the first half. And I think the implied margin would be down 100 basis points to kind of reconcile with where your guidance is. That feels pretty negative, given your comments on Margin for Growth and the very flat commodity environment that we're seeing. Maybe a little bit more discussion on that would be helpful to understand the impacts. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Thanks, David. And I appreciate the question and your perspective on that. If we look at the 12-week period ended July 15, it's a little more flattish. So while I'm really encouraged by the past several weeks, if I look at the two quad periods earlier, the marketplace was much softer. So I think what we're seeing this year is a lot of volatility. It's difficult to predict the market. And I certainly am optimistic that those recent trends continue, but I would say that they do include the July 4th holiday period. And I think we've seen a bit more stability during some of those periods, where there is an anchor season where somebody's coming into the store to make their purchase, but really I'd say it's about volatility. First part of the year, we saw some months that were up, we saw some down. And we're trying to do our best to project what we think that will look like as we go into the second part of the year. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: And this is Patricia, David. You asked about the retail inventory. And, yes, that was a factor in our second quarter. So we really wanted to have a lot of transparency around that. We did some pipeline build against new packaging. And we accommodated some of our retail customers who had some changes in their own distribution network. And it was very important to us to meet their service needs so that they could get product on the shelf in a good execution way. And so when you look at our takeaway, you can see that we need to normalize that retail build over the second half of the year. And so we still believe that retail takeaway will improve in the second half, but from a net sales perspective, we know that we've got to work through that inventory. In terms of the gross profit that you commented on, that sales pattern also shows up in the gross profit. So to the extent that we had higher sales in the first half of the year, that had better fixed cost absorption and that will come out again in second half of the year as those sales normalize through. The other thing that we had in gross profit is as we have reduced our overall full-year sales guidance, obviously, that has a mix impact when you look at the mix of products that we think are most hit by the weaker retail trend. And then finally, we do have some changes in packaging coming, both on the shelf and as we work with our retail partners for packaging that works in their format. And that's also a bit of a headwind for us in our gross margin in the second half of the year. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And, Patricia, just to follow-up, is there any way that you could quantify that retail inventory build, just because it sounds like we should take it out of the third quarter, but I don't think I heard you say the magnitude of it? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: We didn't put the dollar amount out there, but what I'd say, David, is what we want to do every year is make sure that our net sales and our retail takeaway are in line together. So if you look at our overall sales, assume that that's our retail takeaway, and I think you can pretty easily normalize out that inventory build. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: By the end of the year, we would say they'd be aligned. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jonathan Feeney. Please go ahead. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Thank you so much. So I guess following up on Dave's questions, I want to make sure I have these numbers right. I think you told us year-to-date U.S. retail CMG takeaway was 1.4%. And I think that maps to the 4% number you gave us for the second quarter in the release. Correct me if I'm wrong about that. So, a couple of questions here; first, am I right that means Q1 was down 1.2% on net retail takeaway or something like that? I know there is seasonality between Q1 and Q2. And secondly, Patricia mentioned Q2 takeaway was disappointing. Can you give us a sense what you had been expecting for Q2 takeaway? And then related to that, like what kind of takeaway would you expect? Is this just continued 1.4%-ish takeaway in the second half for the U.S., are you expecting with this flat sales guidance? Thank you. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Sure. So let me start with the first part of your question, which is total Hershey takeaway was up 1.4%. Hershey CMG takeaway year-to-date was up 2.0%. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Okay. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: So our CMG performance outpaced the total. And that was really as a result of... Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.: The grocery stock. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: The grocery stock primarily that was a bit of a drag on the total number. And then as we look at the takeaway on a full-year basis, as Patricia said, we're looking for by end of year, net sales and takeaway to be relatively in line with each other. And we're anticipating net sales to be around that 1% range. So that can help to give you a guide of the range of where we think that takeaway may come in. Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. And, Jon, it's typically pretty much, well, they're relatively the same every year. So if you go back to our April guidance, around 2% would've meant around 2% retail takeaway as well. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : That's helpful. I guess I'm just trying to understand where the disappointment came in and its order of magnitude on takeaway. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. And I'd say a lot of that was around everyday post-Easter was a bit softer than we anticipated. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Gotcha. Thank you very much. Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.: Okay. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ken Goldman. Please go ahead. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, good morning. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Hi, Ken. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Question, Patricia, your guidance remains, I think, for input costs to still just not be a headwind for the year, but they were a tailwind in 2Q. And it's obviously impossible to know from our end, but at least from our basic math, it doesn't seem like that tailwind gets any less strong in the back half of the year. So I'm just curious. Is there anything we should be aware of that might be more of a headwind in the back half of the year or do you expect similar trends to maybe what you saw in 2Q in terms of just that input cost tailwind? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. They were a little bit better in the second quarter. And we expect that to flow through to the full year, but not get better. It's really the drivers that I mentioned earlier around because of the change in sales between the first half and the second half, you've got some fixed cost volume absorption. You've got that mix impact I mentioned. And some increased costs coming through on the packaging. And that's really what's, you know, when you look at that against where we came in in the second quarter, that's where some of that comes out. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you for that. And then a follow-up, Cookie Layer Crunch, you talked, I think, last quarter, about the real question \u2013 and I think this is true for all new products, right, is where repeat purchases are going to be. Can you help us understand where they have come in versus your expectation? And the reason I'm asking is, at least in Nielsen data, which I know is not always precise when it comes to new products, but what we're seeing is the max ACV, the weighted average ACV, they both peaked a few months ago and have trailed off a little bit since. So I just wanted to get a better sense from you guys what you're really seeing with that brand and how happy you still are with it. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: So we're very pleased with Cookie Layer Crunch performance. Trial and repeat are exactly in line with our expectations. And so we feel great about that, especially in a world and a marketplace where there are a lot of other big innovations in the category this year as well. So we particularly feel well that we hit those goals despite that. So we continue to be bullish on the initiative, as well as on some of the other innovation like Crunchers and some of the recent innovation that is out there. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Palmer. Please go ahead. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Good morning. First, a follow-up on the acquisition comment you made, I think it was Jason's question. Are you looking across all snacking as fair game? I ask because, at times, Hershey has ventured into other aisles and has done perhaps a little less well. And you seem to be signaling a little bit of a closer-in approach with that term snackfection, where, seemingly, you're trying to leverage a little bit more of the core with what you extend into. Any comment there would be helpful. And I have a follow-up. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Sure. So we really are looking across the snacking landscape. We have identified a couple key areas that we have the most interest in that, for competitive reasons, I won't go into the details on. I will say when we think about that, that we do think about how we can get scale wherever we're going to make an acquisition, either by buying something that's large enough to give us scale or by either looking at a section of the store we can get scale, or a category segment where we can get scale to ensure that we get the benefits of having a profitable business and the organization's focused in one spot. So I'd say we're looking across, but we have distinct areas of focus within. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And just to follow-up also on your comments in the prepared remarks, you seem to be calling out a need for at least a subtle repositioning or a revived focus on the core in some way. You said something about insights work you're doing and stay tuned. Is that a comment about everyday non-seasonal chocolate? And maybe you can give us a hint as to what sort of general opportunity exists for improvement and the timing of any tactical changes you can make there. Thanks. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Sure. I mean, what the snacking demand landscape really gives us is an even deeper view of where each of our brands plays and where there is opportunity to sharpen our positioning to capture new usage occasions or to be more relevant to new users and also to take our portfolio and appropriately spread it to cover the landscape to minimize any overlap. And so what you'll see on some of our brands \u2013 we recently started investing in Twizzlers and PayDay. And we're leveraging some of the landscape insight in the messaging and in the media strategy. And we're actually seeing some really nice results. And across many of our brands, we're seeing some of that sharpening focus. So, I'd say in terms of timing of when you would see that, I think you would start to see it like on the Twizzlers and the PayDay, for example, right now. I think on some of the bigger brands, we should see some benefit from that, I'm going to say, mid to perhaps late into next year, maybe around mid-year next year perhaps. Is that helpful? David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Robert Moskow. Please go ahead. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, thank you. Michele, I think I thought I heard a bit of a change of tone today regarding the sense of urgency to get bigger in e-commerce. You mentioned click-and-collect and also with pure-play e-commerce providers. And I think what I hear from investors about their biggest concern on Hershey and other confection companies, is that just the number of cash registers, the number of opportunities for impulse purchases are now structurally declining. So have you decided internally to kind of shift more of your resources towards that e-commerce effort? And is that part of what you're kind of signaling today? And maybe give me a little bit about what they're thinking about doing to duplicate that impulse occasion online? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Sure. So I would start with the fact we're encouraged that as we look at our business this year, we had pretty strong performance across impulse and our take-home business. So despite that accelerated shift in e-comm, we've still been able with our retail sales force and the power we have in store, to capture and grow that piece of the portfolio. And innovations played a key role in that as well. That said, I think it is fair to say that we are dialing up. We've been focused on e-commerce, but we are doubling-down a bit more than we had in the past with the dedicated team, our reinvestment of additional resources and really partnering closely with our customers. One of the biggest changes I've seen in the marketplace is a lot of our bricks-and-mortar partners are now really dialing up their efforts on omni-channel, both click-and-collect and multiple forms of home delivery. And then, of course, there are the pure-plays out there. So I guess I think about that business in two ways. One, I think that we have an opportunity to say how do we capture the planned nature of how consumers purchase in that channel and dial that up and really capture that on our business. And at the same time, several of our retail partners have come to us and asked us to partner with them in terms of figuring out how to optimize impulse in an e-commerce world. I can't tell you I have the answer to that right now, but I can tell you I think we are in a good position to really be partnering with our retailers on that. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steven Strycula. Please go ahead. Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Good morning. Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.: Hi, Steve. Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : Two questions; the first would be on gross margins, just to follow-up on Ken's questions. Can you help us unpack a little bit of some of the tailwinds or headwinds in the back half of the year? It just seems like the full-year guidance is conservative where you're tracking year-to-date. Can you talk about the mix comments you were discussing, whether that's channel mix are more product mix and elaborate a little bit more on the packaging investments that you're making? That'd be helpful. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Sure. Thanks for the question. So I think it helps to just stand back and say that whenever we're going to reduce our overall net sales outlook, it's going to have an impact on our gross margin, both because we're going to have fewer products to absorb our fixed costs and also because as sales come out, those are typically are very high margin, best mix product. And that's just a natural impact. So first of all, that's the pressure down. In addition to that, this year, especially in the second half of the year, we are making changes to some of our packaging, both as the way that the consumer will see it, and also the way the retailer will handle it in store. And that has some cost as well. So those are the headwinds that we have on a full-year basis. You do see this sort of first half, second half dynamic, driven by the change in sales profile between the two halves of the year. I think the fact that in that lower sales world, we were able to hold our gross margin \u2013 overall margin's actually a positive story. It shows that we do have slightly lower input costs and also that our productivity is very strong in that area. Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : That's really helpful. And then two quick modeling housekeeping questions, the $60 million other income that you were speaking about, that I think was ratcheted up about $5 million for this year, is it fair to model that $60 million going forward or is it just kind of that one-time extra $5 million is a bump this year versus forward years? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Great question. We want to have a sustainable tax rate. So we look each year at investment tax credit opportunities. I think that that's as good a forecast as I would have right now for next year is, again, because we're looking at a sustainable tax rate. Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And given the mechanics of what you said for the third quarter gross margin, the volume deleverage because of the timing of the shift, does that mean that EPS on a year-over-year basis is more pressured in third quarter versus fourth quarter or are they pretty comparable on a year-over-year basis? Thank you. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: They'll come in the way they do, depending on the pattern of our sales. And we're really not giving that level of quarterly guidance. I'd just think about it right now as a second half impact. Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : All right. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Chris Growe. Please go ahead. Your line's open. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, good morning. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Hi, Chris. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Good morning. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. I just had a question for you, if I could, on when I look at the stronger gross margin performance and the lower SM&A in this quarter, it's not clear to me that you are investing. You've talked about investments in go-to-market capabilities. Is that inherent in these stronger performances? And then, I'm just trying to understand going forward then, is that also part of the pressure, if you will, on the second half performance of the business? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Yes. I think that's a great question. Thanks for the question. We talked about the amount of savings that we wanted to deliver through our Margin for Growth Program. That's coming in a little higher than we expected. And that's given us the opportunity to both maintain our bottom line as well as incrementally invest in the second half of the year on a couple of things : first, against advertising and related marketing spend that Michele talked about; second, about the capabilities that we talked about in the first part of the remarks. So when Michele's talking about things like unlocking the demand landscape, using analytics against our consumer or growing our e-commerce capabilities, those are investments that we're making. So we are ramping up those capabilities in the second half of the year. And then finally, as Michele mentioned, we do have a new ERP system going in. And that spending is also starting to really ramp up in our SG&A in the second half of the year. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And thanks for that color. And just a quick question for you on China, it's becoming a smaller and smaller part of the business. Much of this quarter looks like it was self-inflicted. Is that sort of decline rate going to continue? Are you rationalizing SKUs to a point that we've got to lap this, if you will, over the next year? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. I think that's a good way to think about it. As you know, we've put a real focus on rightsizing and rationalizing our China business. It's one of the first pieces of the Margin for Growth area that we focused on and where we'll see some of the early wins. We are seeing those wins. And inherent in that is a lot of moving parts, including looking at the SKUs and making sure that we're going to market with productive and profitable SKUs. It means rationalizing where we participate in the markets in terms of channel mix as well as geography. And so all of that is having a planned impact on our overall sales and we knew that would happen, but it's resulting in a more healthy business and that was our goal. And we're very pleased with that. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, okay. Thanks a lot. Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.: Operator, we have time for one last question. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take that question from Matthew Grainger. Please go ahead. Your line's open. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks, everybody. If I could just ask two quick follow-ups; first, I just wanted to ask about the seasonal outlook for the second half of the year. You had extremely strong share trends in the first half during Easter season. So just curious how the discussions with retailers around second half holidays have been progressing, their level of excitement around the CMG category, specifically, and whether you expect similar or still sort of clearly positive share trends during the upcoming holidays. And then the second one, all the reinvestments you've talked about, the impact on second half margins, could you talk a little bit more about why you expect a pullback in International margins? And which investments are specifically focused in that segment? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Matthew, we feel good about the seasonal outlook in the back half of the year. We anticipate that we will grow business, our business, in both of those holidays. And as you know, we have very good visibility into what our retailers are purchasing in those holidays. Right now, I would say we are feeling good that we should gain share during the holidays in the back half of the year. And I'll turn it over to Patricia to answer the second part of your question. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. So great question and I think you made a good point, which is year-to-date, we are slightly positive in our International and Other segment. So when I say around breakeven, it would sort of encompass that. We do recognize that with a lot of moving parts going on in China, in particular, there are a certain amount of things that we want to protect against in that world. And so that's a little bit of my maybe conservatism on that piece of the business. We also mentioned some of the trends we think will be a little pressured in Brazil in the second half of the year as well. When you're this close to breakeven, we're talking about plus or minus pretty small numbers. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you. Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.: Thank you very much for your time today. And the IR Group will be available for any follow-up questions you may have throughout the day. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Thank you. Operator : And this will conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

(Research) Operator : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to The Hershey Company's Third Quarter 2017 Results Conference Call. My name is Erica, and I will be your conference operator today. All participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please note, this call may be recorded. Thank you. Mr. Mark Pogharian, you may begin your conference. Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.: Thank you, Erica. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to The Hershey Company's third quarter 2017 conference call. Michele Buck, President and CEO; and Patricia Little, Senior Vice President and CFO, will provide you an overview of results, which will then be followed by a Q&A session. Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2016 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the Note section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. As a result, we will discuss third quarter 2017 results, excluding net pre-tax charges of $7.8 million, or $0.05 per share-diluted, which are primarily related to business realignment cost, derivative mark-to-market losses and non-service-related pension expense. These charges are defined in the Appendix of this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website at www.TheHersheyCompany.com. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges. And with that out of the way, let me turn the call over to Michele Buck. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Thanks, Mark, and good morning to all of you on the phone and the webcast. In the third quarter, I'm pleased with our performance. We delivered growth, both in net sales and EPS, in a volatile environment. We continue to feel good about our CMG and snack strategy, as most segments within the $100 billion U.S. snack wheel remained strong and continue to outpace center of the plate trends. As planned, constant currency net sales increased 1.1% in the third quarter. And EPS of $1.33, increased 3% versus last year. There was no change to our constant currency full year net sales outlook, and we reaffirmed full year EPS growth at the high-end of our 7% to 9% range. As discussed previously, embedded in our outlook are important marketplace investments in the business that will benefit the company over the near and long-term, as well as some new challenges, such as higher freight and distribution, that emerged in the course of the quarter. Patricia will have further details, but some of these, particularly the supply chain costs, pressured Q3 operating profit and are expected to continue in Q4. We believe investments in our strategic initiatives will enable the business to deliver long-term sales growth, gross margin expansion and operating profit growth, or a virtuous cycle, over our strategic planning cycle. Advertising and related consumer marketing expense increased 3.7% in Q3. Advertising expense was up 10%, partially offset by lower consumer promotions. There is no change to our full year North America advertising and related consumer marketing outlook, although International and Other segment advertising and related consumer marketing is estimated to be lower in 2017 versus 2016, resulting in total Hershey Company spend that will be about the same as last year. Now, let me turn to our measured channel retail performance. But before I do, I want to note that this summer, we selected IRI as our preferred market insights and analytics provider. IRI has made significant investments in capabilities and technology platforms, and we believe they are a good partner for Hershey. IRI's platform will help us target the right consumers, in the right channels, at the right moment. Total Hershey Q3 U.S. retail takeaway growth was 1%, driven by CMG growth of 1.4%. This more than offsets some softness in grocery items, such as baking chips and syrup. Looking at CMG, or candy, mint and gum, the category and Hershey continue to outpace center of the store edibles. For the 12-week and year-to-date period ending October 8, CMG category growth was plus 2.4% and plus 1.7%, respectively. Hershey Q3 and year-to-date CMG retail takeaway was plus 1.4% and plus 2%. Our year-to-date CMG market share is up plus 0.1 points, driven by strong innovation and in-store activity in the first half of the year. Importantly, within the combined chocolate and non-chocolate candy segment, where we derive the majority of our U.S. sales, Q3 category growth is about 3.3%. Our core chocolate brands, Reese's, Hershey's, Kit Kat and Kisses, continue to drive growth, and I'm particularly pleased with their marketplace performance. The combined retail takeaway on these brands in Q3 increased about 5%. As we've discussed in prior quarters, this was partially offset by planned decline on select chocolate and non-chocolate candy brands as we focus on reducing complexity and improving overall velocity rates at retail. Therefore, the increase of Hershey's Q3 combined chocolate and non-chocolate candy retail takeaway of plus 1.1% resulted in market share being slightly off. We are working on plans to improve the performance of our non-core candy brands and look forward to sharing this with you in the near future. Hershey's CMG and snacks innovation had another good quarter. It's my goal to ensure that on an annual basis, this strategic lever is a lever that consistently delivers meaningful, sustainable CMG and snacks growth. We continue to anticipate strong innovation as a contributor to achieve our long-term net sales growth target of 2% to 4%. Specifically, Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch, or CLC, is tracking as expected. We achieved our distribution target earlier in the year and maintain this level, given the repeat velocity at retail. CLC has been strongly supported by advertising throughout the year on TV, social and online, with continuity media planned through the rest of the year. As we look to 2018, we'll continue to invest in this product with the launch of Cookie Layer Crunch Triple Chocolate. Shipments to select customers begin near the end of the year. Importantly, the Cookie Layer Crunch platform is Hershey's largest launch in recent history and will receive equal support in year two as it did in year one. The transition from lay down bags to stand-up pouches on our core chocolate packaged candy products is progressing. In the fourth quarter, we'll introduce new retail-ready packaging at select retailers before a broader rollout next year. This initiative enables product to get on the shelf quicker, with less in-store labor and it improves shopability in the aisle. Both of these packaging initiatives have an impact on gross margin in Q4 and most likely in the first half of 2018, but we believe this is the right long-term investment for our brands and business, as it should result in improved shelf presence and visibility. In Q3, we also made good progress against our snacks platform. We expanded our initial Snack Mix and Snack Bites products with the launch of Hershey's and Reese's Popped Snack Mix and Chocolate Dipped Pretzels, primarily in large format take-home bags. While early, results are encouraging. Net sales growth is ahead of plan and consumer reaction is positive when our brands are merchandised in the snacks aisle. The velocity of the Popped Snack Mix items is in line with similar competing products, while the Hershey-branded Chocolate Dipped Pretzels is outpacing competition. So we feel good about the progress we're making. Our power chocolate brands are growing and gaining share, and we're working on plans that should enable other parts of our CMG and snacks portfolio to see gains in the near future. As I discussed in July, e-commerce is another strategic initiative that we are focusing on. We continue to work with key brick-and-mortar retailers related to their click-and-collect and omni-channel initiatives, as well as with established e-commerce players. As a result, our year-to-date U.S. e-commerce sales are up about 40%. We have a dedicated and growing cross-functional team responsible for the strategies and execution of our e-commerce plan in developing the next generation of online impulse solutions. We're working with all the key strategic partners and will be validating and testing concepts in Q4 and 2018 that we believe will lead to a sustainable business model. Given our strong CMG position in the U.S., we are collaboratively working with our partners to develop e-commerce-friendly portfolios, digital shelf upgrades, and alternative fulfillment solutions. And in September, we went live with a customer on the first-ever omni-channel Halloween program. Initial results are exceeding expectations, and I'm very excited about the potential for our business in this space. Now, for an update on our International and Other segment, excluding China, our International and Other segment constant currency net sales are expected to increase this year. Net sales for the quarter were relatively in line with our estimate, and on a constant currency basis, about the same as the third quarter of 2016. We're making measured investments in our core markets of Mexico, Brazil and India, where we're seeing solid marketplace gains. Combined constant currency net sales growth in these markets was 8%, and we're improving on operating income trends at the same time. In China, we're executing against the Margin for Growth program as we discussed on March 1. This efficiency and effectiveness initiative is progressive nicely and on track. We're optimizing our in-country supply chain and streamlining the operating model, as we strike the right balance between in-country investments and near-term market opportunities. As expected, due to summer seasonality, the China chocolate category declined by about minus 1% and is roughly flat year-to-date. Small format stores continued to show growth, outpacing the marketplace performance in hypermarkets. Going forward, we have a measured and disciplined strategy in China that is focused on the Hershey brand's messaging, continued e-commerce penetration, and smaller store format expansion. So I'm pleased with our progress in this segment. And I expect our focus on profitable growth to result in break-even or better operating results this year. Now to wrap up, confections is one of the largest segments within the $100 billion U.S. snack market, and we are confident that our brands and consumer-centric business model position us well to deliver sustained top and bottom-line growth over the long-term. I'm encouraged that the broader snacks category continues to grow, despite the volatile consumer and retail environment. Our strong U.S. marketplace presence and solid financial position gives us the flexibility to smartly invest in confectionery and other snacks as well as in the capabilities that give us a competitive edge at retail and with consumers. We're committed to our marketing mix modeling, trade, TV advertising, and digital media and investments related to innovation, consumer marketing and insights. This is part of our DNA and why I remain so optimistic about Hershey and the opportunities that lie ahead of us. As we look to 2018, it's too early to talk about details; however, we feel good about our preliminary plans. We believe we have the right level of core brand activity, innovation, and programming lined up that will continue to drive category growth, despite a shorter Easter. Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch Triple Chocolate and upcoming Reese's innovation will bring variety and news to the category. And I'm also excited with the introduction of Hershey's Gold, Hershey's fourth flavor. Hershey's Gold features a rich cream that delivers a buttery sweet flavor and a distinctively new Hershey's experience. Its caramelize cream also includes a combination of salty crunchy bits of peanuts and pretzels that deliver a creamy, crunchy satisfaction. The instant consumable pack type will begin to ship to only a few select customers in Q4, but you'll see it in stores more broadly in January, as merchandising and program will be tied with the Winter Olympics, which begin on February 9. We're a growth and EBIT margin-focused company with a goal of increasing margins over the long-term via both cost control and, importantly, top-line growth. I'll now turn it over to Patricia, who will provide you with details on our financial results. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Thank you, Michele. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Third quarter net sales of $2.033 billion increased 1.5% versus last year and includes a 0.4 point benefit from favorable foreign currency translation. Constant currency net sales growth of 1.1% was in line with our estimate. Gains were primarily driven by the North America segment and the success of new products. Adjusted earnings per share-diluted came in at $1.33, an increase of about 3% versus last year, driven by our higher sales and the positive impact of the Margin for Growth program savings related to International and Other operating income improvements. Volume was a 0.7 point contribution to sales growth, and net price realization was a 0.4 point benefit. In Q2, we lapped the acquisition of barkTHINS, which is on track with our plans. By segment, North America net sales increased 1.6% versus the same period last year, including favorable foreign currency translation of 0.3 points. Volume was a 1.6 point contribution, and net price realization, 0.3 points unfavorable. We were pleased with North America segment sales performance, which benefited from core brand growth. Innovation, including Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch, as well as the launch of Hershey's and Reese's Popped Snack Mix and Chocolate Dipped Pretzels. Total International and Other segment net sales for the third quarter increased 0.8% versus last year. Excluding the 1.3 point impact of favorable foreign currency exchange, International and Other segment net sales declined 0.5% versus the year-ago period. Volume was off 5.2 points due to planned declines in China, and net price realization was a 4.7 point benefit. Turning to margins, adjusted gross profit increased about 1%, resulting in adjusted gross margin of 45.3%, a decline of 30 basis points versus the third quarter of last year. Lower input costs and supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives were more than offset by unfavorable sales mix and higher freight and increased levels of manufacturing and distribution costs, primarily related to the packaging initiatives that Michele mentioned and the company's focus on maintaining service targets at faster-growing retail customers. For the full year, we expect adjusted gross margin to increase about 25 basis points versus our previous outlook of about 50 basis points. The change is primarily driven by the higher freight, new packaging and customer service costs. And given our supply chain structure and our focus on strategic customers, this could be a gross margin headwind in the first half of 2018. Adjusted operating profit in the third quarter of $446.9 million was about the same as the year-ago period, resulting in operating profit margin of 22%, a decline of 30 basis points. As expected, the increase in gross profit, as well as SG&A productivity and cost savings at the corporate level, were offset by the planned investments in the business discussed last quarter, as well as higher go-to-market expenses and employee-related costs. And, as Michele mentioned, advertising and related consumer marketing expense increased 3.7% versus the third quarter of 2016, as advertising expense increased 10%, partially offset by lower consumer promotions. The third quarter 5.3% increase in North America advertising and related consumer marketing expense was in line with our forecast. Now, let me provide a brief update on our International and Other segment. On a constant currency basis, net sales declined 0.5% and was relatively in line with our forecast. The China supply chain transformation is on track, with the majority of the work expected to be complete by the end of 2018. The reorganization within SG&A functions, which began last quarter, is progressing. The benefit from this work is evident in the improvement in segment operating income. Our SKU analysis and optimization efforts are on track, and we'll look to leverage this work going forward as we focus on five strategic initiatives that should improve our top and bottom-line trends. Specifically, the team is looking to : drive Hershey brands' SKU conversion; Hershey innovation; to optimize channel growth, focusing on small formats; and focus on key strategic accounts; and our e-commerce. We expect China chocolate category sales in brick-and-mortar to be flat to slightly up for the full year 2017, while e-commerce is forecasted to grow around 15%. As expected, given our SKU optimization, our chocolate performance has lagged in brick-and-mortar; however, our online retail takeaway is up for the year-to-date period. Looking at our other focus markets, we continue to be please with our efforts in Mexico, Brazil and India, where combined constant currency net sales in these three countries increased 8%. Third quarter International and Other segment operating income of $16.4 million increased nicely. It was driven by the implementation of the Margin for Growth program and the timing of select investments and expenses. Therefore, we expect Q4 operating results in this segment to be similar to last year. As we stated previously, we are driving a strong profit-focused mentality in this segment and are beginning to see the bottom-line trend improve, and we expect International and other segment operating income to be at least breakeven this year. In Mexico, chocolate progress continues, with solid double-digit retail takeaway. For the year-to-date period, we slightly outpaced category growth and gained share. Q3 constant currency net sales in Mexico increased by about 10%, driven by a combination of volume and pricing. Sales were strong across key brands, particularly Kisses and Hershey's milk drink box. Our new Hershey's choco-yogo product continues to gain trial, with repeat in line with our expectations. In Brazil, our team is focused on profitable growth, despite the challenging operating environment. Q3 constant currency net sales increased 3.3%. We estimate that year-to-date chocolate category growth in Brazil is about 13%. Our retail takeaway was about two times the category growth rate, fueled by both distribution gains and higher velocities, resulting in a market share gain of about 0.5 point. Constant currency net sales in India increased 16% and slightly exceeded our plan. Growth in the brands we're investing behind continues to be solid. Our transition of the India portfolio is enabling a higher margin business, and we are on track to expand gross margins here by 1,000 basis points in 2017. This is enabling adjustments in the local marketplace that should result in a sustainable operating model. Moving down the P&L, third quarter interest expense of $24.6 million was in line with last year. For the full year, we continue to expect interest expense to be in the $95 million to $100 million range. The adjusted tax rate in the third quarter of 2017 was 30.4% versus 30.7% in the year-ago period. For the full year, we anticipate that the effective tax rate will be towards the high end of the 26.5% to 27% outlook we discussed last quarter. In 2017, we expect other income and expense related to tax credits to be about $65 million versus our previous estimate of $60 million. For the third quarter of 2017, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 213.4 million shares, resulting in adjusted earnings per share-diluted of $1.33, or an increase of 3.1% versus a year ago. Total capital additions, including software, in the third quarter and year-to-date period, were $64 million and $149 million, respectively. For the full year, we expect that CapEx will be in the $260 million to $275 million range versus the previous estimate of $270 million to $290 million. During the third quarter, adjusted depreciation and amortization was $62 million, and we paid $136 million in dividends. On August 23, the Board of Directors approved and the company announced that it purchased 1.5 million shares of its common stock from the Hershey Trust Company for approximately $159 million, or $106 per share. The company did not repurchase any common shares against the $500 million share repurchase authorization approved in January 2016. There is $100 million remaining on this authorization. This morning, we announced that the Board of Directors approved an additional $100 million share repurchase program that will commence after the current program is completed. This authorization is a result of the company's strong balance sheet and confidence that we'll deliver long-term earnings per share-diluted growth of 6% to 8%. Additionally, in the third quarter and year-to-date period, the company repurchased $41 million and $141 million, respectively, of common shares to replace shares issued in connection with the exercise of stock options. Now to summarize, as Michele stated, we are focused on our consumer-centric business model and on driving growth and margin expansion, with the right level of investment. And while we're excited about the launch of Hershey's Gold and Cookie Layer Crunch Triple Chocolate, the Q4 sales of these products are not expected to be as great as the Cookie Layer Crunch fourth quarter 2016 sell-in. Consumer uncertainty persists across several geographies. We're pushing hard in export markets such as Asia and the Caribbean, where some Q4 challenges have cropped up. We believe, however, that the plans we have in place will enable us to achieve our full year constant currency sales target of around 1.25%. Exchange rates continue to fluctuate, and we now expect the impact on full year sales to be minimal versus our previous outlook of 25 basis points unfavorable. As we have implied in prior calls, input costs are lower this year; however, the supply chain costs I discussed earlier are greater than our previous estimate. Therefore, expected full year adjusted gross margin expansion is about 25 basis points. The Margin for Growth program is progressing, and we continue to expect 2017 savings of about $25 million. Combined with advertising and related consumer marketing, it should be about the same as last year, and a slightly higher tax rate towards the top end of the range, we continue to expect 2017 adjusted earnings per share-diluted growth to be around the high end of our 7% to 9% target. Thank you for your time this morning. And I'll now turn it back over to Michele for some closing comments. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Thanks, Patricia. I just want to start by thanking all of our employees for those solid Q3 results that we delivered. As you've heard me say before, in an environment of accelerating change, I see opportunity. And I'm optimistic about our future. We are focused on what we need to do to succeed. Our balance sheet and cash flow remain strong. Our executive management team and the Board of Directors are confident that we'll continue to build value for all Hershey shareholders. So thank you. And now, we will open it up for any questions that you may have. Operator : Thank you. We'll go first to the line of Ken Goldman. Please go ahead. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.: Hey, Ken. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Good morning. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : You had talked about spending more on your customers for maintaining some of their service targets. Can you elaborate on this a bit? And the reason I'm asking is we're hearing about Walmart and Kroger meeting with U.S. food companies to really make sure that out-of-stocks are limited. So I guess I'm curious and I know you don't necessarily know what's happening with some other food companies, but from your perspective, do you think this pressure is specific to Hershey? Or do you think the pressure, if there is any pressure, really, to maintain these customer service targets, is something more broad-based around food that we should be aware of? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. So let me talk a little bit broadly, and I'll also talk about Hershey in particular. So first of all, yeah, customer service rates are critically important to our customers in the marketplace right now. And I think, certainly, as there is a pressured consumer retail environment, we all want to capture every sale that we possibly can. So, as a result of that, we believe it was a strategically-good decision for us to really focus and up our performance on customer fill even higher, even if it meant some additional investments in moving product around a bit more. So I would say that that is an overall theme in the industry between retailers and manufacturers that we are all jointly working on together. I'll also tell you, if I speak to Hershey specifically, there are a couple pressures that we had. So you can see the strong growth that we have in our core brands and have continued to have all year long, has actually put pressure on activity (30:14) across our system. And we have made decisions to move product around a bit more to make sure we don't lose any of those sales as we invest in manufacturing capacity to expand our capabilities on those brands. Some of the innovation that we've had on our business as well has necessitated a few more touches and a few more additional shipments that drove some cost for us. Some of the multi-component products like Snack Mix, for example, where you're moving multiple ingredients to make the products. And then also some of our packaging initiatives that we believe are critically important in the marketplace, which, on a temporary basis, create some additional inventory across the system. And then I think you're aware, you've probably heard others talk about that, going forward, there are some additional pressures just across freight, given tightening capacity in the short-term. There were some weather-related issues. And over the longer-term, I think there are some trucking-related, trucker availability issues and capacity that are emerging and starting to impact, as well as some new regulatory changes that we believe is going to create pressure on the availability of truckers as well. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And thank you very much for that detail. Very quick one for me, you talked about the sales mix maybe hurting your gross margin a little bit. How much of that, if at all, was related to some weak C-store trends we're seeing, not necessarily for you but across the board? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Yes. I mean, certainly, we've seen that the C-store retail community has talked about some of the pressures that they felt in their stores and trips not being where they would like them to be. So we certainly sell a lot of instant consumables there. So we are always anxious to have strong trips into that environment. So certainly, that has an impact. I would say there's a few other places where we're expanding the portfolio across snacking that also have a lower margin than our core items. And certainly things like Snack Mix, which I think have very viable and successful in the marketplace, create a little pressure on mix as well. Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.: Yes. And, Ken, just one more point to remember, we did talk about the top-line in the second quarter and would had reflected the trends we were seeing in the C-store at that time. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to the line of Rob Moskow. Please go ahead. Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.: Rob, you there? Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Oh, sorry. Yeah, thanks. I could be modeling this a bit off, but I'm trying to figure out what your guidance implies for operating income in fourth quarter. It looks to be down double-digit, if I got the tax rate right. So did I get that right? And is there anything specific about fourth quarter on the comparisons that caused that? I know you had a tough comp to last year's Cookie Layer Crunch launch. Thanks. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Yeah, thanks. Yeah, I think that's the biggest impact you're really seeing is that tough comp to last year (33:37) impact. That's really the biggest driver that we have. We also have \u2013 fourth (33:42) quarter's our time when we typically spend a fair amount of advertising in China as well. That's always a fourth quarter drag on our performance. And we do have really strong advertising performance that we're expecting in the fourth quarter in our U.S. business related to our new product innovation. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. So it's higher advertising? That's what makes this quarter different from the other quarters? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Well, and the sell-in on Cookie Layer Crunch. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.: That's the implication in your model. Sales are obviously down in the fourth quarter. We planned it that way, Rob, going back to July, as we stated in the remarks, you have some of these gross margin pressures in the third quarter, certainly, you'll have for all of the fourth quarter. You'll be seeing more of the packaging that we talked to ship more in the fourth quarter than the third, as third is highly weighted, obviously, more towards Halloween. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: And can I ask a follow-up about 2018? I know it's early, but we're all watching cocoa commodity costs and seeing all this deflation, hopefully, benefiting your business. It seems to me that that benefit could be quite a bit bigger than the drags you're talking about on freight and on mix. Maybe it's early to talk about those things, but could you give us a sense of, just broadly, whether you're still thinking about gross margin expansion in 2018. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Patricia, do you want to talk about that a little bit? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. We always want to expand our gross margin. In terms of commodities, in general, as we like to remind you, we hedge out 3 to 24 months. So we're not going to ever see us completely follow the market on cocoa. We're going to bleed that in over the next couple years. And, in fact, we already had said that we had lower input costs this year. So we've already captured some of that reduction in cocoa. We see other commodities that continue to actually be up, so the mix basket is certainly moderating that reduction in cocoa prices. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to the line of David Driscoll. Please go ahead. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great, thank you and good morning. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Hi, David. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Wanted to ask a little bit more about the retail inventory levels. I believe that on the last call, you talked about second quarter shipments coming in ahead of consumption. I think we estimated that as something like two percentage points. In the quarter, it doesn't look like there was a big difference between shipments and consumption. So I'm just wondering about the inventories at retail. Do you expect it to have a negative impact in the fourth quarter relative to your shipments? Just where do things stand? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: So, David, we continue to expect that at the end of the year, our inventory and our retail takeaway will be aligned. Third quarter has been a little bit of a messy quarter relative to all those weather impacts that occurred. And actually, even being able to get the available data from a Nielsen or an IRI to really feel confident, given some of the stores that have been closed down, et cetera, and then also with seasons. So I think the best way to think about it is that we anticipate them to be fully aligned by the end of the year. Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. And looking at your things to make, (37:12) David, for the fourth quarter, while it won't look like the third quarter at all on the top line, we expect takeaway to be positive in the fourth quarter. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: All right. That's really helpful. A follow-up on the C-stores, our data actually does show that C-stores have been weakening for Hershey. And I'm just curious if you could just develop a little bit more why. I think you were talking about trips before. Is it just trip issues or is there anything specific to your products in C-stores? And then, just do you have any...? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Yeah, David. If you look at our full year plan, our plan was a bit more front-loaded. And particularly, if you looked at C-store, we are lapping an unusually strong period year ago on instant consumable innovation when we had the Kit Kat Big Kat and as well as the Reese's Pieces Cup. And so the category was looking good in third quarter. And we have a tough lap, though, particularly because of the year-ago innovation in instant consumable and that's the biggest thing impacting us. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Very helpful. Thank you. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go next to the line of Steve Strycula. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Quick question for gross margins, just want to clarify, against the cocoa benefit that you guys will be facing, you also commented about incremental headwinds related to supply chain persisting into next year. When we net the two together, should we still think of like a similar type of gross margins trending lower when you mention pressure for the first half of next year, or should we just expect more muted gross margin gains? Thank you. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: This is Patricia. I think that we always want to be more (39:08) gross margin, but, yeah, we do see them as being more muted based on the points that you made. We'll be giving our guidance next year with more specificity. Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.: Steve? Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : Oh, that was it for me. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Okay. Thank you. Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go next to the line of Jonathan Feeney. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Good morning. Thanks very much. Just one; Patricia, could you maybe give us some more detail on what are the mix factors, either by channel or product, that you called out in your commentary and their approximate magnitude, as far as their impact on gross margin, both this year and going forward? Thank you. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. I think we've touched a few of them already in the call. So, first of all, we are seeing some impacts from our expected and very successful Snack Mix products, or similar products like that, that are pressured gross margin. Nothing is as profitable, we always say, as our core of our core products. But we do need to expand our portfolio. And then, also, some of the things that we've already touched on around the general mix between instant consumable and other types, between seasons, instant consumable is also a little bit of a pressure on us as well. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Is it about in that order of magnitude? And are there any other channel impacts going from C-store, which is presumably underperforming, as Dave and you mentioned, versus to other channels? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: I think of it more as an instant consumable impact, frankly, than a channel-driven one. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Understood. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to the line of Andrew Lazar. Please go ahead. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, good morning everybody. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Hi, Andrew. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Of some of the negative impacts to gross margin, as you talked about, that might persistent a little bit into 2018, freight, packaging, some of the service targets, mix, I was hoping maybe you could dimensionalize those a bit, if there are ones that are of larger impact versus some of the others. And maybe if there's any way you can help quantify a little bit their impact in this quarter, it can help us a little bit with the way we think about how 2018 can play out. Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.: Yeah, Andrew, I mean, for various competitive reasons, I'm not sure we want to get into the magnitude of each one of these. We all have different levels of investments with customers and how we service them. As you look to 2018, certainly, we started the initiative you're seeing here in the third quarter. So you will see in the first six months of 2018, a pressure on gross margin. I'm not saying gross margin's up or down in the first half for 2018. We'll give more specificity, obviously, in January. Commodities, we have deflation this year. You know there are some that are going to be up all the time, even as it relates to next year. Some that are going to be down as it relates to next year. We're a gross margin-focused company. We need that to work to keep investing in the model and get the virtuous cycle that Michele referred to. So I mean, I think, overall, we feel pretty good about our long-term outlook. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. And then, Michele, you had mentioned some of the other non-core chocolate and candy brands are the ones that you'll be talking a little bit more about going forward. But maybe you can give us a little insight into maybe what some of the issues are with some of those brands. Was it just lack of appropriate innovation or effective innovation? Or maybe what some of the issues have been around why those have been a bit more of a drag? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: No, absolutely. So if you think about our total portfolio, if you think about the baking piece of the portfolio, chips and syrup, I think, saw some of the similar trends that we've seen with other center of store categories, so some pressure there. We spoke earlier this year relative to us having a focus to right-size our snacking portfolio and really focus more in a precision approach, so some of that right-sizing. And then, as it comes to what we call our variety chocolate brands and sweets, we've been working on optimizing our consumer communication and investments there to stabilize and get some growth out of those brands. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go next to the line of Jason English. Your line is open. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, folks. Thank you for allowing me to ask a question. I actually have two questions; first, a bit more strategic and then one a bit more tactical. Patricia, I think you referenced and, Michele, you've referenced many times, your portfolio diversification strategy. And if I go back to your Analyst Day, there was quite a bit of focus on trying to spread your wings beyond just your core CMG space. And you've done it with a little bit of innovation. Where do we sit on that now? Where do we sit in terms of the ambition, the progress? And you mentioned your clean balance sheet. Could we expect to see you utilize that to try to accelerate some of those initiatives outside of the core CMG space? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. So we remain committed to our strategy of being an innovative snacking powerhouse and really a focus on capturing more snacking occasions and appealing to new users within snacking. And, yes, I think we're continuing to execute against the strategies that we've laid out relative to innovation, leveraging our core brands in areas like Snack Mix, which we're really pleased with the results; barkTHINS, which is up, I think, 50% this year, which has also been a nice addition. And as we look at our priorities overall, we've always stated that M&A is a key piece of that. And you've seen us execute against that over the past couple years. So I would expect that that would continue to be a piece of how we look to deliver that expansion. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. So turning quickly to the second question, you mentioned some sort of top-line drag from SKU rationalization, portfolio optimization, clean-up, et cetera. We don't really see evidence in the data yet. As a matter of fact, your total distribution points are up overall. They're up in chocolate. They're up in non-chocolate candy. They're up baking, gum. So I guess the question there is one of cadence. Has this been sort of a recent thrust that maybe hasn't yet shown up in the data, and therefore, is likely going to be a drag on the go-forward? Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.: Yes. Jason, this is Mark. I mean, I think you heard us reference some of this in March 1 as well. I mean, I think as a matter of practice, we're always doing this and you're seeing selective SKUs come out. Not every piece of innovation that we have will be on the shelf for three, four, four or five years. So there is a cycle to offset so that when (46:51) some of this comes off, we have something there to replace it. But sometimes, the velocity of what it's replacing versus the velocity of what's coming is, isn't always, always, always equal. And you may see some of that play out over time here in the next year or two, as you look at the velocity of some of the snack stuff in CMG. When you think... Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: I was going to say, I think it might just be hard to look at total distribution points because there is so much noise in those distribution points. So we've had an active SKU rationalization program where we are eliminating merchandising SKUs, many smaller things. At the same time, we have our stand-up packaging initiative in the marketplace, which put new SKUs in place, which we think are very productive SKUs. And so there's a little bit \u2013 both of those things going on at the same time that I think is getting muted in the total numbers, too. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you, guys. I'll pass it on. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to the line of Rob Dickerson. Please go ahead. Unknown Speaker : Good morning. This is Kiniko (48:04) on for Rob. I just had a quick question for you. We recently heard a large U.S. confection player state in their recent earnings result that there has been a retailer push ahead of Halloween. So I was just trying to get a sense of what do you make of that in terms of the overall, I guess, promotional backdrop? Was there more promotional activity? Are retailers trying to drive traffic even more so this year, particularly with branded candy? And do you expect this to persist going into Q4? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: So I think that we always see retailers really try and leverage seasons as a destination to bring consumers into their store environments. And I think that this year is no different, from that perspective. I would say, I would remind you that we have continued to see over the past several years a lot of compression around the holidays. So with Halloween being on Tuesday, it's hard to get a total feel for what the season will shake out like. But I think that overall merchandising, we're seeing very strong collaboration with retailers, as we have in the past. So I can't say we've seen a really big change there. I think we see the retailer continuing to use the seasons as they have. Unknown Speaker : Okay, great. Thank you. I'll pass it on. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go next to the line of Alexia Howard. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good morning, everyone. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Good morning. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Can I ask about the pricing dynamics in North America? Your pricing is down, I think, 0.3% in the region this quarter. We've been hearing about it being more challenging out there, with retailers pushing back on pricing. I imagine that that's either a mix effect or maybe tweaking promotional activity year-on-year. Could you just comment on how competitive things are out there and maybe even if you can't comment on exactly pricing strategy from here, how you expect the shape of that to develop going forward? Thank you. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: You know, we have had a continuous focus, as we've talked to you before, about building strategic revenue management capabilities. Our big focus has continuously been being even more effective and efficient with our promotional dollars. And so, I think the movement that you would see in the marketplace, at least from us, would be around us really trying to get tighter about the best promotional programs and price points that maximize driving top-line, but at the most profitable levels, so that we're not getting ineffective deflation, but we're using price to maximize revenue. And I think that continues to be a focus for us. Certainly, I think in a pressured environment, some elements of the market are looking at whether price can bring in more consumers. But I think that everybody's also looking at that in a very balanced way, which is unless price is really driving incrementality, then it's deflation that has no benefit. So, I think that's what we're really seeing in the marketplace. And our focus, clearly, is on making every dollar count, getting smarter about what really drives the performance. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. I'll pass it on. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go next to the line of John Baumgartner. Please go ahead. John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks for the question. Good morning. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Good morning. John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Michele, just curious in terms of the retail landscape, you mentioned that some of the snack section is being merchandised in the snacks aisle. So I guess first off, do you have a sense from your consumer segmentation work or from retail observations, are the salty snacks categories where share is kind of being sourced to make way for this snack section? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: So as we look at our broad snacking strategy, clearly, the goal of expanding occasions is to drive incremental purchase and to source more broadly across that snacking wheel. And, yes, I would say we do do research and analytics to try and understand how we can best develop propositions that will add incrementally to our portfolio. So that's definitely a key area of focus for us. John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And can you speak to the promotion and some of the merchandising protocols in that snacking aisle? I mean, how are the interactions different with the consumers and retailers from confectionery? It seems that that salty snack space is a lot more fragmented. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: So I think where we are gaining some placement, it is an area that's more fragmented. And certainly, one approach that we're trying to do is to leverage the strengths that we've built over the years around category management to help the retailers to make that section as productive as possible to bring some of the great innovation that we've been known for in the confection category and provide news and exciting propositions in that segment to generate interest and bring new shoppers there. So our focus is really, just as it is within confection, how do we drive the category there and bring incrementality. If I think about the competition, I think national players always tend to be pretty strong wherever they're established. And I think it sometimes more the regional players that experience pressure in those scenarios. John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So are you finding the shelf space is a bit more expensive in that snacks aisle and that's part of the negative margin mix of the snacks section business? Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.: Patricia has always said, nothing is going to ever be as profitable as a candy bar, if you're looking at its absolute margin. So, I mean, as it relates to everything else in that aisle, I would probably say no. But as it relates to our portfolio, obviously, nothing is as profitable as a candy bar, right? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: So it's that more than the mix around shelf space. It's not a shelf space issue. It's just a fundamental value proposition all the way through our chain. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Yes. John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Understood. Thanks for your time. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go next to the line of Ken Zaslow. Please go ahead. Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.: Hi, Ken. Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey, good morning, everyone. Most of my questions have been answered. I just want to understand the CapEx, you reduced it a little bit. Was there something to think about there? Is it just a refinement? Is it putting projects into next year? And then, can you just talk about some of the key capital projects that you have? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. This is Patricia. I'll take that one. So, as we told you, we're embarking on a multi-year replacement of our ERP system and some associated projects. As is typical in the early days of refining that, we just moved some money out on that. It really is related to making sure that we're putting the right resources against those systems and fine-tuning the best way to do that. That's really the biggest impact of the CapEx reduction. Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. So there's nothing to read into it. I appreciate it. Thank you. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Just the normal adjustments of big systems projects, I would say. Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Perfect. Thank you very much. Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.: Okay, thanks, Ken. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our last question from Erin Lash. Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Thank you for taking the question. I kind of want to touch on capital priorities, cash priorities, particularly in light of a major confectionery player pursuing strategic alternatives for their confectionery offerings in the U.S. and just kind get your sense. I know you won't comment specifically on that transaction, but just your sense for the overall acquisition environment, the multiples that sellers are looking for and basically your appetite to do a deal. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: I would just say we've stated before that M&A is a piece of our capital strategy. We're particularly interested in companies with accelerating revenue growth, primarily within the U.S. $100 billion snack wheel. And certainly, are interested in companies that either complement our confectionery portfolio, our snacks business or our go-to-market. Patricia, anything you want to add to that? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: No. There's really been no change in our priorities from a (56:52) capital perspective in terms of investing in the business, and making sure we return cash to our shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. There's really been no change in that approach. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: And I think we're just always looking for propositions that are \u2013 everything we do is around creating shareholder value, whether it's on our base business or M&A. So that's always our lens. Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): To the extent that you have looked at deals up till now, do you feel like the premiums being proposed by sellers are reasonable or inflated? Any sense there would be helpful. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: You know, it's a competitive marketplace and that's about all I would say, right, continues to be competitive marketplace out there from an M&A perspective. Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Mark K. Pogharian - The Hershey Co.: Thank you for joining us today for the third quarter conference call. The Investor Relations group will be available for any follow-ups you may have. Operator : We'd like to thank everybody for their participation. Please feel free to disconnect the line at any time.",

Robert Dickerson - Deutsche Bank AG Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research Fintan Ryan - Berenberg Operator : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to The Hershey Company's Fourth Quarter 2017 Results Conference Call. My name is Erica, and I will be your conference operator today. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this call may be recorded. Thank you. Mr. Mark Pogharian, you may begin your conference. Mark Pogharian : Thank you, Erica. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to The Hershey Company's Fourth Quarter 2017 Conference Call. Michele Buck, President and CEO; and Patricia Little, Senior Vice President and CFO, will provide you with an overview of results, which will then be followed by a Q&A session. Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements, which are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2016 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the Notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes that presentation of earnings, excluding items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. As a result, we will discuss fourth quarter results of 2017, excluding net charges of $0.18 per share diluted related to business realignment activity, derivative mark-to-market gains, non-service-related pension expense and an estimated impact of a onetime mandatory tax on the previously deferred earnings on non-U.S. subsidiaries. These net charges are defined in the appendix of this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website at www.thehersheycompany.com. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges. And with all that out of the way, let me turn the call over to Michele Buck. Michele Buck : Thanks, Mark. Good morning to all of you on the phone and webcast, and a special welcome to the many Hershey employees, including our new Amplify colleagues who are listening in. As I step back and review 2017, we had a solid year, making good [indiscernible] strategic plan that strengthens our business model and positions the company for future growth. Looking back, I'm pleased that we drove our core chocolate brands with mid-single-digit growth, expanded our snacks portfolio with the acquisition of Amplify, delivered EBIT margin expansion and strong EPS growth and maintained our market share in a competitive environment. And we did this while continuing to transform the business to a position that we believe will enable us to achieve our long-term sales target during our strategic planning cycle. I'm less satisfied with our momentum slowing as we ended the year. Importantly, we understand where opportunities exist and have plans to improve upon our performance. Let me now provide you with some further color. We are fortunate to operate in a profitable and growing category in our core U.S. market. For the year ended 2017, our CMG - that's candy, mint and gum, and snacks retail takeaway increased plus 1.6%. Most of you scrutinize the IRI or Nielsen-measured channel marketplace data on a regular basis, so I don't need to tell you how choppy CPG trends continue to be from quad-to-quad. In this environment, we were able to maintain our market share while transforming the business. And being a company focused on growth as well as growth and EBIT margin expansion, I was happy that in 2017, we delivered sales growth of 1%, increased our EBIT margin by 30 basis points to 20.7% and grew EPS about 8%. And after the last several years of evaluating snack assets, I believe Amplify's scale, brand product proposition, marketplace performance and margin structure give us a strong foundation, off of which to further build. As you look across the retail box, U.S. snack real growth has been consistent, and we believe snacks consumption will continue to increase. We have the right portfolio and brands to win, and we're committed to the CMG and snacks growth strategy we outlined last March. This business model should enable us to deliver our long-term targets, which would result in increased shareholder value. Looking at full year performance. Net sales growth was slightly below the outlook we provided in October. That growth, combined with productivity and cost savings initiatives, drove EBIT margin expansion and full year EPS in line with our estimates, excluding the greater-than-expected expenses as related to M&A due diligence initiatives. And we continue to generate solid operating cash flow, about $1.2 billion, which gives us a lot of financial flexibility. We finalized the Amplify acquisition yesterday, and I am very excited about the opportunity ahead of us to bring scale and category management capabilities to the warehouse salty snack aisle. Our goal is to capture more consumer-snacking occasions with a broader portfolio of brands. So the acquisition of Amplify is a step in our journey to becoming an innovative snacking powerhouse. While preliminary, Amplify Q4 net sales and EBITDA were in the guidance ranges they provided in November. Additionally, January is tracking in line with plan, which gives us increased confidence in our outlook for the business in 2018 and beyond. Amplify will continue to be based out of its current offices and operate as a standalone business as we look to maintain and leverage the entrepreneur mindset embedded in the culture, as well as the benefits of scale and synergies for certain functions that Hershey brings to the table. We'll also share knowledge and insights between Amplify and our emerging brands group. I look forward to sharing more of our snack strategy with you at the CAGNY conference in a few weeks. Turning now to Hershey's performance. Our Q4 U.S. combined CMG and snacks retail takeaway was about 1%. As expected, this was greater than fourth quarter net sales growth due to the timing of total sales we discussed last quarter. For the full year 2017, total Hershey U.S. retail takeaway increased plus 1.2% and was in line with U.S. net sales. Looking at just CMG, both the category and Hershey, increased about 1.7% for the full year. Our growth and industry-leading 30.6% CMG market share puts us in an enviable position as it provides us with financial flexibility to invest in the business, expand margins and hold a leadership role with major retail customers. For the 12 weeks ended December 31, CMG category growth was plus 1.7%. Due to the timing of our programming and innovation and consistent with our plan, Hershey Q4 CMG performance lagged the category, with market share off 0.3 points. As the first quarter progresses, we expect marketplace trends to improve, driven by the excitement in the marketplace for Hershey's Gold, which will have merchandising and program tie-ins with the Winter Olympics, which begin this month and an early Easter. Importantly, within the combined chocolate and non-chocolate candy segments where we derive the majority of our U.S. sales, full year category growth was plus 2.5%. Recall, this is greater than total snack real growth of nearly 2% and CMG category growth of plus 1.7%, which includes softer performance related to the gum and mint category. Our core chocolate brands, Reese's, Hershey's, Kit Kat and Kisses, continue to drive growth, and I'm particularly pleased with their marketplace performance this year. The combined retail takeaway on these power brands in Q4 and for the full year, increased about 2% and 5%, respectively, with market share of these combined brands up in both periods. As we discussed in prior quarters, this was partially offset by planned declines on select chocolate and non-chocolate candy brands as we focus on reducing complexity and improving overall velocity rates at retail. We have plans to improve the performance of select variety candy brands in 2018, and expect them to contribute positively to marketplace performance this year. For example, work started already on the Twizzlers brand, and early results are promising as Q4 retail takeaway was up 2.3%. More on this as we work our way through the year. I was pleased with our innovation this year, particularly Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch and our snack products. We expanded our snack mix and Snack Bites products with the launch of Hershey's and Reese's Popped Snack Mix and Chocolate Dipped Pretzels, primarily in large-format, take-home bags. While early, results are encouraging. Trial and repeat are in line with our expectations and consumer reaction is positive when our brands are merchandised in the snacks aisle. The transition for lay-down bags to stand-up pouches on our core chocolate candy products is progressing. New retail-ready packaging began shipping to one of our largest customers in the fourth quarter, and select expansion will occur in 2018. This initiative enables product to get on the shelf quicker with less in-store labor and improved shopability in the aisle. While these packaging initiatives have an impact on gross margin in 2018, we believe this is the right long-term investments for our brand and business as it should result in improved shelf presence and visibility. We feel good about 2018. We have made solid progress against key capabilities, such as our multiyear ERP program and e-commerce. We have a dedicated cross-functional team responsible for the strategies and execution of our e-commerce plans, headed by a new senior executive who has a deep CPG sector digital e-commerce experience. This group is responsible for the strategies and execution of our e-commerce plans in developing the next generation of online impulse solutions. We're working with all the key strategic partners and we'll be validating and testing concepts in 2018 that we believe will lead to a sustainable business model. Additionally, stand-up and retail-ready packaging as well as innovation, such as Hershey's Gold, Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch Triple Chocolate and Reese's Outrageous, bring the right level of brand newness and variety to the category. We are excited about our innovation of these core chocolate brands and platforms, as well as new advertising campaigns and in-store merchandising that should drive consumer engagement and growth across our portfolio that we believe puts us in a position to deliver on our net sales and marketplace objectives. Now for an update on our International and Other segment. Net sales for the quarter were relatively in line with our estimates. Our strategy and execution in the marketplace in 2017 enabled us to generate full year operating income of $11.5 million in this segment. After being in the red in 2015 and 2016, we now have our sights on eclipsing the 2014 operating income high from this business. I continue to be pleased with our performance in Mexico, Brazil and India as combined Q4 and full year constant currency net sales growth in these markets increased 11% in both periods. In China, we're executing against the Margin for Growth program we discussed on March 1 that should result in a sustainable ongoing business model. This efficiency and effectiveness initiative is progressing nicely and is on track. We're optimizing our in-country supply chain and streamlining the operating model as we strike the right balance between in-country investments and near-term market opportunities. As expected, China fourth quarter net sales declined about 30%, driven by volume declines related to SKU optimization and our focus on pack types that meet marketplace velocity thresholds. I'm pleased with the progress we are making and expect our focus on profitable growth in this segment to result in continued operating income improvement in 2018. Now to wrap up. Confections is one of the largest segments within the $100 billion U.S. snack market, and the acquisition of Amplify broadens our participation in salty snacks, one of the fastest growing sub segments. Our strong U.S. marketplace presence and solid financial position give us the flexibility to smartly invest in confectionery and other warehouse salty snacks, as well as in the capabilities that will give us a competitive edge at retail and with consumers. We believe the foundation we have set in 2017 and the investments we're continuing to make this year are in the areas of the business that set us up for continued growth. Investments such as enterprise resource planning system and a refreshed approach to analytical processes should enable operational effectiveness and efficiency and be a differentiator in the marketplace over the next few years that drives top line growth and market share gains. With the goal of increasing margins over the long-term, via both cost control, and importantly, top line growth, I anticipate we'll continue to increase shareholder value. Patricia will cover the details, but we're in the process of evaluating the cash benefit of tax reform and believe that it will complement our existing cash usage priorities. I am confident in our business model and strategies, and I'm excited about the opportunity in 2018. We remain focused on driving growth in our core confectionery business, while expanding our presence in salty snacks. I believe our combination of 5% to 7% sales growth, Amplify accretion as well as Margin for Growth savings will generate solid base business EPS growth within our long-term target and double digits when accounting for incremental brand building and the new tax rate. I'll now turn it over to Patricia who will provide you with details on our financial results. Patricia Little : Thank you, Michele. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. As anticipated, fourth quarter net sales of $1.9 billion declined 1.6% versus last year, including a 0.4 point benefit from favorable foreign currency translation. Volume was up 2.3 points, and net price realization was a 0.3 point benefit. As previously discussed, the expected decline in net sales was partially due to the timing of shipments last quarter and the launch of Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch in the year-ago period. For the full year 2017, net sales increased 1%, including an FX benefit of 0.2 points. Adjusted earnings per share diluted came in at $1.03, a decline of about 12% versus last year, primarily due to lower year-over-year sales. Versus our outlook last quarter, note that corporate costs related to merger and acquisition due diligence initiatives were greater than our estimate. Excluding this, we would've delivered full year EPS growth closer to the guidance we provided in October, as we were able to offset the lower volume and the gross margin softness with SG&A savings. By segment, Q4 North America net sales declined 0.9% versus the same period last year, including favorable foreign currency translation of 0.4 points. Volume was up 0.6 points and net price realization was a 0.3 point benefit. The decline was partially due to the timing of shipments discussed last quarter as well as the tough comp in the year-ago period. Total International and Other segment net sales for the fourth quarter declined 5.4% versus last year, including a 1.2 point benefit from foreign currency exchange. Volume was up 6.6 points in line with our estimates, driven by planned decline from China. Turning to margins. Adjusted gross margin - adjusted gross profit declined 5.6% resulting in adjusted gross margin of 42.7%, a decline of 180 basis points versus the fourth quarter of last year. Supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives, as well as slightly lower input costs, were more than offset by cost increases, which included unfavorable sales mix and fixed cost absorption of overhead given lower volumes, unexpected manufacturing variances, and higher freight and distribution costs and other supply chain expenses. Given Q4 results, full year 2017 gross margin was in line with last year and less than our expectation of about a 25 basis point increase. We have good visibility into our 2018 input cost basket and don't expect inflation. Additionally, we have productivity and cost savings initiative in place that should offset the higher packaging costs that we discussed last quarter and unfavorable mix. As a result, we expect adjusted gross margin in 2018 to be about the same as last year. This includes Amplify, which has a gross margin profile similar to Hershey. Adjusted operating profit in the fourth quarter of $325.1 million resulted in operating profit margin of 16.8%, a decline of 240 basis points. As expected, SG&A productivity and cost savings were more than offset by the decline in gross profit as well as higher go-to-market expenses and corporate-related costs. In Q4, North America advertising and related consumer marketing increased about 3%, in line with our estimate. This was offset by the planned decline in the International and Other segment, resulting in consolidated advertising and marketing decline of 3%. As we looked at 2018, advertising on our CMG brands will be about the same as last year. Total Hershey advertising and related consumer marketing, excluding Amplify, will be slightly down as we focus our spend on brands that have the highest ROIs. Now let me provide a brief update on our International and Other segment. On a constant currency basis, net sales declined 6.6% and was relatively in line with our forecast. The China supply chain transformation is on track, with a majority of the work expected to be complete by the end of 2018. The reorganization within SG&A functions, which began in Q2, is still progressing. The benefit from this work is evident in segment operating income. Our SKU analysis and operators efforts negatively impacted gross sales or volume in 2017, and this work will continue in 2018. In Q4, as Michele referenced, China net sales declined about 30%, driven by our focus on pack types that meet certain marketplace velocity thresholds. The SKUs that we're driving within our four focused core provinces slightly grew full year market share. Importantly, preliminary results indicate that China chocolate category sales in brick-and-mortar will be up low single digits on a percentage basis versus last year, while e-commerce is expected to grow to around 15%. We expect similar category growth rates in 2018. Fourth quarter International and Other segment operating loss of $15 million was about the same as the year-ago period and in line with our forecast. Combined operating income and margin improvements in Mexico, Brazil and India were solid. Performance in China was [indiscernible] estimate with Margin for Growth program savings more than offset by the timing of select investments and marketplace expenses. As a result, operating results in China more than offset the combined operating income in our other international markets. Our 2018 plan is to continue to drive a strong profit-focused mentality in this segment, driven by measured sales growth and Margin for Growth program savings. Moving down the P&L, interest expense of $25.8 million increased $2.4 million versus last year. For the full year, interest expense was $98.3 million and in line with our estimate. In 2018, interest expense is expected to be in the $130 million to $140 million range, including debt related to the acquisition of Amplify. The adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 15.5% versus 28.2% in the year-ago period. The decline was primarily due to the timing of investment tax credits and favorable foreign tax rate differential. This resulted in a full year tax rate of 26.7% that was in line with our estimate. The recently passed U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 will have a favorable impact on our net income, earnings per share diluted and cash flow. Like most companies, we continue to evaluate the details within this legislation. But it is clearly favorable versus our 2017 effective tax rate. Our preliminary estimate indicates Hershey's 2018 effective tax rate should be around 20% to 22%. The company is evaluating the cash benefit of tax reform and believes that it will complement its existing cash usage priorities, such as business investment, including both brand building and capital expenditures that result in growth, dividend, share buybacks and debt reduction. The lower tax rate and the brand building reinvestment is included in the 2018 outlook. The fourth quarter and full year other income and expense was $42.1 million in $65.7 million, respectively, and was primarily driven by investment tax credits. In 2018, we'll continue with that strategy and estimate that investment tax credit expense will be in the $60 million to $65 million range. For the fourth quarter of 2017, average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 212.6 million shares, resulting in adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.03, a 12% decline versus a year ago. Total capital additions, including software, for the fourth quarter and full year were $109 million and $257.7 million, respectively. For the full year 2018, we estimate that CapEx will be in the $330 million to $350 million range, including Amplify needs of $10 million to $15 million, supporting increased capacity for U.S. core chocolate brands that are growing mid-single digits, and in capabilities related to our multiyear ERP implementation. Total adjusted depreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter and full year were $67.5 million and $255 million, respectively. The company did not repurchase any common shares against the $500 million share repurchase authorization approved in January of 2016 or against the $100 million share repurchase authorization approved in October 2017. There is $100 million remaining on the January 2016 authorization. Furthermore, in the fourth quarter, the company did not repurchase any common shares in connection with the exercise of stock options. Dividends paid in the fourth quarter were $134 million and $526 million for the full year. Now to wrap up. As Michele summarized, in 2018, we had a lot of variety, news and innovation in place. Hershey's Gold, in an instant consumable pack type, is off to a good start. The take-home package launches later in Q2 and should be a benefit in the second half of the year to both net sales and retail takeaway. The same holds true for Reese's Outrageous, which also launches late in Q2. However, headwinds such as a shorter Easter season in 2018 and our continued SKU optimization in the International and Other segment, will pressure sales growth. As a result, in 2018, organic net sales are expected to increase in the range of slightly up to 2% versus last year. Additionally, the acquisition of Amplify will be about a five-point benefit and foreign currency exchange is expected to be negligible, resulting in reported net sales growth of about 5% to 7%. As I stated earlier, we expect adjusted gross margin to be about the same as last year. And as we discussed on March 1, we'll continue to make investments in the businesses that we believe will improve our go-to-market capabilities and industry-leading knowledge and insights. Additionally, we're reinvesting a portion of the EPS benefit related to tax reform. However, Margin for Growth program savings and Amplify accretion should enable us to maintain EBIT margin in 2018. Therefore, including the lower tax rate discussed earlier, we estimate 2018 adjusted earnings per share diluted to be in the $5.33 to $5.43 range, an increase of 12% to 14% versus last year. Thank you for your time this morning, and we'll now take any questions you may have. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We'll go first to the line of Robert Moskow from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Robert Moskow : So I guess, the theme of the call here is reinvestment, and I guess higher costs also. When I think about just your core guidance for 2018, just on the core confectionery business, is it fair to say that you're guiding here to kind of flat operating income growth just for the core business? And is that because of the headwinds you're kind of talking about? Reinvesting a portion of the tax benefit, the higher freight cost and then also the shorter Easter and the SKU optimization? And then maybe you could help me understand, if weren't for those Easter and SKU things, do you think you would be closer to your normal algorithm for the core business or not? Michele Buck : I'm going to let Patricia handle that one. Patricia Little : Yes. So thanks. On the margin side, I think it'll be - I think you have a good take on it. But I will point out that that's not going to translate into income, because obviously, with the growth that we do expect in our core category, that will drive higher dollar income for us. Michele Buck : Relative to your question on shorter Easter and SKU rep, I assume, Rob, you're asking the impact on the top line. And certainly, those do create some pressure as we look at the delivery on the top line. Certainly, a longer Easter benefits not only our total takeaway as well as our share. As we look at our plans for '18, what we're really focused on [indiscernible] growth we've seen on the core brand that is low to mid-single digits, really start to activate part of the portfolio around some of our variety brands, which we have not been doing. So we're going to optimize our spending to activate those. And we started doing that in Q4 and started to see nice results in a lot of the brands that we activated. And then a real focus on stabilizing some of where the leaks have been, particularly around the emerging brands. But the combination of Easter and the SKU definitely creates about a one point headwind for us. Robert Moskow : And can I ask a follow-up? A lot of us have seen data that shows that your biggest competitor in the U.S., Mars, has regained a lot of market share. I found it hard to determine whether that was just a comparison issue versus a year ago when you had the Cookie Layer Crunch launch. What are you seeing differently from your biggest competitor? And has that factored into your plans for '18 at all? Michele Buck : Yes. So I'd start by saying, hey, it's always our goal to gain share and we're pleased that we were able to maintain share despite heavy competitive activity. Certainly, I feel better about the first part of the year where, you're right, Cookie Layer Crunch was a big driver for us in terms of helping really to generate the share gains we saw in that part of the year. As much as we'd like our performance to be consistent on a quarter-to-quarter basis based in our programming and competitive programming, it doesn't always shake out that way. So what we always focus back on is the key levers that drive the category are those same levers that I think all the competitors need to focus on, which is do we have the right activation of our brands from an advertising and consumer marketing, do we have the right invest - innovation to drive each piece of the portfolio and superior execution to really drive displays and especially focusing at winning with the customers who are winning trips. So that's really our focus, and I think that's probably our competitors' focus as well. Operator : We'll go next to the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. John Baumgartner : Michele, just in terms of the packaging change. You mentioned that it's a long-term investment, but it's also a drag on gross margin. So is there a way to think about how far along you are in making these packaging conversions? Is it still an appreciable drag in 2019 and beyond? And have you seen any real benefits thus far in terms of shelf placement at retail or in-store to sell through? Michele Buck : Yes. So that's a great question. So the way I would think about packaging is packaging is a lever that we are focused on improving in the marketplace. And we certainly believe the upgrade we did in packaging created some nice momentum for us versus the lay-down packaging that we had on shelf. However, we really view the packaging as an evolution. And what you're going to see is us continue to improve upon that packaging to make it even stronger [indiscernible] out of it. And as we do that, really, try to optimize the total P&L impact around that [indiscernible]. So it is out there, but you'll see more to come from us. Certainly, it is a drag right now on gross margin. John Baumgartner : Okay. And just a follow-up on ad spend. Hershey's ad spend peaked in 2013, both in absolute dollars and relative to sales. And it's also coincided with the 20% increase in trade promotion over that period. So it seems like the trends here is pretty clear. As you think about how the category is evolving, how do you strike that balance between promo and ad spend? I mean, promo does kind of increase structurally, does that just kind of place a ceiling on gross margin over time? Michele Buck : I think we're always striving to get that right balance between advertising and trade, and we think both are critical. So we're doing a lot of work on trying to optimize marketing mix. As you look at 2018, what you're going to see is we're going to optimize our spending on DMEs even more. You'll see us probably be about flat in terms of our advertising support on our core, but really optimizing our lines across the rest of the portfolio; investing in the variety of brands, which are highly profitable; and kind of rightsizing the investment on some of the smaller emerging brands and rebalancing between DMEs and SG&A. So for example, some of the emerging snack brands, feet on the street to build displays on some of those brands, we're going to get more from that than advertising. On trade, we're - we really look at the benefit based on everything that we've seen on trade. As much as we can drive display, it's really just display that drives that activity. So we try to make sure that we are being nimble and constantly optimizing through strategic revenue management to get a price that's appropriate to drive display but not to be giving away product and creating a deflationary pressure that doesn't - that just subsidize an already planned purchase. So that's the way to balance there. Operator : We'll go next to the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar : I think Hershey laid out the Margin for Growth targets at your Investor Day last year, and it was, I think, 200 basis points of operating margin improvement by 2019. And I think it was expected to be pretty evenly split at the time between cost of goods and SG&A, with much of it coming in the years of '18 and '19. So in the context, I guess, of the flat gross margin expectation for '18, I'm just trying to get a sense of are those benchmarks still right? And if so, I guess, given the gross margin piece, what's sort of making up the difference, if you will, to get those 200 basis points by '19? Michele Buck : Andrew, I'll start with just one comment, and I'm going to turn it over to Patricia to really dig into those numbers. I will tell you that as we look at our performance for Margin for Growth, we have over delivered on the SG&A component of our expectations. We thought that was going to be a difficult piece of the work. And as we really did some - made some tough decisions, we actually found we were able to [indiscernible] a culture that enabled us to really deliver even more than we expected there. But I'll let Patricia do a step-back to talk a little bit more holistically about it. Patricia Little : Yes. So, you're right, we expect the savings to come both through the cost of goods as well as SG&A. A lot of the improvement in the International piece you see coming through the cost of goods, although there's an SG&A piece of that as well. In U.S. business, I think it's a little more weighted to SG&A, especially as we look at both the corporate functions as well as our commercial functions. In general, I would say that, as we look forward, it is a - we really do need the sales that we're driving investment against to help us deliver that leverage looking forward. Operator : We'll go next to the line of Steven Strycula from UBS. Steven Strycula : I'll start with a question on Cadbury license, actually. I wanted to see, you guys have put some - a little bit of money here over the brand over like the last 12 to 18 months. Wanted to see what do you think the brand awareness of that is in, call it, the mass premium market? And what is opportunity for - to scale that in the U.S. longer term? And if it doesn't make sense, how do you think about monetizing it? Then I have a follow-up. Michele Buck : I mean, I'd tell you that the strongest piece of that Cadbury business for us is the seasonal component. The Cadbury Eggs are a phenomenal piece of our seasonal portfolio, whether it's at Halloween or Easter, they're unique in the marketplace. And so our focus is really there. We are not prioritizing building the everyday mass premium nature of that brand. But there's tremendous value in the seasonal piece, so we believe that's the right focus. Steven Strycula : Okay. And then to just follow-up on Andrew's question. For the 2019 margin targets, should we think about, just given what's happened in the industry since you've announced - held your Analyst Day, that the reinvestment pressures are just a little bit higher so maybe the net effect of it all is just a little bit more muted than maybe it was last spring. Michele Buck : I think that's fair. I mean, I think we see a path of getting to the range that we laid out in March. But we do think that it might take us just a bit longer to get there. We see a path to the low end of the range. And yes, we're going to make those constant decisions of balancing getting there with making the right decisions on the business. Mark Pogharian : Yes, Steve. I think, I mean, we've been very good over time of maintaining and increasing EBIT margin, it's certainly always been a focus and a hallmark of the company. So I think we'll continue to make progress. We'll continue to make progress there. But as Patricia alluded to earlier, certainly sales in 2017 being a little bit lighter, lost a little bit of leverage there. But there's still a path to get there, and I think we'll talk a little bit more about that in CAGNY. Michele Buck : Right. And our goal is still industry-leading EBIT margin. And we feel confident we'll be there. Operator : We'll go next to the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. David Palmer : Just a couple of times in the earnings release you mentioned unfavorable sales mix in regard to the quarter, but also 2018. Could you give a little detail on this? How much of a drag is - are you talking about this with regard to margins or revenue per volume, and the degrees that it comes from category channel or pack type? Michele Buck : So the biggest drivers on that would be certainly the snacks portfolio, which is lower margin than our core. And then as instant consumables, particularly in the second half of the year as we were lapping - had weaker instant consumable innovation than we did the prior year. David Palmer : And just to follow up on the previous comments about brand building reinvestment. You said that was included in your EPS guidance. But I was unclear about how much of that is going to be an offset to your tax rate benefit from an EPS perspective in '18? Mark Pogharian : Yes. I mean, we didn't disclose that, Dave, for competitive reasons. But I mean, if you're trying to put everything on an apples-to-apples basis, I mean, I would certainly start with - look, the base business, we're always looking to get to 6% to 8% EPS growth. So use whatever tax rate you want from last year to kind of normalize it, and you'll get back into it and get a sensitivity that way. Michele Buck : Yes. Operator : We'll go next to the line of David Driscoll from Citi. David Driscoll : On the fourth quarter, the revenue trends ended weak. Organic, minus two. Can you just talk about the first quarter? And does that fourth quarter trend kind of give us a little guidance here that Q1 is also going to be soft and that really sales growth guidance is weighted to the second half of 2018? Michele Buck : Yes. So we expect that we'll see some sequential improvement versus Q4 as we get into the year. But I think it's very fair to say that the strongest performance will be in the back half of the year. Certainly, the first half of the year will be lapping the long Easter, which that alone creates a differential in terms of the first half, second half performance. And then the pacing of our innovation. We've got gold that'll be coming out the blocks pretty strong; and then the Reese's Outrageous, which is our other innovation, is really more midyear. So I think the way you're thinking about it is accurate. David Driscoll : And then, Michele, on the long term revenue objective of 2% to 4% organic, in light of the '18 guidance, do you still think that long-term objective is valid? Michele Buck : I do. We are in the process of transforming the business model to respond to the changes we're seeing in the marketplace. I feel like we're making really good progress on some of those capabilities that are going to be big enablers around building our digital commerce business where we've brought in some really - a really strong leader, experienced leader in that space. That's going to help us tremendously. We have key investments in capacity, and we've been a bit constrained over the past 18 months with some of the demand on our core brands butting up against capacity. We're making investments, we have a Reese line that just came online now [indiscernible] that comes online later on the year. We've got Amplify that we have a lot of confidence in. So we continue to feel good about our ability to get to that long-term sales guidance over our strategic planning horizon. David Driscoll : Yes. Patricia, two quick follow-ups for you just to clean up a couple of items. On the tax reform, so you're saying that some of the tax reform benefit was reinvested back into brand building. But I just want to be clear. I believe the plan laid out at Analyst Day was always for reinvestment in advertising. So are you saying that there is even greater advertising reinvestments because of the benefits of tax reform? That's kind of the first one. And the second one is just Margin for Growth, $60 million in '18. That literally has to go against the higher costs, so we're going to see flat EBIT margins. Do I have that part right? Patricia Little : Yes. You do have that part right. And on the tax reform piece, I would say that our focus is really more around capabilities, things like investment in the e-commerce that Michele mentioned, focusing on those capacity improvements, some technology improvements that we want to give to our sales and marketing areas. And that's really where we see the opportunity, as tax reform comes in, to evaluate good ideas and potentially pull them ahead. Less around direct advertising is just the one thing I would make sure you're clear on. Operator : We'll go next to Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : Just a couple of quick ones from me. First, I just want to make sure I was clear. In terms of the earnings growth build for 2018, share repurchases are not part of the EPS build, is that correct? Michele Buck : Patricia, do you want to cover that? Patricia Little : Yes, we make assumption as we look at our EPS build of a share repurchase program that's really normalized. If you look at the past several years, we have sort of an assumption that we make around sort of our standard share repurchase as a nominal planning piece. It's not a big driver of our EPS. And I'll remind you that we also always repurchase shares related to option programs and other equity grants. Bryan Spillane : Okay. And then, I mean, I don't know if I missed it. But did you give 2018 depreciation and amortization? Patricia Little : We don't give that. We give the CapEx piece. You're welcome to give Mark a call and - if you need more details on that. Bryan Spillane : Okay. And then just the last one. In terms of the decision to reinvest or spend more this year because you've had some tax savings. Would you have made these same investments if you didn't have the tax savings? It just sounds like the things you're spending on are sort of needs in the business. And I'm just curious to know if you're actually executing these things because you had the savings or you would've done this anyway? Michele Buck : I think that these are important investments in the business. And really, the way we're looking at it is it gives us an opportunity to accelerate enacting them, and therefore, accelerate our project progress to our strategic goals. Operator : And we'll go next to the line of Alexia Howard from Bernstein. Alexia Howard : Can I ask about the China business and the International outlook in general for 2018. It looks as though things deteriorated profit wise at the back end of the year in 2017. So I'm wondering if you can just give us some color about when - whether we expect that whole business, China in particular, to get back to at least breakeven during the course of 2018. And I'll pass it on. Michele Buck : Yes. So that deterioration was largely due to some of the trade spending associated with the Chinese New Year. So I wouldn't look at that as a trend carrying forward. We feel really good about the profitability improvements that we've made in that sector across all of International. As we mentioned, we've really hit kind of a high mark here in terms of what we're able to deliver with that $11 million of OI last year. And we're expecting significant OI improvement this year that, as we said, we think we'll eclipse the 2014 previous high that we've had in terms of operating income for that sector. Operator : And we'll go next to the line of Rob Dickerson from Deutsche Bank. Robert Dickerson : I just had a question on strategy on the core brands relative to the noncore brands. We could kind of in the data set that - and what your referenced this morning, the core brands continue to do fairly well within chocolate. So that would - if they're growing, let's say, at the same rate as the category or above the category, they might even be taking some shares, especially what we've seen out of Reese's. But then you also have all your other brands within chocolate, and they seem to be more of a drag. So I'm just curious, as we look out in a few years, if you say - let's say, in '18, then probably more of the spending or marketing would go to higher ROI brands that are perhaps larger, you'd get a better lift. Like how are you thinking about your other kind of non-power brands within U.S. chocolate? Michele Buck : Yes, I'm glad you brought up the question because we actually see that as one of our key priorities in 2018. So we absolutely grew share on all of those core chocolate brands throughout the year. So we're really pleased with the performance we've seen there. And you're right, the investments on those brands are easy because the ROIs are so big because of the scale of the brand. But we're really excited and think we have tremendous opportunity for select variety brands, brands like Twizzlers, Almond Joy, where we have a unique product in the marketplace that really owns a certain space. And we believe that we have an opportunity to better balance our DME spending. And so as you look in 2018, that's absolutely where we're going to have a focus. And if you look into the future, it's continuing to have some level of support against some of those variety brands. That benefits us not only from the lift you get from advertising, but there's a holistic package of where you advertise and then you drag velocity, you actually get greater distribution or avoid distribution losses. And we think that's an opportunity for us that we haven't fully taken advantage of because we do have that breadth of portfolio. So that's definitely a focus for us in '18. Continue the growth in the core, activate variety and then stabilize those emerging brands, which actually had been declining. Robert Dickerson : Okay, great. And then just a quick question. Obviously, you didn't - I'm not sure if you did or not, but you obviously didn't show it, to not purchase the Nestle assets. Just any thought around what you saw and you didn't see in them, kind of how that progressed, et cetera. Michele Buck : So obviously, we can't talk about what we - any activity that we've done or not done in the M&A space. I would say, we've competed versus those brands in the marketplace over the life of the company, and so I think we're well familiar with that portfolio. And as we always focus on how we drive our business and also looking at what might happen in the marketplace, we do that every year, and this will be no different. So we will continue to run our playbook in terms of driving our own business. Operator : And we'll go next to the line of Matthew Grainger. Matthew Grainger : I guess, two quick follow-ups. Patricia, I might be asking for more detail here than you want to give, so please feel free to shoot me down. But I guess, with respect to the flat gross margin expectation, there's a lot of moving parts, and I think both we and investors have tried to decompose this, but you have positive productivity, input cost deflation and then the offset from negative mix and higher packaging costs. Is there any, I guess, directionals there? I guess, any assistance you can give us in trying to dimensionalize those puts and takes in terms of where gross margin might be solely on the basis of productivity flow-through and input cost deflation if you weren't also working through these packaging costs and mixed headwinds. Patricia Little : Yes, I probably won't get into numbers, but I can certainly help you with the pieces a little bit. Over the long run, we expect supply chain productivity to equal, I'll say, offset base inflation, excluding commodities, or beat it. So that would be our goal every year. We don't hit that every year. I'll say that this year and looking forward to next year, we have had some headwinds. And let me just talk about them a little bit. You mentioned two of them in terms of the packaging and mix. But I'll also say that we are seeing the same sort of pressures on freight that many people in the industry are having as we - and I'll also say that as we strive to hit ever-higher service delivery goals, we will prioritize that, getting the product onto the shelf even if that means some extra cost in either our manufacturing or distribution network. So that's a piece of that. And we also, I think, have an opportunity - and it's been a little bit of a hit on us on planning because we have seen, as actual takeaway or sales deviate from our plans, the effect can also drive some pressure in terms of our manufacturing or distribution network. Michele mentioned, and I think this is really importantly, on the opposite side of that, we are adding this new capacity, we've been very tight on capacity and that's been one of the issues. And we're also working to manage our complexity better. And I think that those are better improvements that will help us in the full year '18. And when you add all that together, our best estimate is that we'll be about flat. Matthew Grainger : Okay, great. And I guess, I'll leave it at one more follow-up. But from a freight cost perspective specifically, clearly, it's not getting better yet, so unclear how worse maybe the cost issues there could ultimately be. Can you give us a sense, just as a percent of cost of goods sold, a rough range? Just what percent of your operating costs or your cost of goods are - sort of fall specifically into that bucket of transportation and shipping? Patricia Little : Yes, Matt. We don't give that specific breakdowns of the pieces of our cost of goods sold. Mark Pogharian : Yes, Matt. There was a slide on March for - that kind of give a little bit of pie chart or breakdown of materials and packaging, and then I think there was a little distribution and overhead in there. So take a look at that pie chart and it may help you out a little bit. Operator : And we'll take our next question from the line of Jonathan Feeney from Consumer Edge. Jonathan Feeney : Two questions, please. On SKU rationalization, I think a few of us have been through at least one cycle of just the natural kind of expansion and contraction of SKUs around the edges. So I guess I'm wondering, how much is total SKU count up at Hershey, roughly, just, say, over past couple of years? And within that, how much what you're doing right now as far you taking the opportunity to make - improve your velocity, get that assortment right, is a result of things going on at the retailers level, things they want? And how much of it is just kind of the age-old balance you're always trying to find between optimizing that revenue? What's new that's causing you to rationalize SKUs? And my second question is, just trying to get a sense so we can understand this, what kind of tax rate were you planning on for 2018 as of early December after your planning process but before you knew what Congress was going to do? Michele Buck : Patricia, do you want to talk a little bit about tax? I can throw out a few comments around SKUs, and then I'll ask Patricia to comment on that as well. As we are prioritizing customer service, we are really trying to make sure that we're being very focused on [indiscernible] of the entire business and the productivity of these SKUs. And so as you think about SKUs, what you should think about is not just how do we take out the less - lower velocity SKUs but also we're looking at merchandising vehicles that create complexity and how we really simplify those. And you should also think about that happening both in our U.S. business but also in our International business. So in both areas of the business, there's a real focus on that to maximize efficiency and make sure that we're really then able to develop and deliver even greater customer service. So I'd say that, hey, over time, you rationalize SKUs and then SKUs work their way back into the system, and I think it's a constant process that you really need to clean up. And I think part of it is just making sure that we're tighter about what we are willing to do on customer-by-customer, each-by-each basis because sometimes you become a little too accommodating. Patricia, anything you'd add to that? Patricia Little : No, I think that's right. We really are thinking about it as managing the SKU count and managing our complexity that it drives. I think that's the important takeaway. On tax, we've always set the model at 27% to 28% tax number long term. We've tended to beat that. I have to say that I think we might've beat it '18 as well, but honestly, tax reform came along and got us focused on that instead of figuring out more tax planning strategies. So that quickly became our focus in the last part of last year. Operator : And we'll go next to the line of Fintan Ryan with Berenberg. Fintan Ryan : Just a few questions, please. Firstly, on the environment you're seeing with deflationary raw materials - the sugar, cocoa, should be a benefit. But are you seeing any signs of increase of competitors, potentially putting down pricing or any softness or increased promotional activity as a result of those lower input costs? And then secondly, I think you did mention weakness in sugar confectionery and gum, and one of your competitors has also mentioned that quite recently. But just from your perspective, what can be done to get those sugar and gum confectioneries back to growth? This - do you think this is more of a cyclical downturn? Or is it more sort of structural change of consumer preferences, ultimately? Michele Buck : I mean, I'd start with relative to big competitors using any kind of deflationary raw material cost to increase promotion, I would tell you that, over time, in this category, that's not usually a behavior that we tend to see. I would say we've seen it more a little bit here or there, particularly maybe with some of the smaller competitors in the sweet, sugar area of the category over time. But that's not something that we generally see. So I'm not seeing any more changes there than we do any year in terms of promotional changes. Patricia Little : And also just add that, well, some of our input costs are down, others are up. And what we said is that we don't see that deflation for next year. Michele Buck : What was your second question, I'm sorry? Fintan Ryan : Just what visibility do you have on the improvement of the sugar confectionery and gum categories? And is this cyclical sort of softness in the category? Or do you think there's more sort of structural factors at play? Michele Buck : I would say on sugar confectionery, we've seen pretty strong performance on that segment of the category. And as we look at gum, our own business, we've done exceptionally well in the marketplace and have gained share. So I think it tend - those segments, like chocolate, tend to just be about having the right innovation in the category, having the right new news. And I think, for each of those segments, the years when that happens, you'd tend to see [indiscernible] and a strengthening of that segment. And I think the segment - the brands within those segments that have done that are seeing a lot of growth. Mark Pogharian : Great. Thank you for your time today, and we will see all of you in CAGNY in a few weeks. Operator : We'd like to thank everybody for their participation on today's conference tell. Please feel free to disconnect at any time.",

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Michele. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. And thank you, Melissa and a special welcome to you as the head of our Investor Relations team. For those of you who haven't had the chance to spend time with Melissa yet, Melissa has deep knowledge of our business and the marketplace and a strong financial acumen. I think those of you in the investment community will find Melissa a great resource given that expertise and her very straightforward approach. Now to the business at hand. We delivered first quarter net sales and EPS both in line with our expectations. Constant currency net sales increased 4.4% for the first quarter including a 340 basis point benefit from the Amplify acquisition. EPS of $1.41 increased 8.5% compared to the first quarter of last year. We continue to make progress against our key strategic focus areas, driving growth in our core confection business, expanding breadth in snacking, reallocating resources to expand margins, and investing to strengthen capabilities. Our core brands continue to grow behind balanced activation and investment. Our Amplify acquisition is on track, delivering Q1 as planned and is now expected to be $0.08 to $0.12 EPS accretive in 2018. Our international business delivered another quarter of profitable growth and we are investing in new capacity and capabilities for future sustainable growth. We generated strong earnings results for the quarter, although we got there differently than we had originally planned. We had anticipated gross margin contraction in the first quarter due to higher freight and logistics costs as well as incremental investments in trade and packaging. However, this contraction was greater than we expected due to unfavorable mix, cost of complexity via incremental supply chain touch points and waste, as well as higher input costs. Overall first quarter gross margin declined 260 basis points compared to the prior year period. As a result, we are now expecting full-year gross margin to decline around 125 basis points versus prior year. You have heard us comment over the years that we are a gross margin focused company, so reversing these declines is a high priority for us and is central to driving profitable growth. We are taking swift action to mitigate these challenges. First, we are further increasing our supply chain capacity and flexibility as well as investing in improved forecasting tools by shifting our planned tax reinvestment spend from SG&A to capital expenditure. We believe this will address some of the margin pressures we are experiencing and better position us for profitable growth in the future. Second, we are expanding our SKU rationalization program to the U.S. This effort is in line with our goal to reduce U.S. business complexity and cost (04:55). We feel confident in these efforts given the significant progress we've made in our international businesses on a similar initiative. We think there is great opportunity to capitalize on our ongoing organization work to reduce complexity and enhance margins by providing an even higher level of service and product assortment to our customers. In concert with our SKU rationalization efforts, we will leverage our best-in-class category management capabilities to minimize any sales impact and optimize the shelf with our fastest turning items. We believe this portfolio and shelf transformation is the right long-term initiative to drive profitable growth for us and our retailers. Therefore, we have chosen to rebalance some priorities in the second half, which will result in slightly less but more profitable sales. As a result of this decision, we now expect to be within our organic net sales guidance but towards the low end of our previously communicated range of slightly up to 2% for 2018. At Hershey we have a strong track record of consistently delivering our bottom line without compromising key business initiatives and investments and we plan to do so again this year. Therefore, we are reaffirming our EPS guidance of $5.33 to $5.43. We expect our gross margin headwinds will be offset by improved SG&A and taxes, specifically about half of the recovery will be from delivering the high end of our Margin for Growth target and greater than anticipated Amplify accretion via accelerated synergies and lower deal amortization, about a quarter from a more favorable full-year tax rate of approximately 19% to 20% versus the previous guidance of around 20% to 22%. And the remaining quarter from a shift in planned tax reinvestment spend from SG&A to capital expenditures as discussed previously. We expect gross margin to begin to improve and expand as we enter 2019 based on these new initiatives combined with our ongoing continuous improvement and strategic revenue management capabilities. We are benefiting from our organization's stellar SM&A discipline and prioritization in addition to favorable taxes which will help offset certain cost headwinds and enable us to continue to deliver solid shareholder returns as we transform the business for future long-term profitable growth. We remain a consumer-centric brand-building company that will continue to invest to fulfill our vision to become an innovative snacking powerhouse. Now let me provide a marketplace update. The U.S. snacking market remains an advantaged category and continues to grow about 2%. The categories we participate in; confection, salty snacks and meat snacks, are leading this growth. Total Hershey Q1 U.S. retail takeaway growth, including Amplify, was up 10.2%. This was driven by Hershey CMG growth of 10.7%, benefiting from an early Easter. The CMG category grew 11.8% resulting in a Hershey CMG share loss of approximately 30 basis points. This was in line with our expectations given the timing of Easter, innovation and promotional activity. Given the 15-day shorter Easter season, Easter category retail sales declined approximately 8% versus last year. Hershey retail sales declined approximately 10% versus last year, consistent with our plans given consumer shopping behavior in a shorter season. Given the shift, April retail takeaway is expected to be down significantly versus prior year. We expect April year-to-date retail takeaway to be slightly down versus prior year. Our core brands continue to drive growth, and the variety brands we activated are responding nicely to the renewed investment. Base velocities are showing strong acceleration from previous trends and delivering positive ROIs. Our new Reese's manufacturing line is up and running here in Hershey, unlocking additional capacity and new opportunities for growth. We also recently broke ground on our new Kit Kat manufacturing line in Hazleton, Pennsylvania. Hershey's Gold is off to a great start and trial and repeat are encouraging. Importantly, we are leveraging this launch to not only bring excitement but also to drive additional merchandising growth on our core base business as well. New pack types are shipping now to deliver on more consumer usage occasions and drive incremental growth. Our Reese's Outrageous instant-consumable innovation is on track for a May launch. Our retail partners and consumers are excited for this new twist that builds upon the success of our Reese's Pieces Peanut Butter Cup launch by adding Reese's Pieces to our Reese's Nutrageous Bar. The new Hershey's Chocolate World on the corner of 7th and 47th in the heart of Times Square launched last year just in time for the holiday season. The new store is three times larger than the original store and includes a Hershey's kitchens baking area and a one-of-a-kind S'mores making experience. The store has hosted well over a half a million Hershey enthusiasts already and is on track to connect with over 4 million guests this year. We continue to strengthen our digital commerce capabilities and have made meaningful progress over the past few months. Net sales were up around 30% in the first quarter, and we expect this trend to accelerate as we move through the year and fully activate the digital strategy I shared with you at CAGNY. We have recently allocated incremental investment to further these initiatives and drive awareness, equity and conversion across the ecosystem from any touch point, physical or digital. The Amplify business is on track, and integration in Austin is proceeding nicely. As I mentioned earlier, we are successfully capturing cost synergies sooner than previously anticipated. There is no change to our ongoing synergy estimate of approximately $20 million by end of 2019. SkinnyPop ready-to-eat popcorn year-to-date retail takeaway grew 3.1% versus the year ago period. This was driven by strong base sales growth of 6.9% with velocities improving versus 2017. These base sales gains were partially offset by planned declines in low ROI promotional activity. We have line of sight to distribution expansion that we expect to help further drive second-half growth and I feel great about this business and great about the talent we have in place to lead this business. Now for an update on our International and Other segment, net sales of $220 million for the quarter were slightly ahead of expectations. We continue to make meaningful improvements to segment profitability with Q1 operating income of $18 million, an increase of $16 million versus Q1 2017. I am really proud of the work the team has done to deliver these results. We expect this segment to continue generating operating income gains as we move through the year, albeit at a slightly lower pace. Our performance in Mexico, Brazil and India remains strong with Q1 combined constant currency net sales growth of 12% versus last year. Our China performance continues to sequentially improve as we execute our Margin for Growth initiative with constant currency net sales up approximately 1% in the first quarter. We had a solid Chinese New Year, growing share in our focus SKUs for the first time in several years. In summary, we will continue to balance our top and bottom line in this complex environment. We will invest in our brands and capabilities to drive growth while hitting our bottom line commitments. As we look ahead, we are intently focused on managing the controllable aspects of our business and making the choices needed to further position us to achieve growth, both today and into the future across our portfolio of iconic brands. I'll now turn it over to Patricia who will provide you with details on our financial results. Patricia? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Thank you, Michele, and good morning, everyone. First quarter net sales of $1.97 billion increased 4.9% versus the same period last year, including a 3.4 point benefit from the Amplify acquisition and a 0.5 point benefit from favorable foreign currency translation. Volume increased 2.4 points, which was partially offset by planned negative net price realization of 1.4 points. Adjusted earnings per share-diluted came in at $1.41, an increase of 8.5% versus the same period last year. Gains from volume, acquisition and a more favorable tax rate were partially offset by gross margin declines. Note that due to the adoption of ASU No. 2017-07 Compensation-Retirement Benefits, our 2017 results have been restated. Due to the change in the standard, we have also revised our calculation of non-GAAP earnings, which is positively contributing to the 2018 year-over-year EPS percentage change versus prior year. A reconciliation of these changes, as well as restated quarterly and full-year 2017 results, are available in the Investors section of our website. As Michele stated, there is no change to our expected adjusted full year EPS guidance of $5.33 to $5.43. However, given the restated 2017 non-GAAP results, full-year EPS is now expected to increase 14% to 16% versus prior year. By segment, North America net sales increased 4.4% versus the same period last year. The Amplify acquisition and foreign exchange currency rates were a 3.8 point and a 0.2 point benefit, respectively. Volume was a 1.8 point contribution to sales growth. Net price realization was a 1.4 point headwind due to the impact of first quarter true-up adjustments related to prior-year trade programs as well as planned increased levels of trade promotional spending in support of 2018 programming. Due to the earlier Easter, we accelerated execution of some of our summer promotional activity, including S'mores and Twizzlers. This resulted in some merchandising volume being shipped in the first quarter of this year versus the second quarter of last year. Also recall that in the second quarter of last year, net sales outpaced retail takeaway due to key retailer distribution and some packaging changes that temporarily elevated customer inventory levels. Therefore, we anticipate second quarter net sales will be pressured versus the second quarter of 2017. In total, taking into account our first quarter net sales and the timing of shipments, we expect first half organic net sales and retail takeaway to be relatively in line with the first half of last year. North America advertising and related consumer marketing spend increased on our core confection brands but was offset by spend optimization and shifts within emerging brands, resulting in an overall decline of 5.3% in the first quarter. First quarter total International and Other segment net sales increased 8.8% including a 2.4 point benefit from favorable foreign currency exchange. Volume was up 8.1 points, as we expected, driven by solid sales growth in Mexico, Brazil and India, which grew a combined 12% on a constant currency basis. We're pleased that net sales growth in China continued to improve as we execute our Margin for Growth initiative and optimize our portfolio. China net sales grew 0.9% on a constant currency basis compared to a 29.5% decline in the fourth quarter of last year. International and Other advertising and related consumer marketing declined 2%, in line with our expectations, as we continue to right-size our investments to drive more profitable growth. Now turning to gross margins, adjusted gross profit declined 0.9%, resulting in adjusted gross margin of 44.9%, a decline of 260 basis points versus the first quarter of last year. As we communicated at CAGNY and on our last earnings call, we did anticipate gross margin to be pressured in the first half of the year due to higher freight and logistics costs as well as incremental investments in trade and packaging to drive sales growth and to remain competitive at retail. However, as Michele discussed, first quarter gross margin was below our expectations and we now expect full-year gross margins to decline around 125 basis points versus prior year. Given the pattern of last year's gross margin inflationary pressures, we expect to see improvements in the second half of the year on a year-over-year basis. First quarter adjusted operating profit of $428 million resulted in an operating profit margin of 21.7%, a decline of 150 basis points. The marketing spend shifts and optimization I mentioned, in addition to continued SG&A discipline, partially offset the decline in gross margin. Moving down the P&L, interest expense of $29 million increased $6 million versus Q1 of last year driven by the additional commercial paper debt secured to fund the Amplify acquisition. We plan to issue bonds in early May to permanently finance the acquisitions. Bond principal amounts and maturities are aligned to rapidly de-lever the company, consistent with our targeted capital structure, maintaining a 1.5 times to 2 times debt-to-EBITDA ratio. Even with this additional debt, we have maintained our strong A1 and A debt ratings from Moody's and S&P respectively. We will utilize our healthy cash generation to repay these bonds as well as our existing bonds coming due in 2018 and 2020, upon maturity. Full-year 2018 interest expense is expected to be in the $130 million to $140 million range, in line with our previously stated estimates. The adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was 24.9% versus 31.5% in the year ago period driven by U.S. tax reform. With the additional time we've had to evaluate the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, in combination with prudent tax planning, we are updating our full-year 2018 expected tax rate to be approximately 19% to 20% versus our previous estimate of approximately 20% to 22%. First quarter other income and expense was $1.9 million. We expect full-year 2018 expense to be approximately $65 million to $70 million as we continue our investment tax credit strategy. This was a slight increase versus our initial estimate. For the first quarter of 2018, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 212 million. The company repurchased $140 million of common shares in the first quarter. This completes the $500 million January 2016 share repurchase authorization while $60 million remains on the October 2017 $100 million authorization. We also repurchased $38 million of common shares in connection with the exercise of stock options. Total capital additions including software were $60 million. For the full year 2018, we now expect CapEx to be in the $355 million to $375 million range. This updated estimate reflects the increase of approximately $25 million that Michele discussed, which will go to further enhancing supply chain capacity and flexibility, as well as for forecasting tools, all of which we believe will help address gross margin pressures. Total depreciation and amortization for the first quarter was $74 million. This was slightly lower than our planned level driven by favorable Amplify amortization versus initial estimates. We are making progress on our strategic review of the Amplify international business. We have now reached a point where we believe it is likely that we will sell the business in the next 12 months. Therefore, you will now see this reported as an asset held for sale in the 10-Q we're filing this quarter. The business is still included in our guidance as we're not certain if and when a sale will occur. To assist with your modeling, 12 month sales are approximately $125 million and operating income is immaterial. We continue to return cash to our shareholders, with first quarter dividends of $134 million. This was our 353rd consecutive quarterly dividend on the common stock. We take a holistic long-term view to deliver value to our consumers, shareholders and communities. We remain committed to investing in our brands and our business model to deliver great tasting products and delight our consumers. We generate strong cash flow and have a healthy balance sheet that enables us to return value to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks. And we continue to support the communities where we do business. Most recently, we announced our comprehensive strategy, Cocoa for Good that addresses the most pressing issues facing cocoa growing communities. We're investing half a billion dollars by 2030 to nourish children, elevate youth, build prosperous communities and preserve natural ecosystems. To close, we have good visibility into plans that we believe will enable us to deliver on our earnings outlook in a difficult cost environment. Despite recent pressures, we believe our margin structure remains advantaged and we are aggressively taking steps to address these headwinds in a sustainable way while we transform our business model. Before I summarize the year, let me provide some thoughts on the next quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we expect Q2 gross profits to be pressured. This, combined with the timing of some of our capability investments such as ERP, is expected to result in lower Q2 EBIT versus last year. Our revised tax rate will be somewhat of an offset and we expect nominal Q2 EPS growth. To summarize for the full year, we are reaffirming full-year adjusted earnings per share-diluted of $5.33 to $5.43, an increase of 14% to 16% versus last year. We're refining our reported net sales estimates toward the lower end of the previously communicated range of 5% to 7% to reflect the new initiatives we are implementing to reduce complexity and improve margins. Full-year adjusted gross margin is now estimated to decline around 125 basis points versus prior year. We'll continue to invest in DMEs and business building initiatives. The Margin for Growth program savings in 2018 are estimated to be $80 million to $90 million, an increase of approximately $25 million versus our initial estimate as we now expect to deliver the high end of the $150 million to $175 million overall program target. Amplify accretion has also increased from initial estimates and is now estimated to be $0.08 to $0.12 EPS accretive for the full year. The adjusted 2018 effective tax rate is approximately 19% to 20% and CapEx spending is estimated at $355 million to $375 million, an increase of $25 million versus initial estimates. Thank you for your time this morning. I'll now turn it back over to Michele for some closing remarks. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Thank you, Patricia. Hershey is a category leader with compelling snacking tailwinds. As we transform our business in both domestic and international markets, we believe our core brands and expanding portfolio, our relentless focus on innovation, proprietary insights, and in-store capabilities, and our strong margins and cash flow will help us maintain our competitive advantage, fuel continued earnings growth, and deliver long term shareholder value. This concludes our prepared remarks. Patricia, Melissa and I are now available to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go first to the line of Ken Goldman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Hi, Ken. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I think if I heard you correctly, your outlook for the gross margin was to expand, I think you said improve and expand as you enter 2019. I know we can't really talk in detail about 2019 right now, but I think most of us are modeling in some cocoa headwinds as that year begins. And I think most of us would assume that the pricing environment doesn't get a whole lot better right now. So I realize you have some tailwinds, but historically Hershey's gross margin has been pressured when cocoa rises no matter what else is really going on behind the scene. So I wanted to get a little bit more comfort if I can in what gives you that confidence in seeing that gross margin improvement as maybe 2018 progresses or into 2019? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: So let me \u2013 I'll start off. It's Michele, and I'll also ask Patricia to add some commentary on this as well. First of all, as we mentioned, we think we're taking some very specific actions to address some of the things that hit us that are within our control. We had some customer-specific programming that leaned towards value-oriented packs and created some unfavorable mix, and as we go forward we are working to fix that and address that. As we look at our SKU rationalization plan, a real focus on the core is going to help us tremendously to address some of those mix opportunities for us. And so we think that we've got a good plan against that. I'd also say as we look at input costs (00:29:02) comments about cocoa in particular and then I'm going to turn it over to Patricia. Certainly the fundamentals of the cocoa crop, weather, supply and demand are all relatively healthy, but it is a commodity that we know has some high volatility given just some things that are outside the fundamentals. So with that, let me just turn it over to Patricia to talk a little bit in more detail about the recovery on gross margin. But I think if you think about it at a very macro level, there's a lot of recovery that's just grounded in the lapping of prior-year gross margin. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Yeah, I think that's a good summary. So as you know, we started to experience some freight inflation and some other inflationary pressures in the back half of last year, and so as we lap those, that will give us some easier comps in the back half of this year. And then as we exit that into 2019, while we really don't see a lot of relief on some of the cocoa and other inflationary pressures, we are very focused as a team on reducing some of the costs that we can control, things like the mix that Michele talked about, some of the \u2013 some of our go-to-market, things like our packaging changes. And then really just getting at this issue of complexity and that's where we want to focus our SKU rationalization on making sure that we're really providing the right package to the right customer at the right time with the right value, but not doing that in a way that overcomplicates our supply chain and logistics system, which is where we've seen some of the cost pressures come in that we do believe are controllable. And those are the things that we're looking to improve in 2019. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Yes. Remember, Ken, some of our capacity investments, the Reese's line came online this quarter, and we have a new Kit Kat line coming online at the end of the quarter. So as we look at the mix of what we've been able to sell, we were a bit constrained on some of our most profitable items, and as we get that addressed that's going to help us quite a lot in terms of driving mix on the business. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks so much. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go next to the line of Rob Dickerson from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Kanika Goyal - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. This is Kanika Goyal on for Rob. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask a little bit about the top line trends. Considering how strong organic sales came in for Q1 and the guidance for Amplify is unchanged at 5%, currency still neutral, could you just explain a little bit more on why the full-year guidance was taken down to the lower end? Like where is the pressure actually coming from? I know the shorter Easter period and SKU rationalization was expected to impact sales by 1%, but is that more profound than what you initially expected? And thank you. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Yeah, so first of all, a little bit of perspective on the full year. We always expected \u2013 we had expected in our plan for the first half to be a bit pressured, primarily driven by promotional (32:03) and innovation timing but primarily the shorter Easter. So that was in our plans. As we look at the last \u2013 at the second half, we remain really bullish (32:16) including Outrageous which is launching, Reese's Outrageous, in May, continued Gold success, and very strong sell-in behind Halloween and holiday. The key difference as we look at the back half of the year is this focus for us to really balance the P&L and drive for profitable growth and thus the SKU reduction program. We think it's the right thing to do to really shift and work to drive mix. And we do know, though, that there will be some short-term impact as we make those changes. So really that choice is the primary driver that led us to call the low end of the guidance. We just want to give all of you the heads-up, relative to what the impact of that program could be as we initiate it. Kanika Goyal - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from David Driscoll from Citi. Please go ahead. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you and good morning. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Hi, David. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. So I wanted to ask just a little bit more about the gross margins. So pricing is down, and I believe you used the word planned in the prepared remarks. Can you talk a little bit more about the planned pricing reduction? I mean, it feels kind of counterintuitive that pricing is down as much as it is with gross margins under this much pressure and cocoa kind of screaming higher. So are you under retailer pressures and this is why pricing is down? Or are there other good explanations? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: We're always balancing the mix of our investment behind the business between advertising and trade, and as we looked what we thought we needed to do this year to really be competitive, we did make some additional shifts between advertising and trade on certain parts of our business. I wouldn't say that we see that as major pressure but rather continued optimization to maximize the business going forward. And not all of that is necessarily showing up in price. So as you think about our investment with trade, is really about investment with customers at retail. Merchandising, merchandising racks, things like that also fall into that line. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Can you guys explain just a little more on the \"complexity\" that you're talking about? I'm still not understanding how that comes as a surprise, if you will, in the quarter to drive the gross margins perhaps so much lower than what you initially expected. And I feel like that's really what you're trying to tell us on today's call because it seems to want to drive the SKU rationalization in the second half of the year. Could you just spend a little bit more time on this complexity? And what really this meant? And then why was it kind of something that was a surprise within the quarter to drive this gross margin miss? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: So David, I'd say a couple things. First of all, C-store trends were a little bit lighter than we anticipated, and that really had a bit of a mix impact for us. As we looked at \u2013 so I'm going to address complexity as well as the mix piece. Some of the customer-specific programming we had, some of the areas of the business that did the best were some of our bigger more value-oriented packs, and that created some unfavorable mix. So those are two things we didn't anticipate that hit gross margin. As we look at kind of the complexity piece, what I would say is in a difficult growth environment and with some capacity constraints, we've leaned into some areas of the business to drive revenue that we think have created complexity. They also created sales obviously, but they added some incremental touches in our supply chain. And we just have to get after those. And given that we have these capacity investments in some of our biggest businesses, this gives us the opportunity to better control what we are selling. Patricia, anything else you want to add to that? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: The other thing that we've really explored with the complexity is how much it puts a stretch on our demand planning system. And as we just add SKUs, it just gets that much harder to plan at that SKU level, and that frankly drives some of the cost, too, for things like the extra touches or in our supply chain or added freight. Things like that. So that's one of the areas that we think is a real opportunity for us going forward. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: And, David, I would say like some of the mix things \u2013 obviously, I think some of those marketplace dynamics were a bit out of our control. I think the complexity caught us a little bit more. We knew there was complexity. It caught us a little bit more than we thought it would. And so what we are focused on is we can take the actions to fix that, and we are. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you for the comments. I'll pass it along. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go next to Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Thank you. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Hi, Rob. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to focus on Amplify for a second. I thought I heard you say that sales were up versus year-ago only about 3%. Our Nielsen data tracking indicates that SkinnyPop popcorn in the U.S. was up more than that. Can you help us reconcile those two things? Like, is the Nielsen data overstating the growth rate of SkinnyPop? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Are you referencing the 360 basis points which is just for us the amount that Amplify contributed to our sales given that it was zero last year, and we had a partial quarter? Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Maybe I misunderstood in your opening remarks, Patricia. So maybe just tell us, like, what's SkinnyPop's growth rate versus year-ago on a retail basis? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Hang on. 6.6%. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. So it's up about 6.6%. Is that decelerating versus its normal rate because I remember this used to be like a double-digit growth kind of brand? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: If we look at the latest 12 weeks, it's about 6.3%. Yeah, if we go to the back part of the year \u2013 I'll have to see if we have those numbers here. I thought we did. Hold on. Yeah, we can follow up with you on that. There may be a little bit of deceleration as it's gotten larger, but there's tremendous growth in the category and we're pretty happy with the mid-single-digit growth. Certainly in the first quarter, the team had built some plans to remove some of the lower ROI trade promotion events that they had prior year, and so that's causing a little bit of an offset to some of the momentum that they had. But as we look at the full-year basis, we're feeling really good. And we have line of sight to some distribution expansion which is, frankly, well deserved on the business, which is going to, I believe, reaccelerate that growth rate. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go next to John Baumgartner from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Thanks for the question. Michele, wanted to dig into the health of the category a bit more, CMG in the U.S., because it seems as though some of the upstream commodity indicators are broken down. You also have rising gas prices, which can't be helpful for C-stores. So have you become more cautious in the category for 2018 since January? And as a follow-up, if you could speak a bit more to your performance in everyday versus seasonal, given that I think Q1 was your third straight share loss in CMG. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Sure. So we haven't really changed our outlook in the category versus what we shared at CAGNY. So we had shared that we believe the long-term outlook for the category was around 1.5% to 2%. As we look at this year, we believe this year is probably 1% to 1.5% because the long Easter drives a 0.5 point swing between a long Easter year and a short Easter year. We also continue to be really bullish about the chocolate and non-chocolate part of the category. If you take refreshment out, it continues to have \u2013 grow at an accelerated rate and we anticipate that will be 1.5 points to 2 points of growth for this year. As we look at share, we had shared previously that we saw our plan for the year to be back-half loaded and we anticipated that our share would be softer in the first part of the year, but we expect to end the year gaining share. So some of that's tied to competitive timing of competitive programming as well as the timing of our own programming. It's certainly always our goal to gain share. And I feel good that as we end the year, we will be on track to be doing that. John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to the line of Jonathan Feeney from Consumer Edge. Please go ahead. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Good morning. Thanks very much for the question. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Hi, Jon. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : One broad question, one detailed question. A lot of talk about complexity on the call and recently, and some amount of complexity, it seems to me, it's always been a trade-off, right? You've been able to grow revenues and profits by great innovation and that innovation necessarily leads to complexity. If anything, the world's become more fragmented and maybe more micro targeting probably is a little bit more rational than necessary, not necessarily for you but for everybody. So I'm trying to understand how reducing complexity, if this \u2013 what changed in your kind of calculations to want to go after this opportunity right now? And is it the case that \u2013 is it in the future, are we just going to wind up with another more complex business two, three years down the road when we push all the innovation we can with the new SkinnyPop, et cetera, and the great brands that you have? That's much my broad question. And my narrow question is with these tax credits, Patricia, does the tax rate benefit line up on a quarterly basis with the other expense? So if you buy a credit that lowers your tax rate, do we feel that quarter-to-quarter, or is there ever inter-quarter movement between those two phenomenon? Thank you very much. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: So first on your broad question, this certainly is a category that is complex, right? It's a high SKU-driven category with multiple locations in the store. I think as we look at it, though, there is good complexity, strategic complexity, that adds profitable growth and adds value. And there is also bad complexity, where there can be excess that adds items but not driving really incremental profitable growth. And I think one of the most important things we always have to do is keep track of that. I think we got a little bit out of balance on that, and we think it's really important to address that. So, for example, I'll give you one example. We could have 500 merchandising units, and it might be that when we take a really close look at them, with a couple tweaks, we could get that number in half and generate massive efficiency that takes complexity out of the system. On the other hand, we are going to continue to add SKUs when it comes to innovation that we think is driving incrementality or new pack types on some of our core items. So it's really a balancing act, but it's keeping the good complexity and shedding the nonprofitable, non-incremental complexity. And it's a category that we just have to stay on top of that and stay focused. Patricia, I'm going to turn it over to you for the tax question. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: We do put those two together in terms of the other income impacts that you see with the cost of the tax credits with the rates. Those two tend to go together. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : So they don't move quarterly, basically quarter-to-quarter or go together on a yearly basis? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: They go together on a quarterly basis. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Andrew Lazar from Barclays. Please go ahead. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning, everybody. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Hi, Andrew. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. I just wanted to dig in briefly to the incremental SKU rationalization that you're doing I guess. I want to make sure I understand specifically where is that rationalization more focused? Is it primarily within the core/noncore chocolate franchise? Is it primarily focused on sort of the other non-chocolate broader snacking activities that you've been getting more involved in over the last couple of years? If it's the latter, I'm just trying to get a sense of whether that works, or is that at odds with the type of actions you're taking to get into this broader snacking environment to go after that growth? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. So Andrew, this is really not tied to the snacking initiative. This is really (45:23). I think we have pretty good line of sight and, frankly, a much smaller number of SKUs in the portfolio in snacking. This is really focused on looking at the broad core confection, all the brands, all the pack types we have and actually all the merchandising units as well. So it's really more focused on optimizing that, making sure that we are as focused as possible on driving the core, and making the decisions to have the highest velocity items on the shelf everywhere we possibly can. So it's really within that core piece of the business. Patricia, anything you want to add to that? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Yeah, Michele gave a great example about the merchandising units. I'll give you another one that's really core to us, and that's things like Halloween assortments. We tend to have five different approaches to that, but then over time we've migrated to where we do a lot of customer-specific assortments. And this year what we did is we really optimized our base levels, and those have proved to be so well designed that we can eliminate some of the customer-specific assortments. And that just takes complexity out, makes the customer happy, makes the consumer happy. So that's an example of where we see the complexity creep in that we don't think is adding value to ourselves, the customer or the consumer. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go next to the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Hi, Bryan. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. So I want to just follow up. You had made a comment earlier, or there was a comment made earlier, just about the sort of the shift between advertising and trade spend. And so leaning a little bit more to trade spend this year, can you just elaborate a little bit more on is that a response to like cross-category type elasticity? So trying to sort of position your core chocolate confections better against maybe some of the other categories where they're near-in? Maybe some of the snack bars, that type of thing? Or is it more a response to just competitive activity near-in within your core chocolate franchise? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. I would say it's much more a near-in chocolate franchise view and looking at a couple specific areas of opportunity on certain pack types and at certain customers that we wanted to take advantage of that made really good business sense. I also just want to reinforce that even with that shift in total, advertising on our core chocolate brands was up in Q1, and we expect it to be up for the full year. So we've shifted the advertising away from places that were less strategically important within the portfolio. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And where you've done it, has it also come with incremental distribution? I guess what I've noticed in some of the impulse channels, like convenience and gas, for instance, where you've had the price \u2013 the promotions, you've also had out of aisle display. You've had some sort of display attached to it. So fair to say when you're spending the trade it's not just on price but it's also to get better placement or some merchandising attached to it? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Yeah, I would say that is entirely what drove the (48:51) investment. This is a category obviously driven by impulse, and our primary goal with trade is to get merchandising display. Our secondary goal is price. I think that's a very accurate way to think about it. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go to Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Wow, a daily double. Okay. Just regarding the guidance, your EPS guidance is unchanged, but you have also lowered the tax rate. So that alone implies a lower operating income for the year. But then I think what you also said is that you're going to cut the SG&A and kind of reallocate it towards CapEx about $25 million. So is this in a way kind of saying that, okay, our operating income is lower than what we thought even though there's another $25 million of SG&A that's being reduced and just kind of reallocated? So it's kind of like, I don't know, maybe $50 million, for example, on a fundamental basis? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Yeah, Patricia, go ahead, you can take that. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Yeah, I think Michele did a good job of talking about where the recovery comes from, and again about half of it is on that SG&A Margin for Growth target as well as the improved Amplify accretion. And then a quarter of it is that tax rate. So if you think about above the tax rate, yes, that's where you're going to see some leakage. And then the remaining quarter is that shift from where we had some reinvestment sort of earmarked in our P&L at the beginning of the year, and we've moved that to CapEx. So that's a total help. So if you think about it, about three-quarters of it is being offset above taxes, and about a quarter of it is not. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. So a quarter of it is not being offset by the tax rate? Okay. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: No, I'm sorry. I want to be super clear. About three-quarters of it is offset at the operating income EBIT line, and about a quarter of it is offset at the tax line to get you the full offset. Just super clear. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it. All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Steven Strycula from UBS. Please go ahead. Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Just want to follow up on a few of the gross margin questions. Patricia, if we had to boil it down or kind of break down the 120 basis point delta from where you initially guided versus today, how would you kind of segment that between necessarily trade versus freight and logistics versus raw materials if you had to kind of break it down to those three buckets? Just so we conceptually understand where the weakness is coming from. Thank you. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: It's all of those buckets. We're not getting into that level of specificity, but what we've done is called out the big pieces, and you should think about those as all are (51:57) important to the pressure and all the things that we're going to be tackling with the initiatives that Michele mentioned. Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : And in that vein, should we expect the second quarter gross margin rate of decline to be comparable to the first quarter? Is that kind of what you're trying to insinuate? Is that fair? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And the last piece and I'll pass it along, what was the logic in the accounting switch from the ERP spending expensed to capitalized? At what point did you kind of think that that was \u2013 you made the decision to go down that path? Thank you. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: I want to separate those two things. So first of all, in second quarter, we are expecting a little bit more ERP spending. And that's something that I called out, versus what we've been running at. And that's just the normal timing of any kind of program like that. What we did separately from that is we had earmarked some of our savings from the tax benefit, the overall Jobs Act tax benefit, to reinvest in the business. And we decided that the best way to do that was to really focus on CapEx. Some of the capacity or DC initiatives, as well as some programming, but not related to the ERP system. Does that answer your question? Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah, that clarifies it. Thank you so much. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Okay. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Alexia Howard from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good morning, everyone. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Good morning. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Hi, Alexia. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. So the deterioration in pricing, particularly in North America this year, do you expect that to rebound going forward, i.e., could we actually get back into positive year-on-year territory in the next quarter or two? And then the follow-up question is are new channels like e-commerce, for example, part of this complexity issue? I guess what I'm really asking is, is e-commerce investment likely to be a big area that you're putting money into going forward? Thank you. And I'll pass it on. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: So, Alexia, I'll hit the e-commerce one and then I'll let Patricia talk about your first part of your question. We are continuing to increase our investment in e-commerce. And I think you made a mention, perhaps, about complexity when you asked about that. That would be an example of good strategic complexity. I mean, we're certainly looking for efficiency as we build e-commerce, but that would be a place that we'd be investing in because certainly there's a tremendous (54:26) growth opportunity there. So we are continuing to increase our investments there because we're getting really nice growth. Patricia, you want to talk a little bit about the trade price outlook? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. So we were hit a little bit harder, Alexia, in the first quarter on trade because of the true-ups that we do annually in the first quarter related to prior year. And that won't be an impact in the second through the fourth quarters. We're not at the point of giving guidance about specifics down to the pricing level, but we did have an outsized impact in the first quarter. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. I'll pass it on. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Jason English from Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hello, everyone. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Hi, Jason. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you for allowing me to ask a question. I appreciate it. Hey, I guess I want to come back to and build off a few of the questions that were asked so far. A lot of what seems to be transpiring with the portfolio seems very reminiscent of what was happening maybe a decade ago. Adding more complexity to the portfolio to drive growth, and I know you're on the back end of that. And also shifting advertising to trade to drive impulse at point of purchase. Those tactics worked well until they didn't a little over a decade ago. And now, we're talking about you still putting more trade in, still suffering market share losses. It feels like they're not working that well today either. Now, last time, it clearly led to a path of the business stalling out, ultimately a rebase that set you up to grow anew. Why shouldn't we be concerned that we're ultimately on the same path, a path to kind of needing to rebase to reinvest to reaccelerate growth? And given the category is not quite as resilient as it was back then, competitive intensity seems more elevated. The input cost curve is going the wrong way. And you've got a lot of other stuff on your plate with diversification. It feels like this time could even be worse. Where do you see us maybe off base with that line of thinking? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: So first of all, I would say shifting from advertising to trade, we have a very strong investment in advertising. So 10, 12 years ago, advertising as a percent of net sales was 2%. We are about 9% now at industry-leading levels and we are still at that, even with a minor shift. This was a minor shift to trade of like a couple tenths. So we still have very, very strong advertising levels. So on that piece, I would say there's just not even comparability whatsoever. I think from an SKU perspective, we continue with our strategy to be very focused on driving the core. We always have been. And when complexity ekes into the business, we have to address it. So I think from that perspective, you may say that addressing complexity, as we've done it in the past, is something that needs to be done. And that might be similar to where we were at some point in time, but I think the benefit of that drove some significant growth on the business on a go-forward basis because that usually tends to result in a much greater focus on some of the core most profitable SKUs, and I think creates opportunity for us. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. I appreciate that. And one sort of unrelated follow-up, in regards to the cost curve, if we look back over history, this has been a category where the pricing power has been exceptional relative to the rest of food. And when you face cost pressure, you're able to pass it through. Great discipline in the industry. In context of sort of the proliferation of broader snacks and the greater array of competitors you're facing today, do you feel that that equation or that relationship may have changed at all, or is it \u2013 do you still believe you have the same degree of pricing power and ability that you have in the past? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Well, obviously we can't speak directly to pricing. What I would say is we still feel really good about the category, and every category and the dynamics within the categories are different. The category of confection continues to grow. We as a company are somewhat differentiated in terms of that very significant investment that we make in our brands at industry-leading levels, what we just talked about relative to advertising, and we continue to have low private label penetration in our category. So we're always looking to work collaboratively with our retail partners and look at the marketplace and make sure we have the right product news, the right investment, and the right pricing to benefit all of us for the long term health of the category. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you so much for your time. I appreciate it. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. We'll go to Pablo Zuanic with SIG. Aatish Shah - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hi. Good morning. This is Aatish Shah on for Pablo. Just have a question on seasonal chocolates, specifically if you could tell us what percent of total chocolate for Hershey's sales this is? And then, does this percentage vary much from the first half to second half? And given that Hershey's under-indexed in this, is there an opportunity there? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: So seasons as a part of our business is about one-third, so our business breaks out about a third seasons, about a third instant consumables, and about a third take home. There does tend to be a little bit of back half focus given the size of Halloween and holidays together, which are larger categories than Valentine's Day and Easter combined, and we continue to feel good about the seasonal chocolate sales that we have in the marketplace. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. We are not under-indexed in seasonal. It's clearly a strength of ours in the marketplace. Aatish Shah - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Got it. And just one quick follow-up. I'm not sure if you touched on this. Could you just comment on your cocoa hedging practices? I don't know if you release that kind of level of detail? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Patricia, do you want to talk about that? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. We hedge a number of our commodities. We hedge out for 3 months to 24 months in layers. We look for getting price visibility and sort of easing into any market disruptions. We can't hedge all of our ingredients, but those that we can, we have a longstanding and effective hedging program. Aatish Shah - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Great. Thank you. Melissa A. Poole - The Hershey Co.: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We will be available throughout the day for any further questions that you have. Operator : I'd like to thank everybody for their participation on today's conference call. Please feel free to disconnect at any time.",

Michele Buck, President and CEO; and Patricia Little, Senior Vice President and CFO, will provide you with an overview of our results followed by a Q&A session. Before we begin, please remember that during the course of this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are based on our current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could differ materially from actual events and those described in these forward-looking statements contained in our 2017 10-K filed with the SEC and today's press release. Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe will provide useful information for investors. The presentation of this information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to today's press release for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Michele. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Thank you, Melissa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our second quarter sales and EPS were in line with our expectations and we remain on track to achieve the annual financial guidance we shared in April. In March 2017, I shared with you a vision for transforming our business and our focus, as a company, remains on delivering that multi-year strategic plan and driving long-term value creation. We participate in on-trend growing categories with a portfolio of great brands that resonate with our consumers. As consumers, their shopping and the retail environment evolve, we will continue to build capabilities and evolve our business as we have done previously when the marketplace transforms. In the second quarter, we continued to invest in our brands and capabilities for growth, while taking measured steps to enhance long-term profitability. We developed new advertising campaigns on our two largest brands, rolled out enhanced selling tools for our retail sales force and made solid progress on our capacity expansion initiatives. Amplify's marketplace performance remains strong with high single-digit growth, resulting in share gains and the integration is proceeding well. The ongoing transformation of our international business is ahead of schedule. We delivered solid organic growth for the quarter, completed the successful divestitures of Tyrrells and Golden Monkey and drove year-to-date profit to $34 million, just shy of our largest ever full-year profit in this segment. Constant currency net sales increased 5.3% in the second quarter, including a 590-basis-point benefit from the Amplify acquisition. Adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.14 increased 5.6% compared to the second quarter last year. This morning, we also announced the 10% dividend increase and a new stock repurchase authorization, a testament to our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow generation. Last week, we announced to our retail partners a selective price increase to enable us to maintain strong investment in our business and help offset rising operational costs. This was a targeted approach and it included a combination of list price increases, price-pack optimization and changes to customer terms. As part of this communication, we also shared packaging enhancements that improved the consumer shopping experience to drive growth while delivering net price realization. In the past, you've seen us take infrequent large actions across the entire portfolio that were largely commodity-driven. Our new pricing approach is much more precise both in terms of magnitude and breadth, it utilizes more levers and will be more dynamic. This go-forward approach is critical in a fast changing environment and enables us to balance market opportunity with operational complexity. On our last call, we discussed our gross margin outlook. While our margin performance is not yet where we wanted to be, we delivered second quarter results in line with our April outlook and our plans and full year estimate remain unchanged. This operating environment requires an agile approach to portfolio, strategy and pricing. We continue to take a proactive approach to optimize our portfolio and deliver increased profitability. Our SKU rationalization efforts are a great example and we are encouraged by early results. We have also added resources against optimizing our price-pack architecture, improving mix and enhancing planning. Our investments in capacity expansion, supply chain flexibility and ERP technology all remain on track. We believe these enhancements, in addition to our price increase, will be important levers to address our recent gross margin headwinds. We are confident in the strength of the categories in which we compete and our compelling brands. Our team is committed to making strategic investments in the business to fuel our future growth and success. Now, let me provide an update on U.S. marketplace performance. Overall, the retail environment continues to change rapidly as consumers blur the physical and digital shopping experience. Both traditional brick-and-mortar channels and e-commerce are growing, emphasizing the importance of the holistic commerce ecosystem. E-commerce grocery sales remain robust as retailers invest in and consumers adapt to new platforms. In measured channels, snacking categories are still performing well. Hershey's snacking sales grew 0.3% for the 12 weeks ending July 15, driven by strong Amplify growth. SkinnyPop ready-to-eat popcorn grew 8.3% during this same timeframe, gaining 1.2 points of marketplace share. This growth was balanced across class of trade and driven by gains in both household penetration and purchase frequency. The category remains healthy with growth of approximately 4% year-to-date. We have good visibility into second-half plans and expect both SkinnyPop and ready-to-eat popcorn category strength to sustain as we move throughout the year. Our expansion to participate in broader snacking will continue to be an important lever in our growth. Confection category growth of 0.6% in measured channels during the 12 weeks ending July 15 was a bit pressured. This was driven primarily by competitor lapping significant innovation during the same time last year. Trends for most other competitors were in line with year-to-date performance. Hershey's CMG takeaway of minus 0.4% resulted in a share decline of 30 basis points during the 12 weeks ending July 15. Consistent with what we shared with you earlier this year, we expected softer first-half performance due to a shorter Easter and promotional and innovation timing. While measured channels are a little soft, we are seeing growth in untracked channels as consumers' purchase patterns become increasingly fluid. Our core franchises grew 1.3% during this period, driven by Reese's and Ice Breakers gum. Reese's growth accelerated, driven by the limited rollout of Reese's Outrageous! innovation and additional media supporting a new campaign. Hershey's Gold innovation is selling in line with expectations and continuing to help drive the core, which was a key goal for us. Velocities on core Hershey's branded instant consumables were up 5% during our launch window, benefiting from additional co-merchandising with Gold. And we continue to expand Gold to the Take Home Pack-types where customer on-shelf timing is a bit slower than we had anticipated. Now, for an update on barkTHINS, we have applied learnings from recent acquisitions and are building new capabilities to successfully manage and grow our emerging brands. To that end, we established Amplify as a separate division to nurture and strengthen our emerging and better-for-you brand portfolio. We have a talented team in Austin with expertise and demonstrated success in acquiring, integrating and growing emerging brands. The barkTHINS portfolio, now managed within Amplify, continues to perform well, with measured expansion and activation helping drive solid growth in year two of the acquisition. barkTHINS is delivering incremental consumers and occasions to our portfolio and growing approximately 35% over the latest 12 weeks. Importantly, we are increasing velocity while expanding distribution, a key metric of sustainability. This is evidence of the results possible when applying these lessons. We continue to build our digital commerce capabilities. Grocery shopping, today, occurs in one holistic retail ecosystem, where brick-and-mortar and online are inextricably linked. We are focused on continuously learning more about shopper needs based on the fulfillment models through which they choose to receive their goods. Each of these models are for different levels of convenience and have different economics, which inform different strategies. One thing that remains consistent is the consumers' desire for Hershey brands. We have been consistently gaining e-commerce share this year through upgrades in content, search optimization and clear merchandising and marketing strategies that are linked to our physical retail environment activation. We are also engaged in a full enterprise data and digital transformation program, which includes upgrades to our core digital ecosystem platforms and will allow us to leapfrog in broader digital capabilities across all functions. These efforts resulted in another quarter of e-commerce growth greater than 30% and we have confidence this trend will continue in the second half of 2018 and beyond. I'm excited by the progress we've made here. While we delivered our commitment in the second quarter, we are not satisfied. Consistent with what we shared earlier this year, we expect our overall business results to improve in the second half of the year. An important and unique part of our business is seasons. We have good visibility into strong seasonal orders. Our Halloween and Holiday outlooks are a testament to the hard work of our teams, who were able to not only successfully reduce complexity and increase margins, but also improve our consumer proposition and drive growth. Retailer response has been excellent and we are excited by the opportunity to expand this work to the rest of the portfolio. We are leveraging our capabilities to secure additional space at key retailers with a focus on our fastest-moving, most profitable SKUs. We have good visibility into customer reset changes this fall and believe this will be a growth driver for us. Reese's Outrageous! is off to a strong start and is important innovation to drive our profitable instant consumable business. It is just now starting to achieve full distribution. And we expect additional growth in the second half as it expands to all classes of trade. And we continue to invest in our core brands. This translates into new campaigns, sharper positioning, better packaging and robust marketing support to drive velocities. Now, for an update on International and Other segment, last year, we shared aggressive initiatives to reset our international business model. I am proud of the teams that have delivered on these plans. Across our international markets, they have exceeded our expectations to set the right foundation to capture growth profitably. Year-to-date, our International segment has delivered operating income of $34 million. This represents an increase of $24 million versus the same period last year. In addition to the significant margin improvement, we have built the right foundation in our key markets to capture growth. With a focus on our Hershey's brand, we delivered consistent mid-single-digit sales growth during the first half of the year. This has contributed approximately a 0.5 point of overall company growth in the first half. In Mexico, our business is performing well. Constant currency sales grew high single digits, resulting in continued marketplace share gains. And through a combination of mix, pricing and continuous improvement, we have also improved profitability. In China, our transformation is ahead of expectations. We remain committed to this important market and are optimizing our footprint to focus on core SKUs, provinces and channels. Sales are stabilizing. Our core Hershey's SKUs in targeted channels are growing share and our bottom line is improving meaningfully. I'd like to thank the local team for their tremendous work here. This week, we also completed another key strategic priority by divesting Golden Monkey. We believe this will further enable our teams to focus on our strengths for future growth. In Brazil, our business performed well, despite some macro volatility. While we did experience some impact from the truckers' strike, it was relatively immaterial to overall company sales. We are confident in our ability to recoup the volume in the second half of the year, given our strong marketplace performance and share gains. We have a strong team in Brazil with a great culture, so great work there. Finally, in India, we remain committed to our strategy of evolving to a higher-margin portfolio. Our core brands, Hershey's, Sofit, Jolly Rancher and Brookside are growing over 50%. We anticipate these strong segment sales and profit trends to continue in the second half of the year. In summary, we are pleased with the progress we are making against our strategic focus areas. We are investing in our brands, our supply chain and capabilities to position us to achieve growth. We have expanded our breadth in snacking via a high-growth, high-margin acquisition in Amplify with an experienced team leading our snacking expansion. We have reset our international business model by divesting non-productive assets, rightsizing investments and focusing our efforts on key brands, key markets and key channels to drive profitable growth. We have made meaningful progress in reducing our foundational cost structure and redeploying assets to areas with the highest opportunity, focusing every function on driving maximum commercial value. And we are on track to deliver a strong year of earnings growth in a challenging environment. I'll now turn it over into Patricia, who will provide you with details on our financial results. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Thank you, Michele, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter net sales of $1.75 billion increased 5.3% versus the same period last year, including a 5.9-point benefit from the Amplify acquisition. Volume increased 1 point, which was offset by negative net price realization of 1.6 points. Foreign currency translation impact was negligible. Adjusted earnings per share diluted came in at $1.14, an increase of 5.6% versus the same period last year. Income from a more favorable tax rate, acquisitions and volume were partially offset by gross margin declines consistent with our April outlook. As Michele stated, there is no change to our full-year organic sales or adjusted EPS guidance. We expect organic net sales to be towards the low-end of the slightly up to 2% range and adjusted earnings per share diluted in the $5.33 to $5.43 range. As we said in our press release, we updated our reported net sales outlook to reflect the strategic divestitures of Tyrrells and Golden Monkey. By segment, North America net sales increased 5.6% versus the same period last year. The Amplify acquisition added 6.6 points and foreign exchange currency rates were 0.2-point benefit. Volume was a 1 point contribution to sales growth. Net price realization was a 220-basis-point headwind due to the impact of increased levels of trade promotional spending we planned in support of 2018 programming. As a reminder, second quarter net sales were impacted by current year promotional shifts and the lapping of elevated inventory levels during the prior-year period. Organic net sales were relatively flat in the first half of 2018, in line with our expectations. North America advertising and related consumer marketing spend increased on our scale confection brands in the second quarter. This was more than offset by optimization and shifts out of emerging brands as we emphasize more productive initiatives resulting in an overall decline of 6.1%. Second quarter total International and Other segment net sales increased 3.1%, including a 1.7-point headwind from unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Net price realization was a 3.8-point benefit and volume was up 1 point, driven by solid sales growth in Mexico, Brazil and India, which grew a combined 15% on a constant currency basis, partially offset by lower exports. Our China team is delivering ahead of expectations on both the top and bottom line. International and Other advertising and related consumer marketing declined 17%, in line with our expectations as we further rightsize our investments to drive more profitable growth. Now, turning to gross margin, adjusted gross profit declined 0.4%, resulting in an adjusted gross margin of 44.5%, a decline of 260 basis points versus the second quarter of last year. This is in line with our expectations for the quarter and was driven by higher freight and logistics costs, unfavorable mix, incremental investments in trade and packaging to enhance the consumer experience at retail, plus additional plant costs related to new production lines. Despite incremental pressure from recently enacted tariffs, we continue to expect a full-year gross margin decline of approximately 125 basis points. Given the pattern of last year's inflationary pressures, we expect year-over-year trends to sequentially improve in Q3 and Q4 versus the first half of 2018. We're making good progress against initiatives to address our gross margin pressures. We believe our price increase, additional capacity for our core brands, enhanced planning capabilities and SKU rationalization efforts will lead to sustainable gross margin improvement. Second quarter adjusted operating profit of $339 million was impacted by $10 million of higher depreciation and amortization attributable to the Amplify acquisition and to our multi-year ERP initiative. This resulted in an adjusted operating profit margin of 19.4%, a decline of 140 basis points. Gross margin declines were partially offset by marketing spend shifts and optimization as well as continued SG&A discipline. Moving down the P&L, interest expense of $35 million increased $11 million versus Q2 of last year, driven by the Amplify acquisition. We had a successful bond issuance in May to secure permanent financing for the Amplify acquisition. The issuance was oversubscribed more than three times with very attractive spreads. Full-year 2018 interest expense is expected to be in the $130 million to $140 million range, in line with our previously stated estimates. The adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was 16% versus 24.8% in the year-ago period, driven by U.S. tax reform. We continue to expect the full-year 2018 adjusted tax rate to be approximately 19% to 20%. Second quarter other income and expense was $20.8 million. Full-year 2018 expense is estimated to be between $65 million to $70 million, consistent with our previous estimates. The decline versus 2017 is driven primarily by lower non-service related pension costs, which, as you know, are now included in other income and expense and we no longer adjust out. We're continuing with our investment tax credit strategies and expect full-year 2018 expense to be comparable to 2017. Note that we expect most of the full-year other income and expense decline to be realized in Q4. For the second quarter of 2018, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 210 million. The company repurchased $22 million of common shares in the second quarter to replace shares issued in connection with the exercise of stock options. The company did not repurchase any common shares against the $100 million share repurchase authorization approved in October 2017. There is $60 million remaining on this authorization. Additionally, the board of directors has approved a new $500 million authorization for a total outstanding authorization of $560 million. There is no change to our target leverage or cash flow priorities. Business growth, including M&A, remains our top priority, followed by dividends, then share buybacks. And as we've shared before, for the right M&A, we consider changing our leverage target. This new authorization enables us to make timely choices based on the outlook for M&A and market conditions. Total capital additions, including software, were $75.8 million in the second quarter. For the full year 2018, we continue to expect CapEx to be in the $355 million to $375 million range. Our capital spending is focused on high-growth, high-margin brands and on technology we believe is critical for the future of our business growth. The additional Reese's line we installed in Q1 has enabled a strong seasonal order as Michele mentioned. And our new Kit Kat line is on track to start producing volume in Q4 and will be a key enabler of the brand's 2019 growth. Additionally, we are expanding capacity on our Ice Breakers gum business. Retail sales there have grown over $145 million over the past four years, more than doubling the size of the business to approximately $275 million. Leading velocities have created additional distribution opportunities that this new capacity will enable us to support. Our ERP initiative is on track. We will be implementing our new planning capability next month that will improve analytics to enable us to make better, faster decisions. It will also free up time for our commercial teams to focus on more value-added work. To summarize for the full year, full year reported net sales are expected to increase towards the low-end of the updated 3.5% to 5.5% range. This includes an updated net impact from acquisitions and divestitures of approximately 3.5 points versus the previous estimate of 5 points, reflecting recent international business divestitures. The outlook for organic net sales is reaffirmed towards the low-end of the slightly up to 2% range. Full year reported earnings per share diluted are now expected to be in the $4.76 to $4.96 range. We are reaffirming full year adjusted earnings per share diluted of $5.33 to $5.43, an increase of 14% to 16% versus last year. Full year adjusted gross margin is still estimated to decline around 125 basis points versus prior year. The adjusted 2018 effective tax rate is approximately 19% to 20% and CapEx spending is estimated $355 million to $375 million, consistent with our previous outlook. We continue to return cash to our shareholders with second quarter dividends of $134 million. This was our 354th consecutive quarterly dividend on the Common Stock. And we're pleased to have announced earlier today a dividend increase of 10%. We're confident in our ability to deliver strong earnings while taking the necessary steps to transform our business model and ensure a healthy, sustainable business in the future. Thank you for your time this morning. I'll now turn it back over to Michele for some closing remarks. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Thank you, Patricia. Our brands are loved by consumers. And next year, we will celebrate our 125th anniversary. Each of us at Hershey are extremely proud that we can share a little goodness into the lives of our consumers. It's one of the things that makes Hershey so special. With our success comes opportunity and responsibility that we take to heart. Our consumers and customers can feel good knowing that as we focus on winning in the marketplace, we are doing so in a way that positively impacts our people and our planet. Our investors can feel good knowing that this makes us a stronger business over the long term. We are focused on delivering the back half of the year, but our top priority remains on long-term value creation. We are making meaningful progress in transforming our domestic and international businesses and our multi-year strategic plan will continue to guide our investment decisions. The rapidly changing retail environment is driven by the consumer and we will continue to drive our business forward by focusing on core brand growth and portfolio expansion, retaining and attracting the best talent to build the capabilities needed to delight our consumers, winning across the total commerce landscape and operating our businesses efficiently and effectively. Patricia, Melissa and I are now available to take any of your questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our first question from Ken Goldman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Thank you. Patricia, your accounts receivable were up fairly meaningfully, I think, around 20% year-on-year. And I realize last year's receivables level was unusually low. But beyond the comparison, was there any reason for the sizable increase in 2Q 2018? I guess really the larger question is whether you feel your shipments and consumption timing were more or less in line with each other this quarter, if there'll be any reversals next quarter or so forth? Just trying to get a sense of that whole environment, so to speak. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Go ahead, Patricia. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Yes. So, the biggest reason for the changes in receivables was clearly the Amplify acquisition as we acquired their receivables. So, that drove that increase. As we look overall to inventories at retail levels, it's always a changing environment. We have some customers where our inventories are up. We have some customers where our inventories are down. Those that are up are focused really on service levels. I think, especially in this tight freight environment, the focus is making sure that they have enough safety stock to get products on shelf in this environment. And there was some inventory out where there was consolidation. And besides that, what we saw was sort of the normal patterns of inventory shifting that you'd expect from seasons and promotions similar to what we had last year. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to the line of Alexia Howard from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Good morning, Alexia. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So, can I ask about the gross margin trends going forward? Obviously, you've been under a lot of pressure for the last year. It looks as though we're getting back to flattish, I guess, in the back half, given the guidance for the full year. What's enabling that sequential improvement as we move through into the second half? Thank you and I'll pass it on. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Patricia, do you want to take that one? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. So, some of it, Alexia, is just frankly lapping the fact that we saw the inflation really start to bite last year at this time especially and I think this was well covered in our call as well as frankly other people around some of the freight inflationary pressures that we had as well as some of the things that we highlighted in our call around the cost of complexity, some of the logistical costs that that drives. So, as we're lapping those, that's a big reason that we see those sequential improvements year-over-year. But beyond that and I think more foundationally, we're really tackling the root causes of a lot of the impacts of what was driving that inflation. So, really working hard on freight optimization, making sure that we're trying to avoid buying in the spot market, we contract our freight in advance and then really pushing hard on complexity, both from what we've talked about before with our SKU rationalization, but getting at some of the even deeper root causes of planning better, which is something we mentioned on this call, using some of our analytics tool. If we can plan it on a more granular level, it avoids some of those costs. So, those are things we're working on. And then, the third benefit that we really see driving that year-over-year improvement in the very back of the year is a strong improvement in international, which continues, as Michele, I think, really highlighted in her remarks, to drive to a profitable growth (33:18) margin. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to the line of Andrew Lazar from Barclays. Please go ahead. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Morning, everybody. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Hi, Andrew. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. I think you mentioned that volume in North America was up 1% and that's a bit better than, I think, what we've seen in some of the scanner. And then, I also thought last quarter that the SKU rationalization you talked about to start to limit some of the complexity, maybe would be a bit more of a drag to North America organic growth in this quarter as well. So, I'm trying to get a sense of whether those things, those programs were the drag that you expected or I guess maybe it's just all the untracked channels at the end of the day, but maybe that differential between what we saw in North America volume with the other aspects I mentioned would be helpful. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. Andrew, so I will start with, as you know, we said that we expected the first half to be our softer half and second half to be stronger. Certainly, as we look at Q2, we did see retail takeaway a little softer and that was partially offset by strength above what we anticipated in non-measured channels as the consumer continues to be fluid relative to where they're purchasing products. And that's very important for us to focus on. I would say that the real impact from SKU rationalization is really going to go much more forward versus Q2. So, we really just kicked the program off in the middle \u2013 first part of the year. And so, we're going to see more of that impact come later. I guess, as you think about takeaway for the year, what I would say is, as we look to the back half, the key levers that really are going to accelerate growth are, first of all, seasons, which you know is about a third of our business. We have strong visibility into seasonal orders, as you know, because customers commit way in advance and we produce in advance and we have very strong commitments on the season, both Halloween and Holiday. Secondly, we have also visibility to customer resets in the fall. And we know, through our partnership with retailers, we have a real a focus on making the shelf as productive as possible and that will lead to some distribution gains for us in the back half of the year. We also have the launch of Reese's Outrageous! which really just began in June, but it really accelerates and we gain full distribution in the second half of the year. So, our instant consumable innovation lap, it's much stronger what we have in place this year than prior year. And I'd say those are some of the biggest factors. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: The only thing I wanted to add on the SKU rationalization is, as you'd expect, the first things that we take out are frankly SKUs with very small volume. So, they're not the ones that you see a big impact of and we also focused a lot on merch units, which, again, you don't see coming through in the scanner data. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Right. Thanks very much. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to the line of David Driscoll from Citi. Please go ahead. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Hi, David. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask some questions just around pricing, but I wanted to start with inflation. Could you guys just quantify your expectations for inflation in 2018? And then, one piece of complexity that's a little unusual, but I think we need to know is, is how much of the inflation is system-wide or industry-wide versus Hershey specific? And I'm really thinking about the stand-up packaging, because I know that that's been a big issue. So, there's a question there on inflation and then, I have a follow-up on pricing. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Okay. Patricia, do you want to handle the inflation question? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. I guess if I take it in some buckets, we're seeing a standard inflation that we always see going through on wages and benefits that again, what I think, is industry-wide throughout the country. Second, the freight inflation is hitting us and we do see that impact as well. Again, I think, that's industry-wide. In fact, I think, our guys have done a really good job of managing that, frankly better than probably the industry. In terms of commodities inflation, I think it's a constantly changing landscape out there. It's not a huge driver for us this year. We have seen some volatility in some of our input costs, like cocoa, but, frankly, we think our hedging program really does a great job of smoothing some of the very short-term swings that we see there. So, those are things that I would say everybody in the industry is seeing, wage, freight, whatever their commodities piece is. And then, you're right, we do have some impacts that are specific to us. I think the ones that I would call out are some of the inflations that we see as just being driven from some of this complexity that we've talked about, which drives some internal logistics costs as well as the packaging, which we have talked a lot about over the last several quarters. And we think that that investment that we've made in more expensive packaging though will really deliver, especially going forward, a better value proposition and impression on shelf to our consumer. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And then, on pricing, can you guys quantify the magnitude and timing of the pricing? And then, one question specifically, I think pricing in the quarter is down. So, Michele, if you could just kind of put this together for me, we're taking a price increase, but yet in the second quarter, pricing was down and it's not even immaterial. I think it's at 1.6%. So, kind of why is pricing so weak in the second quarter, yet there is pricing announcements coming? It's just a little bit of a \u2013 it kind of seems a little bit off in terms of kind of second quarter results and what they suggest versus what it is that you need, but maybe you could pick it up and take it from there. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. Absolutely. So, let me start with the first part of your question relative to the price increase. If you look at our total price increase, the weighted average increase of the total of all the actions we took is about 2.5% across our total business. If you really break that out, as I mentioned in my comments, we've utilized a couple different pricing levers and so, the entire portfolio is impacted by terms. There are select pieces of the portfolio impacted by price-pack optimization. And then, about a third of the portfolio experienced just a straight price increase. So, that's kind of how you can think about it relative to across the portfolio. We announced it this past week as is the case with what we've done historically. We do need to price protect for promotions that are already committed to customers. So, really the prime benefit of that comes closer to next year. As you know, there's a little bit of a conversion on the way to realizing the price. And obviously, we have seasons in the back half of the year that are about a third of our back half where we have prices protected as well. As you look at the second quarter and price realization there, Patricia, do you want to talk a little bit about that? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. So, as we shared before, we have been shifting some dollars into trade this year to support some incremental in-store activity. And then, I think, it's also important to say that there are a number of things going on in our trade line. Some of it did show through on the scanner to the consumer, but it was actually fairly small amount. There's other pieces, which really supported more just in-store activity and then, actually a fair amount of it also was frankly some costs that just shifted from below the gross sales \u2013 the net sales line into net sales for some accounting reasons as well as some prior-year true-ups. So, it was a mix of different things. And I think that, as we go forward, we just always are looking at our trade, making sure that we evaluate the effectiveness of it versus advertising and working with our retailers and making sure that we're really driving the best value possible from those dollars. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. Remember, I guess, I would say, in our category, as you know, one of the most important things to generate from our trade is merchandising. So, we continuously balance how much goes into price. And as Patricia mentioned, there was a relatively smaller amount that really showed up as a retail price decline. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to the line of Jonathan Feeney from Consumer Edge. Please go ahead. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Good morning. Thanks very much. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Hi, Jonathan. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : How are you? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Very good. How are you? Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : I'm doing great. So, I wanted to \u2013 you gave us the top line impact, but a real simple question, trying to understand any color you can give us around what Amplify did both, in total, in North America to margin trend year-over-year and the operating profit trend year-over-year? So, it seems to be there'll be somewhat of a positive impact. Any quantification you can give us or \u2013 directionally would be very helpful? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. I mean we feel good about what \u2013 the profit that we're delivering on the business and it is actually ahead of our expectations. So, we are feeling good that we're over delivering on our acquisition model on the top and bottom line. And so, it's having an impact in line with what we had shared with you earlier relative to, if you look at EPS accretion, we are in line with the range that we had provided and are seeing strong profitability. In fact, the team has been focused on really very strong discipline about leveraging the value of that brand and actually spent some time this year eliminating non-productive promotions to further focus on profitable growth. But really if you look overall, the gross margin impact of that business on our total North America business, just given the size of it, is pretty minimal. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go next to the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Good morning. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got a follow-up question just on price increase. I think in the past, when the pricing in the category has been more episodic, retailers, my recollection of it, has pretty much applied it across the board to everyone. Where here, it's a little bit more dynamic, I guess, right? Your \u2013 part of it is list price, some of it is price pack. So, I guess I'm trying to get a sense from your expectations. Will retailers sort of look at what Hershey is doing in isolation or will they try to sort of apply it across the whole category? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: I really could only speculate on that. So, at this point in time, I really don't know. I'm not sure what their plans will be there. That really rests in their hands. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I guess as you have factored in elasticities (44:28), have you, I guess, thought about that differently maybe than you had in the past? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Well, we always look at where our pricing is. And in some parts of the portfolio, there's a lot of similarity in our portfolio and competitive portfolios. In some parts of our portfolio, there's not. So, we've continued to do a very detailed analytic price elasticity models and evaluate all the learnings across, but we can't really share the specifics behind that. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to the line of Rob Dickerson from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you. I just had a bit of a bigger picture question on international. You've divested the two businesses. So, congratulations on doing that. But just in terms of overall profitability expectations, as we think forward into 2019, but say three years forward, how should we \u2013 or how would you like them the market to be thinking about the operating margin potential on that segment? And I just asked, because I think a lot of us can remember dating back, let's call it, five years when there was an expectation for low-double-digit operating margin on the business. A lot kind of happened in the interim. That kind of went away to an extent. And then, in Q2, you're putting up almost 9% in op margin and that's I'm assuming before some hopefully positive effect that would be coming from the divestments. Thanks. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Sure. So, we feel very good about the profitable growth that we are deriving and how we've reset the markets. And we also see continued opportunity going forward. So, I think without getting into tremendous specificity, I think it would be fair to say that we believe low-double-digit margins will be possible \u2013 could be possible going forward. And I think that's a good way to think about it. Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go next to the line of Steve Strycula from UBS. Please go ahead. Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Quick clarification, just wanted to see whether \u2013 when you talked about the industry price increases and your price increases, across the portfolio, is this in line with some of the peers are doing? Lindt had commented that Ferrero and some others who are out there in the marketplace also taking price. So, first question, I just want to say, is that pretty much at parity with what you're seeing across the landscape? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: I'm not sure that I'm in a position to really comment on others' pricing actions in the marketplace. I think I'd prefer to stay away from that and I'm not sure honestly that I have full knowledge of what others have done, given the actions have been relatively recent. Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: I know there are some of them out there. Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : And then, how should we think strategically about M&A going forward? It seems like, a few times on the call today, you called out the lower leverage of the balance sheet and the appetite to looking at different types of assets in the marketplace. Are you seeing anything out there in terms of the landscape that's more appealing today versus what it was 6, 12 months ago, whether it's asset prices or anything you can kind of speak to? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. We remain committed, as we laid out in our strategy in March of 2017, that M&A is a critical pillar of growth. We see that as an opportunity to capture more snacking occasions, given our strengths and core capabilities in the area of snacking. And so, I would say, we continue to be committed and you can look at our activity and see that we're taking action probably at an increasing rate versus perhaps where we were in the past, at least relative to size and scale of assets. I would say that probably the biggest thing influencing our actions is, I think that we have learned a lot and are applying a lot of lessons from past acquisitions. And so, we have perhaps even tighter screening criteria that allow us, I believe, to move more dynamically to capture opportunity. Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to the line of Pablo Zuanic from SIG. Please go ahead. Aatish Shah - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hi. Good morning. This is actually Aatish Shah on for Pablo. On a more of a structural level for the quarter specifically, just want to know if there's a change in attitude by retailers regarding the chocolate category, specifically if you could touch on this by channel, space allocation, promotional environment, et cetera, that will be helpful. Thank you. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. I would say that the chocolate category and the confection category overall continue to be a category that's very important to pretty much all of our retail base, because it is a category with pretty high profitability and it has produced well for retailers over time. So, certainly, in terms of the level of priority and shelf space, that does vary a bit by different classes of trade and different retailers, depending on their strategies. But overall, I would tell you that we have continued to work with key retailers, some of whom are looking to expand space in the category as they look at other categories in their box and say how do they best master the space allocation. And if you just look at category growth across all categories in store, you know that confection continues to grow faster than many. So, there certainly are many that are looking at that. And then, as we know, there are a couple who have strategies that head in a different direction, and so they probably aren't prioritizing it, but I would say, overall, we continue to feel good about the role of this category and how retailers are viewing it as very important. Aatish Shah - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Jason English from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, folks. Thank you for allowing me to ask a question. I appreciate it. A few housekeeping details, I guess, first, the disposal of Tyrrells and Golden Monkey, what's the anticipated revenue drag on both the tail-end of this year and on a 12-month basis? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Patricia, you want to \u2013 yeah. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. So, you can see that that's really the delta between the 5 points that we talked about from acquisition down to the 3.5 [points]. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. That math sort of implies if we annualize it that those businesses are about a third smaller than they were when you bought them. Is that right? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: I don't think you can do it that way, because for Amplify, Tyrrells is a piece of their business, but for Golden Monkey, it's been changing dramatically as we go. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And a quick back of the math envelope, we get about a 15, 20 basis point gross margin tailwind from exiting those businesses, reasonable? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: I'd have to look quickly. There's a small gross margin improvement, but it's very small. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And then, last question, I'll pass it on. You mentioned \u2013 a two-parter question. On the pricing components, can you specify what that third of the portfolio is where you took a straight price increase? I am assuming it's sort of single serve. And can you give us the magnitude? And you mentioned investment in packaging. Can you contextualize that for us? Give us a sense of what exactly you're referring to. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: So, I can tell you that some of the specific price increases were primarily in the Take Home Packs. And I think that's about as much detail as I want to go into on that. And then, relative to investments in packaging, that's really about the refresh to create strong impactful packaging graphics and structure at retail to capture shelf impact. And that's one of the areas where we look at the total value proposition to the consumer and really try and optimize that value proposition. And that's part of what you see in our broad pricing action. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: What's that mean? Is that like more retail-ready packaging? Is that more stand-up pouches? I'm not sure what your comments refer to. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. So, it's across the board. There are multiple components. A piece of that is retail-ready packaging. A piece of that is a change in the structure of our laydown bags to be standing up and to have more of an impact from that perspective. So, it makes them easier for consumers to use, allows for much greater shelf impact. And as always, when we look at adding value to consumers, we always look at making sure that we're aligning the price value and getting price realization as we invest more in some of our packaging. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks a lot. I really appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go next to the line of Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. A couple of follow-up questions, regarding the e-commerce strategy, it's encouraging to see the sales up 30%, but I'm having trouble figuring out how to think about the mix impact it might have away from higher margin single serve and maybe more towards Take Home. Have you done any math to determine if this dynamic would shift \u2013 would also be a drag on mix? And then, also I think you've said in the past that you can shift spending from one bucket to another to fund all of this e commerce investment that needs to take place, but my concern is that you kind of have to invest in both brick-and-mortar and e-commerce at the same time. Can you elaborate a little bit on those things? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Yeah. So, as you look at e-commerce as a channel, we won a bigger business in e-commerce and on the other hand, we're somewhat fortunate that food and especially condition distribution has been a little bit slower than some other categories. So, we've been able to capture some of the learning that those categories have experienced in terms of really thinking about the packs that we want to sell the price points and what the portfolio looks like in that channel. And I think that is helpful to us as we look at continuing to drive margins. And as we look at the investment in e-commerce, we have really had programs underway to look at how we want to reallocate our resources strategically across the portfolio. So, if you look at the increase in profitability that we have in international, that was a choice to improve profitability to be able to fund some of our other critical strategic initiatives. So, that freed up money. We had a major initiative to reorganize internally to drive even greater commercial value. We took dollars out of SG&A on our corporate functions. And that's another source of funds that we could reallocate. So, what we've tried to do is prioritize all commercial value, which is really bricks-and-mortar and e-commerce as users of funds and then, some of those other areas that I spoke to as sources of funds. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it. Thank you. Melissa A. Poole - The Hershey Co.: Erica, we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. And for the final question, we'll go to John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. Michele, just on the international side, the profit recovery has been pretty good, but I'd like to hear more about your vision for the topline. And that, I guess, Brazil and Mexico, India, they're strong, but they're pretty small relative to the U.S. So, do you see Hershey being more of an America-centric business going forward, you lean more on the export business going forward? Is there an opportunity for version 2.0 in China? How do you think about the resource allocation going forward? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: So, as we think about the international business, our goal is on driving profitable growth. And as we've talked a little bit about our strategy in the past, we have an algorithm that basically says we want to get about 0.5 point of profitable growth from the international business and I think there is a possibility that could go up a bit over time. Canada and Mexico, our scale markets, where we have scale positions, strong businesses that kind of fit one role in the portfolio. And then, as we mentioned, export is highly profitable business. So, we'll continue to run that to leverage our brands in key markets. And then, we're placing some bets when you look at China and India in particular on the huge growth that's going to incur in the future and is occurring in those markets and really focused on building sustainable business models. And pending the outcome of that, we'll determine how much more investment we put there, but I think it's clear that we feel good that those businesses have gotten to a point where their profitability is very good. And we'll continue to make choices as we see the success on individual bets in those markets. John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Just given the experience to Golden Monkey and then, I guess, there's another example of the Bauducco JV elsewhere in the world. I mean what's your appetite for taking on more M&A in emerging markets? I mean do you go with a partner or do you do more JVs? How do you think about that? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: I'd say right now that is not our focus for M&A activity. Our focus is in the U.S. market. So, I feel very good about \u2013 we have enough scale in Canada and Mexico. And I think that we're making really good progress on our own in China and India, not ruling out any potential strategic partnership going forward, but feeling good about our focus on The Hershey brand, on a higher margin portfolio and local talent, doing all the right things to accelerate our business. And I think we've got good success or good proof points that in the past when we've stuck with that, it has worked for us pretty well. John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks for your time. Melissa A. Poole - The Hershey Co.: Thank you all for joining us this morning. I look forward to connecting with you all later today to answer any additional questions you may have. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Thank you. Operator : We'd like to thank everybody for their participation on today's conference call. Please feel free to disconnect your line at any time.",

Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Operator : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to The Hershey Company's Third Quarter 2018 Results Conference Call. My name is David, and I'll be your conference operator today. All participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. This call is scheduled to end at 9 :30 AM. Please note that this call may be recorded. Thank you. It's now my pleasure to turn today's conference over to Ms. Melissa Poole. You may begin your conference. Melissa A. Poole - The Hershey Co.: Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for The Hershey Company's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call and webcast. Michele Buck, President and CEO; and Patricia Little, Senior Vice President and CFO, will provide you with an overview of our results, followed by a Q&A session. Before we begin, please remember that during the course of this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meanings of the federal securities laws. These statements are based on our current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could differ materially from actual events and those described in these forward-looking statements contained in our 2017 10-K filed with the SEC and today's press release. Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe will provide useful information for investors.

Please refer to today's press release for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Michele. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we get started this morning, I'd like to take a minute to recognize and thank Patricia. As I'm sure you're aware, Patricia has announced her intention to retire in the spring of 2019. She has been a valued leader as we have : created a more profitable and sustainable international business model; instilled a more disciplined cost management model across the enterprise; and upgraded the company's financial systems, an important piece of our ERP transformation. Patricia and I will continue to work closely together over the next several months as we search for and transition to a new CFO. Overall, I am pleased with the progress we are making against our key strategic focus areas. Our third quarter results were in line with expectations, and we remain on track to achieve the financial targets we shared earlier this year. Our U.S. core confection retail takeaway and share trends are sequentially improving in line with our expectations, driven by strong Halloween results and distribution gains on core items. The addition of Pirate's brands strengthens our brand portfolio and marks our second high growth, high margin acquisition this year to capture incremental snacking occasions. Our International business continues to deliver profitability improvements, while driving strong constant currency organic sales growth. Importantly, we are achieving these results while staying true to our values and purpose, as evidenced by being named to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the sixth consecutive year. Constant currency net sales increased 3% in the third quarter, including a net benefit from acquisitions and divestitures of 2.5 points. Foreign currency exchange was a 0.7 point headwind. Adjusted earnings per share-diluted of $1.55 increased 20% compared to the third quarter last year. In the U.S., we are focused on executing a strong finish to the Halloween season, both in store and online. From core innovation and occasions programming, to strong sell-in with more than 500 employees volunteering at retail, we are out-performing the category and on track to deliver our first-ever $600 million season. The power of our core brands and breadth of our product lineup enable us to deliver great assortments for trick or treating and Halloween parties. Our focus on optimizing mixes, piece counts and price points has driven strong mid-single-digit growth this year, enabled by some of the core capacity investment and expansion we did earlier in the year. We also have exciting Glow in the Dark packaging on select Hershey's, Reese's and Kit Kat products to add some additional magic to the season. We're seeing great engagement and ideas from consumers on social media for these new products. For those who were able to join us in late August for our digital update, the designed for online assortment bag we featured, made BuzzFeed's top 10 best things to buy on Amazon list earlier this month. If you haven't gotten your candy yet, there is still time. As expected, this Halloween strength and other key initiatives are driving sequentially improved retail takeaway and market share performance on our core confection business. In measured channels, for the last 12 weeks ending October 14, Hershey's CMG takeaway increased 0.4% versus the prior-year period, resulting in flat market share. In the latest four weeks, Hershey's CMG takeaway grew 2.5%, resulting in a market share gain of 22 basis points, with improvements across classes of trade. This enhanced performance is driven primarily by our chocolate brands, which grew 3.2% in the latest four weeks, resulting in a market share gain of 24 basis points. In addition to Halloween, distribution gains on core SKUs and new campaigns are driving better results. On September 13, Milton Hershey's birthday, we activated our new Hershey's Heartwarming campaign. The inspiration for this campaign came not only from Milton Hershey, who believed chocolate can bring people together, but also from others who are using Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bars to create positive connection and bring individuals and communities closer together. Our mission started from the inside out. I, along with hundreds of our employees from across the country, took to the streets to bring a little warmth back to communities through the gift of chocolate that day. This launch is a great example of how we are leveraging new models to make our spending more impactful and efficient. In addition to our paid media, we secured over 2,000 media placements and almost 700 million earned or non-paid media impressions from this activation. We are really excited about the early results we are seeing from this activation. In the past month, since we launched the campaign, retail takeaway on our Hershey's Milk, Hershey's Almond and Hershey's Special Dark Bars, which represent almost $750 million of retail sales, was up almost 7%. Our Reese's performance is also accelerating, as expected, behind Halloween strength, a refreshed campaign and the national rollout of Outrageous. In the latest four weeks, Reese's retail takeaway of plus 5% resulted in a CMG share gain of 30 basis points. In addition, we are making progress against our distribution initiatives we shared in July. Since May, our team has secured over 10,000 incremental points of distribution on our core Ice Breakers Mint pucks in the convenience store channel alone. These items have leading velocities and strong margins for both Hershey and our retailers. This incremental distribution has resulted in improving top-line and share performance for our mints business. This is just one example of how we're leveraging analytics to drive space optimization with our retailers. While our overall points of distribution are down due to the SKU rationalization program we announced earlier this year, we believe our focus on ensuring the highest velocity items are on-shelf will pay dividends for both us and our retailers going forward. As the retail environment continues to change, our category management teams have also identified several opportunities to secure incremental space for the category at select retailers. The velocities and margins of confection items, particularly for iconic brands, are still some of the best in the store. So we are excited to capture these opportunities and keep the momentum going as we exit 2018 and head into 2019. This year's innovation, Hershey's Gold and Reese's Outrageous, are continuing to performance well and are in line with our expectations. We will continue to support both launches in the fourth quarter with consumer promotions and merchandising, to not only drive trial, but also support our core portfolio, as well. In December, we are launching the first-ever mash-up of our two most iconic brands. Hershey's with Reese's Pieces will be available in a bar format. We also have our first new holiday-flavored Kisses in almost a decade this holiday season. Kisses Hot Cocoa Chocolates combine marshmallow-flavored cream and classically delicious Hershey's milk chocolate, recreating the experience of drinking a cup of hot cocoa. Similar to innovation earlier this year, these new products will leverage our iconic brands to drive merchandising and consumer excitement in a very cost-effective way. We are also on track to roll out new, improved packaging on our take-home bars next spring. This change affects more than $0.5 billion of sales and we believe will improve branding, shelf appeal and improved consumer experience. Let me just correct that. It's on our take-home bags, excuse me. This is a great example of non-product innovation that can drive core brand and category growth. And finally, I couldn't be more excited about another upcoming innovation that will launch in March of 2019. Consumers love Reese's in all shapes and sizes. And now, they will have a new experience with a new benefit with our launch of Reese's Thins. This product is about 40% thinner than the original cup, and it appeals to those consumers who want something sweet with more permissibility. They will be available in individually-wrapped pieces in both milk and dark chocolate varieties in our newly-redesigned take-home bags. This product truly provides a differentiated benefit, and we've seen this thins concept play well in other categories. For 2019, we have a balanced approach, a combination of news, packaging innovation, as well as unique offerings that we believe will drive core brand growth. Now, for an update on Amplify, SkinnyPop continues to show strong growth in the marketplace, driven by both distribution and velocity gains. In measured channels, retail takeaway grew 10.3% in the latest 12 weeks ending October 7. This was driven by core SkinnyPop ready-to-eat popcorn, which grew over 8%, resulting in a category share gain of one full point. As we shared earlier this year, our goal has been to maintain the entrepreneurial spirit of the team in Austin, while leveraging Hershey's capabilities to capture new occasions and sales opportunities. The biggest example of this is our category management and shopper insights expertise. The Austin team has spent a considerable amount of time learning from, and developing relationships with our Hershey team to ensure they are fully leveraging our vast data, tools, and insights. This has enabled them to elevate conversations with retailers and secure incremental distribution and better placement for SkinnyPop, as well as provide strategic counsel to retailers on optimizing overall aisle efficiency. These skills and relationships will be critical as we continue to expand our footprint more broadly within snacking. Last week, we closed on our acquisition of Pirate's brands. Pirate's Booty, the principal brand in the portfolio, is a sizable fast-growing cheese puff brand with on-trend, better for you attributes and high margins. We expect the full Pirate's brands portfolio to be a great fit for Hershey's growing portfolio of snacking brands, which is targeted toward consumers who are looking for great-tasting snacks without compromise. As with Amplify, we believe this acquisition is a terrific business model fit with our core capabilities. We are best at driving great brands with scale and high margins in expandable consumption categories. We have a deep understanding of consumer snacking behaviors, best-in-class category management expertise, a growing digital commerce capability, and strong retailer relationships across formats. We believe that all of these will be key assets to expand and grow our full snacking portfolio in the future. Pirate's Booty can be found in grocery and club stores. And we believe there's an opportunity to leverage our category management and insights to work to unlock additional growth, particularly in the mass and convenience classes of trade. Year-to-date, the brand has consistently grown high single digits in measured channels, with growth over 7% in the latest four and 12 week periods. Importantly, the growth has been balanced across both distribution and velocity gains on core SKUs, a key indicator of healthy and sustainable expansion. I hope many of you were able to join our webcast focused on digital commerce at the end of August. We believe the competitive advantages we have in traditional brick-and-mortar stores translate to the digital world for our entire portfolio : beloved brands; deep customer relationships and category management expertise; strength in media; and strong margins. Our initiatives are paying off in 2018. We are increasing trips online. We are trading consumers up to higher price points. And we are driving larger basket sizes, while maintaining our margin profile. Our digital commerce net sales for the quarter were up over 60%. And our market share increased 180 basis points. We believe we have the right strategy, organizational focus, talent, and technology to accelerate growth as industry infrastructure continues to expand. Our investments in U.S. manufacturing capacity expansion are on track. Over the last year, we have invested more than $150 million in U.S. supply chain advancements. The Kit Kat line in Hazleton, PA, announced earlier this spring, is expected to be completed by year-end, and will start benefiting us in Q1, 2019. Additionally, our expansion on Ice Breakers gum and our Midwest Distribution Center are also on track and expected to be complete in the next three to six months. Now, for an update on our International and Other segment, we continue to make great progress on our transformation, with profitability improving meaningfully again in the quarter, while driving top-line growth. Combined constant currency net sales growth in Mexico, Brazil, and India was approximately 10%. In China, our constant currency organic sales were up double digits, driven by focus on our core Hershey's portfolio. Year-to-date, our operating profit is $65 million, already $20 million ahead of our previous full-year segment high in 2012. Importantly, each country is contributing to the profit and top-line improvements as we shift the mix to more profitable core and right-size our investments. Last week, we launched our iconic Hershey Kisses brand in India. Over the past decade, we have introduced a range of Hershey's products that are loved by families across India, from Hershey's syrup, to cocoa, to milkshakes, to chocolate spreads. And Hershey's is a leading brand in each of these categories. We believe the launch of Hershey Kisses will further fuel our growth in this strategic market. In summary, we delivered solid top and bottom-line performance. And we are seeing sequential improvement in retail takeaway trends, CMG market share, and gross margin, in line with expectations. We have a great holiday program ahead of us, and continued distribution gains to keep the momentum going through Q4 and into 2019 on our core U.S. confection business. And our International business and broader snacking portfolio continue to perform well and remain on track to deliver additional sales and profit growth for the company. I'll now turn it over to Patricia, who will provide you with details on our financial results. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Thank you, Michele, and thank you for the kind words. Good morning, everyone. Third quarter net sales of $2.08 billion increased 2.3% versus the same period last year. Constant currency net sales increased 3%, with foreign currency exchange a 70 basis point headwind. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures was a 2.5 point benefit to net sales growth. As a reminder, M&A contribution to overall growth in Q3 was less than in the first half of the year due to our Tyrrells and Shanghai Golden Monkey divestitures. The Q3 contribution from the North American Amplify business was comparable to Q2. Volume was a 1.7 point benefit in Q3, which was partially offset by negative net price realization of 1.2 points. Adjusted earnings per share-diluted of $1.55 was an increase of 20.2% versus the same period last year. Income from a more favorable tax rate, SM&A declines, acquisition and volume growth were partially offset by gross margin declines. We are reaffirming our full year net sales and adjusted EPS outlook. We expect reported net sales to be at the low end of the 3.5% to 5.5% range, with approximately a 3.5 point net benefit from acquisitions and divestitures. We continue to expect organic net sales growth to be slightly up versus prior year. Full year adjusted earnings per share-diluted are expected to be in the $5.33 to $5.43 range, an increase of 14% to 16%. We anticipate the top and bottom-line impact from our recent acquisition of Pirate Brands to be minimal in 2018. By segment, North America net sales increased 2.9% versus the same period last year. The Amplify acquisition added 3.7 points and volume gains contributed 90 basis points. Net price realization and foreign currency exchange rates were a 150 and a 20 basis point headwind, respectively. The negative price realization was in line with expectations, driven by slightly higher levels of planned promotional support as well as true-up of trade accruals and other accounting impacts. These trade rate increases are not resulting in deflationary retail prices on our confection brands. Per IRI, on average, our retail price per pound is relatively flat to prior year. Therefore, we remain confident in our ability to execute the price increase we announced in July. As a reminder, this pricing action of approximately 2.5% had several components and will predominantly impact 2019. While some of the price increase will take place in January, the redesign of our packaged candy portfolio will flow through in early Q2, and seasons will begin realizing price in Q3 with Halloween. With the multiple levers we are employing with this action, we expect retail shelf prices to increase on approximately 20% of the portfolio. Given our targeted approach and continued investment in the category, we expect solid conversion, similar to previous actions. North America advertising-related consumer marketing spend declined 18.5% in the quarter. I want to spend a couple of minutes providing some important details and context here. Media spend for our strategic scale brands was in line with prior year for the quarter. We are leveraging analytic tools to improve effectiveness of this spend to get more reach and impressions for the same amount of dollars. So far this year, we have achieved double-digit ROI increases in four of our top five brands. We are also focused on expanding our reach through earned media by having authentic and appropriate content in the right channels. Our Heartwarming campaign is a great example of this. As we work through new models, we are also taking advantage of cost savings in agency and production fees, as we leverage the appropriate production for different channels. An example of this is the creation of our own in-house production studio that went live earlier this year. This is enabling us not only to take advantage of our great employee creativity, but also to be faster and more cost effective. We have also continued to right-size our investments in our smaller, emerging brands in line with our previously-stated strategy. We remain committed to supporting our portfolio and will continue to invest at levels significantly above industry average. Now, for an update on Amplify, as Michele mentioned, sales growth remained strong, with core SkinnyPop ready-to-eat popcorn continuing to grow high-single digits. We are on track to deliver our acquisition model for both the top and bottom line in 2018 and anticipate approximately $0.08 EPS accretion this year. Third quarter total International and Other segment net sales decreased 1.9%, including a 6.4 point impact from divestitures and a 4 point headwind from unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Volume and net price realization were a 780 and a 70 basis point benefit, respectively. Mexico, Brazil, and India strength continued, with combined constant-currency net sales growth of approximately 10%, and the transformation of our China business is ahead of our expectations. International and Other advertising and related consumer marketing declined 1.7%, in line with our expectations as we right-size our investments to drive more profitable growth. Now, turning to gross margin, adjusted gross profit of $916 million declined 0.6%, resulting in an adjusted gross margin of 44%, a decline of 130 basis points versus the third quarter of last year. This is in line with our expectations for the quarter and was driven by higher year-over-year freight and logistics costs, as well as incremental investments in trade and packaging. As we had shared earlier this year, we expect continued sequential improvement in year-over-year change in Q4, given the pattern of last year's inflationary pressures. Third quarter adjusted operating profit of $471 million increased 5.1% versus the third quarter of 2017. This resulted in an adjusted operating profit margin of 22.6%, an increase of 60 basis points, driven by lower selling, marketing, and administrative expenses. As Michele mentioned, we are really excited about the addition of Pirate Brands to our portfolio. Net sales of the business are approximately $90 million, and EBITDA is between $25 million and $30 million. This acquisition was financed with short-term borrowings and cash on hand. We expect minimal impact to our leverage targets, given our strong cash flow and anticipation of slight accretion in year one for the acquisition. Additionally, there is no change to our credit ratings. Moving down the P&L, interest expense of $37 million increased $12 million versus Q3 of last year, driven by the Amplify acquisition. Full-year 2018 interest expense is expected to be approximately $140 million, the high end of our previous range, including the impact from our recent acquisition of Pirate Brands. The adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 22.8% versus 30.3% in the year-ago period, driven by U.S. tax reform. We expect the full year 2018 adjusted tax rate to be approximately 19%. Third quarter other income and expense was $8.5 million, a decline of $16.7 million versus the year-ago period. This year-over-year decline is driven by timing related to our investment tax credit strategy. Our full-year 2018 outlook remains the same at $65 million to $70 million. For the third quarter of 2018, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 211 million. The company did not repurchase common shares in the third quarter to replace shares issued in connection with the exercise of stock options or against the October 2019 or July 2018 share repurchase authorization. The total combined outstanding authorization is $560 million. Total capital additions including software were $105 million in the third quarter. For the full-year 2018, we expect CapEx to be in the $355 million to $375 million range, in line with previous estimates. We continue to return cash to our shareholders with third quarter dividends of $147 million. This was our 355th consecutive quarterly dividend on the common stock. Our Margin for Growth program is progressing nicely, and we remain on track to deliver the high end of $150 million to $175 million program savings range. We have executed a significant portion of the initiatives and now believe our restructuring costs will be slightly less than initial expectations. We now expect total estimated project costs of approximately $340 million to $355 million, versus our original estimate of $375 million to $425 million. That concludes my financial discussion. Thank you for your time this morning. I'll now turn it back over to Michele for some closing remarks. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Thanks, Patricia. As we have shared consistently this year, we are focused on delivering our 2018 commitments, and we are on track to do so. I am confident in our strategies, and I am extremely proud of our Hershey team as we build momentum in the back half of the year. I am pleased with the momentum on our core U.S. confection business. Our growing snack brands are performing well. And we are excited about the opportunity that Pirate Brands brings to our portfolio. And our International business continues to provide meaningful top and bottom-line growth. We will continue to invest in our business as we look towards 2019. Our pricing strategy will begin to have an impact in 2019, along with strong seasonal growth, including a long Easter, core capacity expansion, solid innovation plans, new campaigns and growing digital capabilities. We will continue to do this while operating in a way that is consistent with our values and purpose. And our focus remains on long-term value creation. Patricia, Melissa, and I are now available to take your questions. Operator : We'll take our first question from Andrew Lazar. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning, everybody. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. I think the start of this year, you had guided consumer spend or advertising and consumer to be down slightly, with more of the focus on spending on analytics and some of the enterprise resource planning that you're doing. I guess year-to-date, it's down a bit more than that, around 10% or so. And I know your long-term targets would have A&C growing more in line with sales. So I guess I'm just trying to get a sense if that's still the expectation longer term. And if so, would we expect some type of step-up next year to get more on that long-term track? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Thanks, Andrew. We continue, as you know, to have a very heavy investment in our brands, much higher than the industry average. And if we look at the investment we've had on our core brands on both in Q3, where it was flat, so we had very stable investment. And on a year-to-date basis, our investment in our core brands was actually up. So what we really try and do as we go through the year is leverage the learnings that we're getting and making sure that we are constantly putting our spend in the most effective places. As we looked at this year and got into it, we believed that we were overspending on some of the smaller brands, and we wanted to reduce that spend to ensure every dollar counts to drive business. And also, we did have an accounting change that resulted in moving some dollars out of the consumer marketing line into trade. So as you look at the go-forward, you're going to see some of that continued right-sizing between now and the end of the year, but as you think about 2019, I would tell you, we are very strongly committed to investing where there are returns. The accounting changes will have lapped the right-sizing of the smaller brands. And you shouldn't expect to see declines like we've had in 2018. We think that we'll be more set in terms of our normal track of spend and moving forward. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Thank you very much. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Bryan Spillane. Your line is open. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, good morning, everyone. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Morning. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Morning. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I guess I just wanted to understand a little bit more, just in the fourth quarter, it still implies a pretty wide EPS guidance range for the fourth quarter. And I guess given the visibility that you have into a lot of the seasonal stuff you're doing, just trying to understand what the variables are that might sort of drive you to the high end or the low end of that range, just why such a wide range in the fourth quarter. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Patricia, you want to take a crack at that? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Yeah, we really haven't had any major changes at all in our outlook for the full year EPS. And we just left the range where it was, just to, frankly, make sure that we were working right into that number. (33:30) Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. So it doesn't imply that there's any potential for like you were anticipating any volatility in costs or shipment timing or anything like that? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: No. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: That's correct. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ken Goldman. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. One quick one and then a follow-up, if I can, for 2018, management had previously guided for the gross margin being down 120 basis points year-on-year and the EBIT margin being flattish year-on-year. I may have missed it, but I don't think you specifically reiterated those numbers. Can you help me out with those? And then, I have a quick follow-up, if you will allow me. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Patricia, you want to talk about gross margin? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Yeah, so Q3 came in right in line with our expectation. And, as we've stated before, really the change versus each quarter is heavily impacted more by the phasing that we saw last year in 2017. So we continue to expect Q4 gross margins to be in line with or slightly up from prior year because last year, the fourth quarter is really when we saw the big impacts of inflationary pressures. So we're also very focused on our continuous improvement program, our Margin for Growth initiatives. In Q4, all of those are on track. I think we'll come in the full year slightly below the 125 basis points, but we continue to be very pleased with the progress that we're making there. In terms of operating margin, it remains where we expected it to be. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. And then my quick follow-up is you had also, of course, not given guidance on 2019, but you had said previously, you expect : sales for 2019 at the low end of the 2% to 4% range; the gross margin up year-on-year; corporate expenses, I think, down as much as $100 million. Again, these aren't officially guidance items, but just for our modeling purposes, as we sit here today, are they still reasonable projections, roughly? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: We really aren't going to talk about guidance until the late January call. So I don't know that we want to give any other additional perspective on that right now. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Right. We're still working through our plans, as we speak. And we'll be back to you in the fourth quarter call with more specificity. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Driscoll. Your line is open. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Hi, David. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Good morning, everybody. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Morning. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Patricia, I'm not sure if we're going to get to hear you on the January conference call, but if we don't, I really do appreciate all your help over the years. My question is just on this emerging momentum within the chocolate franchise. I believe you called out the four week data at up 3.2%, and market share up about 24 basis points. Can you just spend a little time here and talk about the competitive dynamic? Where do you see the momentum really building? What I'm trying to get at here, is it really the seasonal piece of it, so that'll carry through the fourth quarter, but then when we get to the first quarter, it's got to kind of flip to the core franchise? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Yeah, so thanks for the question, David. So we certainly are seeing a big impact from seasons. As you know, Halloween and holiday are some of our largest seasons. We had a very strong sell-in to retail. So the retailers bought. Then, obviously, the key is we need to see consumers buy. And we're really thrilled that we're seeing that sell-through, where consumers are buying and the season is up. And oh, by the way, that bodes well for the (37:21). If we sell-through well, the buy is then very strong. As we look to the end of the quarter, we anticipate a good holiday because, again, we have a good sell-in for holiday and so we're expecting to see that as well. The other place that we are really seeing some momentum and anticipate a bit more momentum is, though most of our velocity or momentum right now is on seasons, we have distribution gains that we've shared with you in the past that we are working towards that we are starting to secure. And we do believe that we'll see more of the benefits of those distribution gains as the year progresses and into early next year. And we've also seen some velocity increases, particularly on the variety brands, where we've invested incrementally, as well as on Hershey and Reese. So we believe that we're seeing kind of the green shoots of that, that we anticipate will continue. So as we look at the fourth quarter, we believe that we'll see continued takeaway strength, you know, we believe at 1% or perhaps greater. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And then, just a quick follow-up, Patricia, if you could just address North American pricing. In your script, I believe you said pricing was negative 1.5%, but that retail level pricing wasn't really changing. So if you're giving lower prices to your customers, what did you get for it? So it's not lowering the price at retail, which I would expect to have like a positive volume benefit, but if you don't get lower retail prices, what are you getting for that price investment? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Yeah, so we had a number of impacts in the third quarter, and some of them are the accounting that Michele already mentioned. So some of our costs moved from our marketing expense off into trade. (39:16) We also had a little bit more prior-year adjustments than we've had -- or we've had more of an impact of that. So that's a piece of it. That's actually not quite half of the change. In terms of the rest of it, different promotional programs deliver different benefits. And we are always trying to mix those out so that the consumer, as well as the retailer, gets the advantage of it. And we see different impacts, in fact, across different segments and classes of trade of our business. We just didn't want to give the impression that we're seeing a deflationary impact on the prices. So we think that our overall trade is working hard for us. We always want to make it work harder. And we continue to feel really confident that the pricing that we talked about earlier will bear the fruit that we're expecting. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Yeah, I'd just also clarify and remind everyone that the pricing action we took really will impact us in 2019. If we look at some of the straight pricing in terms, we anticipate we'll see the benefit in Q1. We'll start to see some of the wait-out that we took on our consumer packaged candy line in Q2. And then, as you know, we plan seasons out very far, so some of the benefits around seasons from pricing will come as late as Q3, just so that you all remember that. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Good morning. Thanks very much. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Morning. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : What role would you say the distribution gains are playing right now with the acquired brands with SkinnyPop? And looking forward into 2019, can you give us some viewpoint as to not only in the Amplify brands, but the Pirate brands that are coming up, are there opportunities to grow through distribution? And again, how much of the growth right now is distribution-driven versus, you know, same-store sales, if you will, or velocity? Thanks very much. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: So, on this piece of the portfolio, Jonathan, both distribution and velocity are opportunities. So we're certainly seeing some distribution gain benefits, because one of the greatest synergy values that we can bring as a company is the category management piece, where in many places, SkinnyPop velocities were the strongest on-shelf within the category, but the distribution or the facings did not match with that velocity strength. So we're about right-sizing that. We are also about expanding distribution into the classes of trade where we have the strongest presence where SkinnyPop was underdeveloped. It was underdeveloped at Walmart, convenience stores, et cetera. We're realizing some of that now, but there's more to come. But velocity is also very important. And we're pleased that we're continuing to see strength in velocity on these brands as well. So you're going to see a mix of both on the entire portfolio of acquisition brands. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks, good morning. Just a question on organic sales, it feels like the fourth quarter might be one where you could have shipments be even stronger than consumption. You mentioned holiday demand or seasonal demand is strong and we've heard that, too. And you talked about some new products that are coming, some of which that may be shipped ahead of the first quarter. So I know your organic sales guidance implies something similar for the fourth quarter as to what you have done year-to-date, but should we be thinking that the fourth quarter would be higher? Thanks. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: So, David, I would say the answer to that is no. As you know, we have noise between takeaway and net sales, given the dynamics of our category, particularly given the fact that about a third of our business is seasonal. And we also have a promotionally-driven business as well. So those things combined with the impact of SKU rationalization, and then as some of you have called out, some inventory contraction. We have some consolidation in the industry that's leading to that. We also do have some retailers who are looking to increase inventory to ensure that they can minimize out of stocks. But as we planned this year, we anticipated that net sales would be below our retail takeaway in the fourth quarter because of some of these factors I talked about, and we're continuing to believe that that will be the case. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good morning, everyone. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Good morning. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So I know you're not giving an outlook for next year, but could you give us some commentary around the progression of the gross margin? You're obviously lapping tough comps. They're getting easier next quarter. We should get more towards the flattish area on the gross margin next quarter. You've got pricing kicking in in a positive way. I'm not sure how much of a headwind some of the other factors like freight and packaging are likely to be next year, or where commodity costs are going. But will we be right in thinking that things are getting easier on the gross margin side from here on out? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: So, let me provide overall commentary. And I'll let Patricia go a little bit deeper. So, Alexia, I would say that I don't know if I would say things are getting easier. Because it feels like they never get easier. But we do believe that we will be making improvement on margins as we exit 2018, and as we go into 2019, part of that, obviously, driven by pricing and the impact that we will get as our pricing hits next year. But do you want to talk a little bit about cost inputs, Patricia? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Yeah, there's been a lot of discussion about freight and logistics, so let me start there. We started to feel the impact of that about a year ago. And that has certainly continued, and I don't expect that to change going forward into next year, because the structural reasons that freight costs are higher are not going to go away, in terms of some of the cost pressures that those give us. Commodities are always something we look hard at. We make sure that our hedging program is focused on really giving us cost visibility into those parts of the portfolio. And we're not expecting a huge impact from that. So, overall, I think what we will see is continued improvement, as Michele said, driven by pricing and our continuous improvement program that we're always extremely focused on. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. I'll pass it on. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Thanks for the question. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Good morning, John. John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Michele, I wanted to come back to the A&C spend. I understand the concentration of resources and also your spend level relative to peers. But when we think about confectionery versus other snacks, I mean, the share of stomach is still under pressure. So, whether it takes the form of ad spend or the other in-store expenses and I think trade pulling up in flat (46:49) for about the last four years or so as it is, why doesn't absolute spend still have to be higher? I mean, is the incremental ROI on core brands leveling off at this point? I'm just trying to square the comments versus the absolute growth. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Sure, so when we think about the right investment, while certainly spend can be a benchmark, the real thing we look at are the number impressions that we're delivering and how we're delivering impressions. And so, if we can get better, more targeted, better insights, better copy, a better media approach, or the addition of social media and earned impressions in the mix, that really influences our decisions about how to support each and every brand. And the other piece simply is, as we look at the portfolio, a lot of this really does come down to some of the smaller brands, where we spent against some of those a bit more like they were a big brand model. And some of the more emerging brands are really driven more by an impact at retail, making the brands visible at retail, ensuring they have the right facings on shelf. And mass media spend is not the right approach for some of those smaller household brands, brands that have, call it, 5% household penetration, versus a brand like Reese that has 55%. So we are spending more on some of the brands like a Reese, and we do testing constantly to understand where there is upside, where we think that we can spend even more and get more. But it's really all based on looking at those impressions we can deliver. John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great, thank you. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Does that help? John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah, absolutely, thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, folks. Thanks for squeezing me in. I appreciate that. First, a quick housekeeping question, you started the year with a tax rate around 20% to 22%. It's now drifted to 19%. Is 19% a good number to assume for next year or is there risk that this drifts higher? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Yeah, again, we haven't planned out all of the 2019 pieces of the business that allow us to hone in on the tax rate, but I think that's a reasonable planning stance. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's helpful. Thank you. And I want to go back to Michele's comment on some gross margin improvement as we go into 2019, with pricing playing an important role. Of the 250 basis points of price, we're getting to around 200 basis points coming from the wait-out initiative on the multi-serve bags. Is that reasonable? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: No. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: What do you have? Melissa A. Poole - The Hershey Co.: Jason, this is Melissa. We had said of the 2.5, about 50 basis points was the retailer terms and then of the remaining 2, it was about half and half between the straight price and the wait-out, so we've called about 100 basis points of the 250. (49:32-49:44) Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And on that wait-out, you mentioned that it's being accompanied with a packaging upgrade. And we were down there in August and, as we discussed, it's clearly a more expensive pack. Does the cost benefit of the wait-out outmatch the incremental cost of the packaging or do you actually get some surplus? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: I don't know that we really want to get into the details of margins by items that we have in the portfolio. I would say that we feel good that as we add value to the consumer, that we are netting out in line with a good value proposition that enables us to cover the incremental costs and still have very strong margins across the business. So I'd say you can think about it as it's net in line. We're not losing anything. We're not realizing a windfall, but it's net in line in terms of covering the costs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Totally. So that kind of net's neutral. We're left with about 150 basis points that can cover the rest of the inflation in the system. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Yep. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: That's fair. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on. Operator : We'll take our next question from Rob Dickerson with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you very much. I just had a simple question on International. Obviously, there was a sizable step-up in volume performance in the quarter and then the operating margin, I believe, was around 13%. So, I asked last call, is the low double-digit kind of run rate over the next couple years still feasible on International and the answer was yes, but we're seeing it now, not two years out from now. So the first question is just is that 13% a rational expectation going forward into 2019 and Q4 and what have you and then also just the volume performance in International, what's driving that outside of just the divestment of Golden Monkey, and is that sustainable? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: So let me talk about the volume performance and then I'm going to hand it over to Patricia to talk a bit about the margin. So, I feel really good about the sustainability of the volume performance. If you look at what we've done over the past couple years here in our portfolio, we have transitioned our portfolio to highly branded higher gross margin items. Our number one focus is on the Hershey's brand and our Hershey's portfolio, and the growth we are getting is from that brand, and from the other invested brands in the marketplace. So, the growth looks to be very sustainable and especially as we've divested parts of the portfolio that really were creating the biggest drag, both in terms of the top line but also profit. So, I'll turn it over to Patricia now to talk a bit about margin. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Yeah, we couldn't be more pleased with the performance of International in the third quarter. They really delivered and, frankly, over-delivered versus where we thought they'd do at the beginning of the year. So we're pleased. The margin performance, though, is pretty seasonal. And fourth quarter is always the lowest margin business because we are spending against Chinese New Year that has not occurred yet. So that's just always a low margin quarter and you'll see that again this year. Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our last question today from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, thank you. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Hi, Rob. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. So I did want to follow-up on the distribution gains and how it relates to inventory. And I do think you're doing the right thing by taking a conservative approach to forecasting inventory de-loading. But you said that your core business distribution has been expanding. When we looked at Nielsen data, I guess overall distribution is still declining this year. Do you have a number for your overall distribution, and is that up or down? And then, I have a follow-up on taxes as a going away present for Patricia. Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: I'm not going to go away yet. You can hold it. Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: So, Rob, I guess as you think about distribution, our biggest focus on driving distribution is on driving productive distribution and really taking a look at what's on the shelf, and ensuring that the highest velocity items are gaining distribution. So while overall points of distribution, given they're not all equal, may not be up, what we're feeling good about is that we are making some really good calls to get more productive items on the shelf. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: And does the SKU rationalization cause any further distribution declines, just for the overall footprint? Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.: Yeah, if you look at total points, I would say yes, because the key things we would be getting rid of are the less productive items. And so some of that can come through, though some of the SKU rationalization is around merchandising units as well, which it doesn't translate to a strict SKU. Melissa A. Poole - The Hershey Co.: Yeah, and, Rob, this is Melissa. We had talked a little bit before when we talked about the SKU rationalization program, that you probably would see more of an impact on net sales than you would retail takeaway, as you're taking some inventory out of the system for some of those merchandising vehicles and other things that won't show up as much in retail, but you would see some inventory contraction there. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And then, Patricia, thanks again for all your help over the years, but for the tax rate guidance now at 19%, that's a little lower than before, but it's related to your other income line because of the government tax program. So where is that line going to come in? Is that going to be around like last year at $95 million because I think the original guidance was a lot lower than that? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: Yeah, we haven't changed our guidance on that. Our full year 2018 outlook is still $65 million to $70 million for the other income and expense. It was lower in the third quarter, as you point out. And that's why you saw the flip up in the third quarter tax break. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. So then if your tax rate then implied for fourth quarter is like 9%, does that mean that your expectations for operating income were a little lower than they were three months ago, or were in line? Patricia A. Little - The Hershey Co.: So, really, nothing has changed for the full year. We always have variability related to this investment tax credit program that we have. And I'll also point out that now there's pension expense in that. The non-service pension expense is in that other income line as well, so that is also creating a little bit of noise, but it's really nothing in the fundamentals has changed. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, all right. Thank you very much. Melissa A. Poole - The Hershey Co.: All right, thanks, everybody, for joining us this morning. We'll be available throughout the day for any follow-up questions you may have. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. And you may disconnect at any time.",

As I reflect on the progress that we've made against our strategic plans and the initiatives we have underway for 2019 and beyond, I'm confident and excited about the future of this company. Before I get into the details of our results, I would like to take a moment to reflect on your 125th anniversary that we are celebrating this year. It's an incredible privilege to lead a company that remains as relevant with consumers today as we were more than a century ago. Everyone here at Hershey has tremendous pride in our incredible portfolio of brands. And it's the care and attention that we put into each of our brands that resonates with our consumers. Our job is to deliver on our consumer's expectations each and every day. We are also entrusted to make the strategic decisions to ensure that Hershey is well-positioned long-term. I would like to thank my Hershey colleagues for their consistent passion and commitment. Now turning to the businesses at hand [ph], we are fortunate to participate in growing categories with amazing brands that consumers love. We have advantage margin, a healthy balance sheet, and differentiated capability. In a dynamic and highly-competitive operating environment, in 2018, we grew our business and delivered on our financial commitment, while strategically investing for the future. In our U.S. core confection business, we invested in new brand positioning and launched new campaigns for our two largest brands, Reese's and Hershey's. We shifted investment to new marketing capabilities that enable us to support more confection brands within our portfolio. By leveraging consumer insights and new capacity, our team drove strong growth and share gains during the Halloween and holiday sales period, while improving our sell-through and reducing markdowns. At the same time, our SKU rationalization program and pricing action are enabling progress on improving our margins. We also expanded our portfolio to capture incremental consumer occasions with complementary acquisitions of Amplify and Pirate's brands. These two high-growth, high-margin, better-for-use snacking asset are a great fit with our Hershey portfolio. They're performing well in the marketplace and they're on track to deliver against our goals. We made tremendous progress with our international business transformation plans, delivering a record year of profit as well as solid growth. This growth was balanced with organic constant currency sales and operating income gains in each of our key markets. Importantly, our teams diligently continue to reduce our foundational cost structure to enable investment in growth-generating assets and capabilities. Our ERP initiative is on track and modules are coming online according to plan. In the second-half of 2018, we launched two commercial focus modules : trade promotion and marketing expenses, and we are pleased with the early results. This ERP initiative is a key enabler to our broader digital transformation efforts. We also will continue to invest in core capacity as we did with our new Reese's and Kit Kat lines in 2018 as well as incremental capacity on ICE BREAKERS Gum and in our broader distribution network. While our gross margin was below expectation for the year, we made progress and improved performance as we progressed through the year. We believe the SKU rationalization program and previously announced price increase position us well to make additional progress in 2019. Now let's turn specifically to progress made in the fourth quarter. We delivered sales and EPS in line with our expectation. Constant currency net sales increased 3.1%, including a net benefit from acquisitions and divestures of approximately 3 points. Foreign currency exchange was a 0.6 point headwind. Adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.26 increased 23.5% compared to the fourth quarter last year. Our strong holiday program resulted in both sales growth and seasonal market share gains as well as improved sell-through at retail. Hot Cocoa Kisses was the number one new holiday item in the category and helped drive merchandizing support and growth for the entire Kisses franchise. This holiday strength resulted in measured channels Hershey's CMG takeaway increasing 1% in the 12 weeks ended December 30th. This was in line with our expectations. As a reminder, takeaway was greater than fourth quarter net sales growth due to the inventory reductions that we anticipated and discussed on our last quarter's call. For the fourth quarter, Hershey CMG market share declined slightly, approximately 20 basis points as competitive activity remained robust. Hershey chocolate takeaway was up 1.9% in the quarter, driven by strength in our Reese's brand which grew 4%. Our new NotSorry campaign and strong seasonal execution enabled by the capacity expansion we implemented in the first quarter of last were key contributors of this growth. We activated additional chocolate brands within the portfolio in 2018. And we are pleased with the results. Combined retail takeaway for York, Almond Joy, Mounds, and Payday was up 2% in the fourth quarter. A seven point improvement versus the 2017 trend. And it was driven by velocity. We leveraged new more efficient marketing model to support these brands. And believe there is additional opportunity to bring more of our smaller but highly differentiated products to light in 2019 with this approach. Our ICE BREAKER business continued to perform very well with retail takeaway growth of more than 9% during Q4. This was driven by distribution and velocity gains on our gum business, resulting in growth of over 18% during the quarter. Our investments in digital commerce are resulting in consistent solid net sales growth of approximately 40%. We expect to see similar momentum in 2019 as we continue partnering with our retailers on differentiated offerings that meet our customer's needs. These gains were partially offset by continued softness in our non-chocolate portfolio and sales declines from items impacted by our SKU rationalization program. We expect these headwinds to persist in 2019 as we focused on initiatives to drive growth within our chocolate portfolio and continue to reduce complexity to improve margins. As we look more broadly across the portfolio, total Hershey retail takeaway in the fourth quarter was slightly higher at 1.2% driven by SkinnyPop and Pirates Booty. SkinnyPop retail takeaway remained strong with growth of 9% in the 12 weeks ending December 30th. The core ready-to-eat popcorn portfolio grew 6.5% led by continued household penetration gains. This resulted in a category share gain of 28 basis points in the quarter. Pirates Booty grew approximately 5% in the quarter outpacing the category. Similar to SkinnyPop, these gains were driven by increases in household penetration. For 2019, we have a balanced plan to build on our second-half 2018 momentum. We expect annual net sales growth of 1% to 3% and adjusted earnings per share diluted growth of 5% to 7%. We believe this growth will be driven by improving organic sales growth and profitability within North America. Let me provide you with some details around our plans. For our U.S. confection business, we anticipate growth from seasonal strength, pricing, core distribution gains, innovation, and new brands positioning, a very balanced set of growth levers. Our seasonal growth will benefit from a late Easter, adding approximately three weeks of additional selling days for the season. While there will be some offset in our everyday sales, we do expect a net positive impact to the business based on historical patterns. Merchandizing is already off to a strong start on consumer's Easter favorite : Reese's and Cadbury eggs. Additionally, we expect our strong Halloween and holiday performance from 2018 to result in increased orders for the upcoming season. Our previously announced price increase of approximately 2.5% is on track. As a reminder, we expect the P&L impact to build over the course of the year. Similar to past price increases we anticipate some volume impact on items experiencing higher retail shelf prices. As we rationalize less productive SKUs in the portfolio, we continue to make progress in securing distribution on higher velocity items to maintain and optimize our shelf space and improve productivity for both Hershey and our retailer partners. We are also focused on securing incremental space for the entire category. We are consistently collaborating with our retailers on ways to adapt to this rapidly changing environment and optimize space to drive sales and margin. We recently partnered on and implemented a new front-end planogram at a key customer to increase space for snacking and is showing promising results so far. Hershey performance in stores that implemented this change are currently pacing 500 basis points ahead of stores with the old planogram, strong retail partnerships are always a key priority for us and has helped to fuel our success. We are excited about our core marketing and innovation plans for 2019. As we discussed last year, we have both packaging and product innovation that we believe will drive consumer engagement and increase sales. The transformation of our packaged candy portfolio is on track and starting to hit shelves after Easter. This will benefit many of our chocolate brands with better shelf impact and improved velocity. Additionally, we will continue to leverage our in-house creative studio and new media model to support the breath of our portfolio in 2019. Investing in our portfolio has always been and will remain a critical part of our business model. We constantly look for ways to engage with our consumers in new, different, and more efficient ways. Our Reese's Spreads launch will be in this new improved packaging. And it's on track to hit shelves after Easter. This great tasting product gives consumers another way to enjoy their favorite combination of chocolate and peanut butter. And it will be available in both milk and dark chocolate varieties. Reese consumers are passionate about their cups. And we will leverage TV media, in-store merchandizing and social to engage with them and drive excitement and ultimately incremental purchase. And we will continue to have a lineup of new such our Hershey with Reese's Pieces launch to drive relevancy and merchandizing. While our overall innovation lineup is comparable to 2018, the contribution will be slightly SKUed to the second-half. Also as a reminder, the late Easter will drive slower retail performance in February and March, and then rebound in April. We expect the category to accelerate slightly in 2019 driven by the longer Easter, and we expect our performance to be in line with the category. We feel confident about the actions we are taking both to compete today and to build for the future. But as you all know, the competitive environment is intense, and it is taking more to win. We are committed to investing in our business to maintain our leadership position while also delivering our financial commitments. Now for an update on our 2019 plans for our recently acquired snacking assets, Amplify remains on track and is expected to grow mid-single digits in 2019. SkinnyPop is projected to grow share in the ready-to-eat popcorn category behind additional distribution gains and a new marketing campaign. As we shared last year, some of our confection capabilities can be applied to broader snacking, this has been a priority area for us and we are seeing some great progress. The Pirate's Booty integration is proceeding nicely and the Amplify team in Austin is preparing to take over selling responsibilities. As with SkinnyPop, Pirate's Booty has a focus set of four SKUs with high velocities that weren't greater shelf presence and we plan to leverage our category management capabilities to drive distribution in 2019. I want to thank all the teams working hard to integrate and drive sustainable growth on the important brands. I'd also like to take a few minutes to recognize our international team who have done an amazing job executing our transformation plan. We expect to make continued progress internationally in 2019, how bad at a slower pace given the significant gains we drove in 2008. We will continue to leverage our strengths and focus on our Hershey's first strategy, which has resulted in solid Hershey brand share gains in our focus market. In Mexico, the Hershey brand has grown share of the chocolate category for 17 straight clods. In Brazil, the Hershey brand is growing share of the bar category in a highly competitive environment. And in India, we are gaining share in syrup spreads and drinks. The Kisses launch in India is on track and we are excited by the opportunity here. We have also launched gifting items under the Kisses brand in Mexico, which we believe will enable us to capture an incremental premium occasion to drive growth. While we are confident in the plans we are executing, we remain cognizant of potential geopolitical risk that could impact international performance in 2019. We are focused on driving actions within our control and managing risks as effectively as possible. In summary, in 2018, we delivered our financial commitments, and we continue to invest in our future growth. Our core confection sales and margin trends are improving and we believe we can further build on this momentum with a balanced 2019 plan. Our recently acquired snacking brands continue to see strong growth and deliver against our financial objectives and our international business remains on track. We remain focused on driving long-term shareholder value by delivering balanced top and bottom-line growth in 2019 while investing in differentiating capabilities to expand our competitive advantage in the future. I'll now turn it over to Patricia, who will provide you with details of our financial results. Patricia Little : Thank you, Michele. Good morning everyone. As anticipated, fourth quarter net sales of $1.99 billion increased 2.5% versus the same period last year. Constant currency net sales increased 3.1% with foreign currency exchange, a 60 basis points headwind. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures was a three-point benefit to net sales growth. Volume was a 90 basis point benefit, which was partially offset by anticipated negative net price realization of 80 basis points. For the full-year 2018, net sales increased 3.7%. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures was a 3.6 point benefit. Organic constant currency net sales growth of 0.3% was partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of 0.2 points. Adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.26 in the fourth quarter represented an increase of 23.5% versus the same period last year. This was driven by more favorable tax rate as M&A declined acquisition and volume growth. For the full-year 2018 adjusted earnings per share diluted of $5.36 was an increase of 14.3% versus the full-year 2017. This was driven by favorable tax as M&A and acquisitions partially offset by gross margin declines. By segment in the fourth quarter North American net sales increased 4.3% versus the same period last year. The Amplify and Pirate brands acquisitions added 4.8 points and organic volume gains contributed 80 basis points. Net price realization and foreign currency exchange rates were 110 and 20 basis points headwinds respectively. These results were in line with expectations. North America advertising and related consumer marketing spend declined 13.3% in the quarter, this was in line with expectations consistent with what we shared throughout 2018, these declines were driven by optimization of emerging brand spend, as well as media efficiency gains as we leverage new models and channels to reach consumers. Despite the spend declines for the full-year, our consumer impressions were up on our chocolate brands. In 2019, we expect the year-over-year changes in advertising and related consumer marketing spend to be more comparable to our historical patterns and grow relatively in line with sales. Now for an update on Amplify and Pirate brands, accounting for the materials divestiture the Amplify business came in according to plan on both the top and bottom-line. The acquisition was approximately $0.08 EPS accretive consistent with our previous guidance. The Pirates brands contributed slightly to our overall sales performance and had a negligible impact on our earnings in 2018. Fourth quarter total international and other segment net sales decreased 8.9% including an 8.4-point impact from divestitures and a 3.1-point headwind from unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Volume and net price realization were 190 and a 70 basis points benefit respectively. Organic constant currency net sales in our focus market Mexico, Brazil, India, and China grew 7%. International and other advertising and related consumer marketing declined 13%. In line with our expectations as we right size our investments to drive more profitable growth. Now turning to gross margin, adjusted gross profit of $844 million increased 1.9% resulting in an adjusted gross margin of 42.5%, a decline of 20 basis points versus the fourth quarter of last year. This was a meaningful improvement versus our first task in third quarter trends although slightly below our estimate for the quarter. The lightness was driven by the disposition of underutilized packaging assets related to the upcoming migration of our package can utilize in the second quarter of 2019. Excluding this impact, our gross margin was slightly up versus prior year in line with our expectations. We believe we will continue to make progress in 2019 and expect modest gross margin expansion for the year. Fourth quarter adjusted operating profit of $369 million increased 13.1% versus the fourth quarter of 2017. This resulted in an adjusted operating profit margin of 18.6%, an increase of 180 basis points driven by lower selling marketing and administrative expenses. As we look forward to 2019. We expect operating profit margin to expand slightly above our recent historic average. This is driven by pricing and productivity initiatives in both cost of goods sold as well as SM&A. As a reminder, we over delivered our margin for growth program expectations in 2018 with savings of approximately $90 million partially driven by the acceleration of some savings originally stated for 2019. Additionally, we expect some of the remaining savings to flow through into 2020 due to the phasing of our ERP implementation. We continue to expect our overall margin for growth program savings to be towards the high-end of our $150 million to $175 million range. Moving down to P&L, interest expense of $38 million increased $12 million versus Q4 of last year driven by the Amplify and Pirate brands acquisitions. Full-year 2018 interest expense of $139 million was in line with our previous guidance. In 2019, interest expense is expected to be approximately $150 million to $160 million, a slight increase versus 2018 due to acquisitions. The adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 9.5% versus 15.1% in the year ago period. This resulted in a full-year 2018 adjusted tax rate of 19.2% versus 26.6% in the year ago period in line with our expectations both the fourth quarter and full-year tax favorability was driven primarily by U.S. tax reforms. In 2019, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 17%. In the fourth quarter, other expense was $38 million, an additional expense of $10 million versus the year ago period. This year-over-year decline is driven by timings related to our investment tax credit strategy as well as favorable non-service related pension expense. Full-year 2018 expense of $69 million was in line with our expectations. In 2019, we expect other expense to be approximately $105 million to $115 million. This reflects a higher investment and tax credits as well as additional expense associated with our pension assets, due to the year and negative stock market performance. For the fourth quarter of 2018, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 211. In November, the company purchased $48 million of common stock from the Hershey Trust in connection with the exercise of stock options. The company did not repurchase common shares in the fourth quarter against the October 2017 or the July 2018 share repurchase authorization. The total combined outstanding authorization is $560 million. Total capital additions including software was $87 million in the fourth quarter. For the full-year 2018 capital additions were approximately $329 million. This was slightly below our estimates driven primarily by lower capital spending required to support the Amplify integration. For the full-year 2019, we estimate that CapEx will be in the $330 million to $350 million range. As a percent of net sales, this remains slightly higher than our long-term targets as we continue to advance our ERP transformation and invest in core capacity. We continue to return cash to our shareholders with fourth quarter dividends of $147 million. This was our 356th consecutive quarterly dividend on the common stock. We expect full-year 2019 net sales to increase 1% to 3% including approximately half-a-point net benefit from acquisitions and divestitures. We are claiming a negligible FX impact for the year. However, the environment is very volatile. We anticipate FX will be a slight headwind in the first-half and a slight tailwind in the second-half. As a reminder, the SKU rationalization program we announced last spring will continue to impact net sales for the first-half of this year. This, in addition, to the timing of divestitures key marketing activities around innovation and packaging, and FX impacts are expected to result in stronger net sales growth in the second-half of the year. Full-year adjusted earnings per share diluted are estimated to grow 5% to 7% driven by operating profit margin gains as well as a more favorable tax rate. Due to the timing of investments throughout the year as well as the gating of the sales growth, we expect EPS growth to be stronger in the second-half of the year. We take a balanced and disciplined approach to building our brand and evolving our business model for the future. We have strong cash flow and a healthy balance sheet that gives us flexibility to make the necessary investments to drive long-term shareholder value. That concludes my financial discussion, thank you for your time this morning, and I'll now turn it back over to Michele for some closing remarks. Michele Buck : Thanks, Patricia. I remain confident in our strategies and I am excited about what we here at Hershey have ahead of us in 2019 as we look to drive a year of balanced growth. As we talked about, the marketplace continues to advance at an accelerated pace. I am optimistic that this change creates opportunities for us to engage with our consumers in new and innovative ways to unlock growth. As I mentioned at the top of our call, 2019 is our 125th anniversary, and it's an incredible time to be here at the company. Our remarkable employees are dedicated to delivering the best quality and the best experience for our consumers each and every day. That hasn't changed over the past century, and it will continue into the next. Patricia, Melissa, and I are now available to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ken Goldman : Hi, good morning. Michele Buck : Good morning. Patricia Little : Good morning. Ken Goldman : I just wanted to poke around a little bit on the de-load [ph], can you frame for us - I don't think you quantified the impact of it, so if you did, forgive me, but I'm just trying to get a little bit of a sense of the number there. And then I also want to get a sense for you know, where retail inventories currently sit as far as you can tell, you know, are they still up year-on-year after the de-load - I really just want to get an idea of further risk as we look ahead, because I know you guys talked about how the de-load was in line with your expectations, but I don't think most people on the street were quite prepared for it as perhaps you guys were? Michele Buck : So let me just start, Ken, and then I'll turn it over to Patricia for more details. The year did close in line with our expectations, and we know that as more data and analytics are available retailers are constantly looking in how they can optimize inventory levels as we all are, and we do expect that to continue into 2019, and those assumptions are built into our guidance, but I'll let Patricia give a little bit more detail around that. Patricia Little : Yes, as we talked about on the third quarter, we have good insight, especially on some of our bigger customers in terms of their inventory. And we knew that there would be some de-load in the fourth quarter, and you saw that play through in the difference between the sales and the retail takeaway. That was absolutely in line with our expectations. We don't have as good an analytic on all of the, you know, many, many customers, but we know that overall we believe that inventory came down through this system. We expect that to continue into 2019 as Michele said, again, really related to broad secular trends in the industry. On any given quarter, that will have a lot of movement based on season, based on timing of pricing, which we think was an impact this year looking at when promo activity is innovation timing. So quarters can be very - have a lot of movement, but this was exactly what we - we ended the year exactly as we expected. Ken Goldman : Okay, thanks very much. Operator : And our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is open. Brian Spillane : Hey, good morning everyone. Michele Buck : Good morning. Patricia Little : Good morning, Brian. Brian Spillane : Hey, just one clarification and one quick question just on the clarification, Patricia, you talked a little bit about share repurchases, and it just wasn't - I want to make sure clear, the EPS guidance range for this year does not assume a reduction in the share count? Patricia Little : You know, we have a long-term historic average of doing share repurchase on a discretionary basis every year, and we always put that into our plans, because otherwise it would just show us - especially, in the absence of acquisitions, which are hard to - which we don't put in plan which show us building cash. So there is a modest amount of our normal run rate sharing purchase included in the plan. Brian Spillane : Okay, but nothing unusual relative to history? Patricia Little : Correct, nothing unusual. Brian Spillane : Okay, all right. And then, Michele, you talked a little bit about the, I guess, the gap between - in North America, the takeaway in chocolate versus non-chocolate, you know, so the non-chocolate being a drag, and I guess, that didn't SKUed [ph], can you just give us a little bit more color what the magnitude of that is, and then I know - I guess, it's still going to be a drag in '19, but is it less of a drag in '19 than it was in 2018? Michele Buck : Yes, so the SKU rationalization is probably the bigger impact on the business and that's about a point in 2019 and that's about the same that it was in 2018. Brian Spillane : Okay. Michele Buck : And then relative to the non-chocolate portfolio, I would say the impact will be similar in '19 versus '18 as you know the large proportion of our business is chocolate. So from a magnitude perspective, I think, that can give you a little bit of a feel of the size of that. Brian Spillane : Okay, great, thank you. Michele Buck : Sure. Operator : We will take our next question from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Your line is open. Andrew Lazar : Good morning, everybody. Patricia Little : Good morning. Michele Buck : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Lazar : Okay. I know heading into this year, Hershey obviously had worked through a decent chunk of some SKU rationalization as you've talked about, some trade inventory reductions you made capacity investments and divested some businesses that have been a drag. This year you've got, obviously, the benefit of a longer Easter, getting some pricing in place. And then you've still got incremental cost saves as well. So, I guess my question is, maybe why wouldn't we see maybe more of an - like on algorithm type of year with respect to the top and bottom line. Maybe in other words, would you characterize '19 as still a year of incremental investment or perhaps you're being a little bit more cautions on things like volume elasticity in relation to the pricing and things of that nature. Thanks very much. Michele Buck : Well, Andrew, yes, we feel really good about the plans and the activations we have this year. And I think what we feel great about is how balanced - how many different growth levers we think we're really pulling. So, as you know, as we mentioned, we expected to accelerate performance in our important North America market. However, that SKU rationalization is still impacting us at about that point, as I mentioned. And if you add that back in to where growth is, that really puts us smack dab in terms of where the long-term guidance is. So, the price increase, which will have a little bit of an impact. We feel good about the price increase, but we do anticipate a little bit of volume conversion, which as you know, based on history, you get a bigger volume impact, and then it works its way back up throughout the year. And we'll continue to see that little bit of softness as retailers continue to optimize inventory. And we feel great about the plans and the acceleration, but that SKU rat is really the biggest - kind of the biggest offset. Andrew Lazar : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Robert Moskow : When I try to add up the big building blocks for 2019, it does shape up to be a very different year in terms of what's driving the profit growth. In 2018, as far as I can tell, International segment profits grew a lot. And I think that was largely due to overhead reductions. You had a big advertising cut, like an 11% cut. And then when you think about 2019, those kinds of benefits kind of go away. And what's driving '19, it looks like, is more gross margin expansion, which is fueled a little bit by the pricing, and maybe some other factors. And then maybe the tax rate is a benefit too, although I'm a little unclear. So, is that a more difficult task in '19 given the competitive intensity that you brought up, and also the pressure from retailers that's pushing inventory down? Thanks. Michele Buck : Now, I feel confident that we've done a very solid job building this plan, and that we have all the right building blocks to deliver that growth and profit algorithm in the way that we've laid out. So I wouldn't say that it is a - I wouldn't say it's a more difficult task. I think we're excited about what we have to deliver that. I think our pricing is on track, so some of the levers that are going to deliver that are already in place. The Easter season which benefits us, pricing, we feel really good about the innovation that we have. So, we feel great about it. Patricia Little : And just to comment on the taxes, that will be a benefit, the slightly lower tax rate, but that will be basically offset by the fact that, as I mentioned, our non-service related pension costs will be higher in 2019 due to just outset performance at the end of the year. So, that's not a big net overall change to our EPS. Michele Buck : Yes, Rob, what I would say is I just think we've taken into account a lot of the varying factors going on in the marketplace in a better way than we ever have in the past, and have a strong plan. Robert Moskow : I appreciate that. But can you comment on the pricing in North America in fourth quarter, it was more negative than I thought it would be. Did some of your price increase get implemented in fourth quarter or did any of it get implemented? Michele Buck : As we've seen over history, it really takes a period of time for our pricing to hit the marketplace because of the seasons which are sold in so far in advance, and then protecting promotional programs which are usually also about six months out commitments. So, that really would not normally hit till '19, that's when we're anticipating to hit. We've seen a little tiny bit of it show up already, but it'll build as we go throughout the year. So it's totally in line with expectations. Robert Moskow : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi. Your line is open. David Driscoll : Great. Thank you, and good morning. Michele Buck : Hi, David. David Driscoll : I wanted to ask about your price-volume elasticity expectations. You made a couple of references, Michele, but specifically would volumes be negative in North America in 2019? You've got the longer Easter, but it is a price increase, and so just curious if you actually would guide negative volume growth in North America for 2019? Michele Buck : I would say closer to flattish on volume. David Driscoll : Okay. Michele Buck : Given that we've seen historically and what our elasticity data would show. David Driscoll : And Patricia, you mentioned, and I think you reiterated in your script, the margin for growth the total program achieving $175 million. You've been at this level for a little while. It sounds like the program is going very well. Is there a possibility of upside to this program? And just give us some cadence here as to how you guys are thinking about that. It's been a while since this program is out, just curious about your revision process. And then specifically, what is the savings expected in 2019? And then I just would love an update on your CFO search, Michele, just to see how that's going? I don't think you mentioned that, but curious how that's going as well. Thank you. Patricia Little : So, I'll start on the Margin for Growth program, we've been really pleased with how it's done. In really two senses, I just want to say clearly in one sense, and we've talked probably a lot about this, is in terms of the savings that we've had in a lot of function. And I just want to thank all my colleagues on work on, I think, a very effective program. But I also want to say I just never want to forget this, we also use this as an opportunity to invest in more of our commercial capabilities, so is really a change in that, and that's gone very well also. So, we pulled ahead a fair amount into 2018, as I mentioned, that primarily comes out of 2019. There's a small piece that, given just some of the timings as we get into the details of the program, got pushed into 2020, and that relates around some of the - honestly a lot of it is in the finance function gated by our ERP transformation. That'll leave us, I think, pretty much where we expected to be earlier in the year, which is the high end of the program, closer to the $175 million range. And I would expect, if you sort of do that math that puts us in the $30 million to $40 million range for 2019. Michele Buck : And then, David, to follow-up on the second part of your question regarding the CFO search, it's on track. I have nothing to report at this time, but well, we'll know as soon as we make our announcement. David Driscoll : Thank you so much. Michele Buck : Thanks. Operator : And we will take our next question from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Your line is now open. Jonathan Feeney : Good morning. Thanks very much. Michele Buck : Hi, Jonathan. Jonathan Feeney : Hi. I wanted to dig into the gross profit a little bit. And forgive me if this isn't - just tell me what you feel like you can. But I'm trying to understand this, and I know there's some moving parts, but what an organic rate of gross profit looked like for the fourth quarter broadly. Was that particularly in line with your expectations, because it was a little bit behind mine? And maybe what role costs played, where they a headwind, is there a tailwind there, and what does that mean on the cost piece for 2019? I believe you already commented on gross profit for - gross margin for 2019. Thanks so much. Patricia Little : So, as I mentioned, we had the - we did have a small write-off in the fourth quarter related to some - we disposed of some underutilized assets. Absent that, we would have been closer to a positive 20 basis points for the quarter. In terms of the underlying cost structure, I would say that what we've really seen, clearly, we as well as everybody else have been hit by inflationary pressures as well as some of the negative price realization. And what you see is that stabilizing in the fourth quarter, especially things like freight, logistics, costs like that they remain high but stable. Going into 2019, we don't see a real reduction in those. We think we're doing a good job of optimizing freight and logistics, but there's still a base level of inflation in that, as well as packaging. We're also starting to see some of the wage inflation related to some of the high employment rates that you especially in some of - like our distribution centers, so that's also a bit of a pressure on us. Opposite that, so we will have some good news in our commodities based on where some of the commodities pricing or hedging program puts us. So, all of those puts and takes puts us at a modest improvement for 2019 growth margin. Jonathan Feeney : That's really helpful, Patricia. But I guess and again if you don't want to comment fine but I was just thinking you brought private brands to gross profit and you've got a certain amount of the amplify gross profit and I know that some of that got divested but net of that it looks like that seems to be a bigger number than the $15 million in adjusted gross profit year-over-year and I know you have a divestiture, I mean you've got rid of the divestiture that you just talked about, when you net all of that stuff out, I'm trying to understand what the trend is in your organic greater gross profit, so when all this stuff goes comparable, we kind of understand what's going on, is that clear? Patricia Little : Yes, it is. I would have to think it through that way and I think what we're saying though is those were to get impact what we said all along, we didn't get negative growth margin and we see that goes up to base up the fourth quarter building play there is reaction from amplify is really hardly anything in the fourth quarter. I mean we have to take a little bit further detail offline. Jonathan Feeney : Yes, we can take it further offline later, thanks so much, appreciate it. Operator : And our next question is from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. David Palmer : Thanks, good morning. Question on your U.S. organic growth as we head into 2019, it feels like it's one way to organize the outlook is to think about the big three things going on you have the confectionery innovation that you're doing, you have that SKU rationalization and then you have the build out broader snacking in the distributions you might get there, Could you touch on the big buckets that as you see them and perhaps compare that to 2018 and help us understand where you see an acceleration in organic growth coming from? Thanks. Patricia Little : Yes, absolutely, so I think at the kind of highest level there will be an acceleration in North American growth driven by price, there will be acceleration driven by season both Easter as well as Halloween and holiday and certainly there will be a contribution from snacking that will be incremental as well and I think I mean I think those are the real biggest buckets to focus on as the biggest change from a year-on-year perspective. David Palmer : I guess just a follow up, if I were to concentrate on the core confectionery side of things, I guess one thing I wonder about is you've had a few different new products, some of them are combinations of research pieces in your core trademarks, you've kind of gotten two and half years it feels like into some of these call mega extensions and I wonder about the incrementality of the new stuff you're doing versus perhaps the fate of some of the 2017, and 2018 vintages of these extensions, is that something you're managing and do you think you can still manage that on a net positive basis? Thanks. Patricia Little : Yes, so as you think about 2019, what I'm really excited about in our innovation plan is that our two big innovation are the chocolate packaged candy packaging reinvention which is really a better package but the same product with drive Shelton packed in usability et cetera and then re-spent and we've got a great track record of innovations on this and also any time we innovate close to the core. So I think the innovations we have in 2019 have a lot of the levers to that are tend to be correlated with some of our bigger successes and then I think you're right as we look at SKU rationalization, we include in that some of the past innovation that has had a couple good years of growth but maybe has dwindled down a bit to the point where we have more productive uses of the shelf space and so that's kind of included in that. David Palmer : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jason English : Hey, good morning everyone. Thanks for spotting me in. I was hoping you could comment on the amount of pricing that you expect to be realized in the P&L this year, I heard you say you're on track for the 250 bps contribution but it sounds like the timing of the new bags is going to happen a bit later than we expected and obviously what we're entering the year with what looks to be a fair amount of year-on-year increase in trade spend at least, so we're closing last year which is clearly net price drag, as we contemplate the puts and takes of all that, what do you expecting the growth of the P&L? Patricia Little : Approximately about 1.5 for the year, as we talked on the last call, it does build throughout the course of the years of the full 3.5 doesn't get realized in the overall P&L, you have built up to that 2.5 by the time you get to the third quarter, so all in that's about all about 0.5 for the year. Jason English : Okay. Thanks and sorry if you guys had previously given that clarity and then I want to come back on this derationalization drag, I think hearing to your prepared remarks, I mentioned this derationalisations is affording the ability to swap out on productive SKUs with more production SKUs, if that's the case shouldn't this be an acceleration and you're putting higher productive SKUs on shelves, shouldn't be adding to growth net, net and if I know I know you're sitting the drag, what am I missing there? Patricia Little : Well, there are inventories that get pulled back associated with some of those SKUs, and that's what drives part of that drag, so there's a transition timing, there's the inventory piece and that really creates that. Jason English : Got it and last question, just these are sort of rapid fire ones, I know in the last call you flagged retail takeaway was tracking about 2.5% you are gaining share, your takeaway has slowed your shares kind of slipped negative despite the strength in Halloween, can you give us some context in color of what drove that sequential consumption deceleration? Patricia Little : I think I believe we stated we expected our retail takeaway to be about 1% in the fourth quarter and that's exactly where we came in and the key drivers were as we expected, we had some really strong seasonal strength that was the biggest driver. And our share decline decelerated as well, which was expected. Jason English : Okay, all right, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Your line is open. Alexia Howard : Good morning everyone. Patricia Little : Good morning. Alexia Howard : Hi, I'm trying to have a little poke into the drivers of gross margin, I know there's been a couple of questions on this, but I'm thinking particularly around the outlook for 2019 over the last 18 months, I think you had some headwinds from packaging things like the shelf ready packaging being along with gross margin products maybe some extra packaging costs because of online different format and maybe having to go out to per manufacturers a bit more often to get those different pack types, if that is still a headwind or is it becoming a bit easy and what do you think on the ingredients side of the outlook for 2019? Thank you and I will pass it on. Patricia Little : Alexia, this is Patricia. Clearly we do expect gross margin expansion, pricing will be a piece of this although I do want do remind everyone that a part of it relates to our new packaging that we're bringing on shelves after Easter and that has a cost implication too, so that pricing is really designed to cover the costs of that. So that doesn't - that's not a net drop down to gross margin. In terms of ingredients, we do expect commodity cost to benefit us this year because when we look at the price of the underlying commodities and then the timing that we get from hedging, so that should be a help to us but we do continue to expect inflation on things like packaging which is both core inflation just pure inflation on packaging which we definitely see as well as continuing to build out things like our retail ready packaging in some of those programs, freight is well it's stabilized, if it's not stabilized at a better number stabilized at where it is and then as I mentioned I think earlier today we are starting to see some wage inflation related to low unemployment rates. So you can really tell from that that there are a number of puts and takes but overall we definitely expect modest gross margin improvement. Alexia Howard : Thank you very much. I will pass it on. Operator : We will take our next question from John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. John Baumgartner : Good morning, thanks for the question. Patricia, I wanted to come back to your thoughts on reinvestment, it sounds as though there won't be any real robust uptick in advertising spending in 2019, we haven't really seen trade spending increase for about four or five years now, and I can't recall the last time you heard of any real material uptick in feet on the street sales force presence. So as you think about you know the CMG category sticking below the long-term growth rate. The competition from adjacent categories ratcheting up, how do you think about those buckets of investment, I mean is there any area where you're seeing incremental needs being larger or how do you think about the ROI on those buckets devolving just any clarity there will be helpful? Michele Buck : Hey, John, it's Michele. So I'm going to kick off with some thoughts and Patricia will probably jump in as well. I think. Let me start with advertising. As you think about advertising, while we definitely look at a rate of spend as a percent of net sales, we are also very focused on our delivery of media impressions to the consumer. So if we look at the past year, our consumer impressions or media impressions on our chocolate brands were actually up over 3% for the full-year. So what we're constantly trying to do is optimize how we approach each of these line items to get even more efficient, sometimes we will increase the spending to get impact and other times we will go for efficiency. So, some of the ways we were able to do that we've continued to advance our media capabilities and gotten smarter about how we are targeting some of that media that's driven some of that we've increased the earned impression using that as a lever, which has helped us optimize the portfolio spend. And then also, we created this in-house content studio, which really let us take production costs down, which enables us to put more of that spend into media. So I would say for media, if you think about that, that's a good analogy to how we think about every item every one of our line items. As we look at trade promotion, we mentioned previously that one of our ERP application is a new trade promotion module that we think gives us better insight. Frankly, industry leading insight and that will enable us to get more both more effectiveness, more impact, but also hopefully more efficiency that helps to drive net price realization as well. And so, we are constantly looking at how we build those differentiated capabilities, e-commerce, and other place that we're looking to build those that. As the world has evolved, even though we value very much our retail force in bricks-and-mortar, and we constantly upgrade the skills there. We look at e-commerce as a new channel. And we've certainly invested a lot to build capability in that area, invested in new distribution capacity that we think we're bet we're investing in a balanced way while also trying to optimize within. John Baumgartner : Yes, and I don't - that sounds great. I agree with everything you said. Michele Buck : Great. Thanks for your time. Operator : And we will take our next question from Steve Strycula with UBS. Your line is open. Steve Strycula : Hi, good morning. So just to circle back - circle back on a question that you had touched on a little bit earlier. So I apologize, if there's any redundancy here. But on the SKU rationalization Michele, can you just help us understand and unpack that was the key catalyst when you kind of embarked on this mission, maybe last year, was it more just better intelligence as you kind of looked across the portfolio or maybe you weren't optimizing certain space or is it more focused on some of the smaller brands such as Crave and why not, so that will be the first part my question then I have a follow-up? Michele Buck : Okay. Sure. So the real impetus was complexity that we were starting to see the complexity creating some challenges in gross margin, frankly. And so, it was really about simplification to drive that productivity through reducing merchants - merge units, assortments, some of our innovation et cetera. Steve Strycula : Okay. And then, question for your full-year guidance. Just wanted to understand a little bit more, so we think about the benefit of the longer Easter season being about half of a point for your old sales growth over the full-year, is that pretty fair and then on the input costs assumptions the way you build out your gross margin expectations, have you factor that in based off kind of the current spot rates or you build in a little anticipated inflation just so we can kind of gauge the conservatism? Thank you. Michele Buck : So relative to Easter, yes, about a half a point is how you should think about it. And Patricia, do you want to handle the\u2026 Patricia Little : Yes, on our key commodities because we hedge one of the things that gives us is a lot of good cost visibility. So definitely include in our plan, we have those pretty, since we hedged three - 24 months out, we have good visibility into that. We also, stay in very close touch with the market on things like packaging, freight, wages that allow us to, I think do very good at estimating the impact of those. Steve Strycula : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our final question from Rob Dickerson with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Rob Dickerson : Great. Thank you so much. So Michele I just have a broader question with respect to the - I guess the 22% to 23% margin, operating margin targets you put out two years ago. So I think you know I hear you for 19 gross margin to be up modestly or its sadly some of that's more commodity driven honestly off of restructuring spend or ERP efficiency et cetera. And you said also that on the operating margin side that that sounds like that would be up a little bit more than what we've seen historically but frankly over the past call it three years we haven't seen that much. So I'm just wondering like if we think about what this implied margin, expectation with a need to be for 2020, is that still rational, given what I'm hearing is the increased efficiency, increased velocity probability, a few rationalizations and more targeted spend. But I'm also hearing that maybe there's some need given the competitive environment that if you're more efficient, you might need to reinvest more, which therefore could, maybe increase the probability of accelerated top line growth but not as much margin expansion at the company which might not be a bad thing. So I'm just curious to updated thoughts around kind of the top line growth relative for profitability expression platform. Thanks. Michele Buck : So our target when we set the target it was really set to ensure that we will be in the top core tile amongst our sector and that's really the goal and the intent of that EBIT margin target. We will always take a balanced approach to expanding margins and growing the top line, and we know that sometimes we will shift in one direction versus the other. But we think that balanced approach is critically important. 2018 overall was a pretty tough year for the industry from a margin perspective. But we're confident in our plans to make that progress in 2019 that you referenced both in terms of on the gross margin line and a little bit below. So we think there's always opportunity there and we need to continue to evolve and attack each line item in the P&L to go after margin improvement and will continue to do that going forward. Rob Dickerson : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : And this concludes our Q&A session. I'd like to turn the program back over to our presenters for any additional remarks. Melissa Poole : Thank you for joining us this morning. We will be around today for any follow-up questions you may have. Operator : Thank you for your participation.

My name is Catherine, and I'll be your conference operator today. All participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call is scheduled to end at about 09 :30 AM. So please limit yourself to one question, so we can get to as many of you as possible. Please note that this call may be recorded. Thank you. It would now like to turn the call over to Melissa Poole, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Poole you may begin your conference. Melissa Poole : Thank you, Catherine. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for The Hershey Company's first quarter 2019 earnings conference call and webcast.

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Michele. Michele Buck : Thanks, Melissa, and good morning to all of you on the phone and webcast. Our year has gotten off to a strong start as we remain on track to deliver our financial commitments for the year. I'd like to thank my colleagues across the Hershey business for their focus and hard work. Many of them listen to this call and I'm very proud of what we have accomplished and the progress we are making. Now on to the results. Net sales increased 2.3% in the first quarter in-line with expectations. The net benefit of acquisitions and divestitures was 90 basis points and foreign currency exchange was a 50 basis points headwind. Organic, constant currency net sales growth of approximately 2% was driven by a longer Easter season and international growth, which was partially offset by our SKU rationalization program. We continue to make good progress against our margin improvement plans, which contributed to gross margin expansion of 80 basis points in the quarter versus the same period in 2018. This was slightly ahead of our expectations, driven by incremental efficiencies from our text complexity reduction efforts. These gross margin gains along our solid sales performance drove quality EPS growth of plus 12.8% in the first quarter. This was above expectation driven by the stronger than anticipated gross margin as well as the timing of investments. Our key initiatives for this year are progressing well and we remain confident that our balanced plans will enable us to accelerate our U.S. CMG performance, deliver our acquisition models for amplifying pirate brands and maintain our international business momentum. Net price realization was up slightly in the quarter, in line with expectations. Consistent with previous guidance we anticipate the net benefit of pricing to build over the course of the year, and current retail pricing trends are reflecting this acceleration. Recall our Easter season, which had a meaningful impact on sales in the first quarter, was not priced. Additionally, promotional timing events related to Amplify, Pirate Brands and international resulted in a modest first quarter headwinds. Our U.S. business excluding recent acquisitions delivered net price realization of 50 basis points in the quarter. As we shared earlier this year the later Easter is impacting recent retail performance. Per IRI year-to-date Hershey candy, mint and gum\u2019s retail sales decreased 6% versus overall category declines of 5.4% through April 14. This resulted in a share loss of approximately 20 basis points in-line with our expectations. We expect our retail sales and share performance to improve in the coming weeks as the full Easter season is reported. As is typically the case with a late Easter we do anticipate some softness in May retail sales as consumers enjoy their Easter candy and make slightly fewer everyday purchases. This is accounted for in our guidance as part of the net increments impact from the long season. Preliminary results indicate these strong Easter season for both the category and Hershey. Hershey retail takeaway grew about 15% to 20% resulting in an anticipated seasonal share gain of approximately 150 basis points. This was driven by a strong focus on our core brands, purposeful innovation and exceptional retail execution. Reese and Cadbury are the top two brands in the category during the Easter season with a combined market share of over 25%. This share is greater than the next six brands combined and we had one of the top selling new items of the season with our Cadbury shimmer egg innovation, which contributed even stronger growth and consumer engagement this year. A special thank you to all our employees who helped contribute to the success of this seasons. Another key initiative for us this year is the renovation of our chocolate package candy bags, which has just begun to execute at select retailers. This transformation not only increases branding and competitiveness but also enables us to secure incremental shelf space in store. Early results are encouraging and we will remain focused on this transition in the coming months. Our Reese's Thins innovation is off to a solid start and is generating strong consumer engagement. We are supporting this launch with both paid and earned media as well as merchandising both in-store and online. Current distribution is building and we expect sales to continue to accelerate in the coming weeks. We are also excited about our summer Reese's lovers promotion which shifts primarily in the second quarter. Our activation of this plan in and out instant consumable promotion in late March generated the largest amount of earned impressions ever for one of our announcements. Our nearly $4 billion earned impressions were three times the amount our competition achieved during the same period. This is a tremendous advantage for us that speaks to the power of this brand and our ability to leverage multiple models to effectively and efficiently drive consumer engagement and grow sales.  And this week, after much media speculation, we confirmed that Kit Kat is launching a new product nationwide in December of 2019. Kit Kat Duos Mint + Dark Chocolate is the first permanent Kit Kat flavor in the U.S. in almost a decade. This item will feature a mash-up of two iconic flavors, with mint cream on top and dark chocolate on the bottom surrounding the light and crispy wafer. More to come on this later in the year. And as I've shared before, we're leveraging new media capabilities and models to support our portfolio in more efficient ways. Earned impressions are a key piece of this, along with targeted media and more efficient content production. This is enabling us to support our brands in a more cost-effective manner. In the first quarter of 2019, 12 of our U.S. confection brands that represent approximately 90% of our sales had media support.  Our paid consumer impressions for these brands increased double digits, with only a slight increase in spend. We will continue to leverage this model and support the breadth of the portfolio throughout the remainder of the year. We expect dollar investment to accelerate as we move through the year due to the timing of innovations, the lapping of our media efficiency gains from last year as well as incremental investments supported by our gross margin expansion. Our e-commerce business continues to show strong growth. In the first quarter, our e-commerce net sales grew almost 50%, and our online chocolate share grew 120 basis points at our key customers. We remain focused on winning search and having the right content and portfolio for this channel. Now for an update on our Amplify and Pirate Brands acquisitions. Both are delivering solid growth and are on track to achieve our financial targets. Per IRI, Skinny Pop ready-to-eat popcorn is growing over 11% year-to-date through April 14, resulting in a share gain of over 100 basis points. Our focus on improving distribution and shelf placement is resulting in consistent gains in household penetration. We have a new marketing campaign launching in Q2 to help continue this strong momentum. We successfully transitioned selling responsibilities for Pirate Brands to our Amplify team in the first quarter. We remain focused on leveraging the same capabilities we use for Skinny Pop to optimize distribution and shelf placement to drive growth. Recent retail sales growth has slowed slightly due to distribution losses associated with the transition, but we are confident these trends will improve as we assume whole selling responsibilities. Now for an update on our international business. Constant currency organic sales grew 3.5% in the first quarter. And we continued to demonstrate disciplined investment, resulting in segment operating income growth of 14.5% versus prior year. In India, our Kisses launch is off to a good start and pacing ahead of all key metrics. Both consumer and customer acceptance have been strong, and we remain optimistic that this platform can be expanded to additional regions in the future. Our Kisses brand is also seeing strength in Mexico behind our Seleccion Especial gifting platform. Digital advertising, in-store exhibitions and sampling all helped to recruit new consumers to the brand and drive growth at two times the category level. This is a great example of a differentiated product proposition. This is driving not only a premium price point but at accretive margins. So we have good momentum across all of our key strategies, with strong financial results in the first quarter. We remain committed to delivering balanced growth today while making key investments in our brands and capabilities to take the business to the next level. The organizational changes we announced last week will enable us to continue this good progress. I'm excited that Steve Voskuil will be joining Hershey as Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer next month. Steve is a seasoned executive with a wide variety of experiences, working in CPG both in the U.S. and international markets.

Thank you to Steven Schiller and Patricia for all their contributions to our success over the past several years. And now I'll turn it over to Patricia, who will provide you with details on our financial results. Patricia Little : Thank you, Michele. Good morning, everyone. First quarter net sales of $2.02 billion increased 2.3% versus the same period last year, including a 90 basis point benefit from acquisitions, partially offset by a 50 basis point headwind from foreign currency translation. Volume and net price realization increased by 1.7 points and 0.2 points, respectively. These results are in line with our expectations. Adjusted earnings per share-diluted were $1.59, an increase of 12.8% versus the same period last year. This was driven by volume growth, gross margin expansion as well as marketing and administrative expense efficiencies and shifts. By segment, North America net sales increased 3.2% versus the same period last year. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures was a 1.6 point benefit. This includes one additional month of Amplify versus the prior year period, four months of Pirate Brands sales as we transition financial reporting into Hershey\u2019s system and to fewer months of Tyrrells sales versus the prior year. Volume was a 1.4 point benefit, driven primarily by a longer Easter season. Net price realization was a 0.4 point benefit and foreign currency exchange was a 20 basis point headwind. All of these results were consistent with expectations. North America gross margins expanded 60 basis points driven by favorable commodities, volume and insourcing of key Easter items, which was a discrete benefit of approximately 20 basis points only in the first quarter. Additionally, we benefited from cost savings from our complexity reduction efforts which were slightly ahead of expectations. We continue to expect gross margin expansion to build as we progress through the year as net price realization increases. North America advertising and related consumer marketing spend increased 1.1% in the quarter. Media and production efficiency gains enabled by new capabilities drove double-digit consumer impression growth with only modest dollar spend increases. We expect dollar investment to accelerate as we move through the year due to the timing of innovation as well as the lapping of last year's media efficiency gains. First quarter total International and Other segment net sales decreased 4.9% including headwinds of 4.6 and 3.5 points from divestitures and foreign currency exchange, respectively. Organic constant currency net sales increased 3.5%. Volume increased 4.3 points, offset partially by net negative price realization of 0.8 points. Organic constant currency net sales in our focus markets, Mexico, Brazil, India and China, grew 3% versus the first quarter of 2018. This growth was slightly below 2018 levels driven primarily by inventory volatility in the first quarter of 2018. We expect that year to go organic growth will be comparable to full year 2018 levels. International and Other advertising and related consumer marketing declined 14%, in line with our expectations as we continue to right-size our investments to drive more profitable growth. Total Hershey adjusted gross profit increased 4%, resulting in an adjusted gross margin of 45.7%, an increase of 80 basis points versus the first quarter last year. These gains were driven by favorable commodities, volume, efficiencies from our complexity reduction initiatives as well as margin for growth savings from our international markets. First quarter adjusted operating profit of $171 million resulted in operating profit margin of 23.3%, an increase of 160 basis points versus the first quarter of 2018. Gross margin gains and continued SG&A discipline drove favorable operating profit results. Moving down to P&L. Interest expense of $37 million increased $8 million versus Q1 last year, driven by incremental debt associated with recent acquisitions. Full year 2019 interest expense is expected to be in the $150 million to $160 million range, in line with our previously stated guidance. The adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was 22% versus 24.9% in the year-ago period. These gains were driven by tax reform regulation releases, benefits of employee share-based payments and continued use of investment tax credits versus the first quarter of last year. We continue to expect our full year 2019 tax rate to be approximately 17%. First quarter other expense was $6 million, an increase of $4 million. There is no change to our full year 2019 estimate of approximately $105 million to $115 million. This reflects a higher investment in tax credit as well as additional expense associated with our pension assets due to December's 2018 stock market performance relative to our long-term asset return assumptions. For the first quarter of 2019, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately $210 million. The company repurchased $150 million of common shares in the first quarter. This completes the October 2017 $100 million authorization while $410 million remain on the July 2018 $500 million authorization. We also repurchased $49 million of common shares in connection with the exercise of stock options. Total capital additions including software were $93 million in the first quarter. For the full year 2019, we continue to estimate that CapEx will be in the $330 million to $350 million range. As a percent of net sales, this remains slightly higher than our long-term target as we continue to implement our new ERP system and to invest in core capacity. We continue to return cash to our shareholders, the first quarter dividends of $146 million. This was our 357th consecutive quarterly dividend on the common stock. To summarize for the full year, there's no change to our full year reported net sales outlook. We continue to expect net sales to increase 1% to 3%, including approximately 0.5 point net benefit from acquisitions and divestitures. We expect full year FX impact to be negligible based on current exchange rates. Reported net sales growth is expected to be slightly higher in the second half due to the negative impact of divestitures and FX in the first half. Organic net sales growth is anticipated to be slightly higher in the first half due to the impact of Easter. Full year reported earnings per share diluted are expected to be in the $5.50 to $5.60 range. There's no change to our full year adjusted earnings per share diluted range of $5.63 to $5.74, an increase of 5% to 7% last year. Due to the gaining of sales growth, gross margin gains and the timing of promotions and investments, we anticipate strongest EPS growth in Q1 and Q4. We continue to take a balanced and disciplined approach to building our brands and evolving our business model for the future. We have strong cash flow and a healthy balance sheet that give us flexibility to make the necessary investments to drive long-term shareholder value. That concludes my financial discussion, but before I turn it over to Michele, I just want to say that working with Michele and all of our Hershey colleagues has been an absolute joy. One of the reasons I feel so upbeat at the end of my Hershey time is the confidence I have in this business and in the team to take the company to the next level. I know Steve will be a great partner to Michele and the rest of the team in delivering against our aspirations and making an already great P&L even stronger. Michele Buck : Thanks, Patricia. I am pleased with our strong start to the year. The actions we are taking to drive core confection momentum, to capture growth via incremental portfolios and regions and to invest in our brands and capabilities will continue to drive this business forward. I believe this dynamic environment and accelerated pace of change creates tremendous opportunities for us to engage with our consumers in new and innovative ways to grow today and into the future. We remain focused on achieving balanced sales and earnings growth to continue delivering peer-leading shareholder returns. We have a portfolio of beloved brands and an amazing team of individuals that are excited and proud to come to work every day. We are pleased with the progress we are making but we also have a healthy degree of dissatisfaction that drives us to continue pushing to elevate the business to the next level. And we are committed to doing this in a way that is consistent with our values and purpose. Patricia, Melissa and I are now available to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go ahead and take our first question from Ken Goldman [JPMorgan]. Your line is now open. Ken Goldman : Hi, good morning. Michele Buck : Good morning, Ken. Ken Goldman : Good morning. Thanks for everything, Patricia and best of luck in your next endeavors. Patricia Little : Thank you. Ken Goldman : Two for me. Michele, I think your previous guidance suggested that Easter would benefit annual sales by about 50 basis points, which implies about 200 for the first quarter. I didn't hear a number in your prepared remarks. Maybe I just missed it. But is it reasonable for us to think that Easter helped the first quarter by around 200 basis points on the top line? Michele Buck : Yes. That is reasonable. The growth in the first quarter, definitely driven by Easter and our international business. Ken Goldman : Okay. Thank you for that. And then I know you don't give quarterly guidance, but you did just give some cadence. So I wanted to ask a follow-up to that. I guess, I'll just ask the question directly. The Street in the \u2013 for the second quarter is looking for a bit under $1.8 billion in sales, around $350 million in EBIT or operating income, are these numbers really unreasonable to you given the Easter timing headwind? I just wanted to get a sense of whether the Street is, at least modeling this within sort of the range of what you're thinking. Michele Buck : Patricia, do you want to? Patricia Little : Ken, again we don\u2019t give quarterly guidance, so I would absolutely not comment on specific numbers that the Street does have in their model. We were just trying to give you some help because with Easter, FX and divestitures, we just really want to help you understand the cadence of our sales kind of that is impacting first half, second half and then a little bit about just the rhythm of EPS that we expect. And we don't have anything further to say and certainly no comments on specific numbers that the Street is modeling. Ken Goldman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Bryan Spillane [Bank of America]. Your line is now open. Bryan Spillane : Good morning, everyone. Michele Buck : Good morning. Bryan Spillane : Just wanted to ask \u2013 tie together, I guess, a couple of comments around gross profits and gross margins. And you talked about it maybe building more later in the year, but \u2013 and you also pulled in a little bit of the benefit from insourcing some of the Easter product. So can you give us a sense of, I guess, is like a 60 basis point gross margin expansion as a basis point year-over-year sort of what you would see maybe for the balance of the year or for the full year? Or is this quarter maybe the strongest in terms of gross margin performance? Just trying to get a sense of where gross margins land for the year. Michele Buck : So this is Michele. We feel good about the progress we're making on gross margin and we expect that our full year gross margin expansion will be at or slightly above what we delivered in the first quarter. So as you mentioned, there was the discrete benefit of about 20 basis points, so I think thinking about 60 as kind of the run \u2013 the base run rate is a good way to think about it. Recall that we will get more price realization in the second quarter with our new packaged candy bags. There's also some packaging costs which are limiting the amount of that gross margin, but as we go through the year, we anticipate that, that gross margin will ramp up a bit off of the run rate that you mentioned. Is that helpful? Bryan Spillane : Yes, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Robert Moskow [Credit Suisse]. Your line is now open. Robert Moskow : That Bryan Spillane is a smart guy. He took my question, but let me try a different one. Can you talk about the market share losses in the first quarter, which was just 20 basis points? And I guess I thought I heard you say that you picked it up in the early phases of Easter, I guess, related to your Easter seasonal activity. Can you talk a little bit more broadly about just candy, mint and gum in general; your innovation plans? Is that enough to get you back into a pattern of share gains overall for the year or for next year? I think most people's perceptions of the innovation pipeline is it's okay, not super; and a lot of concerns about competitive incursion from Mars and Ferrero. Thanks. Michele Buck : Sure. So Rob, our year-to-date share is in line with our expectations. We expected a little bit of a slower start on share due to the timing of some of our innovation and our promotions, but we continue, as you look at the trend that you're seeing in share, with a continuous kind of improvement in trend as we go through the first quarter here. You're going to see that continue. As we get through Easter, we think that you'll see the retail takeaway. The share and the sales kind of true up and line up together. And then obviously, following that, we have some of our biggest programs for the year, including the chocolate-packaged candy reinvention as well as Reese's Thins and the Reese's lovers activations. So we've got a pretty balanced plan with a lot of activation, but from a retail takeaway perspective, more of that begins to hit Q2 and beyond for the year. And we're continuing to drive a balanced approach to driving our business. We feel great about the innovation we have this year with the chocolate-packaged candy packaging effort, which is about $0.5 billion in the portfolio; Reese's Thins and Reese's lovers promotion, our largest brands by far; and then obviously just announcing a new item within Kit Kat, one of our other core brands. So we believe we do best when we have a really balanced approach where we are winning on multiple levers which include seasons, pricing, innovation, good marketing on the core. And we're going to continue to drive that. And we anticipate that, as much as there is a lot of competitive innovation, we think that overall it'll be in line in total with prior years. Robert Moskow : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Jonathan Feeney [Consumer Edge]. Your line is now open. Jonathan Feeney : Thank you so much and good morning. Two questions from me. The Easter share you quoted earlier, I think, was 150 basis points. Is that Easter share on a through April 14 basis? Or is that what you know about the totality of Easter this year versus the totality of Easter last year, about how you're comparing with some non-Easter weeks in that number, that share number, first of all? And second of all, yes, I know that there's been a lot going on from a takeaway standpoint. What \u2013 I mean what level \u2013 you gave us a year-to-date takeaway number, and clearly, you're way outperforming that. In the six days approaching through that, it's not in that takeaway number. What's a good U.S. CMG takeaway number mid-May that would give us the sense that you are on track towards your plan? Like what is that number so I understand that you guys are on track to \u2013 for the next months? Thank you very much. Michele Buck : So let me start with your question around Easter. The share gain that I quoted is what we anticipate for the full season based on what we know year-to-date and across the business. And that is really looking full Easter this year versus full Easter last year. Relative to takeaway, somewhere in that 1.5% to 2% range on a year-to-date basis, I'd say, will be a good benchmark. Jonathan Feeney : Thank you very much. Operator : We will take our next question from Steven Strycula [UBS]. Your line is now open. Steven Strycula : Good morning and congrats on a good quarter. Michele Buck : Thank you. Steven Strycula : So this Easter shift is really breaking my calculator here. I'm trying to figure a few things out, but Patricia, I was hoping you'd help me out here a little bit as I think about the organic [Audio Dip] think about how that flows through the year directionally is the first part of my question. Patricia Little : Steve, you broke up a little bit. I'm sorry. You were just asking about what the organic sales were at Easter in the quarter. Steven Strycula : Yes, just what the cadence we should think about throughout the balance of the year. I think it's a little bit noisy because of Easter. And a lot of investors have been asking me this morning just how to think about front half versus back half in 2Q. And then I've got a follow up. Patricia Little : Yes. So as we said, we expect that, because of that Easter, we will \u2013 we would expect that on an organic basis it will be higher in the first half than into the second half, just because of the long Easter. Is that what you were getting at? I mean there were again\u2026 Steven Strycula : Thank you for that. Patricia Little : Okay. Yes. Think about it as the organic growth was about 2% in the quarter. I mean we had\u2026 Steven Strycula : Sure, yes. I think there's some background noise, but so the other fundamental question I had was \u2013 to piggyback off of Rob Moskow's question, is to think about the incrementality of innovation this year relative to prior cycles that you guys have had. How do you think about what you're bringing to market; and how that compares against Cookie Layer Crunch, Hershey's Gold? And what's so different about the packaging this year that it should drive better conversion at retail relative to the past? Thank you. Michele Buck : Yes. So I feel really good about our innovation this year. And I will say, if I look historically, I think frequently the best and more sustainable innovation we've had is when we are really focused on either improving our core or staying close to the core with a key, purposeful benefit. So when I think about the chocolate-packaged candy, it gives us a notable improvement in shelf awareness in a category that is a very challenged category to shop. So I think the first benefit starts with that, and then second in terms of the usability of the package at home. So it's really a lift across a very big piece of business that is a very closed-end product improvement benefit. And I think that tends to \u2013 those types of things tend to perform very well for us. Reese's Thins, likewise, it is a variation of a Reese's cup with a new shape. And as we think about our portfolio, one of the interesting things about Reese's is we have all different kinds of cups and different shapes and different ratios of chocolate to peanut butter, and everybody has their favorite. And thins offers a benefit of permissibility and a totally different eating experience on our biggest core brand. So that proximity to the core tends to lead to a more sustainable approach. So where we find some of those innovations, I feel \u2013 I tend to feel the best about those. So I'm pretty bullish on what we have for this year. Steven Strycula : Okay thanks. Operator : We will take our next question from David Driscoll. Your line is now open. David Driscoll : Great, thank you and good morning everybody. Michele Buck : Good morning, David. David Driscoll : Patricia, I just wanted to say thank you so much. It's been a pleasure to work with you, and we wish you all the best. On to the \u2013 I want to follow up on some of the questions related to the top line. So just to be super clear : With CMG takeaway down 6% in the Q1, shipment is up 1.6%, excluding M&A. Volume is a big driver there at 1.4 points. Is there any implication to the second quarter? Is there any shipment pull forward into Q1 that would affect Q2 because of those numbers? Michele Buck : David, there's not. If you think about the way Easter and the seasons work, especially given the timing this year, you're shipping to season in the quarter before a lot of the takeaway occurs. So there's a little bit of a \u2013 the disconnect between the shipments and the takeaway, but there is no pull forward. It's just the natural flow of how that business works that you're shipping. And then some of the biggest takeaway for the season comes in the couple weeks, those two weeks right before the day of the holiday. And so that's really the dynamic. And if you look at past years, you'll see that \u2013 every year, that's the way it works. Patricia Little : So again, David, you can just expect that, by the end of April, the share, the takeaway and the sales will all be trued up together. David Driscoll : Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. My last question is just on pricing. You have expectations that pricing is going to increase as the quarters go forward. Has retail acceptance of your pricing plans been \u2013 if it did happen to the fullest extent? Do you have any concerns about the implementation on pricing, whether it's the list price increase or whether it's getting your new packaging on shelf? Because everything on the pricing plan kind of full steam ahead. Michele Buck : Yes, everything relative to the pricing is working and coming in exactly as we expected. The retail price points that we're seeing, in terms of the phasing for the year \u2013 remember Easter wasn't priced. So that's a big piece that, as we get later through the year, is really where the pricing impact kicks in. We've looked at price points, retail price points; where we are in our elasticity and conversion model. And that's in line with what we expected as well, so all looking good. DavidDriscoll: Thank you so much. I\u2019ll pass it along. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Baumgartner. Your line is now open. John Baumgartner : Good morning. Thanks for the question. Michele, it sounds as though the momentum around the media impressions is fairly solid, but I guess my question is really more about the conversion on those because, I mean, you've been working through the efficiencies for a while, but the share in chocolate is still down pretty consistently. And I know your brands are always very responsive to traditional media, but maybe digital is showing as less impactful. So I mean, are you seeing any data points that would suggest otherwise? I mean I'm just trying to square the media shift with the market share we see in the Nielsen data. Michele Buck : We continue to optimize the right balance across earned and paid impressions; and also, within the paid, what is the optimal level of TV versus digital and getting tighter and tighter on the digital relative to addressable and programmable media that allows us to reach the exact right person. So I feel good about the progress we're making there. We continue to optimize and implement as we learn and go along the way, but we feel good that we are continuing to see strong ROIs on the spends that we have and continuing to optimize based on those. John Baumgartner : And do you have a sense kind of where digital is right now as a percent of the total bucket and where, I guess, the long-term target is? Michele Buck : So I want to say digital is about 40% of our total media investment. And in terms of the long-term target, I would say we continue to learn as we go, but at this point in time we believe that mainstream media, given our very broad household penetration, will continue to be an important part of our mix given it's pretty efficient media. And within digital and some of the capabilities of old in terms of more capability about \u2013 around programmable, we'll continue to adjust to that, but there's a lot of blurring of the lines in terms of playing across the entire John Baumgartner : Okay, thanks Michele. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Rob Dickerson. Your line is now open. Rob Dickerson : Great, thank you. Two quick questions. First question was just on kind of organic sales cadence again for the year. I think you just said in the remarks that you\u2019d expect basically organic sales to be a little bit faster in growth terms in the first half versus second half. It sounds like second half rate would get more of the pricing but less than a mix effect from the new innovation or at least the stand-up bags and the thins, so I\u2019m just curious. If there is to be more pricing in the back half of the year, our organic sales will be slower, I\u2019m assuming, kind of back of Easter. I \u2013 are \u2013 does that imply that your models are baking in some material volume elasticity in Q3 and Q4? Or is it more just an Easter effect in Q1 versus what you expect in the back half? Michele Buck : No. Our models do bake in that elasticity in the second half. When we take a price increase, that\u2019s historically how it works. And the data we have based on history is exactly what we are banking on. It\u2019s also what we\u2019re seeing year-to-date where prices have hit, but you\u2019re absolutely right. In the year we take pricing, you see a big increase in the amount of our revenue that comes from pricing and you take a hit on volume as the conversion of that builds. Rob Dickerson : Okay. Great. And then just in terms of margin, I think you said you\u2019d expect gross margin to build just given partially the pricing benefit as you move through the year. Operating margin was up almost 150 basis points in Q1. Should we also expect the operating margin to build throughout the year? Or I\u2019m assuming, given higher SM&A and brand investment, that operating margin would likely be expanding but at a slower rate relative to gross margin for the remainder of the year. That\u2019s all. Michele Buck : Yes. I would say no. That should not be your expectations. There can be a lot of noise on a quarterly basis. And no. Well, there should be a build in gross margin. Do not think about operating margin that way. Rob Dickerson : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Ken Zaslow. Your line is now open. Ken Zaslow : Hi, good morning everyone. Just have a question on clarity. I think I\u2019m just confused. I think you said in the quarter that your expectation's where you thought it was on both sales and EPS. And then in the last quarter, you said that your sales accelerate through the second half. Now I think you \u2013 and your sales growth obviously was 2.3%. Your guidance is 1% to 3%. But now you are saying that the first and fourth quarter are going to be the highest. What changed? Did nothing changed? And I just don't understand. I'm sorry. Michele Buck : So relative to sales, we said our sales was in line with our expectations Ken Zaslow : It was fourth quarter. It's supposed to build through the year, right? Patricia Little : So it might be the confusion between our reported net sales growth, where it's going to be higher in the second half due to divestitures which we talked about. And then the organic piece is higher in the first half due to Easter. And on the EPS side, we did say that \u2013 all right. And then on the EPS, it was higher than we expected, as we said on this call. Michele Buck : Q1 was higher than expected. Ken Zaslow : And my real question is can you talk about your e-commerce progress? What share do you want to get to? Where are you? How far are you away from what share you're looking to get and get to? And then what is the difference between your digital spending three, four years ago and now? And where do you expect that to get? And I'll leave it there. Michele Buck : So, I think we want to continue to drive share and gain share in e-commerce. I think the benchmark that we would look at is we would want to be at least comparable to our bricks-and-mortar business, but I would say that I also think there's an opportunity with our capabilities for us to have higher share than bricks and mortars. So that's certainly what we are shooting for. And we're pleased that, in each of the past several years, we've continued to gain over 100 basis points of share on our chocolate business in e- commerce. So we want to capture as much share as we can. Ken Zaslow : And in your spending. What percentage of your spending is on digital? And where do you expect that to go? And I'll leave it there. Michele Buck : Well, for total digital advertising, from a media perspective, it's about 40%, if we just look at media. Obviously, there are a lot of other investments in terms of resources, people, all of that. Ken Zaslow : Thank you. Operator : There are questions at this time. I will turn the call back to our speakers for any additional remarks. Melissa Poole : Thank you for joining us this morning. We'll be available throughout the day for any additional questions you may have. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

My name is Catherine, and I'll be your conference operator today. All participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call is scheduled to end at about 09 :30 a.m. So, please limit yourself to one question, so we can get to as many of you as possible. Please note, this call may be recorded. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Melissa Poole, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Poole, you may begin your conference. Melissa Poole : Thank you, Catherine. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for The Hershey Company second quarter 2019 earnings conference call and webcast. Michele Buck, President and CEO; and Steve Voskuil, Senior Vice President and CFO, will provide you with an overview of our results, followed by a Q&A session. Before we begin, please remember that during the course of this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meanings of the Federal Securities Laws. These statements are based on our current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could differ materially from actual events and those described in these forward-looking statements contained in our 2018 10-K filed with the SEC and today's press release. Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe will provide useful information for investors. The presentation of this information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to today's press release for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Michele. Michele Buck : Thanks, Melissa, and good morning to all of you on the phone and webcast. First, I'd like to start by giving a special welcome to Steve. He joined the Company following our last call, and he's been a great addition to the executive leadership team. Some of you have already had the chance to meet Steve, and he and I look forward to visiting with more of you in the coming months. Now on to business. We are pleased with our second quarter results and the momentum we are seeing behind our key initiatives for this year. Our balanced plans and capability investments are enabling us to deliver accelerated sales growth and differentiated earnings performance. We are maintaining our market share leadership in our profitable U.S. confection business, and driving incremental profitable sales with our snacking and international portfolios, both of which continue to perform well. These have been and continue to be the strategic priorities of our business. And I'd like to take a minute to thank my colleagues across the business for their contribution to the strong quarter. As we look to the back half of the year, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our financial commitments for the year. In the second quarter, net sales increased 0.9%, in line with our expectations. Organic constant currency net sales growth of approximately 1.8% was driven by pricing and the launch of key innovation, including Reese's Thins and Reese's Lovers, as well as our new packaged candy bags. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures was a 60 basis-point headwind as the Tyrrells and Shanghai Golden Monkey divestitures offset our Pirate Brands acquisition. The majority of the impact of these divestitures has been realized, and we expect the net impact of M&A to be a benefit for the remainder of the year. Foreign currency exchange was a 30 basis-point headwind in the second quarter. We had another strong quarter of gross margin expansion, which enabled brands and capability investments as well as robust earnings growth. While some of our second quarter margin and earnings gains were training related, the underlying trends remained solid. This strong gross margin expansion of almost 200 basis points drove second quarter adjusted EPS growth of 14.9%. Steve will share more details around second quarter gross margin performance as well as our expectations for the rest of the year. As we've previously discussed, price realization is a strategic focus area for us. The price increase we announced last summer remains on track, and the final portion is implementing now as we execute our Halloween program. Additionally, last week, we announced a new price increase on our confection instant consumables business. These products represent roughly one-third of our overall sales, and they were priced high-single-digits, contributing to an estimated two points of pricing to our overall portfolio. Consistent with previous practices, we will have a transition period for our retailers to adjust to these new prices, and we do not expect a material, sales or earnings impact in 2019 from this pricing action. We anticipate category retail prices for these impulse items to begin to increase in the second half of the year. These actions reinforce our commitment to a more agile approach to pricing strategy that protects our advantaged margin structure while enabling continued investments in our brands and capabilities to drive category growth. Other key initiatives on our U.S. confection business are also progressing well and on track. Retail takeaway was slightly ahead of our expectations coming out of Easter, due to accelerated activation of our Reese's Lovers in and out promotion. For IRI, Hershey candy, mint and gum retail sales, increased 1.9% versus prior year, since the Easter season ended. This was in line with overall category growth of 1.9%, resulting in flat shift. This growth was led by our powerful Reese's franchise, which grew 12% during the time period behind our new packaged candy bags, our Reese's Thins innovation, and or Reese's Lovers instant consumable promotion. Our new packaged candy bags are on shelf at all major retailers. And we are pleased with the increased branding and improved shopability that we are seeing to-date. We are also excited by the response we are seeing from increased media on some of our smaller iconic brands. These profitable brands are a tremendous asset for us that deliver unique consumer proposition, and incrementality to our portfolio. We are leveraging our new media capabilities, both for content, as well as targeting, and increased investment to drive growth on many of these brands. Over the past year and a half, we've increased support on our Almond Joy, Mounds, York, Payday and Twizzlers brands. Our strong gross margin performance has enabled us to support additional brands, Heath and Rolo, in the second quarter. Early results are encouraging with our Heath brand growing 37% and our Rolo brand growing over 7% over the last four weeks. While not all of this growth is incremental, having more brands in our portfolio, staying relevant with our consumers and growing is critical to our overall category leadership. Our e-commerce business continues to perform well, with second quarter net sales growth of over 60%. Customer-specific data, as well as industry reports indicate that our growth is consistently outpacing competition by 10 to 15 basis points in 2019. As we look to the second half of 2019, we expect to build on last year\u2019s seasonal success with solid performance in Halloween and holiday. Additional Kit Kat capacity is further enhancing our assortment bags for Halloween and enabling our Kit Kat Mint Duos innovation that was launched towards the end of the year. Now for an update on our Amplify and Pirate Brands acquisitions. Per IRI, SkinnyPop ready-to-eat popcorn grew approximately 10% in the second quarter, resulting in a share gain of over 100 basis points. We continue to focus on expanding distribution and optimizing our shelf placement, which is leading to consistent gain in household penetration. As we discussed on our April call, Pirate\u2019s Booty sales performance has declined recently due to distribution losses at a few key retailers and the lapping of some significant promotional activity from prior year. The distribution of losses occurred during the sales transition, but we remain confident that trends will improve in the second half as planograms reset and year-over-year promotional activity normalizes. Retail sales trends for the latest four weeks are already improving versus the last 12 weeks, and expect that that will continue to improve. Now, for an update on our international business. Constant currency organic sales grew 8.3% in the second quarter. And we continue to demonstrate disciplined investment, resulting in segment operating income growth of 32% versus prior year. In Mexico, we grew our net sales high-single-digits in the second quarter, behind continued strength in our core chocolate business, and the launch of a new Pelon Pelo Rico flavor. In Canada, our Reese's brand eclipsed Kit Kat and is now the number one brand. Our Reese's brand is also seeing great momentum in the UK, recently receiving the Gold IPM award for best new product launch for Easter Reese's Creme Egg. We will continue to focus on our core brand equities to drive profitable sales growth in the second half and beyond. To wrap up, we have good momentum across all of our key strategies, with strong financial results in the second quarter. We will continue to invest in our brands and our capabilities to take this business to the next level and drive sustainable top and bottom line growth. I'll now turn it over to Steve who will provide you with details on our financial results. Steve Voskuil : Thank you, Michele. Good morning, everyone. Before I get started, I'd like to take a few minutes to say how excited I am to be part of the Hershey team. Hershey is a great company with strong brands, leading marketing positions and a balanced approach to profitable growth. I've been energized by the talented team here and their passion for innovation, growth and transformation. I look forward to partnering with Michele, our Board and the whole team to achieve our strategic vision, and deliver strong and sustainable shareholder return. Now, on to the financial results. Second quarter net sales of $1.8 billion increased 0.9% versus the same period last year. Organic constant currency net sales growth of 1.8% was driven by net price realization of 1.2 points and volume growth of 60 basis points. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures was a 60 basis-point headwind and foreign currency translation was a 30 basis-point headwinds. These results were all in line with expectations. Adjusted earnings per share-diluted were $1.31, an increase of 14.9% versus the same period last year. This was driven primarily by gross margin expansion, and was ahead of expectation, driven by two key factors related to the price increase we announced last week. First, a few select customers increased inventory on our most profitable items in anticipation of a price increase, while total retail inventory levels were not up significantly from prior year. We benefited from positive mix for the quarter. Second, we increased internal inventory levels to support more demand from our retailers in the coming weeks as we transitioned to the new prices, which resulted in favorable fixed cost absorption. About 90 basis points of our gross margin expansion in the second quarter can be attributed to these two factors, and is expected to be offset in the second half, primarily Q3 as the internal and external inventory levels normalize. We are pleased with underlying momentum against our margin expansion initiatives, the business reinvestment it is enabling and the balanced top and bottom-line growth it is driving. By segment, North America net sales increased 0.5% versus the same period last year, driven by pricing, which contributed 1.5 points of growth in the quarter. Volume was a 50 basis-point headwind, the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures was a 30 basis-point headwind, and foreign currency exchange rates or 20 basis-point headwind. These results were in line with expectations. North America gross margins expanded 180 basis points in the second quarter. As I mentioned, about half of this was driven by favorable product mix and fixed cost absorption related to the price increase we announced last week and is expected to reverse in the second half, primarily Q3. The remaining 90 basis-point expansion was consistent with expectations and was driven by favorable commodities, price realization from our July 2018 price increase, and improved ways as we continue to execute our SKU rationalization program. These factors are expected to continue contributing to solid underlying gross margin expansion in the second half, though will be partially offset by the reversal of Q2 gains from product mix and fixed cost absorption, as well as some additional supply chain costs associated with fully integrating Pirate Brands into our operations. North America advertising and related consumer marketing expenses increased 2.7% in the quarter, driven primarily by advertising. We expect dollar investment to continue to accelerate as we move through the year due to the lapping of last year's media efficiency gains and increased investment in our confection brands. Second quarter total International and Other segment\u2019s net increased 3.9%, driven by volume gains of 960 basis points. This was partially offset by a 320 basis-point headwind from divestitures, a 130 basis-point headwind from net price realization and a 120 basis-point foreign currency exchange headwind. Organic constant currency net sales in our focus markets, Mexico, Brazil, India and China, grew 5% versus the second quarter of 2018. International and Other advertising and related consumer marketing increased 38% versus prior year. Most of this increase is driven by increased investment to support Ramadan in EMEA, our India Kisses launch and timing of consumer marketing spending. Total Hershey adjusted gross profit increased 5.3%, resulting in an adjusted gross margin of 46.5%, an increase of 200 basis points versus the second quarter of 2018. As mentioned, approximately half of this expansion was driven by favorable product mix and fixed cost absorption that are expected to reverse in the second half. The remainder was driven by favorable commodities, price realization from our July 2018 price increase, and efficiencies from our SKU rationalization initiatives. Given the progress we have made year-to-date and our visibility into the second half, we now expect full year gross margin to increase approximately 100 basis points. Second quarter adjusted operating profit of $370 million resulted in operating profit margin of 20.9%, an increase of 150 basis points versus the second quarter of 2018. Gross margin gains and continued SG&A discipline were partially offset by incremental advertising on our confection brands. Moving down the P&L, interest expense of $34 million decrease $1 million versus Q2 last year. Full year 2019 interest expense is now expected to be in the $140 million to $145 million range due to lower interest rate. The adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was 14.8% versus 16% in the year ago period. These declines were driven primarily by valuation allowance releases, and access tax benefits from stock-based compensation, partially offset by fewer tax credit investments. Second quarter other expense was $13 million, a decrease of $8 million versus prior year due to fewer tax credit investments. We now expect our full year 2019 tax rate to be approximately 18% versus our previous estimate of 17%. However, we also expect our full-year other expense to decline to $80 million to $90 million as we expect fewer tax credit investments. The net impact to the full year of these two changes is expected to be negligible versus our previous estimate. For the second quarter of 2019, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 211 million. This is a slight increase versus the first quarter due to an increased number of stock option exercises in the quarter. The Company did not repurchase any shares in the second quarter against our July 2018, $500 million authorization and $410 million remaining. The Company repurchased $56 million of common shares in the second quarter in connection with the exercise of stock options. Total capital additions, including software were $176 million in the second quarter. For the full year 2019, we estimate cap adds to be towards the high-end of our $330 million to $350 million range. As a percent of net sales, this remains slightly higher than our long-term target, as we continue to implement our new ERP systems and invest in core capacity. We continued to return cash to our shareholders with second quarter dividends of $149 million. This was our 358th consecutive quarterly dividend on the common stock. Additionally, this morning, we announced a 7% dividend increase, a testament to our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow generation. To summarize, for the full year, we expect full year reported net sales to grow around 2%, the midpoint of our previously communicated range. We continue to anticipate approximately a 0.5-point net benefit from acquisitions and divestitures and the full year FX impact to be negligible, based on foreign exchange rates. Full year reported earnings per share-diluted are expected to be around $5.58, comparable to prior year. We expect full year adjusted earnings per share diluted growth of around 6% to 7%, the top half of our previous range. As we look to the second half, we want to highlight a few areas where we expect trends to vary versus the first half. Underlying gross margin is expected to continue to build as pricing builds. However, recall we expect approximately half of the Q2 expansion to reverse in the second half, primarily Q3. Advertising and related consumer marketing expense is expected to grow more in the second half than the first half as we lap media efficiencies from last year, as well as increase support on our core confection brands. Given current sales and EPS guidance, compensation is anticipated to be a headwind in the second half of 2019 versus the second half of 2018. Due to the timing of tax strategies, we expect the second half net tax impact to be unfavorable versus prior year. For the full year, we continue to expect a slight benefit to EPS, from tax. That concludes my financial discussions. And I'll now turn it back to Michele. Michele Buck : Thanks, Steve. We had a strong start to the year. The actions we are taking to drive core confection momentum, to capture growth via incremental portfolios and regions, and to invest in our brands and capabilities will continue to drive this business forward. We have a portfolio of beloved brands and amazing team of individuals that are excited and proud to come to work every day. And we remain focused on achieving balanced sales and earnings growth to continue delivering peer leading shareholder returns. Steve, Melissa and I are now available to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please go ahead. Andrew Lazar : Good morning, everybody, and welcome, Steve. As you noted, consumption in North America was a bit above shipments, organic growth. And I assume some of that was certain things like SKU rationalization and such. But, I guess, with SKU rationalization, I think, expected to moderate some in the second half and pricing expected to build and certainly a greater level of innovation that will hit as well, given some of the, I guess, understatement, if you will in 2Q relative to takeaway, I guess, why wouldn't organic sales in North America, not necessarily keep, let's say a similar level of momentum, as we've seen more recently? And then, just, I may have missed it, but the incremental pricing that you've announced, is that all list pricing or similar to last year's pricing, where it was a mix of all the various revenue management levers? Thank you. Michele Buck : Thanks, Andrew, it's Michele. Hey. So, let me get your first one -- your second part of your question first. The incremental pricing is indeed all list pricing. So, that's a pretty simple one. As we look in our consumption and our sales, let me start with, as we told you in the past, on a full year basis, we always expect our net sales and our takeaway to be relatively in line. But we continue as we have in the past, again this year, to have some volatility from a quarter-to-quarter basis. I guess, the easiest way that I would advise you to think about it is, if you look at our takeaway trends, first half second half and you see that basically on our CMG business, we were up first half about 2.6%. So, we all know that about 1 point of that was driven by Easter. If you take the first half minus the Easter bump, we expect that same underlying trend to continue in the back part of the year. So, we think we're going to have -- continue to have pretty solid takeaway on a full year basis. There are several puts and takes as you look at the net sales piece relative to a little bit less SKU ramp in the second half, but at the same time, we are -- have a bit of a harder ramp as we lapped some of those seasons, and as you recall how strong seasons were in the back half of the year last year, some inventory related things in the second quarter, but by full year ends, we think it'll level out as it has in the past. Operator : We'll now go to Ken Goldman with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Ken Goldman : Hi. Good morning. You said you don't expect a material sales impact from the new pricing action this year. But, I think, I also heard you say that category retail -- retail prices for these impulse items will increase in the second half of the year. So, I wanted to reconcile this a little bit, if I could. Are your customers taking up their pricing before you are? If so, why are you protecting your pricing? I just wanted to clarify when you expect wholesale and retail net prices to rise, and if there is any synchronicity with each other? Michele Buck : So, we do expect that we will see some impact at retail on the everyday business, particularly in the fourth quarter. But, as you know, as you look at the back half of our year, we are heavily weighted towards seasons. So, seasons is a much bigger piece of the portfolio than the everyday piece. So, we expect we\u2019ll see some there. But, we also do some price promotion protecting. So, many of our retailers have price promotions, trade promotions that they have booked that we've committed to six months out, sometimes slightly more. And we do price protect those promotions, when we go out with our pricing action. So, that's why you don't see the full impact. Again, we believe the impact will not be material to us. Ken Goldman : But, will the increased retail prices -- and maybe you're saying that there really won't be because they\u2019ll be built back. So, I just want to understand, will that potentially lead to a situation where you're not getting the pricing yet, but retail prices are going up and therefore your volume could get hurt because of some elasticity trends? Again, I just want to make sure I'm understanding all the puts and takes here from a net pricing perspective? Michele Buck : There's a little bit of impact there, but it's minimal and all the pricing is baked into the guidance. Ken Goldman : Okay. I'll let it go. Thanks so much. Operator : And we\u2019ll now go to David Driscoll with Citi. Please go ahead. David Driscoll : Thank you. And good morning, and welcome Steve. So, nice to have you on the call, nice quarter to join the Company. Can you talk a little bit about the pricing and the impact on the king size bars. I think, as we understand it, the king size bars will break the $2 price point, the over $2 and this may cause some down trading. So, just kind of building on Ken's question, just trying to understand the impact of the price increase here and how it affects the loose bar portfolio. Is this something where -- can you just walk us through these impacts, as I find it kind of complicated? King size was always such an important component of your loose bar business, so profitable. So, if it forces some down trading to the standard bar, walk me through the impact on how you see the price increase playing through on this issue? Michele Buck : So, David, we have pretty sophisticated price elasticity modeling that we do. Whenever we take any price action, including this one, that model takes a look at the impact of crossing key price thresholds, it also takes a look at the relationship between regular counts, the single bar and the king size because there's an impact there. It looks that other competitive items in the marketplace and any impacts there. So, all of that is taken into account as we do those elasticity models that help us to predict the conversion curve. And then, we also take a look at that. And in some cases, if there's an area where we think we need it, part of our total pricing action could include some level of reinvestment in trade on specific areas to either maintain the current price point. We certainly also reinvest in advertising, because we know back from the past, if we take pricing and at the same time reinvest that that also helps to accelerate the conversion curve. So, we believe all that is taken into account as we do the analysis. And you are right that on some of those businesses, some of those -- you do hit some of those issues, but we think that's fully taken into account in our plans for the marketplace. David Driscoll : One quick follow-up on your comments on Reese's. We also understand that the Reese's Lovers promotion was very successful. But ironically, the criticism that I heard was that it was such a good product, people were disappointed -- the retailers were disappointed, they couldn't reorder it. Can you give us some thoughts as to what you do with something like this that\u2019s gone this well? Is there any thoughts in making any part of that promotion and everyday part of the lineup, or do you just repeat the promotion sometime in the future? How do you think about that? Michele Buck : So, David, it's certainly a great problem to have. And we will evaluate all of those things. Interestingly, there is sometimes a good thing to have something consumers love and they look forward to seeing it return to the marketplace. And I think frequently, we found that that's a really good strategy to employ. It was a great in and out promotion. And we could do it again in the future. So, we'll be evaluating those options -- all options to determine whether something like that should become permanent or we just leverage it to keep news and excitement, which is key in this category. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jason English : I guess, I want to come back to the price increases as well and focus a little bit more on what's different this time. Looking back at some of the pricing cycles, particularly on single-serve, arguably, they were all cost justified? And we don\u2019t certainly see kind of what the cost justification is for this magnitude of pricing in single-serve. So, question number one is, are we missing some sort of cost pressure out there that necessitates this price? And if not, without the cost pressure, how might this be different? Do you expect to have to deal back more to reinvest more to keep retailers happy, or do you expect the relationship with retailers to be very similar to what we see in the past cycles? Michele Buck : As we shared, we\u2019ve evolved our pricing approach from one in the past that was very much -- much more cost and commodity driven to much more of a strategic pricing capability, where we think strategically across the portfolio at where we have opportunity, on an ongoing basis more than versus that kind of episodic approach. But we approach it in much the same way as we have in the past in terms of how it gets impacted and executed through retail. And I wouldn't anticipate that we would see any type of different scenario versus other times when we price instant consumables in the marketplace. We haven\u2019t priced that part of the portfolio for probably more than five years. And we expect to see similar results based on what we've seen in our elasticity models. Jason English : And looking back to the 2014 hike or even the 2011, the buy-in period -- the protection period was eight weeks in duration for both of those cycles, and it effectively caused the deferral of the P&L flow through benefit by one quarter. So, you announced in July last time, by the fourth quarter, we actually saw material flow through of price benefit. You're suggesting, this time will be different. It seems the entire thing is kind of consistent. So, what's the disconnect there? Why shouldn't we be expecting a more material benefit coming in the fourth quarter? Michele Buck : I mean, we expect that we will see some impact in Q4, but we don't do view impact to be material. And I think some of that will be associated with what -- some of that varies on how much we see relative to what kind of inventory position people are carrying and how that kind of flows through. Melissa Poole : Jason, it's Melissa. I mean, I think, the one piece that we had talked through that was a little different than the last time is we did have retailers kind of building inventory on these packs, before we announced. So, there is a little bit more inventory in the marketplace at those old prices. So, it\u2019ll take a little bit longer to cycle through that just because the speculation was out there in advanced. So, that is a little different from the last time. Operator : We'll now go to Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Bryan Spillane : Hey. Good morning, everyone. So, just I guess a question, first, just about Reese\u2019s Thins. It's been in the market now for I guess almost two months. And so, any sort of takeaways in terms of how that's performing in the market, better or worse than expectations and how you're thinking about that for the balance of the year? Michele Buck : So Reese's Thins is performing well. It is exactly in line with our expectations. We are feeling good about not only the trial, but also the repeat, which is strong and building. And we believe that based on what we're seeing to-date, it will be a sustainable item for us, and that we may be able to extend further off that platform. Bryan Spillane : So, I guess, following up on that, just in terms of extending off of that platform, is that possible to go with Thins across some other brands, maybe as we look into next year? Michele Buck : Yes. While we don't want to make any firm commitments on our future innovation plans, I think, we clearly look at a platform -- an idea like that is something that really can be a platform that can be expanded. And if you look at how we've run platforms in the past, many times it is a basic idea that we take across brands and just allows us to get scale for merchandising, et cetera. Operator : Our next question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Your line is open. Alexia Howard : Can I ask about -- you made a couple of comments about the popcorn brand earlier. I'm curious about the pricing on the SkinnyPop line, it seems to have come down fairly sharply in the last, I guess, three quarters or so. The rest of the category doesn\u2019t seem to have followed. I'm wondering, if -- what the competitive dynamic were, what the thinking behind that was, and whether you anticipate needing to continue with that -- those kind of pricing strategies going forward? Thank you. Michele Buck : So, one of the things we love about SkinnyPop and believe is a key part of the business prop is the premium pricing that we have on that brand. We are delighted that we're continuing to see really strong growth, overall strong retail growth in the double-digit range, which -- to us, which suggests that the price volume piece is working. Though this is a brand where given the channel dynamics, we can see bigger swings on promotional pricing impact in the marketplace, just given how that product skews by class of trade. For example, there's a bigger clubbed [ph] business on SkinnyPop than we're used to seeing on the rest of our portfolio. And that can drive bigger swings there. So, I wouldn't be concerned about it relative to -- that we are looking to change the pricing strategy on that brand. Alexia Howard : And just as quick follow-up. I mean, you've made a number of diversifying snacking acquisitions of late. Are you still very actively looking for more opportunities to do that? Thank you. And I'll pass it on. Michele Buck : Yes. I believe that M&A is a key component of our growth algorithm and of our strategic vision for the Company. And we continue to stay very active in the market, investigating categories and assets. So, as you know, it's all about finding the right one. But, you can expect to continue to see us be focused on further expanding the portfolio. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Moskow : Steve, I hate to be the one to greet you with an accounting question, but you're CFO. So, the benefit you had in second quarter from the inventory build, and that relates to inventory and your own inventory, right, it hasn't shipped out the door yet? Steve Voskuil : There are two parts that we talked about on the call. The one is, retailers or distributors built some inventory. And that doesn't benefit us from fixed costs, but the mix that they built and gave us a favorable mix impact. And then, we built a bit of our own inventory, because build our inventory this time of the year anyway for Halloween. But beyond that, we built some more in anticipation of the price increase. And that's the portion that drives a fixed cost absorption benefit, basically those cost and inventory until it bleeds out in the third quarter. Robert Moskow : So, I understand, like your volume was down in North America in the quarter but retailers were building up inventory, does that mean, it would have been worse if they hadn't been building up inventory? Steve Voskuil : In total, inventory, the retailers didn't build, as they built it, they built some in anticipation of the price increase in -- I'd say are more profitable brands that we touched on. In total, they weren't up. And so, I don\u2019t know if that sums around. Michele Buck : The counting impact has more to do with our internal inventory than external inventory. Robert Moskow : Okay. Well, then, the next question is, if it hasn't been shipped yet, how do you accrue for inventory benefits on that kind of volume? Is it like you just get better rates on your labor or better rates on your -- growing your commodities? Like, it seemed, you wouldn't enjoy that benefit until it actually shipped to a customer, but maybe I just don't understand the accounting. Steve Voskuil : Yes. You're getting more efficiency in your plans by running more volume, and then it goes into the inventory, so off the P&L into the inventory until it comes back when you do the sale. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel. Your line is open. Chris Growe : I just had a question for you in relation to the price increase. Obviously, it's well validated by competitors taking prices up too. I guess, I'm just curious, with input costs down, are you getting much pushback, say from retailers, on this pricing strategy, especially at this time when input costs are more favorable? Michele Buck : So, our retailer conversations around pricing have gone well so far. The retailers know and appreciate that we continue to invest in our brands that we provide a lot of investments to drive category growth in terms of our category management and other investments with the customer. And we really jointly work together to drive revenue growth and profitable growth, which benefits to all of us. So, at this point in time, we're feeling good. As you know, the category has price. So, it's been a category initiative. And we're feeling good at this point. Chris Growe : Okay. And then, the next question for you, you talked about a second half North American sales growth rate largely in line with the first half, I think ex the Easter benefit. And if I understand that right, you're going to have pricing coming through at least at that that level? You've got marketing up and new product pipeline looks pretty solid. It would seem volumes could grow in the second half of the year, although I don't think that's what you were implying. So I'm just trying to understand those -- that factor and how that could affect your second half growth rate? Michele Buck : Sure. So, as we think about the back part of the year, I did mention that some of the last were a little bit tougher for us as we look at the back half, given the strength we had in season. There's also a bit of pipeline fill that we had in the second quarter from our new products. If you think about the new products that we had in the marketplace, we had the new packaged candy bags, we had Reese's Thins, we had Reese Lovers. Reese Lovers actually hit the market a little sooner than we anticipated; it hit in Q2. We thought more of it was going to hit in Q3. And so, those things come out of our numbers in the back half of the year. And then, if you think overall about the business, we are increasing our DME spend and we'll have impressions up similarly to the first half of the year. But it's going to cost us a little bit more on that just because we're mapping some of the efficiencies that we realized as we brought some of our creative production in-house year ago. Hope that helps. Chris Growe : It does. Yes. Thanks so much for that. Operator : Our next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore. Please go ahead. David Palmer : Thanks. Just a little bit of a follow-up on Chris's question on volume and your return on advertising. This summer is the summer of Reese's, and you've already been spending back in the quarter on advertising. And it sounds like, you\u2019re going to be doing even more in the next quarter or two with the benefit of pricing behind you. So, I guess the question is about volume. It\u2019s been tough to grow for a lot of players in the instant consumables area. What makes you think or how confident are you that you're going to get a volume response from this advertising in the second half? And I guess, it doesn't seem like that's baked into the numbers. So, how are you going to be judging this return on investment? Thanks. Michele Buck : So, generally, as we price, we expect to see a different volume. That's just how the conversion works. So, the first year of pricing, you take the drop in your volume, and then the consumer kind of converts and gets used to it. Certainly, we try to accelerate that conversion curve by spending into advertising, which we have found to help -- really drive that conversion curve to be a bit stronger than it otherwise would. So, that's really what's occurring when you think about that, because our last year price impact is really what\u2019s hitting the marketplace this year, just as this year's price impact primarily comes into the marketplace in 2020. David Palmer : So, perhaps safer to say that you would be hoping to see a volume response as the year progresses, and perhaps that exit rate on volume is going to be how you judge this advertising push? Michele Buck : Yes, I would say that -- yes, that progressive getting better piece towards the end would be how we judge it. Yes. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Go ahead. John Baumgartner : Michele, I just wanted to touch on the international business. The focus markets are growing mid-singles, but that's a slowdown from last year, especially in LatAm and India. So, how much of that decel would you say is just harder comps relative to anything incremental on the competitive front on the consumer side? And then, I guess secondly, the non-focus markets, I guess, the export markets. I mean, those are still in [indiscernible] part of the business and your growth seems to accelerating. And so, just what's driving that pickup? And how do you think about the export businesses fit in strategically over the longer term for you? Michele Buck : Yes, absolutely. So, if you think about our international strategy, certainly, we believe international is an important part of our business model. And we will be continuing to focus on profitable growth across the key markets. The way we think about that business, we have scaled businesses in Canada, Mexico, and Brazil. We have a very highly profitable export business, just because we don't have those fixed costs of feet on the ground as we export. But we found that to be a very viable piece of our business model and actually growing increasingly, across the board, particularly we\u2019ve seen a lot of strength for Reese\u2019s brand in the UK, with very limited investment on our part. And then, the place that we're really placing bigger bets for the future are in China and India, the big emerging markets that have so much potential growth, and we're excited about those opportunities. So, yes, I would say the slowdown in the top-line growth is really a factor of, as we build scale that same kind of growth, just off a bigger base starts to drop down. But we're feeling really good about the performance across all those markets. They've been hitting expectations. India, we launched Kisses, feel good about what we're seeing there and about expanding that opportunity. So, yes, we're feeling good about that piece. John Baumgartner : And just a follow-up on the pricing, just to be clear. It sounds like the second round of pricing you are taking is going to be in excess of commodity inflation. So, maybe thinking about benefit net of inflation for next year on your margins, or are you going to spend that back elsewhere in the business? Just to be clear on that. Michele Buck : So, we definitely are -- run our business model in a way that we try and make sure that we are balancing pricing, margin expansion overall through smart cost management to enable reinvestment back into the brand. So, you know that we have a pretty active commodity management, hedging program, we try and look at what that outlook looks like, look at all the other cost factors and cost elements in the cost bucket, and just keep trying to get ahead in terms of pricing where we think it makes sense and where there's realization opportunities, smart cost management, and then thus investing back in. So, it's really kind of a -- it's a holistic approach to looking at the P&L versus just zeroing in on any one line. Steve Voskuil : Yes. And I'd say, the key is, the proactive past year. So, we're not ready to talk about 2020 yet, but certainly having the pricing in place will be a good way to start the year. Operator : We'll now go to Ken Zaslow with BMO. Please go ahead. Ken Zaslow : Just two questions. First is, on the smaller brands like the Rolo, the Heath, what have you done differently with them? Is it just activating marketing? What other brands have you not touched yet that may be in the potential? Then, I have a follow-up. Michele Buck : So, yes, I would say, primarily marketing. So, on those smaller brands, over the years, we have seen evidence where a packaging upgrade on the graphics can have a nice impact on those businesses, given they don't have a lot of support when consumer goes to the shop, and you really refresh the package. So, we've done that on several of the brands. Definitely unlocking them through advertising, as if you haven't talked to consumers, and then they start to hear about those brands. From an advertising perspective, we definitely see a lift there. And I would say that is the primary activation. We have hit most of the smaller brands. There are a few that -- I would say, there's a couple more that we will consider investing in going forward. I can think of three. I don't know if I want to really talk about what those are for competitive reasons. But, there are a couple more that we would consider some minor investing. But, I would say, the ones that you've seen this year, including down to Heath and Rolo, you should think about those as the more sizable ones for which we would see the bigger impact. Ken Zaslow : And then, my follow-up, I think, you said it earlier that you lost distribution in some of the -- one of the acquisition, I don't know which one. Was that part of the plan going into that? And what are the plans to regain the distribution back? Michele Buck : So it was on Tyrrells brands, as part of the transition, it was one of those elements where -- yes, a distribution was lost due to retailer, a couple of retailers that shouldn't have been. As we took over the business, our sales team quickly went in and got the volume to get that distribution back. It just takes a little time because you can't actually get the distribution on shelf until the customer has a planogram reset, lined up, and the next planogram resets were in the fall. So, September, October timeframe, we expect to start to see that distribution come back. We have the commitments that it will come back. So, it really wasn't about not deserving the space. It was more of an integration hiccup. And we feel really good about the velocities we're seeing where we haven't lost distribution, we are very high-single-digit velocity gains on Tyrrells. Ken Zaslow : And there's more distribution gains across the U.S. or are you there and you\u2019re just starting to execute now? I leave it there. Thank you. Michele Buck : No. I think, there's more opportunity in distribution across the U.S. Operator : And will now go to Steve Strycula with UBS. Please go ahead. Steve Strycula : Good morning. So, Michele, a quick clarification question for you. The price increase you took this year, meaning July 2018, that is going to be contribution about 1.5% for full year pricing, but on an annualized basis, it's 2.5%. So, there's a phasing effect. My understanding is from what you're saying on today's call is that the go-forward price increase is closer to 2%, but with no phasing. So, we should think about it being a clean 2% for next year. That's the first part of my question. Michele Buck : Yes. That's generally fair way to think about it. Steve Strycula : Okay. And then, the second piece a little bit on the strategy. The way I understand it to simplify the math is that North America breaks down a third center store, a third front of store and a third seasonal. And it sounds like you took pricing across two of these pieces of the third, meaning one-third is left untouched. Could speak a little bit about what's happening in that portion of your business and how we think about when might be appropriate times to also kind of monetize the pricing opportunity? Michele Buck : So, yes, part of seasons, we have done some small pricing action. So, generally, we\u2019ve priced pretty broadly across the portfolio. We haven't taken as much on this sweets part of our business. But, we have had some increase in seasons as part of our broader increases. So, at this point, I can't tell you that there is a -- we don't talk about our future plans around pricing. But, we do feel like we\u2019ve taken some there. And on an ongoing basis, we're just going to constantly evaluate the entire portfolio and look at when and where we think there's opportunity for greater price realization. Operator : Our final question today comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Michael Lavery : Just back to the international business. Can you maybe give us a sense of the margin progression there and sort of what inning we're in? Obviously, divesting Golden Monkey is a big help. And you've done quite a bit to really improve the profile there, the trajectory of margin extension has obviously been really strong. But now, it looks the kind of the runway ahead over the last four quarters more indicative of what we should expect or is there still some big step-ups to come? Michele Buck : I wouldn't expect a big step up. Certainly, we're going to continue as we do everywhere to look at every line item on our P&L and continue to look at opportunities to improve margin, because that's just a piece of who we are as a company. But, I think the really big step-ups have been taken. Steve Voskuil : Yes. I\u2019d agree. And going back to the earlier question, in and out also matters, the mix between the export countries and the ones that we have feet on the ground. And as the feet on the ground grow, that will have an impact on how that margin progresses as well. Michael Lavery : And is pricing a meaningful component of what you can push there to, or is really the pricing focused just North America? Michele Buck : So, we have always had a very active pricing component in those markets. As you know, there are economic volatility components in those markets that are ForEx et cetera. So, we do continue to price in part of why our margins are where they are, is some of the pricing there, but it does vary by market. And given they\u2019re smaller piece, we just don't talk as overtly about that on the calls. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. Melissa Poole : Thanks, everybody. I'll be around today to answer any follow-up questions you have. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Michele. Michele Buck : Thanks, Melissa. Good morning to all of you on the phone and on the webcast. We are pleased with our third quarter results and the momentum we are seeing on our core business. Investments in our brands and capabilities as well as strong execution are driving solid conception sales and share gains, in both our U.S. and International markets. Our Amplify portfolio continues to deliver mid to high single-digit growth and we continue to execute against our broader snacking ambition with the acquisition of One brand, a portfolio of higher growth better for you nutrition bars that enables us to capture incremental consumer occasions. I would just like to pause briefly and say thank you to all of our employees who work so incredibly hard to deliver today and also to create momentum for our future. In the third quarter, net sales increased 2.6%, organic constant currency net sales growth of approximately 1.6% was in-line with our expectations, driven primarily by pricing in North America and volume growth and international. The net impacts with acquisitions and divestitures was 120 basis points benefits driven by our Pirate's brand acquisition, and FX was a 20 basis points headwind. We had another strong quarter of gross margin expansion that enabled a double-digit increase in brand reinvestment as well as adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately 4%. We remain focused on investing in our brands and capabilities for growth, while also delivering consistent earnings performance overtime. Something we believe is a differentiator for us and critical to driving shareholder value. Our key initiatives within our U.S. core confection business continues to perform well and are driving strong retail takeaway and accelerating share performance. For IRI, Hershey Candy Mint and Gum retail sales increased 2.2% versus prior year in the 12 weeks ending October 13. This resulted in a shared gain of approximately 23 basis points. Our $2 billion Reese's brand had another outstanding quarter, with retail sales growth of over 6%. Growth was balanced across multiple levers including strong advertising, distribution gains, smart innovations, new packaging, seasons and pricing. We Reese's brand performing well and we are encouraged by the sustainability and incrementalality of the launch. We also re-launched our Take5 brand under the Reese's umbrella late this summer, and early results are strong. As some of you may know, Take5 is my favorite Hershey Candy, so I couldn't be more thrilled to see takeaway up to over 50% since the re-launch, and we believe there is more opportunity to capture on this great tasting product. Reese's, along with several of our other brands, like Hershey miniatures Kisses and Kit Kat are seeing nice lifts from our new packaging in the take home isle. Performance on these improved bags has been consistently trending up since the transition and we are achieving all of our key benchmarks and driving growth both for us and for our retailers. Our Halloween season is off to a solid start and selling was strong after a successful 2018 season. The power of our core brands, breath of our product line up and incremental capacity are enabling us to deliver great assortment and innovative packaging for our consumers. Additionally, this year we have an Addams Family movie partnership that we will leverage to drive shopper engagement via advertising, merchandising and on tech promotions for key items. Our ecommerce confession business continues to perform well, with net sales growth approximately of 50% in the third quarter, driven by a strong Halloween selling and balanced performance across all fulfillment models. We are measured Hershey\u2019s share of the chocolate category continues to increase with gains of 610 basis points in the quarter according to third-party sources. Our pricing initiatives remain on-track and are performing in-line with expectation. As we have discussed previously, we believe strategic pricing is an important lever for us to enable investment in our brands and capabilities. In 2019, we have invested in capabilities such as media targeting, digital commerce, new business models and supply chain. These capabilities in addition to our brand investments in innovation, advertising, seasons and distribution are driving balanced, sustainable growth in the marketplace. As we look ahead to the rest of the year, we are excited to keep the momentum going with some great activation. Our ICE BREAKER brand is partnering with Disney to bring character packaging and high impact merchandising to stores for the highly anticipated release of Frozen 2 next month. This is a great opportunity to capitalize on the cultural momentum of the movie and secure incremental merchandising opportunities in store. Four, our holiday program this year, we will build on last year\u2019s success by continuing to drive our core and leverage a hero innovation item to secure incremental merchandising and engage with our consumers. This year's item is Reese's Mystery Shapes, which combines the anticipation and surprise of the holidays with the perfect ratio of peanut butter and chocolate that our consumers craves during the season. It is the first new Reese holiday shape in 20 years, and it will be available nationwide for a limited time only. And as we announced earlier this year, we will be launching Kit Kat Duos in December. Our supply chain investments and incremental capacity and new production capabilities allows us to bring consumers to crispy light wafer they love surrounded by dark chocolate on the bottom and mint cream on the top. The launch will be supported with merchandising, national TV and digital media. Now for an update on our recent acquisitions. SkinnyPop continues to perform very well in the marketplace, with retail sales up over 10% in the latest 12 weeks, this growth has significantly outpaced competition, resulting in a share gain of a 170 basis points in the ready-to-eat popcorn category. Both household penetration and frequency has consistently grown this year, a testament to the underlying strength of this brand. We will leverage this strength to continue optimizing placements and facings on shelves, as well as secure incremental space for new pack types that meet different consumer occasions. Pirate\u2019s Booty performance is improving versus the first half of the year in-line with our expectations. In the latest 12 weeks, the business has begun to stabilize and trends are strong where distribution has been maintained. Well, performance is not yet where we want it to be, we remain confident in the strength of the brand and our visibility into recapturing lost distribution as planograms reset. Now for a few more details on our most recent acquisitions and venture investments. Last month, we closed our acquisition of One Brand, and I'm excited to welcome the team to the Hershey family. One is a portfolio of low sugar, high protein nutrition bars with net sales of approximately $100 million. As many of you know, the nutrition bar category is approximately $3 billion and its growing mid to high single-digits. The One portfolio is growing 40% to 50% and has a strong presence outside of measured channels, including a robust ecommerce business. We expect the acquisition to be slightly accretive to earnings in year one, and highly incremental to our existing portfolio. We also announced two minority investments in emerging snacking businesses Fulfill Holdings and Blue Stripes in August. Fulfill was one of the leading makers of great tasting vitamin fortified, high protein nutrition bars in the UK and Ireland. And Blue Stripes the town shop offers experiential retail that combines the goodness of coco with a unique customer experience. This sensor model provides the Company with new avenues for growth through the deployment of small capital investments in disruptive or emerging platforms focused on new occasions, new technologies and new go to market opportunities. Now for an update on our international markets. Constant currency organic sales grew 3.7% in the third quarter, and we continue to see strong segment operating income growth of almost 27% as we focus on increasing gross margins and right sizing our brand an SG&A investment. Our business in Mexico continues to show strong high single-digit growth behind increased distribution and innovation of our Hershey\u2019s and Pelo Rico brands. In India, we continue to see robust growth of over 16% behind distribution gains and our and launch of Hershey Kisses. The Kisses launch remains on-track and we plan to expand to additional cities in 2020. And our China business is also growing high single-digits on an organic constant currency basis, driven by improved velocity on our Hershey bars, and reason specific flavor innovation, which is driving incremental growth. In Brazil, our performance has been challenged by difficult macroeconomic environment and increased competition. While we have invested additional trades to remain competitive, we are also being disciplined about the returns on our investment as we look to balance both the top and bottom line. In summary, we continue to feel good about the momentum we have a property strategies and the business results we are delivering. We will continue to invest in our brands and capabilities to take the business to the next level and drive sustainable top and bottom line growth. I will turn it over to Steve, who will provide you with details on our financial results. Steve Voskuil : Thank you, Michelle, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter net sales of $2.1 billion increase 2.6% versus the same period last year. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures was a 120 basis points benefits and foreign currency translation was a 20 basis points headwinds. Organic constant currency net sale growth of 1.6% was driven by pricing, which contributed 1.1 points of growth, while volume contributed 50 basis points of growth. Our 2018 price increase remains on-track and as anticipated, the impact increased in the third quarter versus the first half. This was offset by our pricing transition period related to our July 2019 price increase, which executed in-line with expectations. We continue to expect minimal full-year sales and earnings impacts from our most recent pricing action. Adjusted earnings per shares diluted were $1.61 an increase of 3.9% versus the same period last year. This was driven by continued gross margin gains, partially offset by increased brand investments, and higher incentive compensation versus prior year. By segment, North American net sales increased 2.7% versus the same period last year. Price realization was a 150 basis point benefit and the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures was also a 150 basis points benefit. Volume was a 20 basis point headwind and foreign currency exchange was a 10 basis point headwind. North America gross margins expanded 80 basis points in the quarter as favorable commodities and net price realization, offset incremental logistics costs. This was slightly higher than our expectations. Recall in the second quarter, we experienced the gross margin benefit related to external inventory mix and fixed cost absorption, both related to our July price increase. While we expected most of this benefits to reverse in the third quarter, as inventory levels normalize, we now expect the majority of the impact to occur in the fourth quarter. Given this timing shift, and the more difficult lag from the year ago period, we expect Q4 gross margin expansion to be less than the third quarter. We continue to be pleased with the underlying momentum in our margin expansion initiatives and the business reinvestment it is enabling. North America advertising and related consumer marketing spend increased 14.4% in the quarter, driven primarily by advertising. This increase is in-line with expectations as we prioritize reinvesting gross margin expansion gain back into our brands to drive growth. As we have shared previously, the dollar spend increase is more meaningful in the second half of 2019 versus the first half. As we are lapping significant media efficiency gains in the year ago period. Third quarter total international and others segment net sales increased 1.8%, volume was a 5.3 point benefit driven by organic growth in our key focus markets. Net price realization was a 160 basis points headwinds as we invested more in response to increase competitive activity. Foreign currency exchange was a 100 basis points headwind and divestitures were a 90 basis point headwind. Combined organic constant currency net sales in Mexico, Brazil, India and China grew 7.4% versus the third quarter of 2018. International and other advertising and related consumer marketing decreased 14% versus prior year as we continue to right size investment and increase ROI in China in our regional markets. Total Hershey adjusted gross profit increased 4.4%, resulting in an adjusted gross margin of 44.8% an increase of 80 basis points versus the third quarter of 2018. This was driven by favorable commodities and net price realization. Third quarter adjusted operating profit of $477 million resulting in operating profit margin of 22.3% a decrease of 30 basis points versus the third quarter of 2018, as gross margin gains were offset by incremental brand investments and higher incentive compensation. Moving down the P&L, interest expense of $35 million decreased $1.5 million versus Q3 last year due to lower short-term interest rates. We expect full-year interest expense of approximately $145 million, the high end of our previous range due to our recent acquisition of ONE Brand. The adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 20.1% versus 22.9% in the year ago period. These gains were driven primarily by excess tax benefits from stock based compensation, along with higher tax investment credits. For the full-year, we expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 18.5%. Third quarter other expense was $18 million an increase of $5.5 million versus prior year driven primarily by unfavorable pension expense. For the full-year, we expect other expense of approximately $70 million to $75 million. This is below our previous estimates, as we plan to exercise fewer tax investment credits and is offset by a slightly higher tax rate for the whole year. Then net impact of these two changes is negligible versus our previous estimates. For the third quarter of 2019, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 211 million, reflecting a slight increase versus the second quarter due to a increased number of stock option exercises in the quarter. The Company repurchased $191 million of common shares in the third quarter in connection with the exercise of stock options. The Company did not repurchase any shares in the third quarter against our July 2018 $500 million authorization and $410 million remaining. Total capital additions, including software were $60 million in the third quarter. For the full-year 2019, we continue to estimate CapEx of around $350 million. We continue to return cash to our shareholders with third quarter dividends of $168 million. This was our 359th consecutive quarterly dividend on the common stock, a testament to our strong balance sheet and strong cash flow generation. Before I close, let me provide some additional information on our recent acquisition of ONE Brands. As Michelle mentioned, net sales are approximately $100 million. Given our mid September close, we expect approximately $25 million of sales in the fourth quarter for this acquisition. The margin profile on this portfolio is attractive, and we expect it to be slightly accretive to earnings in year one. Given acquisition related costs, we expect it to be slightly dilutive to recorded earnings in the fourth quarter and have a negligible impact to adjusted earnings in Q4. Our focus will be on maintaining the brand's current momentum, [indiscernible] links have to built brand equity and secure incremental distribution and capturing supply chain and procurement synergies. To summarize for the full-year, we expect full-year recorded net sales to increase to around 2.5%, an increase versus the previous guidance driven by the acquisition of One Brands. The net benefit from acquisitions and divestitures increases to approximately one point. Full-year FX impact is anticipated to be slightly negative based on current exchange rates. Full-year reported earnings per share diluted are expected to be around $5.58 relatively flat the prior year. Full-year adjusted earnings per share diluted are expected to grow 6% to 7% consistent with our previous outlook as the impact of One Brands acquisition has a negligible impact on earnings in 2019. That concludes my financial discussions, and I will turn it back to Michelle. Michele Buck : Thanks, Steve. We remain confident in our strategies and in our ability to deliver our financial commitments for the year. We are pleased with the progress we have made over the past two years. But we continue to operate with a healthy dissatisfaction that drives us to push and elevate the business even further. I continue to be energized by the opportunities presented by this rapidly changing environment and the power of our amazing brands and remarkable people to capitalize on this change to unlock new opportunities for the future. We will continue to focus on delivering today and building for the future in a way that is consistent with our values and purpose. Steve, Melissa and I are now available to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please go ahead. Andrew Lazar : Good morning, everybody. Michele Buck : Good morning, Andrew. Steve Voskuil : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Lazar : Hi there. So I guess in thinking ahead a little bit, Hershey\u2019s already discussed some incremental pricing for 2020 roughly 2% on average. In terms of volume, the SKU rationalization drag I think is behind you at this point. The volume elasticity from the previous pricing, I think is largely behind you. And as Hershey's you have talked about a stepped up brand investment quite a bit. I do recognize there will be some volume elasticity on the new pricing increase, could be a partial offset a little bit on volume going forward. So, I was just hoping you could just comment maybe even more broadly on how sort of all of these factors are expected to come together in terms of how we think about volume moving forward. At a high level do it seem like volume could at least be maybe flattish or given the puts and takes if not a bit better, or the discrete maybe other volumes headwinds we should be aware of maybe it's Easter timing or things along those lines? Thanks so much. Michele Buck : Yes, I think if we think about our retail takeaway trends and revenue going forward, I think that there is no reason to expect that to - the trends wouldn't be similar with what we have been seeing and are seeing here in the back half of this year. As you think about going from 2019 into 2020, clearly, we will gain a little bit from SKU wrap being behind us. We lose a little bit in terms of Easter and going through a shorter Easter. But net, net, I think those are two of the single biggest changes you are right, that pricing kind of continues at a pretty steady pace. So I think it's fair to assume that the trends would be roughly similar to what we have been seeing during the back half of the year. Andrew Lazar : Got it. And those trends in the back half have been around consumption. I think it's been, I guess what you say today around 2ish or a little above 2ish more or less? Is that fair? Michele Buck : Yes, exactly. That is fair. I think we have always said 1.5 to two of growth we would get from North America and yes, retail takeaway trend is around 2%. Andrew Lazar : Great. Thank you so much. Michele Buck : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Goldman with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Ken Goldman : Hi. Thank you and Michelle, congrats on the added title and responsibilities. Michele Buck : Thank you. Ken Goldman : I wanted to ask two questions. One, sort of the mechanics of the gross margin impact on a benefit that you got into 2Q was originally expected to reverberate and hit 3Q, now you're mentioning 4Q as a bigger impact. Can you walk through the mechanics of that, because to me, it was more of a fixed cost absorption benefit, and I just don't understand how the timing is delayed by a few months so that would be helpful? and then I have a follow-up. Steve Voskuil : Sure, yes, happy to take that one. As we talked about the second quarter, and as you said Ken really two pieces there, one mix driven, we were selling a richer mix for us of instant consumable that was a benefit for us and then the inventory build both our inventory build in the second quarter and third-party inventories. We expected to see more of that inventory come down in the third quarter and we got a little bit of that benefit back probably about a third of what we expected. We expect more inventory reduction in the fourth quarter and that is really the reason for the delay. With more inventories we got into the third quarter, both in third-party and ours, it took longer to bleed it out. Ken Goldman : Okay, thank you for that. And then my follow-up, Steve, is on the always exciting topic of working capital, but if you look at working capital forget inventory for a second, because I know there is timing issue there. But I look at your payables on a last 12 months basis and a percentage of COGS they have been decreasing for lowest they have been in a few years. Your last 12 months receivables as a percentage of sales is at a highest they have been in over decades. So can you just walk us through what is going on with these items that is running a little bit less favorably for you at least as I look at it and maybe what the opportunity is to turn them around? Steve Voskuil : Yes, it's a great question. If you look at say the phase for the balance sheet and cash flow today, I think networking capital year-over-year through nine-months is about $10 million drag across all three of those components. And if you stick strap one there, so one sort of clouds up the numbers a little bit. It's just a slight positive cash generator year-over-year, but inside that you're exactly right we have opportunities to be more efficient on working capital. I think inventory in particular is one within our cross years and think about the future. But we do feel they need to be efficient in working capital as one of the sources of funding that helps funding investments and the other thing we want to do with the business. So you can expect we will try to talk more about that as we think about 2020 plans and beyond. Ken Goldman : Thank you. Operator : We will now go to Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jason English : Hey good morning folks and thanks for sliding me in, I appreciate it. I wanted to I guess come back to the direction of the question that Mr. Lazar was asking in terms of price contribution as we look into next year, but first kind of close out this year. Do you still expect to see roughly 250 bps of price contributions in North America for this fiscal year? Michele Buck : No, in the fourth quarter, yes, not for - the full-year was always around more 1.5%, because of the time it takes for pricing to build. So we took 2.5% as we mentioned till that hits fully through the year because of price protection timing we expected more like 1.5 on the annual basis to even out the year. Jason English : And that price protection timing. How much longer does it run for, is it not behind us now? Steve Voskuil : Largely behind us as we exit the third quarter, but there is still inventory that will be getting run down into fourth quarter, some of which was still price protected, I would say largely behind us. Jason English : Right. So I guess that is the component what I'm just having a hard time bridging because we have got the bracket changes of 50 bps, the gum, et cetera and sugar confection, we have got to weighed out benefit. And we should start to see what price protection behind us albeit volumes muted, because the inventory reduction, I would expect to see some of that single serve pricing come through. If you add all that up and it's a much bigger chunk than say 250 bps in the fourth quarter. What am I missing in the math, and maybe what I'm missing is just sort of reinvestment, or reinvest in SG&A, maybe there is reinvestment in above the line type investment as well. If you could help me understand that I would really appreciate it. Steve Voskuil : I will take the bigger - the total P&L side and then we can talk about - if Melissa wants to add on the growth line. When you look at the fourth quarter P&L in total, you have got a couple of headwinds. One is the incentives that we mentioned on the call, that was an impact in the third quarter, will also be a drag in the fourth quarter. We have got a tax drag in the fourth quarter, this year we had a lot of our tax planning benefit across the first three quarters. Last year, the fourth quarter was a big tax planning quarter. And so that by itself is order of magnitude an $0.08 drag. So you have those two pieces working against, we will have some more DME investments in the fourth quarter, similar to what we saw here. And then that gross margin, roughly reversal from the second quarter. That Ken talked about just a few minutes ago. So from a total P&L standpoint below sales, those are some of the big drivers driving the I would say deceleration in the fourth quarter P&L. Melissa, you want to add anything on the top-line specifically? Melissa Poole : Yes, just from the pricing piece. You're right in how you're thinking about the builds of last year's than this year's kind of compounding it. I guess the two pieces I would point you to is we did have most of our Halloween Business shifts in the third quarter. So that the jolt we get from that is mostly behind us. So we don't have Halloween pricing in the fourth quarter just because we don't really ship too much in the fourth quarter. And then the last piece on price protection, there is still a little bit of price protection for some of the promotional activities of our most recent price increase. So we kind of give in the third quarter would have been more around kind of base volume, time to transition to the new prices that everybody gets on everything. In the fourth quarter, there is a little bit of promotional activity that we will also deal back. So absolutely right that it should be higher than what it was so far a year-to-date and in the third quarter. But I don't know that it's enough to kind of trip you into a pretty significant pop in earning given all of the points that Steve had walked you through. Jason English : That is helpful and the elevated trade in the fourth quarter, would we expect that to persist into next year? Melissa Poole : No. Jason English : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : We will now go to Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Alexia Howard : Good morning everyone. Michele Buck : Hi, Alexia. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. Alexia Howard : Hi there. This is probably quite linked I guess to Jason\u2019s question, but again focusing on pricing in North America, but the measured channel pricing was up pretty sharply sort of mid single-digit numbers on the whole portfolio and particularly on chocolate this time around that is obviously meaningfully higher than the 1.5 the price growth that you reported this morning. Is that just a timing effect, because of the timing of shipments or all the retailers temporarily increasing the markups on the product because of the upcoming pricing increases. And similarly the volumes were down only 2.2% in the numbers you reported this morning and that is a lot better than the mid single-digit declines that we are seeing in measured channels. So I'm just trying to figure out whether there is something going on a non-measured channels that were backed out or whether the inventory, some inventory shifts are recycling that if you could maybe speak to that? Thank you very much. Michele Buck : Sure. So it is not a measured channel non-measured channel. There are a couple different factors going on. So first of all you right, retail takeaways is trending a little bit ahead of shipments in North America and we expected some of this and part of that is tied to the inventory contraction that is associated with our SKU rationalization program. So we knew that shipments will have a little bit of a drag there were shipments would be lighter and takeaway. We also know that as we take price, there is some retailer margin expansion from our price increase, so you do see retail prices go up slightly higher than the Hershey prices. And then some of that is just tied to the timing of that new price increase, because as you know we have got kind of the two price increases, the one from last year that hit, and then the new one, where again retail prices will go up before we see that in our data because of how we manage those price increases and allow a buy-in period. Steve Voskuil : Yes. And I would say - all I would add is by the end of the year we expect those two to tighten up between shipments and take away. Alexia Howard : Great. Thank you very much. I will pass it on. Operator : We will now go to Chris Growe with Stifel. Please go ahead. Chris Growe : Hi good morning. Michele Buck : Hi, Chris. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. Chris Growe : Hi. And so actually a follow-on to Alexia's question there, because related to the - what we are seeing in measured channels the increased level of price realization, we are seeing an equally or weakening volume and performance as well. So I just want to understand how that - maybe from a higher level how elasticity is playing off for you right now and then how we should read again what we are seeing in the measured channel data, which is obviously a increasing in pricing, but a much weaker volume performance overall? Michele Buck : Yes, so what we are seeing at retail is very consistent with what our model would indicate. We normally see a conversion timeframe, when we take retail prices up, we see volume goes down, obviously we do a lot of work with one of our programming to mitigate some of that volume declines during that conversion timeframe to bring back the volume even more quickly, but typically in periods of price increase, we do see those volume declines and they are pretty much in-line with all of our elasticity models. Melissa Poole : And just to build on that Chris and we can talk with this a little bit more offline, because there is some extra noise in the third quarter, but if you kind of break them into pieces, and think about last year's price increase, the price of that retailer are to Michele\u2019s point pretty much in-line with expectations. So they are a little bit ahead of us as retailers are expanding margins, but nothing out of bound by any stretch. I think a lot of the noise in this quarter there is some timing of promotional activity where there were some losses and some higher prices on promotion that you're seeing place through for why those retail prices are a little bit more elevated in the in the quarter, year-to-date they are pretty much in-line with what we are seeing on the P&L, but a little bit of noise in the quarter. And then especially this most recent price increase to the timing of the protection causes a pretty big disconnect as they start rising prices and we don't see that in our P&L right away. So overall feeling really good they are where we expected, it is just there is a little bit more noise in this quarter. Chris Growe : Okay. And then just a quick follow-on in terms of how that relates to the gross margin, as I think about the fourth quarter, you have a bit of an easy comparison on the gross margin, have you given indication in terms of your pricing in relation to cost inflation, kind of how that stands today, you talk about input cost being down and then what that would mean for a full-year gross margin and we can kind of imply what it could mean for the fourth quarter. Steve Voskuil : Yes. I mean our full-year gross margin guidance isn't unchanging. We kind of said in the order of 100 basis points year-over-year, and we are just sort of tracking to that. I'd say there is nothing new relative to commodities versus price, we are playing out the way we expected, again because we have got the hedging program against some of the commodities that smooths out and give some forward visibility, so not a lot of change there. I don't know if that answers your question. Chris Growe : Yes, it does. Thank you. Operator : We will now go to Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Moskow : Thank you. And I will second your remarks Michelle, on Take5. Michele Buck : Thanks. Robert Moskow : Yes. And, in my channel checks, what I keep hearing is that actual physical shopping trips to stores are on the rise, which is not what you would expect with the growth of e-commerce and I think that is a positive for your business, more impulse purchases. And then secondly, I saw on the data that it looks like your points of distribution are rising. You didn't really talk about those in your prepared remarks. Can you comment on those two things and would you confirm or not? Michele Buck : Yes, I think as you look at the IRI data it can be - there is a little bit of noise in that this year, because of the standup packaging bag transition where we had an overlap of inventories transitioning from the old lay down bags to the stand up bags. So we are always pushing to drive against distribution, getting additional points of distribution and actually additional disruptive placements in-store primarily. So we did have a program at one of our big retailers where we got significantly expanded distribution points around the front end, but it\u2019s a little bit of both, we are expanding some distribution with some customer specific programs, but there is also - it probably looks a little higher in the numbers in the IRI data than actually is just because of that conversion on stand up bags. Robert Moskow : Thanks, try to see you up. So net-net it is a little higher, but it might be temporary or it's a -. Michele Buck : No, I would kind of say it's higher, but not as high as the numbers would show. So there is growth, but it's just not as high as the total IRI looks. Robert Moskow : Okay, and physical shopping fixed stores, I think IRI also indicates that people are going to stores more frequently. Michele Buck : Yes, we are seeing some good signs there, relatives consumers and I think as consumers are shopping on omni-channel basis we see them in-stores, also looking at the retailers websites, while they are in-store, so we are seeing a lot more of that versus a net shift. Robert Moskow : Okay. Alright. Very good. Thank you. Michele Buck : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from [indiscernible] with RBC. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Yes, good morning, everyone. Michelle maybe you can just give us some perspective on some channel dynamics, maybe just talk about what you're seeing in big box and the convenience per channel. And then maybe Steve, if you could just address, no one recently talk about inflation and a sided sugar and milk prices. So I just wanted to get your thoughts around that kind of what you guys are seeing and if you are hedged for 2020. Thank you. Steve Voskuil : Sure. Michele Buck : Yes, so if we look from a channel perspective, we are really seeing growth across most all classes of trade, with the exception of drug which tends to be a little bit soft, particularly given some of the strategies and actions taken focus in that class of trade. I would say particular strength in big box, for sure. In club stores and in the dollar class of trade, but pretty much growth across everything except for drug. Steve Voskuil : And Nick on the commodity side. Obviously we are watching commodity prices very closely as we put together our plans for 2020. Hedging gives us some visibility. I think probably the biggest takeaway across that group is that as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we have got a tailwind this year on Coco. But if you look at the Coco prices today versus the last 12 to 24 months they are higher and so at minimum, we are not likely to have a tailwind in 2020 that we have been able to enjoy this year on Coco. Hedging will help to smooth out that transition and we will get more guidance on commodities in general as we get closer to 2020. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you. Operator : We will now go to John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. John Baumgartner : Good morning thank for the question. Michele Buck : Good morning. John Baumgartner : Why don\u2019t dig into the ONE Brands acquisition a bit, because that nutrition bar space is increasingly crowded. Can you speak a bit to the diligence that went into that and how you're thinking about the competitive tension there, how you think one stands out and maybe how you're envisioning growing that business, whether it's in distribution channels or different product formats? Michele Buck : Absolutely. So we continue to be excited with the growth that we are seeing in that snack bar segment and particularly if you look across total snack bars, and you really dissect that market, you see that the real sweet spot where that has the strongest growth is that high protein, and particularly high protein with low sugar. So I think my first direction would be to kind of dissect within that category to say where is the sweet spot where we think that there really is growth and we certainly think that there is room to have a couple brands that play in that space in the marketplace consistent with other categories. What we really liked about it is, it's very consistent and fits right into our stated desire for scale to growing assets in attractive categories that give us access to incremental snacking occasions. High protein, low sugar it provides on the go convenience, it also gives us a play in the morning snacking occasion where we are underdeveloped. We like a lot that that business has a strong presence and growth in e-commerce and non-traditional channels, which again provides some incrementalality for us and we certainly like the growth rates that we are seeing on this business. We think it fits in a nice sweet spot for us in terms of where we can add value, because there is still a distribution opportunity. So I'd say job one, as we look at growing the business is securing that incremental measured distribution expansion, continuing to build on the brands equity, we like the fact that this asset has good margins that are in-line with Hershey margins and that is one thing that has always been important to us to the kind of businesses that we run best, and then of course we will capture any opportunities for supply chain and procurement synergy. So we see it as a platform that has - our primary focus for growth will be around to close in - at least for the next several years the close in driving against the core. So unlike perhaps some of the other assets in that space where maybe some of their focus is expanding to a lot of other categories. I think there is a lot of upside expanding within snack bars. But then later some opportunity to take that one trademark more broadly in terms of the platform it stands for. John Baumgartner : Is it fair to think just given you know how in the bar business already that this is something you could repatriate overtime internally in-house? Michele Buck : I mean, we certainly make a lot of bars and that technology of kind of slab and slip is something certainly we do well. So we always take an approach of getting our arms around the business and then looking at how we leverage repatriating for opportunity whenever and if it is appropriate. John Baumgartner : Okay. Thanks for your time. Operator : We will now go to Steven Strycula with UBS. Please go ahead. Steven Strycula : Hi, good morning. Michele Buck : Hi, Steve. Steven Strycula : So I have a question, Michelle, could you walk us around the globe, some of your key markets internationally such as Brazil, China and Mexico, just give us a feel for how Hershey is performing versus the competition or whether you're seeing more competitive dynamics or macro acceleration, deceleration, multinational brands versus local, because you called out specifically Brazil, but be helpful to understand the dynamics across Brazil, China and Mexico and then I have a follow-up? Michele Buck : Yes, I would say across all of our international markets, we are feeling good and performing well, in most of those markets we are gaining share. For some of my highlights in my opening comments, we feel particularly good about Mexico where we have strong, very strong growth with a real focus on Hershey\u2019s Pelo Rico, but we are seeing growth in India in China. Brazil is really the market that is been challenged given that combination of macroeconomic as well as some competitive activity around deep discounting where we have just made some choices around. Investing additionally, but still being very rational about balance top and bottom line. But I feel good growth and good share progress in all the other markets. Steven Strycula : Okay, and just to clarify, was Brazil more of a multinational or a local competition? Michele Buck : Yes, Brazil is more multinational competition. Steven Strycula : Okay. And then to close out a question on pricing, I know you guys have three levers you pulled for pricing this year that are kind of cascading or phasing in throughout the year and then we have another piece from the price increase announced this summer. So can help us understand as we go from fourth quarters into the first half of next year how do we stack pricing on top of pricing. So basically, when does it peek out versus when does it starts to kind of like normalize to a more moderate rate? Thank you. Michele Buck : So we will start to see the pricing come into our P&L mostly as we get into Q1 and flow from there. So Q1 should be a little bit higher, but I would expect on an annual basis, you're going to see similar to what we saw with our last price increase of around 2%. That we will see on an annual basis next year. And it will build we won't get from the second price increase any impact this year. But as we go into next year, you will see that build in the marketplace. Steven Strycula : Thank you very much. Michele Buck : Does that, answer your question? Steven Strycula : It does. Thank you. Operator : We will now go to David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Palmer : [Technical Difficulty] on 2019 is coming to an end here. How do you think this year will shape up versus what you think will be a typical year for your growth in terms of the complexion of the growth. On the phase of it looks like there has been some nice pricing gains relative to input inflation, you even had some pretty clever way of doing pricing with a stand up bags and that weighed out there. You are reinvesting heavily in advertising, you're getting some very nice growth out of your Reese's trademark, which is sort of the trademark of growth of your year. So in some ways it feels like an unusual period in terms of reinvestment room and reinvestment behind what might be your best trademark there and in some ways you might be thinking about a different type of growth going forward. Any thoughts there would be helpful? Michele Buck : Yes, I guess as I think about the growth model this year and then the growth model for next year, I would say that there are some similarities and I can call of a few differences. So think in terms of similarities pricing certainly this year, pricing will play a key role next year. So I think that is kind of one platform that you can think is even though taking a little bit differently comparable on a year-to-year basis. While we don't get into specific guidance, we are continuing to look for strategy to continue to reinvest and invest in our brands and capabilities and certainly, that will be a priority for us next year as it was this year. We always focus on trying to achieve that balance between driving our everyday brands and really driving the core brands. So you should continue to expect to see strong support and programming around Reese when you have built a brand that is $2 billion in revenue. There will always be a focus on that brand just because of how big a pieces it is at the portfolio but also support by some of our other big brands. We talked about Kit Kat Duos and Kit Kat will certainly be a brand that will have a lot of focus next year as well. So I think a lot of commonality in terms of some of those elements that you called out, I think relative to growth where the biggest differences are is more around the timing of Easter, which is a little bit of a heard about half a point for next year, but then the benefit around SKU wrapped cycling which is a help. Does that provides perspective? David Palmer : Yes. No that is. That is helpful. Thank you. Operator : [Operator instructions] And our next question comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Michael Lavery : Good morning. Thank you. Could you just touch on your thinking on the consumer marketing spending is obviously up very strongly in the quarter. But looking at the last few years it's typically been 7%, 7.5% of sales and 2018 was just a little bit of 6%. Should we expect it to get back above a 7% level or are some of the increase this year a little more one off. Can you just give us a sense of how sticky it is and where your optimal range might be. And then just related to that what were some of the things that changed last year where there were the cutbacks and what are some of the things that are coming back or maybe this year in terms of how you're deploying the spending? Michele Buck : So our kind of stated strategy around marketing investment is to grow in-line or slightly ahead of our sales growth. So to grow the dollar investment in-line or slightly ahead. There can be some noise around that, because sometimes we are able to get efficiencies in how we are buying and so we can actually get greater impressions than the dollar budget. So it's not always perfect, but I would say that is overall how you should think about it. When we took our spend back from 7%, 7.5% down to 6% there were two key places that the spends really came out of, one was we did start gaining some efficiencies as we started developing some of our creative in-house and also some media efficiencies from very strengthen targeting capabilities. And then we also cut back on some of the smaller emerging brands where we believe that frankly we were over investing beyond what we should. As you look at where we are now and the reinstatement of spend, you will certainly see that in terms of strength behind the core brands, but then also really tapping into unleash some of our smaller brands like a ROLO, HEATH bands that have been around forever, brands that are very stable and with a slight amount of increase in advertising we can drive some significant growth. So that is I would say where the biggest priorities of reinvestment has been. Michael Lavery : Just when you talk about some of the cuts on emerging brands, could you give any examples of what those might have been? Michele Buck : Yes, I would say, let\u2019s say KRAVE would be an example, some of the emerging brands that we have in our Amplify portfolio. Some of our snack mixes that were in the warehouse isle under the Reese or Hershey trademark, things like that. Michael Lavery : That is helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : We will now got to with Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Kenneth Zaslow : Hey, good morning, everyone. Michele Buck : Hi Ken. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. Kenneth Zaslow : Just a one follow-up question here. On the thin platforms can you talk about how broad that could be to other products, how big you think that could be. It just seems like that is something very similar to the expansion of other products that you have and other real opportunity that this can actually become a bigger product offerings. Can you talk about that? Michele Buck : Yes, absolutely. So, we feel great, first of all about Reese\u2019s performance in the marketplace, it is on-track with our expectations, we are seeing signs of sustainability and incrementality. So certainly we always look as we develop innovation to see if there is an opportunity to develop the platform and certainly this does feel like one that could cut across multiple brands and that certainly an opportunity that we are evaluating? Kenneth Zaslow : How big do you think the platforms can be, can you put any like parameters around it about which brands it can go to? It just seems like there is a lot that can be happening with this. Can you kind of put some parameters to it and I will leave it there? Michele Buck : Yes, I mean, I think there are multiple brands that can go to, I think what we always try and focus on with our platform is not spreading it too far. But having it focused on a couple brands where it really makes the most sense. And clearly, if you look at the history of how we have built other platforms in the past and just beside the brands, Reese given its size, will definitely be the largest of opportunities, but I do believe that there can be growth beyond that. Kenneth Zaslow : Great. Thank you. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. I would like now to turn the call back to our speakers for any additional remarks. Melissa Poole : Hey thanks so much for joining us this morning. The team will be available today and all of next week for any follow-up questions you may have. Thanks so much. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at anytime.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Melissa Poole, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Melissa Poole : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for The Hershey Company's fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call and webcast. Michele Buck, Chairman of the Board, President and CEO; and Steve Voskuil, Senior Vice President and CFO, will provide you with an overview of our results, followed by a Q&A session. Before we begin, please remember that during the course of this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meanings of the Federal Securities Laws. These statements are based on our current expectations, and involve risks and uncertainties that could differ materially from actual events and those described in these forward-looking statements contained in our 2018 10-K filed with the SEC and today's press release. Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe will provide useful information for investors. The presentation of this information does not intend to be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to today's press release for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Michele. Michele Buck : Thanks, Melissa. Good morning to all of you on the phone and webcast. We had a strong 2019, with accelerated business performance and differentiated financial results. This was driven by momentum in our core U.S. confection portfolio in both retail takeaway and margin expansion, like incremental and profitable international growth, and by further expansion of our snacking portfolio, and we continue to invest in our brands, capabilities, and people. I would like to extend a sincere thank you to our employees and all of our partners for their hard work to make this possible. For the full-year, we delivered net sales growth of 2.5% and EPS growth of 7.8%, a testament to our strong brands, business model, and a commitment to balance top and bottom line growth. Constant currency organic sales growth of 1.8% was ahead of expectations, driven by incremental pricing and core base strengths of our U.S. confection business. These gains drove stronger than anticipated gross margin expansion of over 100 basis points for the year, which enabled incremental investments in our brands and employees, and enhanced earnings for our shareholders. We're pleased with the consistency of our results throughout the year, and the momentum we're taking into 2020. In the fourth quarter, net sales grew 4% behind 1.9% organic constant currency growth, and our gross margin expanded 96 basis points. For the full-year, our Hershey Candy Mint and Gum retail sales increased 2.6% resulting in a category share gain of approximately 10 basis points. While a long Easter contributed to this performance, we also finished the year strong with retail sales growth of 2.8%, and a category share gain of approximately 20 basis points in the fourth quarter. As was the case with the entire year, this growth was driven by balanced activation across the portfolio, and we are seeing the benefits from our investment in marketing spending carrying through to retail performance. Our Reese's brand continue to outperform the market with growth of over 6% in the fourth quarter, driven by great advertising, innovation, and strong in-store execution. Kit Kat grew 2.3% in Q4 behind incremental capacity, and our new Kit Kat Duos innovation, which launched late last year. Early results of this innovation are encouraging, and we expect continued momentum on this brand in 2020. Our media and packaging investments on our mid-tier iconic brands also drove strong growth with Payday up over 8%, Almond Joy up 6%, Rolo up 5%, and Heath up 35% in the quarter, resulting in a combined share gain of 20 basis points. Pricing remained an important lever for us in the fourth quarter. Net price realization of approximately four points in Q4 was slightly ahead of expectations as we began to see a benefit from our most recent price increase announced in July of 2019, and we expect this to continue in 2020 with planned price realization of 2 to 2.5 points on our U.S. confection business in the U.S. for the year. As we look at 2020, we have another great year of activations planned within our confection business. In just a couple of days, for the first time in brand history, Reese's will be running an advertisement during the 2020 Super Bowl. This will be a great opportunity for America's number one confectionery brand to increase awareness of one of its best tasting, highest consumer rated items in the portfolio, Take 5. As we had shared with you last year, our re-launch of this item is off to a strong start, and we're excited to build on this with an ad during America's most watched sporting event and additional in-store merchandising and distribution. We're also excited about our product innovation for 2020. In addition to our Kit Kat Duos innovation, we are excited to announce the expansion of our THiNS platform in 2020. York THiNS and Reese's white THiNS will launch in March, and will be available in both the take-home bag and peg formats. This provides York lovers a unique way to enjoy one of their favorites, and it enables us to secure strong year to merchandising for our core milk and dark Reese's items that we've launched this past year. Our snacking portfolio also delivered solid growth in the fourth quarter. SkinnyPop ready-to-eat popcorn retail sales grew over 13%, resulting in a category share gain of 170 basis points. And as expected, Pirate's Booty performance accelerated as we began to recapture distribution lost earlier in the year, and had strong promotional activity behind our on-pack Disney promotion. Retail sales grew 1.4% in the fourth quarter, and over 4% in December. Our most recent acquisition One Brand grew 35% in traditional measured channels with additional strength in non-measured channels such as e-commerce. Now, for an update on our international markets, we have made significant progress over the past several years by focusing on branded high margin products, streamlining our operating model and right-sizing our investments. Since we began this journey at the beginning of 2017, we have increased our segment income by $125 million over the past three years, while continuing to grow our organic constant currency net sales. This is a significant accomplishment made possible by the hard work and dedication of many employees around the world. A sincere thank you to everyone who helped drive this business transformation and financial performance. Our international business provides us with important geographic diversification and incremental growth, and we're excited to build on this progress with another year of profitable growth in 2020. In Mexico, we will continue to focus on increased distribution and innovation on our Hershey and Pelon Pelo Rico brand. After strong test results last year, we will be launching a new business model more broadly in 2020 aimed at securing incremental and profitable distribution in traditional trading. Additionally, we will continue to innovate with new flavors and packaging to drive growth in our existing channels. In Brazil, despite a continued heightened competitive environment, we delivered profitable growth in the fourth quarter. Our Dark Chocolate Hershey's portfolio has performed very well, and we're excited to bring new innovation within that platform to market in 2020. Additionally, we're focused on growth in non-traditional retail channels, and we're expanding a successful 2019 test to more regions this year. In India, our National Kisses launch remained on track, and we are leveraging important learnings from our regional launch last year to further optimize the proposition as we expand in 2020. We continue to see this market as a strategic growth vector for our business. In China, we had a strong finish to the year, and we plan to build upon last year's successful flavors of life promotion with new varieties in 2020. Due to the timing of Chinese New Year in 2020 and 2021, we expect 2020 shipments to be slightly pressured, but we continue to feel good about our in-store activations and our base business momentum. In summary, we're pleased with our performance, and believe we will deliver another year of high-quality financial results in 2020. We're proud of what we have accomplished and the momentum we're seeing on the business, but we also recognized we must continue to adapt and invest to elevate the business further. Over the past several years, we've invested in incremental capacity and planning capabilities. I'm pleased by the progress that we've made here, and the opportunities that this has unlocked for us. In 2019, we delivered our best case fill rate in a decade, and saw meaningful increases in our Advantage Survey rankings. Since 2017, our supply chain ranking with our customers advanced from number 15 to number four, and our customer service is now ranked number one amongst our peers up from number 12 just three years ago. We will build on this with additional investment in our supply chain capabilities over the next several years. As a part of a multi-year capital project, we will add additional capacity for our largest and fastest-growing brand, build agile fulfillment and late-stage customization capabilities, and invest in new data and technology within our supply chain that increases visibility, automation, and digitalization. We believe these investments will enable us to respond to changing needs from both our consumers and customers, while maintaining our advantage margin profile. We look forward to sharing more details about this at our Investor Day in March. In addition to investing to advance our business capabilities, we're also very focused on elevating our talent and culture. In December, I announced several organization changes that I believe will enable us to take our business to the next level. Chuck Raup has been promoted to President at U.S. Chuck is a proven, results-driven, commercial operator with a successful 10-year track record at Hershey, most recently leading the acceleration of our U.S. CMG business. Chuck's deep expertise across snacking, having led all areas of confection at Hershey, and from his previous experience at Craft will be instrumental to our future success as we pursue our strong growth ambition across traditional and digital channels. Kristen Riggs has been promoted to Chief Growth Officer. Kristen started with the company more than 14 years ago, and has worked across nearly all commercial functions. Her focus on driving growth is underpinned by a strategic and analytical understanding of the modern consumer, strong marketing expertise, and tenacity for creating positive change in the organization. Together, the U.S. business and growth office will work seamlessly to ensure the delivery of both 2020 and our growth plan over the next several years. And finally, Chris Scalia has been promoted to Chief Human Resources Officer. Chris joined Hershey in our legal department in 2005, and transitioned to human resources in 2011. Since that time, Chris has led talent management, recruiting, HR operations, and business partner teams as well as workforce development. Chris brings a strong commercial business acumen and analytical rigor to talent planning and development, and a passion to help people and culture drive performance. These changes are a testament to Hershey's talent development succession planning, and I couldn't be more excited about the opportunities ahead with this tremendous talent across the organization. Thank you to Todd, Mary Beth, Kevin, and Terry, for all their contributions to our success over the past several years. I'll now turn it over to Steve, who will provide you with details on our financial results. Steve. Steve Voskuil : Thank you, Michele, and good morning, everyone. It was a strong year and quarter and we are pleased with the quality of delivery across our segments. North America achieved net price realization and operating leverage, enabling incremental investment in brands and capabilities throughout the year. We saw consistent solid retail takeaways on our core confectionery brands in the U.S. and our international business delivered another year of incremental profitable growth. We feel good about the momentum we have heading into 2020 to deliver in on algorism year for both top and bottom line. Fourth quarter net sales increased 4% to $2.1 billion versus the same period last year, with a slight headwind from foreign currency exchange. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures contributed 220 basis points of growth. Organic, constant currency net sales growth of 1.9% was consistent with expectations and driven by price realization in the U.S. and volume growth in our international markets. Net price realization for the quarter was 360 basis points partially offset by anticipated elasticity-driven volume declines of 170 basis points. Adjusted earnings per share diluted were $1 28 for the quarter, an increase of 1.6% versus the same period last year. This was driven by gross margin gains, which were more than offset by increased incentive compensation. For the full-year, net sales increased 2.5%. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures was a one-point benefit. Organic constant currency net sales growth of 1.8% was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange of 30 basis points. The delivery of our net sales and gross margin expansion plans allowed for investment in brands capabilities and our employees to drive future growth. This translated to adjusted earnings per share for the full-year of $5.78 cents, an increase of 7.8% versus prior year. In the fourth quarter, our North America segment net sales increased 3.8% versus the same period last year. The net benefit of acquisitions was 250 basis points. Organic net sales of 1.3% was driven by price realization of 400 basis points partially offset by elasticity-driven volume declines of 270 basis points. Recall, in the third quarter, price realization was approximately one point lower than expectations due to the timing related to our July 2019 announced price increase as anticipated, this headwind reversed in the fourth quarter. Without this timing shift, price realization was approximately 300 basis points, about 50 basis points ahead of expectations as we began to get a slight benefit from our most recent price increase. This incremental pricing contributed to stronger than anticipated gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter. Adjusted gross margins in North America expanded 130 basis points versus prior year. This was driven by net price realization and favorable commodities, which were partially offset by increased logistics and packaging costs consistent with other quarters. North America advertising and related consumers marketing spend increased 5.1% in the quarter driven by planned advertising increases enabled by our gross margin expansion. Fourth quarter international and other segments net sales increased 5.8% versus the year ago period. Constant currency net sales grew 6.3% offset by a 50-basis point headwind from foreign currency exchange. Volume was a 5.7-point benefit and net price realization contributed 60 basis points to net sales growth; combined organic constant currency sales, net sales in Mexico, Brazil, India, and China grew 6% versus the fourth quarter of 2018 with growth in all markets. International and other advertising and related consumer marketing decreased 11% versus prior year as we continue to optimize investment in these focus markets. Now turning to gross margin, adjusted gross profit of $898 million in the fourth quarter increased 6.4% versus prior year. This resulted in adjusted gross margin of 43.4%, an increase of nearly 100 basis points driven by net price realization and favorable commodities. Fourth quarter adjusted operating profit of $370 million resulted in operating profit margin of 17.9%, a decrease of 70 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2018. Gross margin gains were more than offset by higher incentive compensation. This incentive increase was related to a strong 2019 performance, and a structural market-based increase of variable compensation linked to company performance for our managers and individual contributors. This increase was planned to occur gradually over the coming years. However, our strong performance in 2019 allowed us to accelerate this change, which we believe is important for retaining and securing top talent in our organization. As you saw in our press release reported operating profit in the fourth quarter declined $135 million versus the prior year period, driven by the recognition of a long-lived and intangible asset impairment loss associated with our 2015 acquisition of KRAVE. While meat snacks remain a growing category, volume has been driven by mainstream and value brands. The Premium segment slowed, and became even more competitive, which pressured sales and margins. While disappointing, this acquisition was an important step to beginning to diversify our portfolio in the U.S. And we have leveraged the learning to improve the propositions and performance on our more recent acquisitions. Moving down to P&L, interest expense of $37 million was in line with the prior year period. Full-year interest expense was $144 million in increase of $5.3 million versus 2018 due to increase debt associated with acquisitions. The adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 9.8% versus 9.5% in the year ago period. This rate was favorable versus our expectations due to the execution of additional tax credits. For the full-year 2019, the adjusted tax was 17.4% versus 19.2% in the year ago period. This full-year favorability was driven by excess tax benefits from stock based compensation and valuation allowance releases in our international markets. In the fourth quarter other expense with $34 million, a decrease of $5.1 million versus the year ago period, driven by non-service related pension expense. For the fourth quarter of 2019, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately $210.5 million, reflecting a slight decrease versus the prior quarter. The company did not repurchase any shares in the fourth quarter against our July 2018 $500 million authorization, and $410 million remain. Total capital additions including software were $82 million in the fourth quarter, totaling $318 million for the full-year 2019. This was slightly below expectations, as some of our IS initiatives were delayed due to employee resource constraints related to our large ERP and supply chain projects. We continue to return cash to our shareholders with fourth quarter dividends of $157 million. This was our 365th consecutive quarterly dividend on the common stock. We have solid underlying momentum in our core business that we believe positions as well to keep the momentum going in 2020. We expect full-year net sales growth of two to 4% consistent with our long-term algorithm. This includes an approximate one point benefit from the acquisition of ONE brand. We anticipate our growth in North America will accelerate versus 2019 as we lap our SKU rationalization program. While we continue to expect profitable growth in our international markets, we expect the contribution will be lower than 2019 due to less favorable macroeconomic conditions impacting the confectionery category growth. Like 2019, we expect our North America growth to be driven by pricing while our international growth is expected to be more volume-driven. We expect gross margins to expand again in 2020, but at a slower pace than 2019. While we plan to benefit from slightly more price realization, commodities will change from being a tailwind in 2019 to a headwind in 2020. As a result, we expect the adjusted gross margins to expand 40 to 50 basis points. As was the case in 2019, we will leverage this pricing and growth margin expansion to lead into investments in our brands and capabilities. We expect advertising to grow slightly ahead of sales this year, and will continue to invest in data, technology and other initiatives to drive sustainable profitable growth in the future. We expect 2020 interest expense to be relatively in line with 2019, and other expense to increase 30 to $40 million versus 2019. As we plan to execute additional tax credits. As a result of these higher tax credit investments, we expect our 2019 adjusted tax rate to be between 16% and 17%. The net impact of investment tax credits and our adjusted tax rate is unfavorable versus 2019 as we lapped the one-time benefit of valuation allowance releases. For 2020, we expect elevated CapEx spending as we advance our ERP transition and initiate a strategic supply chain program. As Michele mentioned, this multi-year capital project will not only add capacity, but also give us new fulfillment and technology capabilities that we believe will help us deliver on the needs of our consumers and customers while maintaining and advantaged market profile. Given the significant investments, our CapEx for 2020 is estimated to be between $475 million and $525 million. Our core business sales growth and another year of gross margin expansion are expected to deliver full-year adjusted earnings per share growth of 6% to 8% consistent with our long-term algorithm. Given some of the timing of this year's key initiatives, as well as events we are lapping from prior year, we do expect second-half financial performance to be stronger than the first-half, while we have more pricing in the first-half, and are lapping our SKU rationalization program, we're also lapping a strong Easter pipeline still associated with our package and candy transition tax strategies that resulted in a low first-half 2019 rate and second quarter margin benefits associated with our July 2019 price increase. Similar to 2019, while these factors create some volatility in our quarterly financial results, we expect retail performance to be more consistent throughout the year and remain confident in our ability to achieve our full-year guidance. We remain focused on delivering balanced growth with a disciplined approach to building our brands and evolving our business model for the future. We have strong cash flow and a healthy balance sheet and we'll continue to make the necessary investments to drive the business and deliver long-term shareholder value. That concludes my financial discussion, and I'll now turn it back to Michele. Michele Buck : Thanks, Steve. I'm proud of what we have delivered over the past several years, and I'm optimistic about 2020 and our future, we continue to operate with a healthy level of dissatisfaction and constantly push ourselves to elevate the business even further. We are excited about the opportunities ahead, and we look forward to sharing more details about our strategic plans in March. Steve, Melissa and I are now available to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Lazar : Good morning, everybody. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. Michele Buck : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Lazar : Hi, there. So, two things for me; first, as we think about some of the various pieces that drove the fourth quarter unallocated corporate, maybe can you give us a sense or help quantify a bit, you know, how much sort of is expected to stay in the base as we go through 2020, and how much of any sort of reverses out and perhaps helps to become a bit of a tailwind to 2020 operating income? And second, I know it's a smaller business, Michele, but your comments on a new business model in Mexico just peaked my interest, I think you were talking about a new model to gain some incremental distribution, I didn't know if that was something along the lines of more of like a partnership or perhaps you can expand a little bit on that, and that's it. Thank you Michele Buck : Andrew, why don't I take that one first, because I think that's a quick one, which is really the focus there in Mexico is a new model to capture traditional trade. So, it is not anything beyond that, but really it's a focus to go after that traditional trade business. Andrew Lazar : Got it. Steve Voskuil : And just picking up on the on the compensation and what stays and goes just in the fourth quarter really had three things that rolled in, one was if you look year-over-year, there was a re-based impact on incentives, the prior year period had below target performance and payout. So, in the fourth quarter, you sort of catch up to target. We had then a predicted over-target performance, and then the market adjustment that we talked about, and clearly as we roll into 2020 that one-time market based adjustment will go away, and so will the performance will reset at a target level. So, roughly 50% of that increase will stay going forward, and about half of that will go away. Andrew Lazar : Great, thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Robert Moskow : Hi. The results are pretty much in line with what we'd expected, maybe incentive comp is a little higher than we thought, but -- so I was just going to jump into CapEx, the CapEx spend is a big step up. You mentioned it's related to the ERP and supply chain program. Are there any expenses that run to the income statement related to this step up in your ERP program, or is this really just a kind of a CapEx kind of effort, and also what steps are you taking if any if you need to mitigate customer service issues? Thanks. Steve Voskuil : Sure. The ERP program has been going for a number of years, and so, you're right, there's a portion of that CapEx step up in 2020 is due to the ERP program continuing. There is a portion that hits the P&L. Year-over-year for '20 it's not a material factor, and it's obviously factored into our guidance. As we get to the March Investor Conference, as Michele said, we'll talk more about the supply chain project, and probably also talk more about the next couple of steps that we expect on the ERP program, but for 2020, it's fully reflected from both OpEx and CapEx. Michele Buck : And we have a big focus on change management to the end of your question relative to really managing the risks and business continuity during that period of time, and we can talk a bit more about that in March. Robert Moskow : Okay. Well, I'll wait till March then. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Ken Goldman : Hi, good morning. Thank you. Michele Buck : Good morning, Ken. Ken Goldman : Hi. First the increase in CapEx, does that change your outlook at least in the short-term on M&A? I know most of the M&A you've been doing is relatively, I guess, tack on in nature. So, my guess is probably you'll stay opportunistic, but I'm just curious for your thoughts there. And then my second question is, thank you for the guidance on the gross margin outlook, I guess, in that guidance, are you assuming any incremental pricing action, whether it's list prices, whether it's reduced promos or pack size changes, things like that, or is it just sort of status quo and you have all the pricing actions that you need already baked into hit that gross margin number? I'm asking because obviously, cocoa has gone up a little bit, and I know your heads there and so forth, but just curious. Steve Voskuil : Maybe I'll take the first part of that question relative to thinking about M&A relative to the additional CapEx. So clearly, it has an impact on free cash flow. Our capital allocation priorities aren't changing. You know, we continue to look first and foremost at funding, both organic and inorganic growth, protecting the dividend and obviously watching overall leverage. I would say as we sit here today, we have with the incremental CapEx investment we're not pulling back, are looking for potential inorganic opportunities as they come available, we'll always do that with an eye towards leverage and the value proposition for shareholders. I would say no change in our posture from that perspective. On the gross margin side, we don't comment about specific pricing actions that we might have planned for the coming year. We can say price continues to be a strategic part of our repertoire of tools to use along with all the other components. So, anything you want to add to that, Michele? Michele Buck : Yes. I would just say, I mean, overall, we are expecting price in that 2% to 2.5% range for the year in North America, and our gross margin guidance is consistent with that being a part of it. Ken Goldman : Great, thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Alexia Howard : Good morning, everyone. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. Alexia Howard : So, it seems as though the core business is chugging along, you've got the modest price increases rolling through each year. In terms of the future business development, acquisition strategy from here, can you talk a little bit about what the key learnings have been from what's worked with SkinnyPop Popcorn, and what seems to be improving with Pirate's Booty, and maybe some of the things that didn't work so well with KRAVE and Brookside? And then also maybe just talk about what your priorities are for it from here, is it going to remain within salty snacks in the U.S., are you thinking about more overseas acquisitions, what's the priority list from here? Thank you very much, and I'll pass it on. Michele Buck : Sure. So, let's start with our overall strategy, which is about capturing incremental snacking occasions, and if you look within that, certainly the number one priority is in categories outside of sweet indulgence in the U.S. So, both salty snacks savory as well as we recently bought the ONE brands nutrition bar. So, I'd say it's largely about better for you in savory in the U.S., not to say that we will not move forward with something in confection if there's a gap in our portfolio we will, and we would entertain international acquisition, but our bar is much higher given the risk levels of that business, and obviously, given we don't have scale internationally the businesses that makes sense for us are just a bit different than in the U.S. Relative to our key learnings, I would say, probably the first and biggest learning is that is around selection of assets, that is, we are a branded high gross margin company that is -- those are the kinds of brands we're used to growing and building. SkinnyPop and Pirate's Booty fit right in that sweet spot on both of those elements, and I think especially if we're going into a newer category or segment within snacking. KRAVE in particular was an acquisition that did not meet either of those relative to adequate scale nor adequate gross margin. So, I think that's the single biggest learning was that piece of what fits our business model and staying true to that, and then certainly along the way, I think we learned other things relative to integration and how to get the best of both leveraging our scale as well as enabling some of the entrepreneurial spirit, but realizing the businesses we're buying are in a phase of scaling up in growth and there's help needed to do that. Alexia Howard : Great, thank you very much. I'll pass it on. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jason English : Hey, good morning, folks. Thank you for citing me in and happy belated New Year. Michele Buck : Thank you. Jason English : You're welcome. I want to come back real quick on the CapEx piece because it's a surprisingly large number. And it sounds like we'll get more detail on where that spends coming at the Analyst Day, but given that you're spending a lot more into supply chain and you explain at the same time that your prior margin for growth productivity savings are poised to step-down. Is it unreasonable to think that we should expect a larger or some sort of news around renew productivity goals over the next couple of years? Steve Voskuil : Yes, we're not announcing today any renewed productivity goals, I would say productivity is and will remain a key part of our algorithm inside the P&L. You're right last couple of years with margin for growth that probably had higher than historically typical productivity. 2020 is down a little bit from that as that kind of peak of that program passes. And we will do as we always do, kind of continue to look for additional productivity opportunities and some of the improvements coming in terms of fulfillment with the supply chain investment will actually set the future for some more as we go forward. Michele Buck : Yes, little bit additional context. In the past, we did big supply chain projects and those tended to be much more focused on utilization of capacity and also margin enhancement. This supply chain project is very much focused on enabling growth and doing so by providing increased flexibility and customization capabilities that will then allow us to meet consumer and customer needs while maintaining the advantage margin structure that we have. Jason English : Thank you. That's good context. I understand a little bit better. I appreciate that. Switching gears real quick to the growth side, so new capabilities help drive growth, but from a volumetric perspective, there's not a lot of growth right now in at least in your North American portfolio, and I know there's some elasticity components there, but how should we think about the growth trajectory for both the category and your portfolio as we track through the next 12, 24 months? Michele Buck : So first of all, we think both volume and price are important to our long-term algorithm. During the years where we have pricing, those years will be much more pricing driven than volume driven. And we do a lot of hard work on our programming to keep our volumes flat during that time. Otherwise, according to the models, we'd actually decline in volume. So we're pleased that we've been able to do that. But over the years, you'll see a bit of both. And as we look at the actual growth outlook, we continue to think that the CMG category is going to grow at that 1.5% to 2% type of range. We believe in 2020, that it will be at the higher end of that range given the pricing in the marketplace, but we believe it will not be as high as 2019, which also had the additional benefit of a long Easter and we look to grow in line or slightly above the category growth rate. Jason English : Got it, okay, Thanks a lot. I'll see you in Florida. Michele Buck : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Strycula with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Steven Strycula : Hi, good morning. Just piggyback off of Jason's question on organic sales for the year, how should we think about maybe how the China and Brazil macro situations really kind of play into how you think about the international business, I know it's a smaller part and then on the U.S. front, anything to comment on Snap and how that any potential developments in legislation might potentially impact that business as you think forward? Thank you. Michele Buck : Yes, so certainly we have seen macro economic softness in several of the developing markets in which we participate. As we developed our plans for the year, we tried to take that into account as other factors that were known at the time, clearly the coronavirus would be the one unknown that really we didn't have visibility to at the time, and we are tracking that carefully. We do anticipate that will have an impact on our business in China. But as you know, we're a predominantly North American based company. So not as big an impact as we may see from some others, and we are carefully tracking, and always do kind of what happens with Snap at this point in time; we have not built in nor anticipate something significant there, but we'll keep a close eye on that. Steven Strycula : As a quick follow-up to that, Michele, I appreciate the color for China, as you think about it being a potential impact as you noted, is it more from a manufacturing standpoint that facilities or maybe offline until maybe the beginning of February, as is the case for the industry, or is it more just an early indication that depletion rates in the retail channel are already starting to come in a little bit as travel slows, any color there would be helpful. Thank you. Michele Buck : Yes, I would say it's more the latter which is our business tends to have a seasonal skew around Chinese New Year, we sold in our volume and now consumers are not able to go to retail and so we're trying to carefully watch what's the take away will be and any waste implications from the fact that that portfolio is seasonal in nature. So that's the biggest hit for us. Steven Strycula : All right, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Feeney with Consumer Edge. Please proceed with your question. Jon Feeney : Good morning, thanks very much. A couple of detailed question first and then a real question. The detail question is on looking at your takeaway data you gave us, so 28 on Candy Mint and Gum or 11.3 on salty snacks, 2.5 overall, is it like last quarter where all that gap is that all KRAVE that were kind of flushing out of the system is my first question that because it would seem to me it'd be something like in the threes overall if that was the case. And second question, real question is, it seems like pricing works a lot better than it used to, and it's worked fantastically at times in the past decade. But it seems like you get it, you see less elasticity, you grow gross margin like, is there something just new under the sun here where you have better capabilities, and you can just price more tactically going forward than used to be, if any detail on that, I'd appreciate it. Michele Buck : Okay. So relative to your first question, you're right that there are some of the smaller emerging brands like KRAVE that are a drag to our total consumption. The other piece is our grocery business, which is comprised primarily of syrup and baking chips. Syrup tends to be a pretty stable business. But baking chips has big promotional windows, and it's very competitive. So, we always have decisions to make relative to which pieces of business to go for at which just don't have the profit margins that we're interested in. And so we passed on some less profitable business this year. And that was a drag in our total retail takeaway. Relative to pricing, I would say we think about the impact as being pretty consistent with what we've seen over the years that we've always had a pretty solid ability to leverage price, and we believe that's only though because of all of the investments that we make with retailers in retail specific programs. The high level of advertising we put behind our brands that creates the brand value proposition for the consumer then it enables that. So but we see basically the elasticity is being somewhat in line with what we've seen historically. Jon Feeney : Well, it works whatever it does. Thank you. Michele Buck : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. John Baumgartner : Good morning. Thanks for the question. Michele Buck : Good morning, John. John Baumgartner : I guess, Michele or Steve, I just like to hear a bit more about the operating leverage, given the importance of that to the P&L. We've seen plant closures over the years you've had the modernization in Hershey. Now there's talk about, I guess, the smart plants. So as you exit the margin for growth, how do you think about leverage from here, I mean how large of the contributor will manufacturing be given the increases in capacity, flattish category growth relative to leverage from SG&A at this point and a lot of moving pieces, just trying to get a sense for the factors and how it materializes? Michele Buck : Steve, you want to take that? Steve Voskuil : Driving operating leverage over time is going to continue to be a key part of the algorithm. And so, all of these investments whether we're talking in the manufacturing area or some of the capability investments, all are with an eye towards driving a return over time and ultimately driving leverage of itself. Some of the investments in digital and data, all have a business case around leverage at the end, and so as we've done in the past, as margin for growth wraps up, we will kind of that Michele said in the past go right back through the P&L and attack each one of those to continue to drive sustainable leverage. Anything to add there, Michele? Michele Buck : Nope. John Baumgartner : Okay. And just as a follow-up there. Based on the guidance, it looks as though non-advertising SM&A for 2020 should increase a fair amount year-on-year. Are there any particular callouts there in terms of the plan, whether it's in-store programming, your sales force feed on the street or anything else worth note that we should think about here? Michele Buck : Our data and technology investments do fall in that line. So investments around ERP, investments more broadly around data and technology when it comes to analytics and how we evaluate the business, new data sources, et cetera filling up buckets, that's a significant piece. John Baumgartner : Okay. Michele and Steve, thanks for the time. Steve Voskuil : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Rob Dickerson : Great, thank you. I guess first question, Michele is just, given the amount of investment, you deployed over the past two, three years to now, speaking to the next two to three years, to become more efficient. With that in mind, as we see brand support increase, I feel like at least, usually that brand support goes to larger brands, right, just higher margins that are leverage overall. But you've also acquired a number of smaller companies that are faster growth, smaller with faster growth, on trend, et cetera. So, like, when you step back and say, okay, we kind of, let's say, we've kind of gotten through the first part of kind of our investment overall supply chain ERP, now we have further investment, like should we be expecting, increased innovation in the marketplace on brands like Skinny and Pirate's Booty and One, and I just asked because, you seem to be kind of the on-trend growth to your brands, not as big, but there's a lot of potential there, and I feel like we just haven't seen a tremendous amount of new innovation come out of those brands so far post acquisition? Steve Voskuil : Yes. That's a great question. I would tell you that overall, as we look at growing a business, we do really believe in balanced -- the balance levers we've spoken with you all about relative to distribution, advertising that can drive base velocities, seasonal presents, pricing et cetera, and so, we believe all those levers are important, but at different phases and different brands lives, different of those levers are more important. So, with brands like SkinnyPop and Pirate's in particular, we want to make really sure that we take full advantage of driving the cores on those businesses because they were not at max distribution capacity for what they deserve, given their velocity levels. So, making sure that we continue to focus on that core distribution and also that we advertise to maximize household penetration, so there are many brands and confections where we have 40% household penetration, and it's significantly less on the brands like Pirate's or Skinny. So it's intentional that we first focus on the core, and that we judiciously add innovation. And we did do that with some seasonal items and some items, the right flavor profiles, but we think that's a key learning from the past is to be very measured in the innovation approach. We learned that on some of our early acquisition models focus enough on the core. Rob Dickerson : Okay, fair. And then, just a quick follow-up, I guess what's implied with further capital spends, especially in 2020 on the CapEx side and overall investment, I'm assuming, as leader of a company, right, the expectation is that this does build efficiency obviously. So, essentially, hopefully de-risk further acquisitions, even a smaller in scale. So, basically KRAVE doesn't happen again? Steve Voskuil : Yep, we're always focused on making better and better decisions and learning from every action we take in the past. So and we feel good about what we're seeing on SkinnyPop and Pirate's in particular and One is on track integration and acquisition model wise as well. Rob Dickerson : Okay. Super. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. David Palmer : Great. Good morning. Michele Buck : Good morning. David Palmer : In recent years, Hershey has been smarter about pricing and smoothing out the price increases in any one year and you've been hitting different parts of the portfolio and using weight outs and new packaging, but volume is still down, it's down this last quarter and wondering how you're thinking about pricing power levers that you might have up your sleeve. Should we get into a inflationary environment particularly with cocoa into '21 that looks like it's shaping up to be. In other words, do you do you think you could defend that 45% type gross margin should we get an outsize lumpiness in inflation? Michele Buck : So, of course, we can't really talk about the future pricing actions, but we can talk a little bit about what we're seeing in commodities and cocoa pricing and how we're thinking about how that flows through the P&L. I think if we take a little bit of a step back and talk a bit about that, and Steve and I'll kind of tag team this. So we are very focused on watching cocoas commodity, because it's critically important for us, we do know it's a headwind as we go into next year, and that headwind is built into the guidance that we've given you. So, every year going forward, we focus on the right combinations of programs, which include hedging, which includes sometimes deciding to price, which include making tradeoffs across the P&L to really accommodate whatever's happening in cocoa pricing. We do have pretty strong visibility going forward, so we have a chance to plan around that. And Steve, do you want to talk a bit more about that? Steven Voskuil : Yes, I would say, as Michele said, we have good visibility in 2020. As you point out, David, if things like the lid and some of the pressure on cocoa remain into 2021, you know, that puts some pressure for sure from a commodity standpoint into the P&L. That said, between pricing levers, productivity levers and others, we will use our toolbox to work to continue to drive leverage through gross margin as we go forward. The bar will be tougher, depending on how that cocoa pricing shapes up as we get to the back part of 2020 and into 2021, and we'll have more visibility into that as the year progresses. Michele Buck : It's certainly something that's been volatile over time. So I think we have experienced managing that volatility. David Palmer : That's very helpful. And just a real small one, that the re-launch of Take 5 as you said, at the Super Bowl, that's an interesting move, it's only in the measured channel looks like it's about half-percent of your channel mix. So, it's not a huge trademark, but there's probably something you see in that that's making you think there's an opportunity there. So, may be a couple of comments about why you think that is? Thank you. Michele Buck : Sure. So Take 5 has the highest repeat purchase of any competitive innovation, and has one of the highest repeat purchases of many of the great brands we've seen over time. It lacks the awareness and trial, and so we began re-launching that brand putting it under the Reese's trademark because that is one key way to drive trial, it has great Reese's peanut butter on it, but that's where a placement like Super Bowl can tend to really help you, which is it garners a lot of awareness and trial and eyeballs, and we think that that will be really helpful for us as part of our overall marketing plan behind Take 5. So, we look at Take 5 as -- I look at it as one of our great innovations for the year. We know it's a great product, and we'll have consumers get a chance to try it for themselves. David Palmer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Melissa Poole for any closing remarks. Melissa Poole : Thanks for joining us this morning. We will be available for the rest of the day if you have additional questions. Please feel free to reach out. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.",

Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. I hope, first of all, that you and your loved ones are safe and healthy. We are all experiencing an unparalleled and rapidly evolving global pandemic. Our thoughts go out to those that have been impacted and we'd like to extend our sincere thank you to all of the heroes working to keep people safe during this difficult time. As you all know, food companies play an important role during this crisis, helping to ensure a steady food supply and supporting local economy. We recognized that Hershey is not only a food manufacturer, but also an important link in the broader food supply chain, particularly with farmers and other raw material suppliers that rely on us. I could not be more proud of The Hershey team and how they are responding to this situation, first and foremost, with the care and support they are showing for each other, their families, partners, and communities. But also with their relentless energy and passion to continue to safely operate with excellence. I'd like to extend a heartfelt thank you to all of them, especially to those in our manufacturing plants and those working at retail to make moments of goodness for our consumers during these difficult times. The situation continues to evolve so rapidly that it's difficult to predict the future with much certainty. While comparisons can certainly be drawn to weather related disruptions or natural disasters or recessions, the reality is that we have never seen so many factors at play at the same time on such a global scale. But we are committed to being transparent about what we are seeing in the marketplace and what we are doing to respond. We will continue to be forthcoming as we navigate this uncharted territory and we believe we will have more visibility in the coming months as the situation stabilizes. Let me start by saying pre-COVID-19, our business was on track versus our expectations, both in Q1 and our outlook for the full year. Now, let me share some details around what we are doing from an operations perspective, before I discuss what we are seeing in terms of consumer behavior. The health and safety of our Hershey team remains paramount in our decision-making and action. Food safety has always been at the center of our day-to-day operations, and that will continue. As the pandemic spreads, we are monitoring the changing environment daily and we are adapting as the situation evolves. We've put in place more stringent operating procedures and safety protocols to help ensure the well-being of our employees, their families, and everyone with whom they interact. We are doing our best to enable social distancing and other safety and cleaning protocols across all functions. And meet our commitments to support consistent community food supplies and the needs of our retail partners. As you would expect all of our corporate and commercial employees who are able to, are working remotely. A big thank you to our IT team who have done an outstanding job making the transition to virtual work as seamless as possible. And also to our HR team for the wealth of resources, they continue to provide our employees to effectively manage work remotely. Currently, all of our manufacturing plants remain open and we continue to operate our supply chain with limited disruption. As the situation began to unfold, we built inventory in both raw materials and finished goods to mitigate risks and to help us to continue meeting demand. This proactive approach coupled with our experienced and dedicated team has enabled us to consistently deliver strong customer service levels. Our first quarter case fill rate was over 98.5% with a 99% case fill rate in March. And despite incremental marketplace challenges in April, our case fill rates remain close to 98%. Utilizing flexible scheduling, the majority of our sales reps remain in stores, partnering with our retailers to provide much needed support. This continued in-store presence, combined with our strong customer service, has driven confectionery share gains of almost 300 basis points during the past month. Our manufacturing and retail employees have shown amazing dedication and resilience and we have implemented incentives to recognize these contributions for employees who can safely work to keep our operations running. We have closed our own retail locations, including our Chocolate World Store in Hershey, Pennsylvania; Times Square, New York; and Las Vegas from most of Q2. While sales in our retail locations are relatively small in proportion to our total business, we do expect several months of closures to have an effect. In addition to our retail stores, there are several other parts of our business that are seeing an outsized impact, including our food service business and our travel retail business, both of which are seeing channel decline of 75% to 80%. And we saw a meaningful category decline in China during a key seasonal gifting window in the first quarter. Combined, these businesses represent approximately 6% of our sales. Now, let me share a little bit about what we're seeing with the consumer as it relates to our core business in the U.S. Pre-COVID-19, our business was tracking in line with expectations with retail takeaway up a little over 2% and confectionery share gains of about 20 basis points. Easter, an NCAA March Madness were sold in and merchandised in store. Our key innovation was largely in markets, including Reese's Take 5 and KitKat Duo and many of our key customers began selling our new thins items before any retail disruption occurred. Similar to many other food manufacturers, we saw a benefit from consumer stock up in March, though to a lesser degree than meal-oriented categories. This was consistent with our expectations and what we typically see with weather-related pantry loading. Total Hershey retail sales growth accelerated to 10% in March. This growth was across all classes of trade, with particular strength in food, mass, and dollar channels. We were in a great position to support this increase foot traffic and demand as we had strong merchandising and ample inventory in stores as we geared up for Easter and our NCAA promotion. We delivered a solid Easter season despite the significant disruptions we saw in both the retail environment and in consumers' lives. Recall we did expect the season to decline versus last year, given Easter was a week earlier this year. Overall, our selling was in line with expectations. Retail takeaway got off to a strong start and sell-through was pacing ahead of expectations heading into the final week. We did, however; see large changes in the macro environment during that final week. This impacted consumer trips and overall category performance and sell-through. Throughout the season, including a difficult final week, our teams executed well. We delivered retail takeaway and sell-through ahead of competition. While our sell through came in slightly below expectations, we expect minimal impact to the P&L or to retail takeaway in the coming weeks. As a reminder, confectionery retail takeaway for the beginning of April is elevated due to the earlier Easter. We anticipate takeaway in the second half of April to be pressured as a result of this shift. Please keep this in mind when you're evaluating retail trends in the next few weeks, particularly as it relates to quantifying any COVID-19 related impacts. Now, let me spend a few minutes discussing some of the changes we are seeing on our everyday performance. As I mentioned, we experienced the lift in March due to consumer stock up. Our grocery and snacks businesses in particular saw increases in both household penetration and basket size. Hershey syrup, baking chips and cocoa all grew approximately 30% during March, and trends have remained strong as families are spending more time together at home baking. Our Skinny Pop and Pirate's Booty businesses grew approximately 20% and gain share. While March trends were strong, the situation has evolved rapidly in April. As a result, we've seen shifting consumer behavior. More regions have been acted shelter-in-place guidelines. Retailers have limited the number of consumers in stores as well as operating hours. And the medical community is recommending individuals wear masks in public and limit grocery store trips unless essential. A significant number of American households are not working and experiencing meaningful financial pressures. All of this has impacted traffic into stores, length of time in stores, and the amount of discretionary goods people are purchasing. While many consumers have shared, how our categories are helping them cope during this time and bond with their families. They\u2019ve also shared how their shopping priorities have changed. Within salty snacks, DSP brands have begun to outperform due to stronger in-stock and merchandising levels. In addition, we've seen a shift to lower price per ounce offerings as many consumers experience financial constraints. As a result, Skinny Pop and Pirate's Booty have experienced share declines and softening performance over the past three to four weeks. For our confectionary business, we've seen declining sales in the convenience class of trade as trips have slowed. This represents approximately 15% of our North American sales. While we still have an opportunity to capture impulse purchases at checkout in other classes of trade, the significant changes we've seen in overall trips and basket size, over the past several weeks has limited the amount of flow back we've seen to other classes of trade. In addition, the government category has been significantly impacted by social distancing. These categories are much more functional than emotional and they've experienced declines of 40 to 50% over the past several weeks. One of these trends that I've just discussed have softened, growth in other areas of our portfolio remain strong. E-commerce growth has accelerated meaningfully, as many of you would expect and have likely observed yourselves, the number of consumers purchasing groceries online has increased significantly over the past several years. Our research indicates that 45% of consumers have used one or more online grocery options in the past four weeks, 23 points of them -- 23% of which use these services for the first time. We\u2019ve seen similar trends for confection with household penetration also doubling over the past month. Consistent with these broader trends, our overall e-commerce growth rate has accelerated significantly with growth over 120% in March versus 60% in January and February. We are seeing growth across fulfillment models and across occasions, including in our Candy Dish offering, seasonal items and our single serve items. At one retailer 80% of the full year digital sales plan was achieved in the month of March alone. In the week leading up to Easter, 43% of Easter sales at this retailer were purchased online. And at another retailer, we were able to make more Easter items available online and shift inventory to maximize sell-through as consumer behaviors changed mid-season. As we've shared in the past, profitability in this key e-commerce segment is relatively in line with total company average margins and that continues to be the case as trends have recently evolved. We believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on these trends given the strong investment and enhanced capabilities we have implemented over the past several years. Our take-home confection business such as our bags of Kisses and miniatures are growing nicely. Baking chips, cocoa and syrup are also seeing elevated growth as families spend more time together in the kitchen. Throughout this pandemic, our proactive approach with our supply chain is paying dividends. Strong customer service has enabled us to partner with our retailers to consistently capture these consumer opportunities and maintain a strong presence in store. As I mentioned earlier, our case fill rate for the first quarter was very strong and has continued into April, despite the increasingly difficult operating environment. This tremendous work by our manufacturing and sales teams is evident in our recent market share performance. Hershey confectionery category share gains were up over two points in March and are up over three points to-date in April. Now, let me spend a few minutes discussing our international markets. As you all know, these markets represent a smaller percentage of our overall sales, but they're an important growth driver for our business. Whilst, specifics vary by country, we've consistently seen more COVID-19 related pressure in these markets than in the United States. This is driven by several factors, including more restrictions on manufacturing and retail in some countries, as well as less discretionary income, which impacts consumer\u2019s ability to afford non-essential goods like chocolate. Parts of our business continue to perform well, including non-confectionery products like syrup, spreads, and milk. And we're winning confectionery share in the modern trade and e-commerce channel. However, some of our 2020 growth initiatives that focused on increasing geographic and traditional trade distribution have been delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe there's still tremendous long-term opportunity for us in our international markets, and we're maintaining an appropriate level of investment to capture these opportunities once the situation stabilized. In both our U.S. and international markets, we are actively reevaluating priorities and resourcing to adjust as the situation evolves. Like many companies, we are partnering with our retailers to make sure we have the right level of promotional support during these unique times. Our best-in-class retail sales force is a tremendous asset to help continue executing important promotional programs such as Seasons, S'mores, and Reese's Lovers. We are evaluating our media plan and adjusting both levels of support, messaging and channel when appropriate. For example, we've adjusted our S'mores copy to emphasize family consumption at home versus larger community and friend gatherings. We have taken savings from events like NCAA March Madness and Olympics and reallocated some to digital and our Reese's Lover promotion this summer, while leveraging some of that to cover incremental COVID-19 manufacturing and selling costs. We are proactively planning for Halloween and partnering with our retailers to be prepared for a strong recovery, while also making smart choices to mitigate risk if consumer behavior remains impacted. This includes optimizing our portfolio and price point mix and activation timing, as well as amplifying our e-commerce plan. Our ability to quickly pivot and adapt to the changes, along with our strong balance sheet and cash flow gives us confidence in our ability to manage through these disruptions and emerge stronger. While we are highly focused on managing the pandemic, we are also continuing to advance strategic imperatives that will be critical levers for us to drive the business going forward. We are however, taking a prudent approach and moderating the pace of some of these work streams, so that teams can adequately focus on the situation at hand. Specifically, we've chosen to selectively pause aspects of our ERP project, until all of our functional experts are able to focus on the critical design phase. We will continue to advance the finance and data work stream efforts of our ERP project, while we delay supply chain and order to cash efforts. We expect this to delay our overall implementation by about one year. Given the current demands on our supply chain team, as well as a desire for cash flow flexibility, we've also altered the pacing on our recently announced supply chain project. We do not expect any of these delays to have a material impact on our future growth ambitions, including those we have planned for 2021. Now, before I turn it over to Steve to share details on our Q1 performance, I wanted to take a minute to update you on some strategic choices we are making unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to better prioritize resources against assets that, fit our business model and scale capabilities, we are working to divest our crates, shorts in burger and to global brands. We will share more information regarding these divestitures in the future. It's important to note that our learnings from recent acquisitions have underscored the importance of assets scale and margin profile. We are obsessed with scale assets closer to $100 million, with high margins that enable brand investment to drive growth. These are great brands that continue to resonate with consumers, but they require a different go to market model that we believe is better supported by other owners. These actions will enable us to prioritize our recently acquired scale assets, within salty snacks and nutrition bars. Now, let me turn it over to Steve. Steve Voskuil : Thank you, Michele, and good morning, everyone. I hope you, your families and colleagues are safe and well. I plan to start with highlights from our first quarter results, including the impact from COVID-19 and then pivot to expectations for financial performance moving forward in light of the evolving pandemic. During the first quarter, recorded net sales increased 1% versus the same period last year, with organic constant currency sales growth of 0.5%. This was in line with expectations with only a modest impact from COVID-19. North America organic constant currency sales growth of 1.2% versus prior year was driven by net price realization as expected, a shorter Easter offset solid everyday sales grow by approximately one point in Q1. We did see a larger increase in consumer demand from stock up trips at the end of the quarter with total Hershey U.S. retail takeaway, up over 10% in March. However, this did not materially contribute to net sales growth in the quarter as retailer inventory was depleted to satisfy much of this demand. As we look to the balance of the year, we did not expect COVID-19 to permanently change our base inventory level assumptions. Though, we expect continued volatility and trends over the coming months due to the virus disruptions. The International and other segments reported in organic constant currency sales decline of 5.8% versus the prior year quarter. This was largely attributable to COVID-19 related softness, particularly in China, also included in this segment are, our own retail location, and our travel retail business that Michele mentioned earlier. While these businesses so minimal COVID-19 impact during Q1, we expect a more significant impact in the second quarter, given the shelter in place restrictions that were implemented in late March and early April. Now, turning to profitability for the quarter, our lever for gross margin expansion continue to be effective, with a 90 basis point improvement in the first quarter, increasing adjusted gross margin to 46.6%. Net price realization drove the majority of these gains and in addition to some benefits from productivity, as we proactively built inventory to mitigate risks related to COVID-19, recall, we expect Q1 to be our strongest pricing quarter of the year as we benefited from both the final phase of our July 2018 price increase and the implementation of our July 2019 price increase. Pricing in Q1 was in line with expectation and remains on track for the year. These gross margin games enabled strong investment in our brands and capabilities, selling, marketing and administrative expense increased 4.8% versus prior year, driven by planned elevated advertising level and investments in strategic growth capabilities. Operating expense for capabilities, including our ERP and supply chain program, or slightly ahead of expectations for the quarter due to timing, however, remain on track for the year. Recall, we also increased our incentive program for key levels in our organization in Q4 of 2019. For the full year, there's minimal impact from these changes versus 2019. However, due to the timing of the decision last year, the related incentive expense will be unfavorable in Q1, Q2 and Q3 and favorable in Q4. Adjusted operating profit increased by point 2% in the first quarter versus the prior period, and adjusted operating profit margin came in at 23.1%, reflecting a 20 basis point declines versus the same period last year. Gross margin gains were more than offset by operating expense timing. Adjusted earnings per share diluted were $1.63 for the quarter, an increase of 2.5% versus the same period last year. Continued growth margin strength and favorable tax enabled additional business investment and offset the Easter sales headwind and the International COVID-19 pressures to deliver solid overall earnings growth. Note the favorable tax in Q1 was driven by the tightening of tax credit. And we did not expect material changes to the full year tax outlook we provided in January. Given our strong cash flow and balance sheet, we are confident we will be able to manage through the current crisis, including maintaining strong liquidity. We believe we have adequate liquidity to meet our operating, investing and financing needs through operating cash flow, further supported by access to bank lines and commercial paper. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet with $261 million in operating cash flow from the first quarter. We will continue to evaluate the situation moving forward and plan to prioritize cash utilization to meet our liquidity needs. Our strong free cash flow and healthy balance sheet continue to remain a core strength and competitive advantage in these uncertain times. Recall in January, we announced two significant investments for 2020 and 2021, including the ERP transformation and the supply chain capacity and capability initiative. We plan to continue to move these projects forward, as both investments are strategically important for long-term growth. That said, as Michele mentioned, we did pause certain aspects of these projects, and reprioritize other capital projects to enable our teams to focus on the current crisis. This is anticipated to be late our ERP implementation by approximately one year. As a result, we now expect capital spending in 2020 to be approximately $400 million to $450 million, rather than the $500 million we communicated in January. In addition to investing for growth, returning cash to our shareholders remains a key priority now and over our 126 year history. This morning, we announced the second quarter dividend, which is our 362nd consecutive quarterly dividend on the common stock. Additionally, the company repurchased $150 million of common stock in the first quarter under the $500 million authorization approved by the Board in July 2018 $260 million remain available for repurchases under this program. We also repurchased $19 million of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options. We remain confident that our capital stewardship and allocation priorities will allow for continued strong and sustainable shareholder return. Let's move now to a discussion of our financial outlook and expectations for the balance of the year. Due to the rapidly evolving situation and the high degree of uncertainty, we do not believe we are able to estimate the full year financial impact with reasonable accuracy, and therefore, believe it is prudent to withdraw our fiscal 2020 full year guidance at this time. As we navigate this dynamic situation, we understand transparency is more important now than ever before. The uncertainty around a few key variables and the subsequent impact these could have to our outlook influenced our decision to withdraw guidance. These variables include the length and severity of the pandemic, the shape and timeline for recovery; the associated impact on retail restrictions both in the U.S. and internationally; the changing consumer behavior from shelter at home restrictions, including potential impacts to participation in key season; and the ability of our supply chain to execute and meet customer and consumer needs. Each of these variables could have significant implications to our growth and profitability. Michele shared with you the trends that are impacting the retail environment and consumer behavior. Some of these sales risks and opportunities also have impacts on profitability, namely risks related to our high margin, instant consumable products, particularly in the convenience class of trade, and our refreshment brands could dilute profitability. The announced compensation program for the manufacturing team along with increased plant sanitation and personal protective equipment, will add approximately $25 million to $30 million of incremental costs. However, we are seeing some efficiencies in the plant from running our largest, most efficient SKUs, which is helping to partially offset some of these expenses. Let me now spend a minute on our supply chain productivity initiatives. We had a strong start to productivity in Q1 with over $20 million of savings. However, to enable our teams to focus on COVID-19 priorities, we have deprioritized some planned productivity initiatives worth approximately five to $10 million in Q2. We remain confident in our ability to deliver against our long-term productivity goals. While commodity prices for some of our key ingredients have recently declined, given our hedging program, we expect minimal benefits to 2020. These declines do, however, improve the profile for 2021 versus our outlook in January. Operating expenses are expected to increase approximately $10 million to $15 million as a result of a new incentive program for sales representatives and increased sanitation and personal protective equipment. We anticipate savings related to travel and entertainment, given travel restrictions and social distancing practices to at least partly mitigate these impacts. While we feel there is too much uncertainty at this point to provide a reasonable estimate of the full year financial impact related to COVID-19, we want to provide reassurance that we are being both proactive and agile in managing our performance as the pandemic unfolds. We build inventory in the first quarter to anticipate demand and limit disruptions. We've taken a hard look at capital spending and reprioritize to ensure adequate resources to address both COVID-19 related projects and those critical for strategic growth. We are dynamically adjusting our trade and advertising plan. We are actively monitoring the commodity and financial markets for long-term opportunities. All of these decisions are being made with the priority of ensuring the safety of our employees and communities, while being fully prepared for the recovery. Michele and I could not be prouder of our team for bringing their best every day. This forward leaning, agile mindset, and high performance culture will help us persevere through this crisis and seize opportunities in the recovery. We are confident the uncertainty we face is temporary and then our decisions and adaptive operating model will help us forge relationships with customers and consumers, allowing for sustained long-term growth. Now, let me turn it back to Michele for some closing remarks. Michele Buck : Thanks Steve. As we look ahead, we expect the environment to remain volatile as the COVID-19 pandemic and consumers financial security both evolve. But we remain confident in the strength and resiliency of our category and brands over the long-term, and our remarkable leaders and employees who are executing against our strategies, reacting to current changes, and capitalizing on the opportunities that this change presents. The Hershey Company has more than 125 years of experience managing through tough, fast moving, and unprecedented moments in time; two World Wars, economic depressions and recessions, and other momentous events. Each time we plan, we took action, and we learned and adapted. And we kept our focus on making the best decisions for our employees, our partners, our stockholders, our communities, and the consumers that we serve. This moment in time is no different. It calls for us to be our best working together with compassion and understanding to do what's best for our global society. And we believe that this resilience will only make us stronger in the days and the years ahead. Steve, Melissa, and I are now available to take any of your questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Lazar : Good morning, everybody, and hope everyone is doing well. And thanks for a lot of granularity in the prepared remarks. Michele Buck : Thanks, Andrew. Good morning. Andrew Lazar : Good morning. I want to start with -- obviously, things are still incredibly fluid and they will remain so for quite some time. And none of us know exactly how or if, you know, ultimately, consumers will alter the way they sort of -- alter the way they celebrate key seasons and things. But you mentioned Michele, a couple of them a couple of actions to sort of mitigate risk or making some smart choices around being able to pivot quickly if there are changes. Adding three of the things you mentioned, were optimizing the portfolio, potentially some changes to net price realization, and activation timing. I was wondering if you could just maybe comment just briefly on each of those. Just want to make sure I have a sense of what are some of the levers you could pull if there are some changes in the way we all think about and celebrate key holidays. Michele Buck : Yes, absolutely. So, relative to Halloween, I know that you were asking about -- and there was actually a fourth lever of e commerce. So, let me talk about each of those. So, first of all, we are looking at the portfolio because we have seasonally dressed items for Halloween. We also have in the season, everyday assortment bags that play a key role. So, one area we're looking at is how do we mitigate potential risk of not knowing what consumer behavior will be by really optimizing what's the right balance of seasonal and everyday type items? We're evaluating the price points relative to understanding that some consumers may be financially strapped. How do we look at some of those higher price points and make sure that we have enough entry level price points and that the balance of the portfolio across price points, accounts for the fact that there will be some consumers going through financial pressures. Activation timing is really trying to keep our pulse on -- we know that we can impact these seasons based on when we set the season, we know that consumers will buy a season to bring the product in their house and there's some celebration in the house before the community events of Trick or Treat. And so leaning in a little bit earlier on some of the timing is a very reasonable option that we're discussing with our retail partners to be able to capture more celebration outside of just the Trick or Treat occasion. And then lastly, we are seeing e-commerce really dial up in Easter we saw that and so we are increasing our investments and activity to really have a great presence in Halloween, the right portfolio, bundled solutions across the needs for Halloween. So, those are really the key actions there. Andrew Lazar : That's very helpful. And then just follow-up, I think you mentioned the number of 6% of sales was for food service, some of the retail locations, and I wasn't clear, does that include also China or was China separate from that number? Michele Buck : Yes. No, that includes China and also our world travel retail business, which of those stores that -- product we sell in duty-free stores in airport. Andrew Lazar : Great. Thanks so much. Hope everyone stays well. Michele Buck : Thank you. Thank you. Steve Voskuil : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Robert Moskow : Hi. Thank you for the question. I appreciate it. I guess -- there is a lot to cover here. Let me ask about 2Q. Is your visibility better for 2Q than it is for the rest of the year? And can you give us -- maybe Steve, some of the puts and takes here. The gross margin benefit you've got in the first quarter, does that come out of 2Q. And then secondly, the retail sales growth as measured by Nielsen was really high, much higher than your shipments. And is there any timing impact with respect to 2Q like will that come back at all or is that just Easter being a week earlier. Thanks. Michele Buck : Hey, Rob, let me start by addressing some of that. So, first of all, I would say we do have greater visibility to Q2 because we're already halfway into the quarter. So we do have stronger visibility there. As you may recall, we had planned for a difficult Q2 prior to COVID as a result of some of our year-on-year lapse. And then our decision to close our retail locations for most of the second quarter, that's a known that's within our control. Certainly the impacts that we're seeing with restaurants closed in the second quarter that's a known that we can see the known impact on food service, the reduction in flights, we can see that that's a known relative to travel retail and then we also had some elements of cost that are knowns which include manufacturing and retail incentives, one-time costs on PPE and safety protocols. So, we do have a lot of visibility around those things. Relative to the kind of the gap or the disconnect in Q1 between retail and shipment, let me address that and then I'm going to let Steve make some other comments about Q2. If you look at Q1, you can really break up that differential with about half the differential with retail being ahead of shipments was driven by Easter. As you know, we always have Easter in Q1, but the amount of Easter that gets consumed in Q1 is all dependent on the timing of the Easter holiday. This year, Easter was a bit earlier than last year and therefore, much more of the season was actually consumed, taken away in Q1 versus last year. The other half of the differential in the retail sales to shipments, part of it is innovation. We shipped Take 5 and Kit Kat Duos in December to set up for strong merchandising in Q1. So, you got shipments in December, you got the takeaway in Q1, and then the other component is some inventory. Steve Voskuil : Yes and I want to add, of a good complete answer. We have good visibility into the costs I think for Q2 and Michele went through most of the things like the incentives and the sanitation are well known and we talked about those in the prepared remarks. The productivity piece, the 20 that we saved in Q1 doesn't come or doesn't go away in Q2, but we would have expected to add to that, and you need to grow and that's the piece that won't happen that we had in the plan. And then maybe the third piece that we touched on a little bit sort of implied as we talked about the top line as there is probably going to be some negative mix impact coming through, again, thinking about refreshment in convenience store impacts in the total mix. And that's probably a $5 million to $10 million gross profit impact for the year. Robert Moskow : Okay. I do have a follow-up. You mentioned your in-store execution and your sales incentives as a way to maybe mitigate some of the category declines and take share. But are some of your retail partners, limiting the amount of people that will allow in the stores, just for social distancing reasons and does that impact your execution at all? Michele Buck : So, some of course are, but as we've worked out with our retail sales reps and partnered closely with retailers, even before that we had worked with them with a lot of our partners to have our team go in during off hours to try and bring our product and set displays when they're either work consumers in the store or at the very lowest periods of time. So, I would say, well, there is some impact. I would say, largely we've partnered really closely with retailers to work around that, both in terms of the safety and social distancing of our employees as well as helping the retailers to kind of protect and manage the number of people in their store. But largely, they've been really supportive and appreciative of the extra help which they desperately need obviously as consumers are purchasing a lot. Robert Moskow : Got it. Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with DD Research. Please proceed with your question. David Driscoll : Great. Thank you and good morning. Michele Buck : Hey David. Good to hear from you. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. David Driscoll : What a pleasure, thank you. Good to be here. So, let me follow-up on Rob's, because I -- while I think you guys gave a good list of things in 2Q. Maybe there is some numbers that you gave that I feel like were annual like the PPE expense, the personal protective equipment and then something specific to the second quarter. So, I'm just a little confused on what expenses were allocating to the second quarter that you know of right now versus the sales side. And then can I can I just follow-up on this. I mean you've said it I think twice now, but I still think I'm not clear, it sounds like there are some -- there is at least one positive with how the retailer inventories ended at the end of the first quarter. And I think you said in the script that you haven't made any changes to your retailer inventory assumptions. So, that sounds like there is going to be a recovery of those retailer inventories in 2Q, which would be favorable to sales. So, again if you -- I apologize here, I do appreciate you've said this, but are you saying that Q2 sales are maybe a little bit better than expected versus where you previously had it, but on the expense side, that's significantly more negative because of the PPE costs, the incentive costs. And then there is I think a couple of other items that you wanted to call out right there in 2Q that we're hitting it the mix. Sorry. Appreciate it. The mix to what's going on in the business? Thank you. Michele Buck : Yes, David. The large majority of the cost increases really do hit in Q2. If you think about the biggest pieces of that the manufacturing and retail incentives, one-time costs around PP&E, the pull back on productivity was around Q2, there is some mix impact with the pressure around refreshment and C-store. And so if you look at that, by far the biggest impact is in Q2. Some of the PP&E and safety will continue throughout the year. And then there are some potential offsets, less travel that will have the benefit of throughout the year. We continue to kind of look at trade in DME optimization. There could be commodities, but not a large number. And as it relates to the inventory, I think, my gut would be that at some point we get a little bit of that back, but we don't know for sure and we definitely don't know that it will be in Q2. In fact, if I was just looking at what's going on in the world right now and at retail, my gut would be that likely wouldn't be in Q2, but instead, would be some point later in the year. David Driscoll : All right. That color is really helpful. Just one follow-up from me. I don't think you said how your China business was performing in April. Is there any insight we can gain right there? Are you seeing any sign of recovery? I mean a nearly 50% decline in that business in Q1 is really large. So, is there any color you can give us on how 2Q might shape up for Hershey China? Michele Buck : Yes, I mean it's better than we anticipated. It's better than we saw in February, but it's clearly in a ramp-up recovery. So, it's not close to back to normal yet. But we are watching that on to leverage any insights and I think the biggest insight there is just the move from offline to online is very real, it's continued and just like we think it will here in the U.S. David Driscoll : Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Ken Goldman : Good morning. Thank you. My first question is, is there anything you can do to protect yourself right now, whether it's buying product ahead of time or potentially considering diversifying your geographic sourcing. Because there is obviously Western Africa has not been hit very hard by COVID yet. There have been some suggestions that maybe it will get hit harder later in this year. What are your concerns about that? Just given how much cocoa you source from one region and, again, what can you do to maybe mitigate some of those concerns, potentially? Steve Voskuil : Yes, right now our supply chain team has done a fantastic job and so aside from cocoa some of our more specialty small ingredients even certainly in the first quarter as COVID starting to get traction they bought some of those ahead to get ahead of it. Right now, I think we feel pretty strong about our cocoa supply, I can tell you our procurement team is very deep into that market on a good day, and they are even deeper here in looking at alternative suppliers and so. So, far harvest looks strong and we don't see anything in the medium term, that causes a lot of concern on cocoa supply. Michele Buck : Yes, what we need for the year, like those quantities are already here. So, they're out of that region. So, as we look at this year, we're in good shape and that gives us time and we're working closely with those governments as well. Obviously, this is important crop for that geography and we're working closely with them to make sure that they are set up to handle it. Ken Goldman : Okay. Thank you for that. And then one quick follow-up. Thank you for the color on what's in the 6% number in terms of branded stores and World Travel locations and so forth. One question that I was asked, I wasn't sure how to answer was, how big our movie theaters, sporting events, things that maybe are not captured in Nielsen, first of all, is that in that 6% number as well and second, can you give us any kind of any kind of rough size for what you would think those types of channels might be. I know I'm being vague with the question there. Michele Buck : No, that's okay. Some of that falls into our broader specialty business and that might be another 2% to 3% of sales again some impact. Ken Goldman : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Alexia Howard : Good morning, everyone. Michele Buck : Good morning. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. Alexia Howard : Hi. So, again focusing on the trends that you're seeing in Q2 now that the doctor settled on the panic-buying phase. Could you give us by channel, how things are looking. So for example, how big are you overall in e-commerce and how quickly is that growing right now and it's not different from the past. The C-store channel I think you mentioned that was about 15% of sale how soft is that right now? And we assume that the food service in China that 6% of the business as well down at the moment. And then also taking a look at it by product type, if you think about import versus seasonal versus every day, how fast are each of those growing or shrinking if I imagine some of the maybe relative to what you would normally expect? Thank you. Michele Buck : Okay. Let me do my best on that one to try a great set out. So, C-store is about 15% of our sales. It's declining about 10%. E-commerce is about 2% of our sales and we're seeing the growth rate double there. Now, of course, that's just what we've seen recently. So, all of these are the recent trends. So, of course, I can't predict exactly how that will play forward. Walmart and mass channels and dollar stores, grocery have had pretty good trends as people are really shopping there. They are frequenting those places and also all of those places tend to have or many of them and e-commerce leg that's being leveraged. I'd tell you the other place we are seeing some softness is around drug. So, drug and C-store are the two channels that I think we've seen the biggest softness, plus there were initial huge stock-ups of the initial stock up behavior with huge at clubs, that's moderated a bit. Melissa might have to come back and give you maybe more of the details around the specifics on each piece of trade. But I would say C-store is 15% and drug in that probably 8% range of our total business, and those are the places that are most pressured and then, of course, the rest kind of fall in the middle. If we look at take impulse, take-home and seasonal clearly the softness on impulse is a little bit less than you see in terms of the 10% decline in C-store, because we do still have business coming through, food, drug and mass, so less than that 10%. Take-home obviously driving our growth and seasons we had a really good Easter. So, at this point, what we're gearing up to do is to -- we met our expectations, our sell-in, our net sales shipments, we fell just short on takeaway. So, seasons, I call kind of a wash and then take-home is where we're seeing the strength. But Melissa can give you more details I think offline on that. Alexia Howard : Perfect. And then a super quick follow-up. I think you said that Easter was down as expected, because of the shorter season, but it was also a bit weaker than expected, presumably because of the pandemic. Is that the way that we should be thinking about it? Michele Buck : The sell-in was on expectation. The sell-through was -- yes, was a little bit weaker than we anticipated. Really strong sell-through up until the final week. The final week of Easter happened at the same week that the government started to recommend the consumer is not going to grocery stores, unless it was essential and many of the big retailers started limiting the number of consumers they would allow in their store at one time. And we saw a direct impact on that, on that last week of Easter. But basically that will not cause that softness in the sell-through in the last week really shouldn't impact the P&L. Alexia Howard : Okay. Thank you so very much. I'll pass it on. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Bryan Spillane : Hey. Good morning everyone. Michele Buck : Hi Bryan. Steve Voskuil : Good morning Bryan. Bryan Spillane : So, I had a question just on -- just one question around the end of line manufacturing flexibility you have with packaging. And I guess my question is around, if we're looking going forward at a scenario where it's more e-commerce, which is, it's sort of a different type -- it requires a different type of packaging, maybe more grocery and mass more at home less convenience and gas. And then also maybe needing packaging flexibility to address affordability, maybe different pack sizes or different types. Do you feel like with the investments you've made in recent years that you have the flexibility to sort of make those shifts and be able to kind of service if that's where the business SKUs over the next six to nine months? Michele Buck : Yes, I would say, largely, we have flexibility in our manufacturing. I mean we already have a portfolio of products that we're meeting e-commerce demand and that demand has been across every pack type whether it's candy dish, whether it is instant consumables, et cetera, we already have a multitude of pack sizes that we've always done. This is a category that that lives on many different pack types for many different occasions. And then certainly as we're doing some of our supply chain work going forward, one of our goals is to put an even more automation to hopefully improve margins as we do that, but we are well set up to be able to adapt to different packs and sizes right now. Bryan Spillane : And if I could just one follow-up to that is, we've seen in other categories where retailers are kind of narrowing SKUs, want to be in stock, with the highest-velocity SKUs. Have you seen any of that yet in your categories? Michele Buck : Yes, we are. And we think we're well positioned there. As you know, we had just gone through a big SKU rationalization program to get rid of some of the smaller SKUs and on the normal course of business, as we grow our business, we have all of our SKUs categorized with the very highest movers, there is a must haves, must be protected at all cost and then we kind of go through our portfolio. So, we've always managed our business in that way. So, we've been well set up to serve in that priority environment. Bryan Spillane : Okay. Thanks Michele. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jason English : Hey. Good morning. Thank you for sliding me in. I guess I'll pick up on one thread from Mr. Spillane in terms of e-com. As we think about maybe what could be different in 2021 assuming all these issues come to pass. The amount of sales going to e-com sounds like it could be the one durable change. So, quick question, just to get a little more context around it. And I guess what really my angle here is to understand the impact on your impulse oriented sales. I think historically you've said about a 30 year portfolio is impulse and you're saying today 15% of that's going through C-store. How much of that is going through food, drug, and mass? Michele Buck : I mean the other -- that would be the other 15%, basically the other between the difference between 33% and 15%, I would say, largely. Let me just think about-- Jason English : And there is a little bit of lending in there too I think. Michele Buck : Yes, that's what I was trying to think how much would be in those specialty channels spending would be the biggest piece of that. We have some in Club as well in terms of reseller packs at Sam's. I mean, I guess I would estimate, I'm going to say may be 15% maybe fundraising Lending Club and specialty are 5%, so I'd say maybe 15% goes through drug and mass. Jason English : And how is that 15% tracking today? Michele Buck : It's tracking much better than the C-store. It really varies by channel. The drug piece would be the softest piece because overall drug is just not getting as much traffic. I think a lot of people are using drive through all options; people are trying to stay away from smaller stores. So, the larger majority of that is really going through mass and grocery. It's still softer than take-home, but it is still growing in some of our retailers. Jason English : Okay. So, is that sort of reflective of what life looks like in the lower trip frequency environment and people stick with the sort of online replenishment and trip frequency is lower. Do you think it's reasonable to assume that if there is risk to like lost business that can be a bit more durable? That's the risk. So, we're talking about a couple of points of sales which may -- that may not come back. And is there anything else that you would highlight that we should be cognizant of as we think about the impact to your earnings power in 2021 or beyond? Michele Buck : Yes, I mean I think with less trips, certainly there is some risk there and that creates some of -- some bit of a mix and sales risks. However, I guess the other thing I'd ask you to think about is, as we look at our e-commerce business, we have instant consumable strength in e-commerce. So, one of our biggest selling items has been instant consumable, both singles, as well as we sell case packs that have maybe 24 instant consumable items in them. And given that our margins are strong, we don't really discount and bulk the instant consumable items. Driving the growth there, our goal there is to continue to drive the growth there which offsets how the consumer behavior is evolving and changing. I think the other opportunity is really for us to just kind of drive against kind of the push that as consumers have less trips they're also executing bigger baskets and so really focusing on that as an opportunity as well. Jason English : Yes, got it. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on. Stay safe, be well. Michele Buck : Thank you. You too. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Rob Dickerson : Hi, great. Thank you so much. So, just sort of question on pricing, I mean it seems like you're saying the last week pre-Easter weakness really shouldn't impact the P&L in the near-term. Maybe that suggests that the promotional plans have really been altered, but then I think it also sounded like, you said promotional spend could be increasing your price mix sharpened as you go through the year, right, to maybe increased demand overall, but then I also heard that maybe you're pricing plans remain on track. So, obviously, there are just a number of comments in there. I just wanted to clarify. Just in general pricing environment and we've heard Easter didn't go so well seasonally let's say in Europe, but obviously because the COVID buying, right, you kind of mask some of that seasonal weakness is there too much product still on the seasonal based on the shelf does that have to be sold through sounds like inventory levels have come down, but pricing sounds to be okay. So, any commentary you can just give kind of around the overall pricing dynamic will be great. Thanks. Michele Buck : Yes, I guess, first I'd start by saying, we feel good about our pricing strategy for the year and our current initiatives are on track and we really don't expect any material changes as a result of COVID. So, we were expecting in that two to two and half points of pricing in 2020 and we continue to believe that, that will be the case. As we look at promotional spending, at this point in time in our category a lot of our promotional spending is utilized to drive display. So, we are unlike some other categories that are less impulsive where people use price to have a temporary price reduction and really low pantry. That's not really how our category works. So, given our retail sales team is out there in force, we're continuing to get display. And so we aren't seeing a big pullback. There could be some small coupled -- couple of million dollars that come back from trade, but I think in general, we're continuing to drive against that. And then really relative to the -- we're just trying to be sensitive to the consumer environment around the financial constraints which is one reason that we continue to believe some of our promotional support makes sense than the display. And then during the holidays just making sure we have the right array of price point. So, I don't think about that as being an absolute reduction in price, because that's really not about the price realization per pack, it's just more what is the absolute price point. So, that consumers have options if they want to buy multiple or a bigger pack, they can and if they're going to buy less, so that's less kind of about the price per pound. Does that answer your question? Rob Dickerson : Yes. No, that's actually very helpful. I mean it sounds like basically if there is somewhat of a mix shift -- you talk about mix in terms of margin and time to make some pack size, et cetera, could affect pricing. But it sounds like maybe you could offset some of that with potential reduced promotional spend and display, so kind of net-net, at this point you feel like we're kind of okay. Does that make sense, back to you. Michele Buck : Yes, I would say net-net, we think we're okay, yes. Rob Dickerson : Okay, cool. And then just quickly and more broadly look over time, we've heard a number of larger food companies have said they actually do better online, but their online share can actually be better just given page one display and overall brand awareness. Obviously, there is a whole conversation around the channel shift. If we just think about online specifically in all the other channels, would you just say yes, we think, given our investment brand awareness, what have you. If we do shift into more than online purchase society over the next few years that we should be taking more share of category. That's it. Thanks a lot. Michele Buck : Sure. Yes, I mean we feel good about our ability to drive the business and capture share online. We're looking at total online share is a little difficult because there are a lot of unique businesses that have direct to consumer businesses online. But if we look at kind of the big retailers and the pure play big retailers in that space, yes, I feel pretty good that that we should be able to continue to drive share there. Rob Dickerson : Thank you, Michele. Stay safe. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC. Please proceed with your question. Nik Modi : Yes, good morning everyone. Michele, the share gains look really healthy and obviously you indicated they accelerated. So, I'm just wondering, what do you think is driving that? Is it a function of just the fact that your fill rates were so good? So, you have the product available. We are hearing about one of your major competitors of scaling back on some of the SKU count. So, I'm just curious what you're seeing and what you would attribute some of that market share gain to? Michele Buck : Yes, I would absolutely attribute it to our customer service levels. So we've been able to maintain incredibly high customer service levels at that 98%, 98.5%, 99% depending on the month. I think within that we have had very good availability across our portfolio. So, we've been pretty much able to meet the specific product demands as well. So, huge kudos and credit to our manufacturing team who has just done an outstanding job of being ahead of this, building inventory ahead of this, getting raw materials in ahead of this, working with their teams and all of our manufacturing employees who supported doing this. And then I would also say having our retail sales reps out there building displays, stocking shelves, that has also been a very positive impact. So, yes, I would say a lot of it is about the strength of our company in the past has always been a lot around operational excellence and execution, and I think that's really benefiting us on top of course the fact that we feel great about the brands and the programs we've had out there, but I do think that's been a difference maker. Nik Modi : And just going back to the question, any changes in the competitive landscape. We are hearing again, one of your major competitors is looking to do their own SKU rationalization program. So, I'm just curious if you've seen that in the marketplace or if you've heard the same? Michele Buck : No, I mean, I'd say the only -- we've probably heard similar things as you had regarding a couple of competitors in the category, who may have supply, not a solid position on supply. Nik Modi : Great. And then just quickly on the size of SKU. So, if you think about a lot of the volume that was probably sold over the past several weeks, my suspicion is and maybe you can confirm that it was all large bags multi-packs. Just curious how you guys are thinking about at home inventory depletions just given general consumer behavior. I mean, my sense is, it's going to take some time for them to work that inventory down. But just love your thoughts on that. I could be wrong. Michele Buck : Yes, I mean, obviously, we didn't get as big of a stock up as like say some of the main meal categories. So, I don't think that that there is a huge backlog. But certainly as we get through the quarter, that will be something that we will learn more about. We do know that the things that are selling best or things that are around take-home occasions, snack size assortment bags, six packs of Hershey Bars for people to make S'mores at home. Twizzlers which one of the key uses for Twizzlers is when you're watching movies or TV, so I think we know which items are getting consumed the most rapidly. And like I said, we don't have a huge stockpile, but that is something that will play out in Q2 and we'll get a better feel for how quickly people utilize those. We also, know, hey, they are baking a lot at home and so there are other indulgent categories that we're competing with for those usage occasions at home. Nik Modi : Great. Thanks a lot. Stay healthy. Michele Buck : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Chris Growe : Hi. Good morning. Michele Buck : Hi. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. Chris Growe : Hi. I just had two questions, if I could. I was curious first of all, Michele if you could speak to your thought here, the concept of the thought around guidance. And it sounds like and I'm taking good notes, and there's a lot of little factors you've given around the second quarter, but you seem to have pretty good -- a pretty good visibility into that quarter. Is there a factor too that worried you about giving guidance for the upcoming quarter or having a good read on the quarter given you seem to have good visibility across a number of different areas of the other P&L? Michele Buck : Yes. So, as we mentioned, we do have a lot of visibility into Q2 of some of the things that we know will hit us. We mentioned the 6% of the business, a lot of those businesses essentially being closed or down based on governmental regulations. We certainly know that we've got in that $45 million of cost that will hit in Q2. If you add up manufacturing and retail productivity some of those elements, so we do have that at the same time, we still don't know how the rest of the quarter will play out and we're seeing that every single week we get new pieces of news or information that make it difficult to know if something else is coming our way. And certainly, then I think as we look to the rest of the year, we have significantly less visibility there. We certainly have tried to share what we think the biggest risks and opportunities are in the portfolio. The opportunities we're driving at, how we're managing against the risks, but much less visibility there. So, yes, I would say that's where we kind of stand. Chris Growe : Okay. And then I just was curious, a quick question about your international business. Obviously, China has gotten better rather still down as you noted. Are the -- the other countries, in India, Brazil and Mexico, just a bigger risk of declines is that one area of uncertainty you have also in the second quarter? Michele Buck : Yes, international is definitely an area that remains a risk. Each country, each area is in a different state in the growth or stage of the pandemic and each government is acting quite differently. So, we have some markets like Mexico or India, India is really on a lockdown for four weeks. We have some of those markets where it's difficult for our employees to actually get to work, based on what's happening with public transportation, based on government regulations about people in certain areas, not traveling to other areas. So, we are facing a lot in those markets. And I'd say that's really primarily in Mexico and India as the two biggest impacts. But yes, it is in that camp of more uncertain at this point in time. Chris Growe : Just one final point on that. Is it likely that the international business could be weaker in Q2 than it was in Q1 even though you don't have that unique China experience? Michele Buck : Yes, I would say there is a lot of uncertainty in international such that I'm not really sure that I could say for sure how that's going to play out. I think that's one of the uncertainties for Q2. Chris Growe : Okay, that's fine. I appreciate it. And again stay safe. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Michael Lavery : Good morning. Michele Buck : Good morning. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. Michael Lavery : With the heavy traffic at retail are you -- what adjustments are you making if any to promotional spending? And if there is any change in plans or those things that can drive savings or is it just shifting timing to a different point in the year? Michele Buck : Yes, we haven't made a lot of big wholesale changes in promotions, because our promotions are really geared against display, because our retail sales teams are still out there and are able to build those displays and obviously there remains a lot of space in stores given outages in certain categories. We continue to be focused on making sure that we are really driving as much of our spending as possible to display any place that we didn't have any kind of temporary price reduction. We are trying to pull back on those and then certainly we are trying to gear the spending around the right programs that are relevant at this point in time. So, we continue to look at where we are there. We continue to partner with retailers in terms of how we meet their needs. At this point in time, I would say we are largely executing according to our plans for the year, but always looking if there is opportunity where promotions aren't going to make sense. They aren't going to drive consumers like a temporary price reduction. I don't think, well, how we convert that more to a display driving initiative or use it for something else. Michael Lavery : Okay, that's helpful. And then you talked about it a lot of the puts and takes on the cost side and specifically a lot of cost headwinds that are more 2Q focused. You also have some of the marketing savings you mentioned and efficiencies from the bigger SKUs running to the extent that it goes both ways on the full year how does it net out? Is it a net negative or is it about a push, how do you see assuming just at least what you know now? Michele Buck : Are you saying a net negative or a push on total cost impact to the business? Michael Lavery : Exactly, yes. Michele Buck : Steve, do you want to talk to that? Steve Voskuil : The cost impact on a full year basis will be a net negative. I think we're not giving guidance for the full year until all of the other puts and takes on the variables that we're watching will come into play. Obviously, depending on the shape of the recovery, we would expect to see improvement in those costs, after we get past the challenge in Q2. But I don't think there is enough new savings to offset some of the deeper incremental costs we are going to face in Q2. Michael Lavery : Okay. Thanks. And just a last quick one on the Hershey World Stores, how much seasonality is there to that with the percentage of sales in Q2 and 3Q typically be much higher? Michele Buck : So, it depends on the location. Clearly for the Hershey-based store, there is big seasonality in the summer, because we are right outside Hershey Park. So, that one is highly seasonal. Las Vegas, I would say not so much and Time Square has a bit of a SKU to summer and to holiday because it's driven by that traffic, but not quite as much of a seasonal SKU. Michael Lavery : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] It will come from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Steve Powers : Yes. Hey, thanks for taking the question. I guess if we just wrap all this up, I mean before we -- before this the COVID-19 situation, I'll started we were looking forward to an Investor Day update from you in March, which seems like a long, long time ago. But as you think back and think about what you intend to communicate that day, how much of the content that you feel would remain unchanged as it relates to your medium to long-term strategy at this point versus what degree do you think we're all going through now is likely to have lasting impacts on Hershey's future playbook? Michele Buck : I don't think that what we are going through right now would have any impact on that content on our long-term strategies. What I would say is, some of it may shift a bit. So, certainly, I think there has been a step change in e-commerce that just now occurred that probably would have taken longer to occur in society around consumers' adoption of e-commerce around retailers' readiness. It would be smaller things like that, but largely our strategies remain unchanged. Our big initiatives in terms of what we think is important remain unchanged as well. Steve Powers : Okay. And I guess maybe just a quick follow-up. I can tie it to your comments that you made today on the plans to divest the businesses that you highlighted. I guess how much -- was that a March communication or is that a decision that you've definitively come to more recently. It feels just a little bit surprising in the context of what were all -- what were in the midst of. So, I just wanted some clarity there as you -- I mean obviously you've made comments about this business in the past, but with the X now intend--? Michele Buck : That was pre-COVID. That's been under way. It has been Q1, late Q4, probably started in Q4 or early Q1 activity to explore and to begin that work. Steve Voskuil : Yes, I'd say we're always looking at everything in the portfolio, testing where its best place is and so no COVID impact on that. Steve Powers : Okay. And is there any way you can dimension the size 2019 sales profitability of those businesses, just for some frame of reference? Michele Buck : I mean they're small. Steve Voskuil : Yes, they are small. Steve Powers : Okay, fair enough. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Ms. Poole for any final comments. Melissa Poole : Thank you all for joining us this morning. I'm sure there are still additional questions, I'll be around all day to answer as many of them as I can. Thanks so much. Stay wealthy -- stay healthy. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Melissa Poole : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the prerecorded discussion of The Hershey Company\u2019s Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Results. My name is Melissa Poole and I\u2019m the Vice President of Investor Relations at Hershey. Joining me today are Hershey\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Michele Buck, and Hershey\u2019s Senior Vice President and CFO, Steve Voskuil. In addition to these remarks, we will host an analyst Q&A-only session at 8 :30 a.m. Eastern on the morning of July 23. A replay of this webcast and our subsequent Q&A session will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website, along with their corresponding transcripts. During the course of today\u2019s discussion, Management will make forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. These statements include expectations and assumptions regarding the Company\u2019s future operations and financial performance, including expectations and assumptions related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Actual results could differ materially from those projected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other factors. The Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based on subsequent events. A detailed listing of such risks and uncertainties can be found in today\u2019s press release and the Company\u2019s SEC filings. Finally, please note that during today\u2019s discussions, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe will provide useful information for investors. The presentation of this information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning\u2019s press release. It is now my pleasure to introduce our Chairman and CEO, Michele Buck. Michele Buck : Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. On behalf of the entire Company, we hope you, your colleagues and your loved ones are continuing to stay safe and healthy. We have all experienced significant change and new challenges over these past several months. Things we never predicted are now realities that we are all adapting to. Things we thought would evolve over the course of several years have changed in weeks. I could not be prouder of the Hershey organization for how they have responded. At the center of our culture is the shared believe that Hershey and its people stand for togetherness, integrity, excellence and making a difference. These values have shined even more brightly over the past several months. Our teams have worked together tirelessly to keep each other safe, our supply chain running, our customers\u2019 needs met, and our consumers stocked with snacks that make their lives a little more delicious during these very difficult times. Our teammates have done this with a care and compassion for each other and the communities in which they live, and they are energized and inspired to leverage this moment to drive positive change for the future. I want to thank the entire organization, from retail to manufacturing and across our corporate international and regional offices, for the hard work and commitment they bring every day. The marketplace remains volatile as the virus and consumer behavior evolves. We saw significant changes as we progressed through the second quarter, but our teams did a fantastic job of adapting to these changes and continued to execute exceptionally well. The first half of the quarter was particularly challenging, as global economic growth contracted and government-mandated restrictions and closures impacted consumer mobility and, in turn, our performance. We did see an improvement later in the quarter as economies began to reopen and consumers returned to more activities outside the home. We continue to feel good about our long-term strategies and the strength we saw in our core products and channels during the quarter. Despite new challenges and increased complexities, we delivered profitable category-leading sales growth in North America. These gains were offset by sales declines in areas heavily impacted by the pandemic and related government restrictions and consumer mobility limitations. Our agile investment mindset enabled us to quickly pivot and mitigate sales declines in areas impacted by consumer mobility restrictions. In addition, our advantaged margin structure and strong cost management helped us to mitigate incremental COVID-19-related costs to enable us to deliver adjusted earnings per share in line with last year. We expect accelerated sales growth in the second half of the year, based on momentum exiting the quarter, assuming there\u2019s no significant disruption to current consumer trends. We also expect pricing and strong cost management to drive margin expansion and earnings growth in the second half of the year. Now, let me share some details on our North American business. While we have seen significant channel disruption and changes in consumer behavior, our brands and categories remain an important part of consumers\u2019 lives and have performed relatively well. We saw strong performance in the food, mass, dollar and e-commerce classes of trade, consistent with broader channel trends. Our e-commerce sales growth remains significantly higher than our pre-COVID baseline, with year-over-year sales growth accelerating further in the second quarter to 200%. Category trends in drug, convenience and club channels were more pressured, though all sequentially improved as we progressed through the quarter as consumers returned to more normal activities away from home. While COVID-19 has impacted traffic to some key channels in the short-term, we continue to believe our channel diversification is a long-term strategic advantage. Despite some of these pressures, our combined retail takeaway in measured channels was up over 4% in the quarter and it was up almost 9% in June. Importantly, we are winning share in every channel this year, and our share growth is strongest in the largest channels that are experiencing the most growth. We are leading not only through our portfolio of iconic brands, consumer relevant marketing and strong execution, but with our thought leadership, as well. Within confection, this has enabled us to drive growth that far exceeds the category and expand our number one share position in the U.S. Our category share grew 225 basis points in the second quarter, bringing our year-to-date share gain to 150 basis points. The chocolate category is performing well, with growth of approximately 4% in measured channels for the first half of the year, despite a shorter Easter. Everyday chocolate sales have consistently grown 9% since the pandemic began. While take-home products are driving outsized growth, instant consumable products are also growing. Hershey\u2019s has outperformed the category, with sales growth across brands that accelerated as we progressed through the quarter. In June, Hershey\u2019s chocolate portfolio grew 13%, with Reese\u2019s, Hershey\u2019s and Kit Kat brands each growing 14%. Key variety brands, such as PayDay, York, Almond Joy, Mounds, Heath and Rolo, also all grew during the month, resulting in a combined growth rate of over 11%. Our key chocolate innovation is also performing well. As we discussed in April, much of our innovation was launched prior to the pandemic hitting the U.S. Despite softening convenience store trends in the quarter, our instant consumable innovation remains on track. Our Reese\u2019s Take 5 relaunch is set to double the size of the brand this year to approximately $70 million of retail sales, and our Kit Kat flavor innovation is doing very well, with Kit Kat Duos and Kit Kat Birthday Cake both driving incremental brand household penetration and frequency. Distribution of our new THINS innovation was delayed slightly by the pandemic at several customers, but it\u2019s now in full distribution and velocities are strong. We have secured strong merchandising in-store for our key summer promotions, including Smores, Twizzlers and our Reese\u2019s Lovers In and Out Promotions. Our teams have shown great agility to adjust messaging and deliver consumer-relevant content to drive growth of 14% on these programs versus last year. Our Twizzlers and Jolly Rancher brands grew a combined 6% in the second quarter, also ahead of the category. Our strong in-store merchandising on Twizzlers has been amplified by consumer-relevant marketing to drive accelerated growth this summer as consumers enjoy this classic treat while watching movies at home or in the car on their summer road trips. As we mentioned in April, the refreshment category has been negatively impacted by social distancing, as the functional need for breath freshening has lessened. While trends have improved since April, the category continued to decline 20% to 25% in June. Our business has trended relatively in line with the category. We expect category trends to remain challenged until social distancing guidelines relax. Sales for our baking items are performing exceptionally well, with growth of over 40% in the second quarter. This growth was across products, including syrup, baking chips, toppings and cocoa, as consumers spend more time at home together in the kitchen. We have capitalized on this trend to sustain momentum, increasing marketing spend and generating more content and recipes for our consumers. This is important for the second half of the year, when baking takes on an even bigger role in U.S. households. Finally, let me touch on our better-for-you snack portfolio. Our salty snack brands have shown solid growth this year. As we shared on our call in April, we did experience some softness early in the second quarter, as our in-store presence and supply was negatively impacted by COVID-19. We worked quickly to improve our execution and in-store distribution and merchandising, resulting in accelerated performance in late May and June. In the month of June, our Skinny Pop and Pirate\u2019s Booty brands grew 8.4% and 3.7%, respectively, in measured channels, and total sales growth outpaced these levels, bolstered by strong growth in club and e-commerce. While we saw strong sales growth in measured channels, as expected, this was partially offset by significant declines in our food service and specialty retail businesses. Trends improved as we progressed through the quarter as many locations re-opened; however, traffic and sales remained below prior year levels in June. While we expect the second half headwind in these channels to be less severe than the second quarter impact, uncertainty remains as consumer behaviors continue to evolve, COVID-19 cases rise and regions consider mitigating actions to control the spread of the virus. Before I discuss our international segment, let me spend a few minutes providing an update on Halloween. As many of you know, Halloween is our largest season and it represents approximately 10% of our annual sales. We begin manufacturing product in the second quarter and primarily ship product to stores in the third quarter. Halloween celebrations are likely to be different this year, with an earlier start to the season and more geographic differences than in prior years. We expect that there will be more at-home activities, with families sharing timeless traditions and new ways for people to celebrate with neighbors. It is important to note that nearly 50% of Halloween candy spend is on \u201ctreat for me\u201d and \u201ccandy bowl\u201d occasions, which start early in the season. Trick or treating represents the other 50% of the season, with sales concentrated in the last two weeks of October. While research indicates trick-or-treating participation will likely be below prior year levels due to COVID-19 concerns, the expectation of this holiday tradition has been consistently improving over the past several weeks. We expect to outperform the category given our iconic brands, strong innovation and merchandising, and great execution. While we have visibility to orders and current consumer intentions, we expect the virus and consumer sentiment to evolve in the months leading up to the season, which could present some risk to sell-through. We will continue to monitor consumer behavior and local guidelines and partner with our retailers to help consumers celebrate the season of Halloween during this uncertain time. Now, let me shift gears and discuss our international and other segment. As anticipated, second quarter results were significantly impacted by COVID-19. As we shared in April, our owned retail Chocolate World locations were closed during the second quarter and we saw a meaningful impact on our travel retail business as air travel declined. While our locations have begun to reopen and air travel is beginning to improve, traffic remains well below historical levels and we anticipate a slower recovery in these channels. In several of our key international markets -- notably, Mexico, India and Brazil -- we have seen a significant increase in coronavirus cases over the past several months. While measures to stem the spread of the virus have varied by country, we have consistently seen these measures and their associated economic impact pressure chocolate category sales. In many of these markets, chocolate consumption is not as embedded in the culture as it is in the United States, and it is premium priced versus other food and snacking options. Category trends did improve as the quarter progressed, but they remain below prior year levels. While we saw strength in some of our other items in key markets, such as cocoa powder, syrup and spreads, it wasn\u2019t enough to offset the chocolate declines. We have responded to these recent trends and scaled back investments accordingly to help mitigate the COVID-19 impact on our business. We remain committed to our international strategy over the long-term and we will maintain an appropriate level of investment to capture opportunities as the macroeconomic environment and pandemic improve. Now, let me turn it over to Steve to provide some more details of our financial results, as well as our outlook for the rest of the year. Steve? Steve Voskuil : Thanks, Michele, and good morning, everyone. Before reviewing the detailed results for the second quarter, I want to build on Michele\u2019s remarks and commend our team\u2019s ability to adapt, execute and make smart decisions quickly during this unprecedented time. While our top line was challenged due to COVID-19-related softness in certain areas of the business, and we incurred incremental costs related to the pandemic, strong price realization in North America and proactive cost management allowed us to sustain profitability and deliver earnings in line with last year. As we look to the balance of the year, we anticipate incremental improvement to our top line, and feel good about the plans we have in place to continue to adapt and manage the opportunities and challenges that may arise in this dynamic operating environment. During the second quarter, reported net sales decreased by 3.4% versus the same period a year ago, with an organic, constant currency decline of 3.5%. As Michele mentioned, these declines were driven by COVID-19-related pressures to our international and other segment, as well as non-traditional channels in the U.S., such as food service and specialty retail. These declines were partially offset by strength in our confection business in measured channels, which benefited from elevated at-home demand and strong price realization. Despite these top line challenges and incremental COVID-19-related manufacturing costs, price realization and productivity savings enabled us to maintain our peer-leading adjusted gross margin of 46.4% in the second quarter, relatively in line with prior year. Adjusted operating profit increased 4.4% in the second quarter, resulting in a 170-basis-point improvement to operating profit margin versus the prior year period. Incremental incentives, cleaning and PPE costs were more than offset by travel and meeting expense favorability, as well as marketing spend optimization to align with consumer demand changes in the quarter. In North America, organic, constant currency sales growth of 0.4% was driven by pricing and elevated at home consumption of our chocolate and baking items. This was partially offset by sales declines in foodservice, specialty retail and our refreshment brands due to COVID-19. Price realization contributed 4.2 points in the quarter, which was slightly ahead of expectations, due to incremental trade efficiencies realized from revenue management and selective programming choices related to COVID-19. We continue to expect second half price realization to be approximately 1.5 to 2 points, driven primarily by our July 2019 price increase. Food service, specialty retail and refreshment were each down approximately 40% during the second quarter. We continue to expect these businesses to be negatively impacted by COVID-19 during the balance of the year, but improve incrementally as the economy and consumer mobility continue to recover. In measured channels, retail takeaway for Hershey was 4.1% for the second quarter, driven by strength in demand for our take-home confection and baking businesses, and strong execution by our supply chain to ensure product was available and on-shelf. We did not see this fully flow through to net sales, as retailer inventory levels continued to be depleted to satisfy a portion of this demand. As a result, we expect these inventory levels to be replenished in the coming months, contributing approximately one to two points of growth in the second half the year. Adjusted gross margin for the North America segment expanded 20 basis points to 47.5% for the second quarter, driven by strong price realization, which more than offset a challenging 2019 lap of favorable mix and incremental COVID-19-related costs for incentives, cleaning and PPE. Mix was a slight headwind for the quarter, driven primarily by lapping the significant mix benefit from Q2 of 2019, versus COVID-19- driven mix shifts this year. As Michele mentioned, our instant consumable business has continued to grow, which has helped maintain our margin strength. As a result, we do not anticipate mix being a material driver of earnings in the second half. North America advertising and related consumer marketing spend decreased 10.8% in the second quarter, driven by media cost efficiencies and selective programming optimization related to COVID-19. Approximately half of our spend reduction was driven by favorable digital media costs in the marketplace, a portion of which we expect to sustain in the second half. The remaining declines were driven by reduced investment in brands negatively impacted by COVID-19 trends, including IceBreakers and select chocolate brands that are disproportionately sold in the convenience store class of trade. As consumer trends improved in May and June, we began reinvesting in these businesses. These actions are a testament to our capabilities and willingness to adapt quickly to changes in the marketplace. As we look to the balance of the year, we will continue to be mindful of the evolving operating environment, but plan to invest more in advertising and consumer marketing as sales trends improve. In our international and other segment, organic, constant currency sales declined 33.4% in the second quarter, driven by COVID-19-related softness in our owned Chocolate World retail locations, large declines in air travel and performance in key international markets. Combined constant currency net sales in Mexico, Brazil, India and China declined 31.8% versus the second quarter in 2019. As Michele mentioned, we expect our international business to be slower to recover and likely challenged for the balance of year because of both COVID-19-related restrictions and economic conditions impacting consumer participation in the chocolate category. Our owned retail businesses were closed for nearly the entire second quarter, though all have reopened on a limited basis with appropriate COVID-19-related precautions. While our stores have reopened, we do expect significantly decreased foot traffic during the second half of the year and, therefore, expect sales to remain below prior year levels. Given these declines to the top line, we have taken a disciplined look at our variable cost base and optimized where feasible, while still maintaining the appropriate level of brand investment. This resulted in savings in advertising and related consumer marketing, along with travel expenses of approximately $15 million. The segment reported a slightly negative operating income of $4 million for the second quarter. We continue to expect gradual recovery throughout the second half of the year, but do not expect the segment to return to the same level as last year. While this segment has borne the greatest impact from COVID-19, we remain committed to the right balance of investment and support to ensure acceleration post COVID-19. Shifting to items below operating profit, interest expense was $38 million for the second quarter, an increase of $4.3 million, versus the same period a year ago, due to higher debt balances from debt issuances in October 2019. Other expense of $11.2 million represented a decline of $1.9 million, due to the purchase of fewer tax credits and lower non-service-related pension expense. The adjusted tax rate in the second quarter increased by 4.6% to 19.4%. This increase was due to the lapping of a prior period benefit related to the release of valuation allowances in select international markets. At this time, we do not anticipate any material changes to the tax and other income/expense outlook that we shared with you in January.We do, however, expect interest expense to marginally increase over the prior year due to the bond issuance in October 2019 and May 2020. Despite any short-term challenges posed by COVID-19, we remain confident in our strong cash flow and healthy balance sheet to manage through the current crisis and beyond. At the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet, an increase of $800 million versus last year, and $614 million in operating cash flow. To further mitigate potential risk and to take advantage of favorable rates in the capital markets, we issued $1 billion of bonds in the second quarter with staggered maturities, while paying long-term debt of $350 million that came due in May. We continue to have a peer-leading capital structure, providing agility to adapt to the dynamic environment we are operating in. Given our strong free cash flow and liquidity, we remain committed to our long-term capital priorities, with a balanced approach to investing in the business and returning cash to our stockholders, all while managing through this volatile environment. First, let\u2019s discuss our commitment to reinvestment. In the second quarter, total capital additions, including software, were approximately $87 million, bringing our-year-to date investment to $186 million. As discussed in April, our revised capital spending full year outlook of $400 million to $450 million reflects selectively pausing portions of our ERP transformation and supply chain capacity and capability initiative. Both ERP and our supply chain initiative, while re-phased, remain on track and are critical capabilities to deliver our long-term strategic initiatives. Now, shifting to returning cash to our stockholders, which remains a steadfast priority in our capital allocation strategy, earlier this morning, we announced our third quarter dividend, reflecting a 4% increase. While the Company did not repurchase any shares in the second quarter against the July 2018 $500 million authorization, we did repurchase $42 million of common stock in connection with replenishment of stock options. We remain confident that our balanced approach to business investment and returning cash to stockholders will continue to provide sustained stockholder returns now and in the future. As you saw in the press release, we are not providing new 2020 fiscal guidance at this time. While the Company\u2019s performance improved over the course of the second quarter, the impact of recent spikes in coronavirus cases on consumer mobility, retail operations, governmental regulations and the macroeconomic environment remains unclear. With that being said, we do want to provide some visibility into our latest thinking for the balance of the year, which is based on our current understanding of the operating environment. In the North America segment, the Company expects accelerated sales growth in the second half of the year driven by elevated at-home consumption, price realization and the replenishment of retailer and distributor inventory levels. These gains are anticipated to offset improving, but still pressured, sales in the food service and specialty retail channels. The Company does not currently expect seasonal performance to have a material impact on second half financial results, though the impact of a resurgence of COVID-19 cases on consumer participation in seasonal activities remains uncertain. In the international and other segment, the Company expects demand to slowly rebound in the second half of the year, but remain below prior year levels as owned stores, travel retail and developing markets recover more slowly. Finally, as it relates to sales, during the second quarter, we completed the planned divestitures of our Krave, Dagoba and Scharffenberger brands. These divestitures are expected to have a relatively small 20-basis-point impact to sales in the second half and an immaterial impact to earnings per share. Solid price realization and strong cost management are anticipated to offset some of the incremental COVID-19 costs we are facing. COVID-19 costs are expected to be less in the second half of the year, mainly for increased plant sanitation and personal protective equipment for Manufacturing and Sales Teams. We anticipate that price realization will continue to drive gross margin gains, though to a lesser extent than the first half of the year, as we begin to lap the announcement of the 2019 price increase. Selling, general and administrative expenses should continue to show favorability in the back half of the year, behind lower travel and meeting expenses and favorable incentive compensation versus prior year. Finally, as it relates to brand investment, we intend to continue investing in North America and further optimize spend in the international and other segment in accordance with expected sales trends. While we have not issued new guidance today, we hope this additional perspective is helpful to understand our approach to managing through the crisis and our high level expectations for the next several months pending the continued evolution of the pandemic. We remain confident in our team, our plan and our agile operating model to deliver solid shareholder returns this year and in the future. Now, I will turn it back to Michele. Michele Buck : Thanks, Steve. During a time of extraordinary changes and challenges this quarter, our teams responded with agility and executed well against factors within our control. We have balanced delivering today with making calculated investments that we believe will enable us to emerge even stronger after the pandemic. In times of risk and crisis, cultures are either strengthened or weakened. Hershey has come together and thrived as a team, committed to serving our consumers and our communities. Our purpose and commitment to operating sustainably and responsibly continues to move us forward. Last month, we released our 2019 sustainability report that highlights some of the great progress we have made in this space, as well as some of our key priorities for the future. I encourage you to go to our website and take a look. In addition to the sustainability report, you will also find information on some of our more recent actions and pledges. Let me take a minute to discuss two that are top of mind related to recent events. We have long supported our communities and given the unprecedented need many are facing right now, we have amplified these efforts. In addition to increasing our product and monetary donations, we have invested in our own mask production line to service our employees, their families and our communities. Second, for many years, we have pursued a vision of building a more diverse and inclusive company. We have been recognized for our progress, including being named the top food company for diversity by Diversity Inc. Recently, we initiated a company-wide dialogue to listen, learn and grow together. Through that dialogue, we have seen the very best of our Hershey culture, and a genuine desire to do more in the fight against systemic racism. We announced a set of initiatives to support Black and Brown communities and accelerate increasing Black and Brown representation and internal development at Hershey and amongst our key partners to promote social and economic progress. We believe these initiatives will help address the need for meaningful, long-term change in our society, and include evolving our approach to recruiting, talent development, training and reporting, as well as pledging monetary donations to organizations to actively fight systematic racism. To close, we believe Hershey is well positioned to adapt and succeed over the long term. We have scale brands in growing categories that consumers love and trust, we have a highly efficient, yet agile, supply chain that we are investing in for the future, we have advantaged capabilities in analytics, media, category management and sales, that we believe position us well to drive profitable growth in the future, and we have a team that is dedicated to our purpose of making more moments of goodness. We remain confident and committed to our long-term strategies and financial targets. With that, we conclude our prepared remarks this morning. Thank you for your time this morning. I invite you to listen to our live question-and-answer webcast, which will begin today at 8 :30 a.m. Eastern Time, and will be available at thehersheycompany.com. Thank you. Operator : Greetings, and welcome to The Hershey Company Second Quarter 2020 Q&A Session. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host Ms. Melissa Poole, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Hershey Company. Thank you. You may begin. Melissa Poole : Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today for The Hershey Company's second quarter 2020 earnings Q&A session.

Joining me today are Hershey's Chairman and CEO, Michele Buck and Hershey's Senior Vice President and CFO, Steve Voskuil. With that I will turn it over to the operator for the first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Michele Buck : Hi Chris. Operator : Mr. Growe your line is live. Perhaps you are muted. Chris Growe : I was muted there. I am so sorry. Thank you. Good morning. Michele Buck : Good morning. Chris Growe : Good morning. I hope you're all well. I just wanted to a question if I could, first of all, on -- as we're looking ahead to the second half of the year, you did call the seasons to be less of a -- not a material effect on the performance of the business over that time. I'm curious, and you did have some discussion on your call this morning about Halloween overall. Can you tell based on orders how Halloween is shaping up at this point in time and the degree to which they have could have an effect on Q3 sales? Then, you also talked last quarter about having some early seasonal sort of fall product coming out, how is that -- is that in the market already or going into the market sooner? How could that play into your overall seasonal sales in Q3? Melissa Poole : Sure. So for Halloween, we do have orders from retailers. We start to get those orders way back in May. In fact, we try and finalize the orders that by the end of May and we have already shipped some product. The way the season unrolls, we continue to ship product from really June through early October. So we have pretty good visibility to those orders. Now, it's always possible that orders could change in the coming months, but that is not a very common occurrence. I'd also remind you as we listed in our comments about half of our products for Halloween is purchase for self-consumption. So that's really candy ball. It's a celebratory kind of treat for the family and then, that about 40% of it then falls into the back part of October, which are the trick-or-treat sales. So we feel good based on what we've seen. We've been partnering closely with our retailers. We feel good about many retailers wanting to kind of lean in. We also think that consumers will find creative and safe ways to trick-or-treat. It is an outdoor event, and it's an event where a lot of masks are already worn. There is no evidence of the virus being passed through packaging or food. So we feel pretty good based on what we're seeing so far from a consumer feedback, but if trick-or-treat tends to be a little lower than expectation, clearly, we will focus even more on to treat for me and the candy ball occasion. So you already know that we shifted some of our portfolio to more everyday packaging to protect the downside should Halloween sales be a little bit later to really manage that liability. So at this point in time, based on what we're seeing, we feel pretty good. From a holiday perspective, we do have an early read on the holiday. We have started producing product. At this time, we don't really see seasonal participation being significantly impacted, and a lot of that is due to the fact that many holiday occasions and consumption is actually at home. So we think that will be less likely to be disrupted, but obviously, we will continue to monitor that closely -- to work closely with our retailers as we have with Halloween. Chris Growe : That's great. Thank you. And just one quick follow-up if I could, which is in relation to retailer inventory levels. As you ended the quarter, I just want to get a sense of where they were. Obviously, you did under-ship demand in the quarter. There is an expectation for an increase at the second half of the year. And I just want to kind of tie into that seasonal discussion. Is that a component of the expectation for higher inventories in the second half of the year? Thank you. Michele Buck : Yes. So inventory was about 1.5 point to 2 point headwind on our first half growth, and there were really a couple of factors that drove that. Part of it is, as you recall last year, we had a build of inventory as retailers were perhaps anticipating a price increase. So the lap from that creates part of that. Secondly, we were depleting inventory as a result of consumer stock-ups and the acceleration that we saw in takeaway across our portfolio. So we've been working really hard and had very strong customer service levels versus the industry. But yet, we've still been continuing to replenish to kind of catch up with that accelerated demand. And then, the third factor that really falls into that equation is non-measured channel softness. We've talked to you about owned retail locations, world travel retail, the foodservice, some of those businesses that don't show up in measured happen to be the same ones where we have some of the greatest softness. So the -- so the Halloween piece is not really a factor in that inventory piece. It is much more around the everyday businesses on the non-measured channel. Chris Growe : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from lion of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jason English : Hey good morning. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. Jason English : Good morning. Congratulations to you and your organization for navigating everything so smoothly right now. But looking at the forward, I'm kind of curious of the pricing outlook. You guys mentioned that you expect pricing in North America to moderate to 1.5% to 2%, which I believe is pretty much singularly the effect of last year's price increases. Said differently, it's suggested you're not expecting some of this trade efficiency and benefits of lower promotions to sustain. If so, why not? Because it looks like the promotional environment for both you and your competitors remains pretty subdued in July, why would it come back so quickly? Michele Buck : So first of all, as we look at the promotional pricing that you see as you look at some of the retail scanner data, we do not believe that data is correct. There is a lot less auditing going on during this time than previously. So the biggest issue we think there is we think simply the data is just not correct. We are continuing to see the kind of promotional activity that we had planned in the second quarter behind Smores, Twizzlers, our Reese's In and Out lever promotion. And going forward, we feel good about the promotional plans that we have in the back half of the year with our retail partners. Steve Voskuil : So yes, I -- here we're going to -- we look at revenue management all the time. And so, driving trade efficiency is part of the base plan, but as Michele said, the outsized impact that we saw in the second quarter was really more data issue. We were out in stores, Smores were out; Twizzlers were out, so we had quite a bit of promotion. Jason English : Interesting, I heard that. Thank you. That's good context. Sticking on the same theme of pricing book flashing forward, as you mentioned, you're on the brink of cycling last year's price increases. Pricing has been part of your growth algorithm in North America for the last couple of years. I don't think you've announced anything new and you are about to cycle these. As we think beyond this year, should we expect pricing to exit part of the -- you don't want to be part of the algorithm for the foreseeable future? And if not, why not? Michele Buck : No. I mean, we remain committed to the pricing strategy that we've discussed with all of you before, and that's really behind smaller more frequent price increases. While we have price each of the last two years, that certainly doesn't mean within our strategy that we have plans to price every single year. We really take a strategic approach where we look at opportunities across the portfolio. Right now, all of our pricing initiatives remain on track, and we continue to think that we're going to see price realization in the second half. But as you know, we have several different levers that we rely on to drive the business. Pricing is one of those, but brand investment, key retailer initiatives, innovation, merchandising and new capabilities, that balanced portfolio levers to drive growth is something we really believe in, and we think that that's very important. So we take a lot of variables into consideration when we decide, what to price, when to price, how to price, and we will be consistent with the stated strategy going forward. Jason English : Understood. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Robert Moskow : Hi, thanks for the question. I guess, two smaller ones. A follow-up to Jason's, my understanding is over the past couple of years, you had taken pricing on about two-thirds of the portfolio, which left another third. It's likely to be raised as well. I mean, has something changed since the start of the year with how you're looking at your list price increased plan? I guess, that's the key thing, has something changed? And then just a quick follow-up on Mexico, I was surprised to see Mexico down so much. Is -- do you put that in the category of countries where chocolate is just not part of the overall embedded culture of the country, because I thought Mexico had been pretty resilient in the past? Thanks. Michele Buck : Yes. So relative to pricing, our plans were not impacted or changed for the year. It is correct that we have a third in portfolio that wasn't priced in those actions, but we did not change our plans throughout the year on pricing. So we just continue to look across and decide when and what and Halloween was the right time. Relative to Mexico, we certainly have seen big disruptions in that market. And I would say -- I wouldn't put it as much certainly -- there are certainly pockets of Mexico where there are economic issues, but the biggest factor in Mexico has really been the trade, the spread of the virus and then the shutdown of key elements of the trade specifically, the wholesaler network, distributor network where we have about 50% of our business. And so, it was really the trade shutdown that impacted our business in Mexico. Robert Moskow : Okay. Can I sneak one more in? Your outlook is very robust for third quarter and -- based on the strong exit rate and the visibility at Halloween. Is your assumption that the other 40% like the element that's based on sell-through, is your assumption that, that part will be down year-over-year? Have you been appropriately conservative on that element in your outlook? Michele Buck : I think that we have been appropriately conservative. I think we have partnered with our retailers. So we've utilized that visibility. We've taken into account what we think the category will be. And importantly, we've also taken into account what we believe our market share of the category will be based on recent performance and what's happening in the marketplace right now. So I think if we see pressures in Halloween, that's probably going to show up more toward Q4 than Q3 as it will be at that -- those end periods post the holiday relative to sell-through at that point in time. Robert Moskow : Got it. Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Lazar : Great. Thank you very much. Even -- in 2Q, even with the weaker volume and elevated COVID costs that you incurred, the company was still able to expand operating margin by 170 basis points or so. So just as we think through the second half, some of those, I guess, COVID discrete costs begin to dissipate, volume starts to pick up based on some of the comments you made about exit rate and things of that nature. So perhaps investment spending, I guess, picks up as well. So I guess, as we think about margins in the second half, what would be maybe the key points to consider versus let's say, where Hershey came out in 2Q? In other words, where do you expect margins to be up similarly to what you saw in 2Q or what are some of the discrete factors that could change that one way or the other? Thank you. Michele Buck : Steve you want to hit that one? Steve Voskuil : Yes. I'd be happy to take that. You're quite right. Q2 turned out to be more favorable from a margin standpoint than we expected going in. While we had incentives, some of those incentives were less than what we had expected for the quarter. Insurance costs that we had expected for the second quarter came out more favorably. We talked on the last call about productivity, and productivity being a risk for the quarter and in fact, the productivity goals in manufacturing were still achieved. Probably, the lingering piece, PPE and cleaning costs, that will continue. So we kind of take Q2 and look to the future, obviously the incentives based on everything we know today are about returning. Productivity, we expect to continue along with our full-year plan. PP&E is not a big cost in the quarter, so I think $3 million, $4 million a quarter as a benchmark. We will continue to drive SG&A savings both at the corporate level with travel and meetings, as well as at the division level. And then, as you said, we're going to spend a little bit more back from a DME standpoint. So while we had an opportunity in Q2 to optimize, probably optimize a little bit more than we had expected. We are going to invest back more behind the brands as we get to the back half of the year, so -- and a little bit less pricing benefit as well. We've had a lot of pricing benefit across the first half. As we lap now, that will also start to come off. So those are the big drivers. That's the reason, again not giving specific guidance, but expecting some margin acceleration in the back half. Andrew Lazar : Very helpful there. And then, just one last one, Michele. The market share gains that Hershey has been seeing, right, have been pretty phenomenal and unprecedented in many ways and certainly, a big part of that has been the company's execution, right, particularly at the point of sale and in-store and leveraging the advantaged distribution model that you have. I know there has been some issues that competitors, let's say, around -- let's say, supply chain resiliency and things like that. So I'm just trying to get a sense, as you think through how market share can sometimes be pretty sticky, both when it's gained and when it's lost, how do you think about the share that Hershey has picked up? I would assume that at some point, as things normalize and competitors get back there, whatever supply chain resiliency, there'll be some additional pressure on that front, but I'm trying to get sense of how much do you think of share can kind of structurally remain or be sticky versus let's say, some that might be more transitory, if you get what I'm asking? Michele Buck : Yes. Absolutely. I guess, I'd start by saying, even pre-COVID, we had very good momentum in both takeaway and market share starting last year. And we really attribute that to the balanced activation plan and great execution that we had even then, which was a good -- I think the right balance across advertising, distribution, pricing, seasons and innovation, kinds of that suite of levers that we have. Obviously, since COVID, as you mentioned, our team has really stepped up relative to execution keeping product on shelf, while there were some struggles among some other competitors in the marketplace. And certainly, we do know some competitors also begin to rationalize SKUs to simplify their portfolios. So we do believe that the recent share performance is likely to persist for several more months. And while we do think that huge game that we're seeing is likely to revert next year as we lap the strengths, we do believe that some of the gains will remain in the long term and sustain. Andrew Lazar : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Ken Goldman : Hi, thank you. I also wanted to follow up on Jason English's question really just to make sure I understood your response, because you did say in the prepared remarks, price realization contributed 4.2 points in the quarter, slightly ahead of expectations due to incremental trade efficiencies realized from revenue management and selective programming choices related to COVID-19. So sorry for reading all of that, but I did interpret this quote, especially the part about selective programming choices to mean that you did reduce your reliance on discounting in the second quarter. So I guess, given that you're not changing your guidance for the back half of the year, doesn't that imply that you're going from a period of less discounting to a period of sort of more normal discounting, or what am I missing there? I'm just still not sure I understand exactly sure what that quote means maybe. Michele Buck : So we did pull back a little bit in the second quarter and that was primarily around refreshment given what was going on with refreshment being so incredibly soft and the functional demand just not being there as much for that product, especially given its presence in convenience stores and also a bit on grocery just because that part of the business was doing so incredibly well on its own. A little bit on Smores, we had really strong demand on Smores, but what I would say is, the trends are now stabilizing as the most severe declines on certain parts or most severe accelerations on parts of the portfolio in Q2. We saw the wildest swings and those tend to be stabilizing a bit now. So we are kind of going back to a more normalizing approach. It wasn't a huge pullback in Q2. It was very selective against those parts of the portfolio. Does that help? Ken Goldman : Yes, I know that is -- that's clear. Thank you. And then, for my follow-up, some of your peers in the broader sort of food and beverage industry have talked about making some pretty meaningful reductions to their product portfolios in terms of SKUs. We haven't heard quite as much from Hershey on that. I'm just trying to, or I'm hoping to get an update from you in terms of how you think the breadth of your portfolio is right now in a post-COVID world and whether there are any plans, I guess, sort of major reductions or miners to some of the products that you might have. Michele Buck : Yes. So we had already really embarked upon SKU rationalization program really over the past two, 2.5 years. So we had pretty aggressively taken a look across our portfolio and made a lot of those cuts. So at this point in time, we're feeling pretty good about where we are. I don't see a major program. Obviously, it's always an ongoing focus to optimize and to cut some of the small things, but the biggest steps we had already taken previously. Steve Voskuil : And meanwhile, some of the new innovations that we brought to market that you have done quite well. So where we brought in new SKUs, whether it was Kit Kat Birthday or Take 5. Ken Goldman : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Nik Modi : Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So just kind of two-parter on innovation. It's nice to see retailers picking on new products. We've been seeing that trend now. Obviously, people were a little doubtful of how much new product would actually get into retail, given the focus on A level SKUs, but Michele, I was wondering if you can just opine on. Has there been a philosophical difference at retail that you can discern in terms of what products they are actually taking on the shelf? And I'm really kind of get out our large companies like Hershey advantage from the situation in terms of new product given well-known brands, etc. And then on the second piece of that, just some of the work we've done looking at numerator data would suggest there's a heavy degree of interaction between the Hershey portfolio and the snack cake category. And I know you've dabbled in that area to some degree with Mrs. Freshley's, but can you just give us some thoughts on how you're thinking about that adjacency kind of opportunity a little bit more broadly? Michele Buck : Yes. So starting with your first question, we definitely have seen retailers, especially during the COVID situation, dial up their focus on power SKUs, must-have SKUs, really because of the huge consumer demand and needing to make sure that they were in stock on the most important items and also just because of labor needs and all of that just a focus on what's really going to deliver the business. I think that's what -- why you're seeing. Many of the manufacturers also now started to really rethink their portfolios to do the same. So I would say, yes, I think the retail trade is saying, hey, right now, this is a time where we need to focus on those biggest most important items. So I think you're right about that. And then, I'm sorry, remind me again, your second question? Nik Modi : Yes. No problem. Snack cake category. Michele Buck : Snack cake. Yes. So we have seen some similarity, some crossover in terms of candy and snack cake consumption. They both have some similar traits in terms of really hitting the kind of the treat sweet tooth and filling certain needs for consumers that are similar. So I think we have seen some of that crossover certainly from consumers. Nik Modi : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Bryan Spillane : Hey, good morning everyone. Just two quick ones for me. One, you gave some color in the press release about performance in June. So, just curious if July has continued to progress the same way. And then, the second question is more around distribution gains. I think you referenced in response to Andrew's question, the -- some of the issues that some of your competitors have had. So I guess, if they're reducing SKUs and maybe having trouble keeping some things in stock, have you actually gained shelf space or gained distribution in this time period? And if so, kind of, if you could give some color in terms of which channels, is it more convenience and gas, more in grocery? Just some more color there would be helpful. Thanks. Michele Buck : So we haven't really seen any material changes in July versus our trends. So there are some geographic differences, just given the big differential across geographies as a result of COVID. So now, I would say we're feeling good about what we continue to see. And market share is pretty consistent though. In terms of our market share performance, I would say we're feeling pretty good in terms of continuation of that trend. Bryan Spillane : And I think wherever we've had opportunity to take advantage of getting shelf space or a broader distribution it's crossed over all classes of trade. Michele Buck : Yes. And we certainly -- those are some of the benefits that I think you don't always see immediately because you have planogram timing, etc., to realize those benefits. So some of those benefits, I think, we started to see in June and that might be what's driving some of our continued trends -- positive trends in July. Bryan Spillane : Okay. So you have seen some shelf space gains or some distribution gains. Michele Buck : Yes. Bryan Spillane : Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of David Driscoll with DD Research. Please proceed with your question. David Driscoll : Great. Thank you and good morning. Michele Buck : Good morning. David Driscoll : Great. Good morning. I wanted to ask about a little bit on the seasonal candy and then, a specific question on Halloween with the related. So I know for the full year, roughly a third of the portfolio was seasonal candy. But in just the second half of the year, can you give us the breakdown between your seasonal sales in your everyday sales? What percent of the second half is actual seasonal? Michele Buck : Well, Halloween, we've said previously, is about 10% of our full-year business. Certainly, seasons are higher in the second half than they are in the first half because Valentine's is our smallest holiday. So you really have Easter as a big one in the first half. We don't really want to get into some of the specifics by quarter. But I would say that the season's impact is definitely bigger in the second half than the first half. David Driscoll : And then, I -- just to be clear, I think what you're saying is -- I think you said this in the release that you don't expect Halloween to have a material impact, so it sounds like it's flat. And if seasons are 40% or something like that of the second half and the seasonal numbers are expected to be roughly flattish and your everyday is running up 9%, I think that's what you also said in the release. And is that not a decent way to think about how to model North America in the second half? Michele Buck : I think your math is generally correct. I can't argue with the math. The one thing I would say is you're speaking specifically to measured channels, and you need to remember the impact of non-measured channels, owned retail, foodservice, air travel, world travel retail, which is airline and the trends on those businesses as that does -- that has been as we've shared the biggest hit in our business. So while those channels are certainly not shut down like they were in Q2, they're in the recovery mode. And the recovery mode is definitely going to be a slow uptick. David Driscoll : Okay. So that -- there is a little adjustment to maybe the everyday 9% that I quoted because of those unmeasured channels and then, seasonal is where the expectation is roughly flattish given what you know today. Obviously, there's plenty of caveats and what could change. So I think I'm understanding you. My follow-up question is just on your marketing and your overall expenses. So a tremendous job. I'll give you guys huge kudos on what you did in the second quarter to get your margins where they came out. I'm just curious that is there a learning here that you can actually run a significantly tighter expense budget on a go-forward basis? I'm guessing that the COVID made you do certain things that you normally wouldn't have done, and the results here are, market share gains are fantastic. When you think a year forward, two years forward, can some of these cost reductions be very sticky because it's proving that you didn't need to spend some of those monies in order to produce, I think, excellent results at retail? Michele Buck : I mean, I think SG&A is clearly an area that we're expecting that how much we need to spend will change permanently over time. So I think that piece, yes. I think on the marketing expenses, it's a little bit different. Certainly, some of our pullbacks were as a result of certain businesses like refreshment that were down 40%. We just didn't think it made sense to be spending into that. Then, part of what we were able to do was to leverage the fact that a lot of advertisers dropped out of the marketplace and as a result, the costs of media were less than we had planned them to be. And so, we were able to have a nice outcome there. As advertisers come back into the marketplace, some of that pricing benefit is not going to be available anymore. So while there may be some ongoing efficiencies and we are always looking to tighten our data knowledge and have capabilities around media since we are big spenders to get more for our money, and we're always building capability to take it to the next level. There were some unique circumstances there as well. Steve Voskuil : Yes, I agree. Certainly on the pricing for some of the media exposure that came down, that was a big benefit. I think we did benefit from tools and investments we made around marketing efficiencies and driving ROI and optimizing. We haven't talked as much about some of those tools, tools both on trade efficiency, but also marketing spend efficiency. And those tools allowed us also to be more agile as things evolved quickly. And so, that part is something we'll look to leverage further in the future. David Driscoll : I really appreciate it. Those are helpful comments. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. David Palmer : Thanks. I just want to follow up on that Halloween comment. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned that the seasonal performance would not have a material impact to second half results. That's an interesting comment. I mean, we're not doing the official guidance here. If you would think that, that would be a big variable, it might be 20% of your second half revenue. So is there something that's giving you confidence there? I know that you wouldn't be making such a comment without perhaps orders in hand or some insights around the ability for you to some of that through, even if it doesn't happen to trick-or-treaters, and I have a follow-up. Michele Buck : Yes. I mean, I think the confidence drivers are orders in hand. Some of the dynamics that exist around the fact that only half of that Halloween volume is trick-or-treat. The fact that the trick-or-treat behavior is outdoor. People do wear masks. So as we get closer, we're feeling good about that. Now obviously -- certainly, we didn't provide official guidance in the back half of the year. And there is uncertainty and volatility overall given the virus, but based on everything that we know and the visibility we have and with every day we get closer, we feel that we've taken an appropriate look at what we think can happen and have really factored that into our outlook as best possible. We've mitigated some of the downside risks with the everyday portfolio versus all the Halloween packaging. Steve, anything you would like -- Steve Voskuil : No. I agree. I think for the things we can see and certainly, the things we can control, we're optimistic, but part of the reason for not providing more specific guidance is, there are things we can't control and probably can't see. And for those reasons, there still is potential variability in the back half, but everything we can see gives us a plenty of confidence. David Palmer : That's helpful. And with regard to COVID-related costs, you mentioned those were a gross margin headwind in the second quarter. Could you give some color as to how much that might have been? And how much of a gross margin headwind do you think it's going to be for the year? Thanks. Steve Voskuil : In terms of just COVID related costs? David Palmer : Yes. Just COVID related costs. Yes. Steve Voskuil : Yes, probably on the order of \u2013 for the gross margin somewhere between $15 million and $20 million of COVID-related costs. Again, we had predicted it might be more than that. In fact, it came out less. As we go forward in the rest of the year, the biggest piece that will stick around is going to be that personal protective equipment, cleaning costs and so, if I take that $15 million to $20 million, think about maybe a third or a quarter becomes sticky to the back half. David Palmer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Rob Dickerson : Great. Thanks so much. I had a question on c-store traffic momentum there. We've obviously seen convenience store channel improve throughout the quarter overall. It seems like hopefully that momentum is sustainable as long as people are leaving their homes more and going to the channel, but also the channel is more relevant for using a lot of other companies in this space and usually. I would think there is a little bit more of a margin benefit just given the single-serve product that you're sold there that you saw there, but with remarks, you said that margin mix really didn't have much of a headwind. It doesn't sound like you're really speaking to that as a risk going forward, which is great. I'm just kind of curious where I'd be wrong and thinking that some of that single-serve product that usually have a better price per pound and potentially better margin impact, and why it didn't and why it might not? Michele Buck : Yes. I mean, I think that's generally correct. We are seeing a rebound in convenience stores as people are out and about more. And I think also as some people are choosing not to travel via air, but do vacations that are more driving vacation, so I think that's helping as well. So yes, I think certainly instant consumable and that class of trade are helping the business. We're also seeing instant consumable strong and strength in other classes of trade as people have returned more now to grocery stores and trips and shopping. So the strength is not just in convenience stores. So that is helping our margin mix. Rob Dickerson : So, it sounds like even though -- if I think about a movie theater, right, even though consumers might not be going to movie theaters and buying Hershey products there in a single-serve format as well as traffic of C-stores that maybe like you're seeing in grocery stores a bit, that is still trying to get their fix, right? So they might not be buying the big bag, but they're going to check out. It sounds like what you're saying is maybe some of your checkout momentum in traditional mass in grocery is doing better than maybe it had. I know if we go back to couple of years that at one point in time, that was a focus of yours. Is that fair? Michele Buck : Yes. That is fair. It has definitely -- we're seeing growth on the instant consumable piece of the business and again, I think a lot of that due to more traffic in those channels. Rob Dickerson : Right. And it just lastly just to keep it simple and summarize because you did say instant consumer is growing right. So -- Michele Buck : Yes. Rob Dickerson : Because there is -- it has to be doing very well. It has to be doing very well for traditional mass in grocery at checkout, and that's more offsetting the pressure away from home in other channels. Michele Buck : Yes. Rob Dickerson : Got it. Thank you. I pass it on. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please receive your question. Alexia Howard : Good morning everyone. Michele Buck : Good morning. Alexia Howard : Hi, there. So two questions for me. Could you maybe just talk a little bit about what's going on in the e-commerce channels? Other companies have talked about real surges are both in terms of click-and-collect and in at-home delivery. I'm wondering whether maybe the meltability of chocolate in this hot season means that the delivery option isn't quite available to you. I'm just curious about what's going on there. And then, my second question is more about your marketing mix strategy in the second half. We know that in the TV channels, the production isn't going to be as -- there's not going to be as much in new production in the fall and therefore, the effectiveness of marketing on TV may drop off. But also, I know that you've announced that you're pulling back on your Facebook spending in the second half as well. So I'm just wondering where that spend is going to go. Is it going to be into other digital channels or how are you thinking about the mix? Thank you, and I'll pass it on. Michele Buck : Yes. So, we have continued to see our category and our business perform really well in e-commerce and seen that growth accelerate. So in the second quarter, we saw a growth of 200% on our e-commerce business, and that was really driven by strengths, both in the click-and-collect kind of pickup and in delivery fulfillment models. So, we saw growth across the board there. You're right that we tend to have a little bit of a softer business during the hottest months in the summer, but we're continuing to see that pretty strong growth even throughout June. So I think just the trends are bolstering that. And that growth, importantly, we're seeing across every piece of the business is a seasoned take-home and instant consumables. So in the past, we've spoken about e-commerce being roughly 2% of our business, and we believe that this channel by end of year could approximate about 5% of our total company sales, so definitely seeing a lot of strength there. When it comes to marketing mix, certainly, we're seeing efficiencies that we're going to realize in the back half in that TV class of trade. So it continues to be a really viable for a place for us to put money, given the very high household penetration on our business, and the sheer number of eyeballs that you can reach on TV is very efficient. And as we look to digital and the pullback on Facebook, we see taking those funds that were in Facebook and redirecting them still back into other digital media venues. So that -- those dollars will stay in digital, but just on other platforms like YouTube, for example. Alexia Howard : Great. Very helpful. I will pass it on. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Steve Powers : Great. Thanks, everybody. I guess, first internationally, I appreciate the category itself was under pressure in many of your key markets as you called out, but can you talk a bit about your market share trends in those markets and maybe a little color as to how you're thinking about relative prioritization of investments in those markets as hopefully they begin to improve in the months and quarters ahead? I guess, what I'm thinking through is should we expect to exit the crisis with similar levels of strategic emphasis and standing in those emerging markets versus the run rate going in, or is there a risk that you slip a bit behind as navigating the U.S. landscape takes precedent. Michele Buck : Yes. So we are gaining market share across most of our international markets. So we feel great about that. The weakness that we're seeing is really driven either by the COVID-related shutdowns in most of the markets, government-restricted shutdowns and especially in a lot of those developing markets. And in some markets, the economic impact of that, that impacts the category, but we feel great that we're winning share across most of those markets. So I don't think that we will slip relative to our strategic emphasis. We are still committed to what we want to get achieved in those markets. We still believe in the long-term potential on those markets. So we are pulling back on a temporary basis just consistent with where the business is, but continuing our focus on all of our key initiatives to win long term in those markets. Steve Powers : Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess if I could just to clean up back on the forward pricing outlook, your core category is exceptionally rational in recent years. So, I guess just given your share gain success and I guess, also just the economic pressures that might build in the back half and into '21, how do you size up the tail risk that some of that price rationality might come under challenge or at least make incremental pricing tougher to come by and at least the near term? I guess, harking back to Jason English's question earlier. Michele Buck : We consider a lot of factors as we're trying to decide how to think about how and when to price. So as it comes to recessionary times, over the past, we've seen that our category tends to have less of the highs and lows that some other categories have, because we are an affordable luxury, so at times, when people need to cut back on other categories. So I -- we will continue to just evaluate all the different factors for when, how, on what we will take pricing. But we aren't particularly concerned that we can't price in recessionary times. We have done that at the point in the past. Steve Powers : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. John Baumgartner : Good morning. Thanks for the question. Michele, just in light of your general sense of optimism for Halloween, I guess, sticking with the brand investment plans, it sounds as though, there will be some shift of March Madness and Olympic spending into H2, but could you also talk a little bit about the in-store-merchandising activity? Are you expecting an uptick in retailer support for the season this year and I guess, increased display space for your portfolio broadly? Michele Buck : Yes. I mean, we are expecting based on our partnerships with retailers, very strong in-store support for Halloween with most of our retailers. We partner with every retailer, and each retailer has their own strategy in terms of how much they support the holiday. And so, I think in general, most of them are continuing to lean in to anticipate and drive to a very strong Halloween. And we believe that given our ability to execute during this time and some of the -- you've seen the results of that on the share in the marketplace, we certainly think that even our performance within the category for Halloween should be quite strong. John Baumgartner : Okay. And then, just coming back to international and the sales weakness there, I would guess a presumed review of the cost structure. Given the success you had in right-sizing China, which was sort of a unique animal in its own right, to what extent is COVID stress sort of identifying new opportunities in other geographies where you can use this downturn to maybe further strengthen your global cost structure more sustainably? Michele Buck : Steve, you want to talk about that? Steve Voskuil : Our international team does a great job of looking to optimize their P&L and cost structure on an ongoing basis. And certainly, the new opportunity here is that business, I think, curtailed in some markets, has shown even further potential there, but I think to Michele's earlier point, the strategic priority of international hasn't changed. And so, we want to continue to appropriately invest behind those businesses to unlock the long-term growth that we believe is there. But to your point, certainly, we will never waste the crisis in terms of looking at every possible way to be efficient with P&L. John Baumgartner : Great. Thanks for your time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Michael Lavery : Good morning. Thank you. Michele Buck : Good morning. Michael Lavery : Can you just talk about corporate costs a little bit? It looks like it's the lowest they've been at least about seven years, certainly declined sequentially. You called out the travel and meetings' savings. How much of that should we expect to continue as there are other savings there that might revert back in the second half we should watch out for? How do we think about looking ahead on how that line might unfold? Steve Voskuil : Yes. The progress that we made in the second quarter, we said from the travel and meetings standpoint was actually better than we expected going into the quarter. And given everything we see today, business has not returned to whatever normal was. And so, we expect in the back half, we're going to see those savings continue. As I think about the second quarter, we saw probably $20 million, $15 million to $20 million of opportunity across all of those areas. And I would expect to see something like that, maybe a little bit less, but something like that in the back half as well. And beyond that, that was really the biggest driver from a corporate cost standpoint. Michael Lavery : Okay. Great, thanks. And just following up on Halloween again, can you give us a sense of what some of your options may be? I know you recognized, there is a little bit of uncertainty still on how the consumer sell-through goes. If that disappoints, do you just have to battle back? Can you buy some down? Does it depend on the magnitude of inventory that may be left? Can you just let us know what the options are, and how you might be preparing for any of those? Michele Buck : Yes. So the first thing we're doing is trying to make sure that we ensure sell-through, which is something we always do, which is having the right merchandising, getting product on the floor as early as possible and leveraging media investment to remind consumers, excite consumers about the holiday. Then post-sell-through, there is always a markdown period that occurs based on how much product actually sells through, both in total as well as you have to get the mix right across each piece of the portfolio. And so, every year as we build our plans, we plan for that, and this year is no different. We planned for that. So we tried to mitigate our risk by -- as we look at the trick-or-treat portion of the portfolio pulling back on seasonal packaging, having more every day, so that's one -- another lever we used and then, really working through the markdown plan. Michael Lavery : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our last question this morning comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed with your question. Ken Zaslow : Hey good morning everyone. Michele Buck : Good morning. Ken Zaslow : I just have two questions. One is have you at all has changed your innovation plans for -- I don't mean for the next two months or three months, but for the longer term? There's been a lot of companies have said look, our 150th new innovation, we're not going to do any more. So, has there been a refinement of the innovation program for the next, call it, one to two years? Michele Buck : So I would say we already did that. A few years back, we took a look at our innovation strategy and really streamlined and focused on sustainability, and that really did lead to not having that 150th new innovation, but really being very real about a focus on sustainability that would lead to the greatest profitability and top line for us. So, we're not really making any changes related to COVID, but I feel really good about the work that we did a couple of years ago, changing our innovation strategy to make sure that we really did have that focus. Across the balance levers, innovation is one of five or six levers, if not the lever. Ken Zaslow : Okay. And then, when I think about the longer term and obviously, the COVID-19 is evolving for sure, but are there certain milestones, are there certain things that would have to happen for you to rethink -- it seems like, as of now -- let me start with this, as of now, it doesn't seem like you've been meeting structural changes to your business model, changed a little bit of investment here and there, but nothing that would be longer term. Are there anything that you would see in the COVID-19 implications that cause you to have to do something, and what would that thing be that you would have to do to change your business model, if that makes sense? Michele Buck : Yes. So I guess, I would say there is nothing that I would say is a big fundamental shift to our business model. There are some changes. So for example, e-commerce, the acceleration in e-commerce is here to stay where consumers are in terms of household penetration of people buying online is where we thought it would be maybe five years from now. So to some degree, that is a shift because e-commerce is a little more than a channel. It's almost the business model as well. So fortunately, a few years back, we had invested to build capability in e-commerce, and I feel really good that we were set up to be able to take advantage of that, but we are taking some further steps internally to develop e-commerce to really now be one of our mainstream channels versus before it was kind of I'd say in the growth development phase. There are other consumer trends, things like cocooning and people staying at home, the importance of value on the short term, some of those trends that we are making some changes to adapt to, but we always change -- adapt to ever-changing consumer trend. So I wouldn't really call those out as business model changes. And then, certainly, there will be some changes in terms of how we work in terms of some people working more from home, the ability to have people working remotely, potentially a shift to suburban and rural settings, which actually can be a strength for us. But I would say, e-commerce is probably what I would put in the -- in one of the bigger shifts like that. Steve, is there anything you would... Steve Voskuil : Yes. Just -- if I turn the question around, I would say COVID has also shown us places where we have strengths through this and having the agility in our supply chain, the retail execution capability, as Michele said, the digital investments, the agile investment approach, I think those are things that we've learned are even stronger in this kind of environment. Ken Zaslow : What if, Steve, refreshment like everybody is working from home a little bit more, people don't need to have their meetings and so, your refreshment category may change dramatically or maybe the size of Halloween or the size of Easter may kind of contract. Are there thoughts on those two potential outcomes, or at this point, you would say not really something that we'd be worried about? And I'll leave it there, and I appreciate your time. Michele Buck : I mean, first of all, based on seasons, I would say not something that I'd be worried about at this point in time, given the results that we saw on Easter, which was really in a peak period of people being told not to go to grocery stores, and we still had a pretty decent Easter. I mean obviously, we will all learn more as we go through every one of these, but at this point in time, I don't see a major business model shift needing to come from that. And I would say from a refreshment perspective, yes, people will be working from home, but people are also going to be going out and they're going to be out in about doing things, I think, more so. There could be some -- I'm going to say more shifts as there always are in portfolio relative to people baking more, people doing one thing or the other more, but not that I think -- I really think about as a massive business model shift. Ken Zaslow : Great. I really appreciate it. Stay safe. Michele Buck : Thank you. Steve Voskuil : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Ms. Poole for any final comments. Michele Buck : All right. So it's Michele. I just want to thank you all for joining us this morning. As you know, this was a new format for us, and I hope that you found it helpful. Let me close with some very brief remarks. Over the years, our great brands, our advantaged margin structure and our consumer-centric strategies have enabled us to navigate volatile environments and consistently deliver strong stockholder returns. We take great pride in our passion to create new ideas, innovation and ways to connect consumers to continue to make moments of goodness in their lives. With our relentless focus on the consumer, an adaptive operating model and our remarkable team of people, we are confident that we can once again respond to the changes in the marketplace to deliver growth and unlock long-term value for our stockholders. Melissa, we'll be available after the call to answer any additional questions you may have. Thank you very much. Stay safe and have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host. Ms. Melissa Poole, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Hershey Company. Thank you. You may begin. Melissa Poole : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for The Hershey Company's third quarter 2020 earnings Q&A session.

Joining me today are Hershey's Chairman and CEO, Michele Buck; and Hershey's Senior Vice President and CFO, Steve Voskuil. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Lazar : Great, thanks so much. Good morning, everybody. Michele Buck : Good morning, Andrew. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. Andrew Lazar : Hi. I'm curious, for the past several years, Michele, the majority, if not all, of the company's organic sales growth has come really from pricing, as opposed to volume or consumption growth, and much of this is obviously due to the success of the company's new pricing model and the associated volume elasticity that comes with it. I guess, that said, as you look forward into '21 and beyond I'm curious if there is a sort of focus internally on maybe regaining some better balance between the two drivers, and if so, would you expect to see some of that maybe develop more fully next year? Thanks so much. Michele Buck : Yes, Andrew, absolutely. I think we've shared before that we do view pricing as an important part of our growth algorithm, but we are very focused and would like to drive to greater balance between price and volume. We have good visibility into Q4 and 2021, and we do expect volume trends to improve. Part of that will be us lapping some of our pricing elasticity from last year, and also a continuation of some of the strong share gains that we've seen to date that will carry into the first part of next year. I think you can definitely count on seeing volume being a more important part of the algorithm next year, and we feel good that the calendar of programming we have, the innovation, the media is really going to help to drive some of that. Andrew Lazar : Great, thanks very much. Michele Buck : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Ken Goldman with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Ken Goldman : Hi, thank you. Along the same lines of 2021, if I can, Michele, you pulled back a little bit on advertising this quarter. It's been a little up and down this year for understandable reasons. I'm just curious what your thoughts are in general on what the company's plan is for advertising and marketing in general as you get into what hopefully will be a more normal year in 2021. Michele Buck : Sure. So we definitely believe in investing in our brand. That is a critical piece of our growth model and the business. So clearly, as we mentioned to you, we had pulled back on some spend in areas where we just thought, given the pandemic, it didn't make sense. For example, in refreshment, where we knew consumer usage was down significantly, but as we look to 2021, and as we've started to see the momentum that we're seeing and some of the recovery, we definitely plan on taking our investment levels to where we would like them to be, and more in line with where they have been historically. So you'll see us really gleaning in to drive the consumer and to leverage some of the behaviors that we're seeing. Ken Goldman : Thank you, and then for a follow-up, you didn't do any share repurchases this quarter. I think that's the first time in two years, and that was -- the last time was right before you bought Pirate's Booty. I want to ask if the lack of repo is an indication of a pending deal of course, but I am curious how you would describe the current environment for potential transactions. I guess particularly are targets maybe more willing to sell because they can do so off a higher sales number than usual, or are they more hesitant because they I guess kind of want to ride this demand wave as long as they can? Michele Buck : Steve, do you want to take that one? Steve Voskuil : Yes, I'd be happy to. So first, just on the share repurchase, I will just echo what you said. Don't read anything into that. I would say for this year we have taken a little bit more cautious approach to liquidity in general, going back to the beginning of the year, and the COVID phase, just taking a little bit more cautious approach. We will be revisiting that as we look at next year, and I would say in general our capital allocation priorities haven't changed. With respect to M&A specifically, it's probably more the latter. I think people are still -- the ones that are the most interesting are riding the wave, and they still have valuation expectations that look like they did pre-COVID, if not higher, but I would say we're continuing to have an active funnel, continue to look at a number of opportunities, and we'll continue to update the market as appropriate. Ken Goldman : Great, thank you both. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Robert Moskow : Hi, thank you. I think the recovery expected in 2021 in International and Other is -- you have a 2% headwind this year in 2020, but can you give us a little bit of color as to the condition of your business in Mexico, and India, and China, and is it easy to assume that things can go back to normal or has the pandemic impaired your commercial capabilities at all or the retailers' desire to merchandise confectionary products in those markets? Michele Buck : Yes, so first of all, I'd start by saying certainly there's a lot of uncertainty and volatility with the pandemic. We all know that we're seeing the ups and downs of occasional increases and spikes in markets around the globe. That said, I would say that we were pleasantly surprised by our performance in International. Our team did a great job executing in this very challenging environment, and I think that we've seen, while each market is a little different and the use of the category is a little bit different, consumers are really looking during this time for brands they trust, and we've done a great job over the past couple of years building the Hershey equity. So we were pleased with the rebound we saw in many of our markets. I think in mentioned in India our business was up 6% versus it had been doing. We gained market share across almost every market on our core chocolate category. So I wouldn't say that we believe our ability to drive the business has been impaired in any market on a permanent basis. Just as we are pivoting in the U.S., I think we've pivoted to where the opportunities are in international, and we feel good about the recovery, and plan to deliver against that. Robert Moskow : Thanks. Can I dive a little bit deeper into Mexico, are there any packaging requirements that the government is making on nutritional values or any concerns about the category, how that might impact the category? Michele Buck : Yes, absolutely. So the government did put in place front-of-pack labeling changes in Mexico, and that new packaging is now in the market, and we are beginning to monitor the trend. We believe consumers know our category is a treat, they know it has sugar, and so, we expect that we'll see less impact from that than perhaps other categories will, but we will, of course, keep a close eye on that, and I would say Mexico has been one of the harder-hit developing markets relative to COVID. So, we feel good about the progress we're seeing, but it's a little slower than some of the other markets. Robert Moskow : Okay, very good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. David Palmer : Thanks. Good morning. A question on your share gains in the U.S., and particularly in chocolate. You really, and in your prepared remarks, you touched on this how adaptive you were by market, by channel, by need state and then in terms of S'mores, and some of that is related or might be related to supply chain. Could you talk about that part of it? And then I think the reason I'm asking is because if there is a supply chain breakdown or lack of adaptability by a competitor maybe that will represent share gains that they can reverse somewhat in '21, and I have a follow-up. Michele Buck : Yes, absolutely. So I would say I believe our share gains are a testament to both our strong brands, our consumer understanding our programming as well as to the supply chain execution, and execution at retail, both of which tend to be core advantages for us as a company. So I think we're seeing our categories and our brands are definitely resonating with consumers, and as you mentioned, we really pivoted with the consumer. So very early on we tried to understand how consumer behavior was changing, and we've talked to all of you before about the fact that our category split is a third, a third, a third take-home, instant consumable, and seasonal. And as we saw consumers shift to more at-home behaviors we very early on shifted the focus in our portfolio to really dial up S'mores, Twizzlers for movie nights, our baking product activity, and then within the season, even with Halloween we made that decision to lean in, and drive, and build a Halloween season versus back away from it, and everything related to that relative to let's set the season early so we can get consumers in, in pre Trick-or-Treat, let's make sure we were smart about the portfolio that's out there, and not overly index to seasonal skews, et cetera, and then we worked really hard on messaging, to message consumers safe ways to celebrate the holiday. We dialed up ecommerce as consumers shifted to ecommerce, and because we had invested in capabilities in that we were able to do that. And then I think a lot of the strong investments we've made in other capabilities over the years helped us during this time to execute well, and some of those go beyond supply chain. So we've made investments in better understanding consumer trends. We've made investments in our ability to forecast at a much more granular level. We've made media investments to target better, and certainly we've invested in our plants all along the way, which really enabled us to pivot quickly to safety protocol, and really be able to continue to execute, and then we made the decision to keep our retail sales team at retail sales. As I think about that share gain, I would clearly -- we would expect to continue to see share gains clearly through the spring of '21. We would expect that they would moderate after that, that we're certainly expecting to hold on to share, and we will continue to drive our outstanding programming, and also continue to execute supply chain with excellence. David Palmer : That's helpful. Thank you, and then, just on -- any sort of one-times from this year that we should be thinking about from model perspective, I'm thinking about COVID related friction costs this year, but also you might add back some SG&A in parts and other -- so, any one-time type comparisons that we should think about. Thanks. Steve Voskuil : Yes. I think we talked about it in the prepared remarks. On the top line, we had about a two point impact. So, you can right away say there's a drop through that two point in profitability, but then if you take a look at the net of costs for COVID, so protective equipment and employee incentives that we had early in the year, and you net them against the DME optimization, the BD optimization that we did, as well as the T&E savings, it was a net -- slight positive on those two pieces, and so, that, we would expect to mostly go away. We'll have some lingering costs next year, probably less one-off in any quarter related to COVID, PP&E and so forth that continue, but net, it was just a slight positive outside of the 2 point drag on the top line. David Palmer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Chris Growe : Hi, good morning. Michele Buck : Good morning. Chris Growe : Hi. I had a question for you. If I look back at Halloween, I'm curious if you slipped this season apart, and you had given some information on this last quarter, sort of the early season part and the Trick-or-Treat season part, kind of how each piece performed, if you can give a little color on that? We have some information from IRI, but I'm curious if you have better information than we have, and then, I'm also curious, as I think about that early part, if that's more indicative of what you expect for the holiday season as you move into Christmas and that kind of time where you don't have a Trick-or-Treat event. Can that early season, if you start that season early in particular in stores, be more like what we saw in the early part of Halloween, if that makes sense? Michele Buck : Yes. So, clearly, we saw that within the season, the early part of the season performed more strongly, and the later part that's more Trick-or-Treat focused performed a little bit softer. Now, we had anticipated that. So, overall, the season performed exactly in line with our expectations. As we look at the total season, we were quite pleased that our sales were actually up versus a year ago as was our sell-through up versus a year ago. So, during a time of the global pandemic I think it speaks to the resiliency of the category, and the consumers' desire to really hold on to and continue to celebrate the traditions, and fun occasions like this in their family lives. As we look at holiday, holiday has some different consumer dynamics than Halloween, and so, we believe it will behave a little differently. I don't think we're going to have some of the pressure that we anticipated coming into Halloween. The category should be quite strong. Consumers use the product in different ways. It's much more about family occasions. We aren't as big in gifting some of the areas of the category that might be a little bit more hard-hit. So, we expect solid results given that skew to at-home consumption. Chris Growe : Okay, thank you, and now, just to follow onto that, are you shipping in holiday products early, and would that have been an incremental benefit -- do we see some of that in the third quarter more than we would have seen historically? Steve Voskuil : Yes, we did -- just like we did with Halloween; started shipping in holiday a bit early, so you do get some pick-up in the third quarter for that, that will take away a little bit from the fourth quarter. Yes, maybe on the order, you have 50 basis points, and we also do that to drive the consumer behavior early as well, just as we did with Halloween, as Halloween was still on the floor, holiday was also out there, so that consumers could also gravitate to the holiday pretty quickly. Chris Growe : A first symbol of\u2026 [Multiple speakers] Michele Buck : Yes, strong Halloween sell-through really helps us because it helps us get that fast start to holidays because it clears the space to be able to put holiday on the floor. Chris Growe : Okay. Thanks so much for the color there. Michele Buck : Absolutely. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jason English : Hey, good morning folks. Congratulations on a good quarter first of all. Michele Buck : Thank you. Jason English : I want to pick up on the back of Chris' questions and tease out little bit more of the outlook on holidays going forward. The Halloween early part selling was phenomenally smarter much than I think any of us expected. I think a big part of that is due to the merchandizing programs that retailers had. Think they started bigger and earlier than they usually do. Has that you think influenced how they are going to approach other seasons going forward? Said more directly, you expect retailers to provide more merchandising power behind the category into holiday, into Easter than they otherwise would coming out of the success we saw in Halloween? Michele Buck : So, we've always had pretty strong merchandizing support at every season, and one thing we always think about with season is when we get it on the floor because we know that consumers will buy that holiday or seasonal product whether it's Easter wherever early for in-home consumption. If you get it out there, it kind of sparks the trigger of fun moments earlier. So, I don't know that I could say specifically that we can anticipate that retailers are going to merchandize it even more than they ever have. I do think that they will be focused on making sure that they definitely get it out early to capture the early part of the season since that is the piece that is a bit more stable. There were a few retailers as you can imagine with the uncertainty of Halloween and the fact that all these decisions about what to do with Halloween really had to be made in early May when things were quite uncertain and schools were closed and bars and restaurants and all of that. So, there are few retailers who had pulled back on Halloween, and based on the results of the season this year, they will likely have more confidence going forward which should help to make even stronger Halloween next year and probably also build confidence for the other seasons like Easter. Jason English : That makes a lot of sense, and then, one more question on the -- I am sticking with follow-on to Chris' questions which I thought was solid. The early part of the season versus the later part of the season, the early part of the season was exceptionally robust, and you said late part was a bit softer, but somewhere in your remarks I think you said all in total holiday, so both earlier part and late part finished mid single digits for the category. I think bathetically to get the category down in single digits, we're going to have to see some pretty sharp declines coming through the retail sales data in the next couple of weeks as we capture that late part of the season. Am I thinking about it right? Am I interpreting your comments correctly? Michele Buck : Yes. Yes, you are interpreting them correctly. So, category was down mid single digit overall as much as our business was actually up, and, we will see some of those declines. Jason English : Okay, thank you very much. Michele Buck : One other thing that to just keep in mind, there is a little bit of a timing impact from the Nielsen and IRI data given the season was on the Saturday versus on Thursday and based on retail reported days. So, you'll probably even see it's down even more, and you'll have to wait till kind of mid November till you see some of those last couple of days being reported. So, some of it when you see will be just the timing shift of the day of the week, and some of it will certainly be the declines in Trick-or-Treat at the end. Jason English : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with DD Research. Please proceed with your questions. David Driscoll : Great, thank you. Good morning and congratulations on the great execution in the quarter. Michele Buck : Thanks David. David Driscoll : I had -- so two questions. The first one -- just two relatively small ones on the other expense commentary, I think the year-to-date period other expense is only very small number, but your full-year projection $100 - $110 million on that means it's a fairly massive number in the fourth quarter. Am I doing the math right? Is that correct on how the time lays up for other expense? And then related just another follow-up on your volumes expected in the fourth quarter, I think in your prepared comments, you said North American organic growth similar to third quarter are pricing only a half point. So that would mean volume is something like five percentage points positive in the fourth quarter. Am I doing those two piece right? Any color you can give on those two comments? Steve Voskuil : Yes, I would be happy to do. So, on the tax side and other expense, you're exactly right. We will have a large other expense in the fourth quarter. Now that's consistent with what we have been seeing even in the early guidance earlier in the year, and then along with that, a lower tax rate in the fourth quarter to do the math on the tax rate you also have to solve for a lower tax rate, so that's how those two lines will play out, and yes, on the volume up in the fourth quarter, you're thinking about it the right way. We do have some inventory replenishment that will happen in the fourth quarter. We saw that in the third. We'll see some more of that or that continue into the fourth. We're also lapping some elasticity after the price increase last year and in this continued strong share gains. Those three things are part of driving that fourth quarter volume. David Driscoll : Michele, like bigger picture question, first, you took pricing in most of the portfolio outside of seasonal candies in 2018 and then in 2019. Given the negative impacts to Halloween for the entire category, would you agree that now is probably not the time for seasonal price increase actions, maybe this gets delayed to 2022 or sometime later until we get a normal consumer environment? Essentially, I'm just asking you to assess your ability to pass through cost increases through pricing actions. It's a weird environment, and I don't know how it's altered that calculus. Thank you. Michele Buck : Yes. So, obviously, I can't speak to any specifics about our specific -- any upcoming specific pricing actions. What I can say is there's been no change to our pricing strategy of smaller, more frequent increases, and that doesn't necessarily mean we're going to have the same amount of pricing every year or that we would always announce pricing at the same time. We did, for example, actually have a small price increase this past year on our food service business in the third quarter. So, if we look over time, we have been able to price at various times, at various economic conditions. So what's important to us is we do think pricing is an important part of our algorithm, but as we've talked about before, we really want to grow through balanced growth across levers, distribution, velocity, innovation, price, et cetera. So, we know that that is certainly the one piece of the portfolio that we have not yet priced, and I think it's fair to say that given that we haven't announced a price increase at this moment in time, the magnitude of pricing in 2021 would be less than we've seen in prior years at least at this point. We've been pleased that we've seen conversion be pretty good this year, even in a very difficult economic environment, and I think that continues to demonstrate what we've seen over the years, which is the category is very resilient. Our brands are strong. We continue to invest into our brands and that does allow us for an even greater amount of pricing power. David Driscoll : Really helpful. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Steve Powers : Yes. Hi, thanks. Good morning, I guess building somewhat on earlier questions, I'd love a little bit more color around your general mindset heading into 2021 as you work through your planning process. Clearly there are parts of your business that have been under pressure this year, international, movie theaters, vending specialty, et cetera, and hopefully all those set up for at least directional recovery in the year ahead, but at the same time you've been gaining a lot of share, you've had great success in at-home categories like baking and with initiatives like S'mores, all of which is fantastic momentum, but again could set up for difficult year-over-year comparisons. So, as you size it all together, I guess, is there a way to frame your thinking at a summary level to what degree those various puts and takes sort of just met each other out in your mind? Or are you approaching 2021 planning thinking we've got either a net easier or a net harder set up versus what one like it sort of typical? Thanks. Michele Buck : Yes, so, we're pleased with the momentums that we are seeing, and I would say, your call-outs in what you shared about some of the ups and downs on the business, I think, are very accurate. We believe we're seeing that our category and our brands really resonate with consumers and especially at a time like this, where they're looking for some of those moments of goodness, moments of happiness. We're really pleased with how we've been able to pivot with the consumer and also pivot with our capabilities to be able to execute within this environment, and we feel good about that momentum and our ability to continue pivoting. So, this year, obviously, it was consumer shifted to take home, and so, we dialed up S'mores and we dialed up Twizzlers and we dialed up baking, and we leaned in to create the season to make sure that we could capture that opportunity giving consumers new ways to participate in Halloween that frankly we believe those things like candy slides and candy graveyards, and all the creative things people did, will probably become a part of their ongoing traditions, and they have just evolved. As I mentioned, we were able to dial in and accelerate e-commerce, and I think as we look to next year, we're prepared if the consumer pivots yet again to be able to pivot with them, I think we've built and we've demonstrated ability to execute well during this environment, and also to pivot from an executional perspective, whether it's at retail, or in our manufacturing facility. So we're very focused on that, we've captured as well some cultural, positive effects, I think capabilities we've built in terms of operating in this environment that perhaps allow us to make decisions more quickly, and we think that is an enabler for us going forward. So we feel good about that as we look to the future. Steve Powers : Thanks for that, Michele. I don't know if you want to take this one or Steve, but just as a follow-up, sort of unrelated, just any comments you might have on just current levels of promotion, the promotional environment, what you expect to see over the balance of 4Q and into '21? Thanks. Michele Buck : Yes, we don't see any significant change relative to promotional activity. We didn't really see it this year, we didn't execute anything significantly differently, and nor do we expect to see anything in the future. Steve Powers : Okay, perfect. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC. Please proceed with your questions. Nik Modi : Yes, good morning everyone. Michele, I was hoping you could provide some context on the partnership with Google that you use during the Halloween period, and do you believe this capability can be leveraged for this holiday season, but also kind of in your everyday business, as you kind of look forward? Michele Buck : We're continuing to leverage different types of data and analytic and insights more and more across the business, and we continue to really try and stay on top of tracking consumer sentiment, and leveraging data and analytics to tailor copy to tailor messaging to tailor media. So more and more, we're operating at a more sophisticated level relative to using multiple data sources, and also using that to reach consumers at the right places, with the right message at the right time. Nik Modi : And I guess what I'm trying to get at is, is this kind of new way of kind of targeting consumers like the return that you see from what you've done like, can you just give us any kind of understanding, because one thing I'm noticing across the entire CPG landscape is, companies are spending more money, but they're spending more money on the same message, and in fact, new consumers are being recruited, usage occasions are changing, and so it really requires a change in how you talk to those consumers, and so I find this, Google partnership incredibly compelling for you guys. So I'm just trying to get better context on how it's changing the return profile of your spend, you can provide any context on that? Michele Buck : So we have a continuous focus on optimizing media and the returns on our media, we always have, we've had strong media ROI forever, and our challenges, how do we keep making them better, and then we continuously optimize based on that. So right now, it's a big spend area for us. So it's an area we're very focused on elevating, and it is about you making sure right now, I would say some of the biggest opportunity is that opportunity of even more precise targeting, and then once you have that target, the ability to alter the message so and then we alter our media mix accordingly, and I would say we see significant movement in that mix on a year-to-year basis as we get better at that, I think we've raised some of the opportunities of how we've gone just very deep relative to specific seasons, whether it's the S'mores by zip code, or whether it's specific holidays and looking at sell-through at the store level basis to be able to dial-up media on a zip code level basis. So you'll continue to see more of that, frankly, that's just becoming a way of how we operate now. Nik Modi : Great, and last question, just from an innovation standpoint, can you just provide any context on kind of what's remaining in terms of innovation this year, and how things are going to work in 2021, if there's any clarity you can provide on the launch timing? Michele Buck : Yes, so we feel very good about our innovation. Some of the innovations that we're excited about that are new to the market include the Reese pretzel product, a Reese cup with pretzels in it. We've had a range of Kit Kat flavors. We know on a global basis a big part of the Kit Kat portfolio, our flavors, they tend to do quite well. We are on a very small level launching snack cakes under our Reese's trademark which delivers that Reese experience in a slightly different type of product form, and we feel good on that, versus based on some of the early test results, and we will have more coming. Some items on our take-home side of our business, that won't get announced till early next year which is typically the time we announce those things just given reset windows. No major change in our innovation strategy. We think it's working very well for us, we think its right-sized, and we think it's delivering much more sustainable results. Nik Modi : Great, I'll pass it on. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Michael Lavery : Thank you. Good morning. Michele Buck : Good morning. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. Michael Lavery : You've talked about the increase in ecommerce sales, even if it might have decelerated a little bit, but it's up very strongly. You've said in the past that basket and dollar rings are higher online. Is that still holding true with the growth that you're seeing now? And on the margin side, you've mentioned that there's a small gap, but that you were narrowing it and that scale would help that. Is that coming along the way that would have expected, how does that look now? Michele Buck : Yes, I mean we've generally seen larger basket sizes in general across most channels this year as people are doing fewer trips and more quantity per trip. So I think that's been somewhat of just an underlying dynamic given the pandemic impact in the marketplace. For us, on our ecommerce business, we've seen very significant growth across the board, but particularly in click-and-collect where people actually go and pick up their groceries, and also in the local delivery models as well versus kind of national deliver. The margins that we have are similar to what we see in bricks-and-mortar. Michael Lavery : Okay, great. That's helpful. Michele Buck : In those two areas -- excuse me, in those two areas where we have similar products, obviously, that we sell in bricks-and-mortar. Michael Lavery : Right. Michele Buck : Steve, anything you want to add? Steve Voskuil : Yes, I would say is that, we've said in the past, that overall, ecommerce margins are a little bit dilutive, and it's there, as Michele just said, in click-and-collect and local delivery very similar, not much impact, and that's probably two-thirds of our ecommerce business. The piece that is more dilutive is the ship-to-home, and in particular cold ship, and that's an area where we continue to work with our customers and look at our overall investment with those customers and joint business planning to drive efficiencies over time so that those margins align. Michael Lavery : Okay, thanks, and I just want to follow up on S'mores. I thought that your data analysis and insight there to push that the way that you did was interesting. As you're seeing cases rise again now are you replicating that? Are you seeing similar results? Is there a S'mores surge we should expect, and that would be it be right to assume that those Hershey Milk Chocolate Bars are probably some of the highest margin ones that you have? Michele Buck : So we have really expanded S'mores from at one point it was a very focused time of year to really capturing S'mores as a year-round opportunity especially if you think about how different weather is across the entire country. There are lots of opportunities to continue to expand that. So we're very focused on that. We're also very focused on the upcoming baking season, where we know that consumers will be spending time at home. It's already a natural baking season, and so, we'll be looking to really optimize what we're able to drive leveraging insights around that season as well. Michael Lavery : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Bryan Spillane : Hi, good morning, everyone. So just one question for me, and I think there was a little bit of a commentary in the prepared remarks about some -- inflation in cost of goods sold. So maybe, Steve, could you just give us a kind of a lay of the land right now in terms of what commodity costs, and just cost of goods inflation looks like currently? In the context it seems like freight costs are going up. You've had some competitors talk about cocoa prices going up. So, just trying to get an understanding of directionally where inflation is headed right now. Steve Voskuil : Sure. Yes, for us, I'd say overall, it's been relatively stable; so, on the commodity side, relatively stable. You saw big movements in commodities across Q2 and Q3, and of course we've talked in the past week -- mitigate some of that volatility with our hedging program, and I would say today they're fairly stable. There are increases in freight costs. There too, our team do a great job of longer term contracting which helps mitigate some of that increase. So, that hasn't been a real material impact for us. We have seen some increased warehousing cost, and part of that's volume and flow through along with the share gains and the volume increases that we've seen. So, we called that out in the prepared remarks, but in total, at least sitting at this point, we'd say overall COGS is fairly stable, and we'll get more guidance on 2021 when we get onto the fourth quarter call. Bryan Spillane : But, I guess we could infer from that, at least from where we sit today that at stable -- is something that looks like it kind of carries into next year unless something changes. Steve Voskuil : Yes, I think that's fair. Next year, as we get the -- you're going to have the 2020 and 2021 crops of cocoa start to bear the LID. So, there's that to consider, and then, there's other things obviously on the gross margin side as Michele said, a little bit more volume-driven than price-driven mix driving growth margin, next year we'll have our continuing productivity goal, and again, a lot more on that to come when we talk on the fourth quarter call. Bryan Spillane : All right, thanks, Steve. That's very helpful. Have a happy Thanksgiving everyone. Steve Voskuil : Thank you. Michele Buck : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. John Baumgartner : Good morning. Thanks for the question. Michele Buck : Good morning. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. John Baumgartner : Michele, I like to follow up on the Reese's snack cake. You mentioned that it's small right now, but Hershey went down this path about 15 years ago, and it didn't really translate into anything material. So, I'm curious what the data tells you in terms of changes in the landscape now. Does this maybe mark a new phase of the snack section evolution? I guess where do you think it slots in? I mean does it compete against the Twinkies or cookies, just where's the target market? Any big picture of thoughts would be appreciated. Michele Buck : Yes, absolutely. So, I think we've approached this in a very thoughtful and measured way, which was not a mass launch where we just threw it out there and tried to make it as big as we possibly could at one point in time, but we did a very targeted in-market launch for an extended period of time, so that we could really learn about the proposition. We spent a lot of time in terms of developing the product to make sure that we really understood some of the drivers of liking in the snack cake area, and we also really thought about where and how we wanted to play and launch. So, this for example is very C-store focused. It is a single serve type of item. So, we're keeping it as a focused launch. It is definitely bringing the great chocolate and peanut butter taste profile that we have on Reese's to the snack cake market. So, yes, it is playing in that snack cake area versus other snack cake brands. We know that -- we had participated in this category for many years through licensing, and we learned through that that our brands could participate, and extend to the category. We also know that morning snacking has been a growing trend, and our confection items skew more to afternoon and evening. So, this is a chance for us to participate in some of that growth because that is where these snack cakes get utilized. So, again, we're going to be very focused throughout, and we'll put it in locations where we think we can garner incremental space, and where we think there's a strong consumer fit, and starting at c-store and looking at other select areas, and then, if it continues to perform well, we will expand, but we will watch it closely and take a measured approach. John Baumgartner : Great. Thanks, Michele. Michele Buck : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Alexia Howard : Good morning, everyone. Michele Buck : Hi, Alexia. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. Alexia Howard : Hi, Buck. Can I just talk about the C-store channel specifically? It's obviously been under pressure because of the pandemic, but I imagine that that happens in sequential improvement, and [May] [ph], could you maybe just give us some numbers about how that channel is recovering? Michele Buck : Absolutely. So, as you said, we've continued to see strength in food, and mass, and dollar as consumers eat more at home. The c-store class did see a bit of recovery in the third quarter. So, we saw the business grow in the low single digits in the third quarter, which is definitely an improvement versus those early pandemic trends. It did then slow a little bit as summer ended and those summer road trips decreased with kids going back to school. Our business has tracked pretty much in line with the channel, and significantly ahead of the category. So, we have share gains of about 120 basis points in Q3 in that channel. So, I'm seeing some rebounds and some recovery versus where it was in the past as people are out and about a little bit more than they were. Alexia Howard : Great, and then, as a follow-up -- follow-up actually on Bryan Spillane's question about freight costs, I remember back in 2018 as freight costs spiked back then, that was quite a bit of a headwind for you. It seems as though it's not pretty much of a problem this time around. Are you able to tell us roughly what proportion of COGS freight actually represents, and how much of that is already contracted out, and what you've learned since 2018 to make the situation this time around a bit more manageable? Thank you. Steve Voskuil : Sure. So, yes, freight costs right now, we don't see as a material impact as it continues to rise, it will have a bigger impact right now again because we're contracted and our teams do a great job of managing those contracts, it's not having as material of an impact. It's roughly 10% of COGS overall. So, it's not in material, but right now, not seeing enough movement there given the contracting to really drive a material dock on overall COGS. Alexia Howard : Great, thank you very much. I'll pass it on. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Feeney : Good morning. Thanks very much, and thanks for a great Halloween, personally and professionally, you know, the leanest of my financial ambitions has been to give out full-sized candy bars, which I was again able to execute. So, thank you. Two quick ones; I noticed in the data, your pricing in North America is plus 19 on the take-away, plus 33 is what you reported. Is that just the math or is there some shrinking or different mix within retailer margins there is my first question. And secondly, historically, when you look at -- today's velocity is generally tomorrow's distribution and your velocity has been fantastic. This is a weird year. A lot of people's velocity is fantastic, but do you anticipate gaining shelf space in that everyday place -- you look at these baking items, you look at these take-home items, like this is phenomenally better velocity, forget about just the total sales that you're seeing there. You anticipate significant share gains, perhaps structural ones, I'm talking share of shelf here as retailers do resets for holiday and -- going forward. Thank you. Michele Buck : Sure. So, two parts to your question, the first was around price and some of the discrepancy, and yes, there is a mix impact. Honestly, it might be best if Melissa goes and takes you through a deep dive on that because there's some complexity associated with it, but the P&L is definitely accurate. As it relates to velocity, yes, good velocity -- I like your phrase today's velocity is tomorrow's distribution, I do think that's very accurate. As we look at the seasons, you asked about holiday, we certainly have been able to garner incremental distribution, incremental SKUs throughout the year both in terms of everyday and seasons because we've been able to deliver, and the items that we then put on shelf, not only could we supply them but then they moved. So, we do feel good about that. We'll continue to take a very disciplined approach, and be very careful that we don't over-skew. So, we really have to look at the productivity of every skew, and as long as it's good, we will be there, but yes, we have been able to gain some distribution, and going forward, I anticipate that we will continue to be able to perhaps even through the first quarter of next year. Jonathan Feeney : Thanks very much, and I'll follow up with Melissa. Michele Buck : Very good. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with BMO. Please proceed with your question. Ken Zaslow : Hey, good morning, everyone. Michele Buck : Good morning, Ken. Ken Zaslow : I just have one quick question. Everything has been asked and answered. You made a reference in the prepared remarks about [indiscernible] is tracking ahead of your strategic plans. Can you talk about what are the key learnings that you've developed through your years as a CEO that has really helped you kind of make this a better acquisition and implement it? What are your key learnings, and what do you take forward to future acquisitions? Michele Buck : Well, so, I think a lot of learnings along the way, I guess I would start with there's a business model for brands that we as a company are best with, and that is branded items where -- brand matters, where the business has significant scale, probably close to that $100 million mark, and it needs to be a business that has a high growth margin because that's what our business model is. We're a branded company, we invest a lot in marketing, and we have high margins that enable us to kind of invest and grow, invest and grow, and that's our model. That's what we need. So, I think that was one of the biggest learnings was to help us select the asset. I think secondly, really understanding the strengths of the brand and really being able to do the right deep dive on which KPIs we think predict the ability for a brand to scale, and then, I would say really trying to scale the business well, and I would say hey, we've learned lessons the whole way along the way. As you know, in the past, we bought some businesses that were too small, we bought some businesses that had lower margins, and we had some that we perhaps didn't execute on the scaling as well, and I think we've had a very focused effort on the scaling as well, and we've gotten much better at that relative to supply chain, relative to the talent that we need when we buy a company like this where we want to keep the entrepreneurial spirit, we want to keep people who know the brand and the business, but we also have to be focused on the point that -- we're also at a point where we want to scale the business. I mean I'd go back to the scale, the branded nature, the high margin are probably the biggest ones, and then picking the right underlying KPIs that say it's a sustainable business, because if we can do that, we can make in some. Ken Zaslow : Great, I really appreciate it. Thanks. Stay well. Michele Buck : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Ms. Poole for any final comments. Melissa Poole : Thank you all for joining us this morning. I will be available after the call to answer any additional questions you may have. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Operator : Thank you. Our first question is from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. Nik Modi : Yes, hi. Good morning everyone. Happy New Year. The \u2013 a couple of questions. First on just trade spend and just thinking about, obviously things have been pulled back quite dramatically in 2020 and as we think about 2021, I'm just curious in terms of your discussions with retailors, how your talking about trade spending.  One of the things that we've been looking at is kind of this reset of price sensitivity given that no promotion, so the effect would have been in the market for the past nine to 10 months. So just wanted to get your thoughts on that? And then the other question is just, if you can give us a kind of a round-up of the innovation program that has already been announced, just so we can get a sense for the program in 2021? Thanks. Michele Buck : Sure. So relative to trade spending and promotion, we didn't have any meaningful shifts in promotion activity. Our levels for the year were pretty consistent with the prior year. So we were basically flat. The IRI data will support that, so I think there is a little bit of a disconnect in the Nielsen data. So we don't really expect any material changes as we go into next year as well. And then as you look at innovation, certainly I think some of the bigger items we have, Kit Kat flavors which has done exceptionally well for Kit Kat on a global basis. We have the Stuffed Reese\u2019s product and our Reese Innovation tends to also always be quite strong for us.  We have a permissible line of products to really address that benefit of better-for-you that we are under developed in across our portfolio, and that will include Kit Kat Thins, which is an addition to what has been an already launch of a successful platform with Reese Thins. We are also relaunching our sugar free line to Zero-Sugar, really focusing on Hershey and Reese and launching Hershey and Reese organic products. So those are the highlights of the year, and I would say overall if you looked at our innovation, the level of innovation is about comparable to prior year. Nik Modi : Excellent! Thanks Michele. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : The next question is from the line of Ken Goldman with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Ken Goldman : Hi, good morning. Thank you. Two from me if I can. First, I wanted to think or ask about you know the early holiday shipments that benefited for Q. Obviously, I think over the 4Q, 1Q \u201821 period it's overall a big benefit to you. So I don't think of it as early shipments, but I am curious, how do we look at the potential for a difficult comparison in 4Q \u201821 or should we expect maybe some of these additional orders that you receive this to kind of revert to normal with your competitors or you know maybe better able to fill demand going forward. Michele Buck : So Ken, if you think about the Easter that we\u2019ll be shipping for in Q4, that 2022 Easter, happens to be one of those incredibly long Easters, and so typically we tend to ship a bit more in the Q4 prior to a long Easter. So we don't expect that there's going to be a material difference from a year-to-year basis because of that. Ken Goldman : Thank you, and then just for my follow-up, you know your commentary on cocoa butter costs was I think more constructive than some observes maybe expected, which is great. But I'm hoping you can expand on that a bit, and maybe this is for Steve, just how do we think about you're all in cogs inflation this year versus 2020? Steve Voskuil : Sure, yes I'm happy to take that one. We are clearly facing, on an all-in basis facing more inflation this year than last year. As you know we\u2019ve got the hedging program which mutes some of the cocoa impact as the LID flows through, and we have some longer term contracts on things like freight and warehousing.  But that said, neither hedging or contracting is going to fully cover the exposure that we have in inflation and I think, if I take freight as an example, you know we look at things like demand planning and how important that is, and to the extent our plans deviate from the way volume comes in and have them go to the spot market for example where we have less cover, there is some risk there.  So net-net more inflation, you know we've got a pretty good level of cover and that's included inside of our guidance, but we're not fully covered either on the commodity side or outside the commodities. Ken Goldman : Great, thanks so much. Operator : The next question is from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions. Andrew Lazar : Good morning everybody. Michele Buck : Hi Andrew. Andrew Lazar : Hi! I guess first off it seems as though Hershey\u2019s building in a fair amount of reinvestment spend for \u201821 in both media and other capabilities. Maybe can you give us a sense of the magnitude of this sort of reinvestment and maybe more importantly the ability to be sort of flex up or down really depending on how things play out this year. Michele Buck : Steve, do you want to talk about that? Steve Voskuil : Happy to take that one as well, yes. So on the on the media side, I\u2019ll say media and SG&A in general, we\u2019re probably looking at something like mid-single digits across those pieces. On the media side, clearly we want to you know defend and extend our share gains and so you know we were thoughtful in how we deployed media last year. We made some reductions kind of mid-year. We actually turned it up a little bit towards the end of the year and we want to make sure as we go in to this year that we've got enough to defend and extend share. On the SG&A side, you know we kind of think about it in two buckets, and I'll say things like you know normal corporate expense, travel will be very tight year-over-year and there \u2013 you know these year based budgeting formats, watch headcount, all of that.  And then we talk about the investment side. In the investment side we do have some capabilities that we want to continue to fortify, you know S/4 in the ERP program drives some OpEx through the SG&A areas. More expansion of our digital capabilities which came into play quite a bit over the course of last year and anything analytics and insights, but again we talked a lot about them last year as well, but continuing to extend our capabilities in those spaces. And so you know could it slide us up or down? I think as we get into the year and we see how you know the shape of the P&L and we see how the top line delivers, you know we probably have some latitude and flexibility there, but I would say we have pretty firm investment plans at least in those areas as we start the year. Andrew Lazar : Great! And then just lastly, I'm curious what drove the decision to take a better pricing on sort of one portion of the seasonal business, and should we also assume, I would think that this does not necessarily preclude Hershey from looking at other parts of the seasonal portfolio at some point if in fact you know it deems necessary to do so down the line. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of what goes into that sort of decision making process? Thank you. A - Michele Buck : So if we step back and think about the seasonal pricing holistically, let me just remind you that we had priced the Halloween portion of the season and Halloween is our biggest season, so that had occurred previously, and that's about, you know roughly call it 10% of our season. And then we mentioned that with the pricing in Holiday, Valentine and Easter, you know we're capturing at least another 10 points. There are certain parts of the season, some of the everyday items that got priced along with prior, instant consumable pricing actions. So at this point in time with this recent pricing action we really have priced almost all of the season in the past year so here. Andrew Lazar : Great! Thank you very much. Operator : The next question is from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Robert Moskow : Hi! Thanks for the question and congrats on a really strong year. You provided some helpful color on your cocoa buying and cocoa liquor and butter, but it sounds like these hedges are protecting you this year. Is there an extensive step up in 2022 and it is possible that more pricing will be needed when the full effect of the LID comes into play, not just for you, but maybe for the overall industry. Michele Buck : Steve, do you want to talk about that? Steve Voskuil : Yeah, I\u2019d be happy to. So I don\u2019t want to get too far ahead and get into 2022. Obviously as we said in the past, our range of hedging could to be anywhere from three months to 24 months and so and that flexes across commodities and so \u2013 but I don't want to get too specific in \u201922. But as we know, hedging helps smooth the impacts over time.  At the end of the day as the LID flows through and sticks, then eventually that\u2019s going to come into play in the cost, and so hedging can smooth that out, but to the extent the cocoa price picks that up, eventually that comes through. Now then that ties into the broader strategy Michele just talked about in pricing and looking at the overall P&L and other things like cocoa sourcing and recipes and things of that nature. A - Michele Buck : And Rob, let me just clarify one thing. So the LID is fully in play this year, so the hedges don't really impact that at all. Part of what's offsetting that as the hedge is we had even possibly prior to the LID going in or taking advantage of you know dislocations and supply and demand throughout the course of 2020. There were times when you know the cocoa market had come down for beans and things like that, so that's really there.  Just to be fully clear, the LID is 100% in the cost base for 2021, but you have some of those hedges with supply and demand imbalances, as well as that cocoa butter dynamic, which is really where the offset is. And so as you think about \u201922, those will be the two variables to kind of keep an eye on, of what could causes those costs to change, more so than the LID. Steve Voskuil : That's right. Robert Moskow : Okay, I'll follow-up on that. Maybe one follow-up. Can you give us a sense of where you think inventory levels are right now at the trade? Are you still a little bit below normal inventory or are you at normal and may be a little more color on \u2013 I think in the prepared remarks you say you might ship above consumption in the first half and below consumption in the second half. Steve, can you help us with a little bit more on that? Steve Voskuil : Yeah, that's exactly right. You know we ended the year with inventories in the trade of little below historical averages, so as we look to the next year, you know we see that could be a bit of a tailwind in the first half and a headwind perhaps in the back half at the year. Robert Moskow : Okay, alright. Well, thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Alexia Howard : Good morning, everyone. A - Michele Buck : Hello! Alexia Howard : Hi there! So it seems as though the top line particularly change was better than expected versus the guidance that you gave last quarter. I'm just wondering you know what was favorable versus where you were three months ago in terms of how the results came through in the fourth quarter and then I have a follow-up. A - Michele Buck : Sure. So Alexia, the most significant portion of our over delivery in Q4 was seasons. It was probably about two-thirds of our over delivery, and I would call it somewhat one time in nature if you think about it, so there were two parts to that.  One was we did have retailers requesting early shipments, so that they could make sure that they had adequate supply as they came into 2021, so those shipments were incremental. And then we also had exceptionally strong sell through, both for Halloween and for Holiday, and that has kind of a knock on effect where we then have less discounting required you know post the holiday and less cannibalization of the everyday business, so you kind of get back to the everyday business even more quickly.  So those investments and the focus that we put, both in terms of media and in store merchandising to drive category growth during the season really paid off for us, but that was the, you know kind of the single biggest factor that was different than we had anticipated. Alexia Howard : Right, and then as my follow-up, I just wanted a little bit more color on China. You talked about the change in the go-to-market model there. I think you're talking about using local produces to get the product out. Is that instead of going through the retailers or is that something \u2013 I just wanted to understand a little bit better exactly what the changes are over there and also how big is China today as a percentage of overall sales. Thank you and I\u2019ll pass it on. Michele Buck : So really the shift is relying less on a large owned retail sales force and instead really focusing more on you know a master distributor type of arrangement, which is just more efficient and more effective. Clearly we will give up some level of sales. There will be some slippage in taking that approach, but we think it is the most efficient and effective way for us to get our product to consumers.  And then relative to the size of China, Steve do you want to hit that? Steve Voskuil : Yeah, today it's about 60 base \u2013 you know 0.6% of company sales and so I think in the past if we go back to early \u201920, your right, we said it was about 1% of sales, and if you think about between then and now you got two things; obviously COVID had a pretty big impact on that business for us in the first half, and again strictly because we were concentrated in the gifting space, which was hit early last year and then the second piece is part of moving to the new model and some of those transition changes. Alexia Howard : Great! Thank you very much. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Michael Lavery : Good morning, thank you. Just curious to get a little better sense of some of the sustainability of your share gains and just would love to understand how much you feel like it's innovation driven, execution driven, is it the higher marketing spending? It\u2019s some amount, probably all of those, but is it \u2013 you know how much of the marketing efficiencies you saw last year? Are you still seeing and is that an important piece of what's driving some of the share momentum in \u201921? How should we just think about all that together? A - Michele Buck : Sure. So I think our share gains really are as you mentioned, a factor of many different components coming together. First of all, we do have incredibly strong brand and very strong operating capabilities and executional capabilities. I think as I look at the year, you know we got a broad portfolio and we are able then to leverage that portfolio and pivot as needed to whatever occasion are resonating most with consumers and families right now.  So certainly this past year there were a lot of those at home occasions. Things like S'mores where people were staying, being with their family at home in a smaller environment, doing movie night. You know products like Twizzlers. And seasons were it turned out to be incredibly important for consumers during this very difficult time where they wanted to cling to as much normalcy as possible and the seasons are really about traditions and rituals and connections with family and close friends. You know as you mentioned, we also made strong investments over the past several years and a lot of capabilities that allowed us to understand consumers, improved our ability to forecast where consumers were going to go, and then really execute well in our supply chain, apply data and analytics to our sales and retail coverage, data and analytics to our media in ways that we believe some others can't.  You know early on we had discussed with all of you that we made that decision to lean in and capture opportunity as much as possible during COVID, take the opportunity and create new occasions for consumers and really partner with our retailers to make sure we were there for them when they need us with our retail sales folks in store stocking shelves and meeting their product needs when some others couldn't, so clearly all of those things together were really important for us. Now, as we look at that I would say, you know we are \u2013 you know in the past typically might have been 10, 20 basis points of share in a year. Obviously this year 160 basis points of share and you know 130 on our chocolate business where we already have a 45% market share. So as we look into 2021, we believe that the share growth will continue prior to the last, which is really you know basically up to Easter, and post Easter we believe that the share will moderate as we lap those 20 gains, but it's going to be our goal to profitably sustain as much of the share as we can going forward. Michael Lavery : Okay, thank you, that's helpful color. And just a follow-up on your portfolio shaping. You mentioned in the prepared remarks you know interest in better-for-you. Obviously some of how you're doing that is spins and portion sizes that are organic type driven. But as far as M&A how should we think about maybe in broad strokes what to expect from any bigger push into better for you there. A - Michele Buck : Yeah, if you look at our M&A strategy, clearly it is focused on us capturing incremental snacking occasions and some of the ways that we look at that is you know clearly we do have a pretty sizeable business in sweet indulgent type products and as we look at consumers broad snacking needs, clearly you know salty savory and better-for-you are opportunities where our portfolio is under developed. And if you look at our past history of acquisition you would see that many of our acquisitions have been focused in that space. You know Skinny Pop is a great example of that. So clearly that is a focus area for us within our M&A strategy. Michael Lavery : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your questions. David Palmer : Thanks and congratulations on the year. Could you comment specifically on how much you think of your share gains this year or this last year 2020 was because of the supply chain advantages you might have had versus the competition. If it were supply chain or at least mostly supply chain, you would have expected diminishing share gains through the year, but the opposite seemed to have been the case, and I have a quick follow-up. A - Michele Buck : Yeah, I mean it is difficult in a year like this past year to precisely pinpoint exact amounts to any one factor, just because there was so much going on. I mean clearly we know supply chain was a piece of it. You know frankly though we also believe how we pivoted our portfolio and really shifted spending and shifted focus on our portfolio to the exact right items that consumers were looking for, you know the role that we were able to focus on with season and how much that resonated with consumers during that time.  So it's difficult to pinpoint \u2013 you know there were opportunities for products on shelves, and so I guess I would say you know I think it's fair to say some of that was probably short term benefits and then there are other components that have somewhat of a longer lasting effect. So for example, if you do well in a season one year and your sell-through was quite strong, typically the buy that you get from retailers the next year tends to be pretty strong as well.  You know if you're able to gain shelf space and get incremental items on shelves, typically if they're performing well, you have the opportunity to keep them on a sustained basis. So, well some of the benefits I think are short term, others will have that enduring effect. David Palmer : Yeah, thank you and just a follow-up on some of the comments you made about the advertising spending, as a percentage of sales going up to 21, clearly there's been a lot of changes out there in terms of the depths of digital marketing in the perhaps more exact return on investment you can get or calculate from those. I'm wondering at this point, after many years of declining, not just for Hershey but for the industry, ad spend has come down as efficiency was more the focus. Do you think that you can get to a point where you can get a flywheel going, where you spend as much or maybe even lean in on advertising as a percentage of sales as you get a better sense of the returns on these types of spending? Thanks. Michele Buck : Yeah, I mean our approach on media spend is, you know this is a category and we have brands that are incredibly responsive to media, and if you look at ROIs on media being driven by scale, profit margin and lift, last responsiveness, we win on all three of those. So we are one of the highest spenders on advertising as a percent of net sales within the industry and we really believe in that. At the same time we challenge ourselves constantly to get more from our money, and so over the years we have transitioned from 100% television advertising, probably 12 years ago to we are now down to probably 40%. I think about 60%, 65% of our spending is digital. Now the other factor that kind of plays in, in addition to being more efficient through digital which enabled us to do a lot of very targeted things such as targeting media, based on how sell-through is during a season or targeting zip codes, etcetera, you have the other factor going on, which is you know media, the cost of media in the marketplace and inflation and kind of playing through that.  If you think about 2020, our spending was down a little bit because we pulled back on some parts of the portfolio that we thought you know just weren\u2019t relevant like refreshment this year, so part of our increase is restoring some spend levels in some of those areas, and that's part of what's driving up some of our spending as well. David Palmer : Got it, thank you very much. Operator : The next question is from the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions. John Baumgartner : Good morning, thanks for the question. Yes, I guess first off Michele, I wanted to go back to the Zero Sugar product. Can you share a bit in terms of you know what's enabling that relaunch? Is there anything there recipe wise that's different and then where do you expect it to price relative to the baseline portfolio and is it fair to think that it's, I guess at least gross margin neutral relative to the base. Michele Buck : Yes, so a lot of the proposition is kind of relaunch, rebranding to \u2013 you know think about this as a product that we launched many, many years ago, more as sugar free for diabetics, which is what, you know what that was about, I don't know, call it 20 years ago probably. And really the bulk of the relaunch is about repositioning sugar free in a way that is more contemporary. You know you look at beverages and Zero Sugar and you know lots of other categories, I mean those products are just positioned entirely differently in a much more contemporary way and that's really our goal. We actually think that the products are pretty good tasting too and we're getting good response from consumers, but it is a lot about the repositioning of them. And I'm sorry what was the latter part of your question? John Baumgartner : In terms of the profit contribution, is it sort of neutral from a gross margin perspective relative to the base? Steve Voskuil : Yeah, it\u2019s in the same zip code, and the repositioning isn't going to be a you know a whole new P&L there. John Baumgartner : Okay, great. And then just you know a follow-up in terms of retail assortments. I think part of the strategy has been smarter execution that allows for some muscling out of shelf space, the front end from lower velocity and lower profit categories for retailers. But I think since COVID you\u2019ve seen some pretty sharp declines and distribution points for mints and gum. Has anything changed in that environment, whether it's an uptick in hand sanitizers or anything else, that maybe forces you to pivot in terms of how you're thinking about shelf gains to the front end in a COVID world. Thank you. Michele Buck : No, I mean I would say you know mint and gum, clearly there was pressure on mints and gums relative to COVID as a segment. But part of what you might be seeing is how frequently something scans and versus high frequency which can some impact \u2013 sometimes impact what distribution actually looks like, but sometimes it's there and not scanning. So we haven't had any kind of material changes in our brand and portfolio broadly. We feel pretty good about our portfolio, largely focused on ice breakers as a key brand, which has strong points of competitive differentiation in the product and does well in the brand. So we are \u2013 yeah, we are feeling pretty good about where we are in distributions, overall for us and our brands. John Baumgartner : Okay, thanks Michele. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Chris Growe : Hi, good morning. Just had two follow-on questions for you if I could. Just curious, Ken asked earlier about the incremental shipments that occurred in the fourth quarter. Is it as simple as looking at your consumption and comparing it to what you reported to understand like how much that seasonal shipment pattern changed or were there other factors, the inventory replenishment, that kind of thing and like you mentioned some non-measured channels that may have affected your shipments in the fourth quarter. Michele Buck : Yeah, non-measured was the other piece. Seasons was the \u2013 you know was the biggest component. Non-measured channel which we believe was driven by inventory replenishment. There was also the minor area of there were more shopping days in Q4 versus the prior year and so that contributed as well. Chris Growe : Okay. Thank you. Then just another follow-on was in relation to the international division. Do you expect international sales growth this year? You talk about achieving market stability in 2021, and I guess I'm curious also on that question excluding China, so to understand kind of how the other markets are faring given the uniqueness of China. Michele Buck : So yes, we do expect modest international sales growth which ex-China would be even higher, as we discussed will be living through some changes, the impact of some of the changes in the model, but we do expect modest growth internationally. Each market is a little bit different. You know we continue to feel good on long term basis about international. It\u2019s an important part of our business, it drives incremental, incremental source of growth for us and then as I said, each market\u2019s a bit different. India we saw some nice rebound and a strong finish to the year. Well certainly earlier in the year India suffered through a lot of COVID related pressure. In Brazil constant currency sales were good. They were double digit, but FX has been a challenge. Mexico really is the market\u2019s that contended or has tended to have continued COVID pressure, where the category sales have remained soft, even though they are improving and a lot of that is driven by two factors, you know store declines, traditional trade, store closures and less of those family celebrations where chocolate has traditionally played such an important role. So it's a little bit of a tale with multiple cities as we look at each piece around the world, but in totality will lead to modest growth. Chris Growe : Okay, thanks for all the color. Operator : The next question is from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jason English : Hey, good morning folks. Thank you for spotting me in and congrats on a strong finish to the year.  A couple of quick follow-on questions, you mostly already covered a lot of ground. First, in response to one question and I forget who asked it in terms of glide path for market share. You mentioned strength up to the period where we entered COVID and then a fade from there. Just for clarification, are you talking about a fade in gain or do you expect your market share to flip into net losses as you give back some of the outsides gains from this past year. Michele Buck : Yes, so I would say our goal \u2013 we expect we will continue to gain share through the lap and then once the lap hits, we are going to be focused relentlessly on trying to profitably sustain as much of the share gain that we can.  Obviously it's hard to predict what will happen, what will be going on in the market place competitively, etcetera. Category mix alone could pressure our share a little bit, as gum will likely rebound versus \u201820 and we are under developing gum, so that mix shift alone puts a little bit of pressure, and I guess that's probably the only specific thing I\u2019d call out.  We will be executing and it\u2019s one of the reasons that Steve mentioned earlier, that we are really making sure we have significant investments this year, so that we invest in trying to maintain those share gains. Jason English : That's helpful thanks. And one more related follow-on. I think in response to Mr. Modi\u2019s question, you mentioned that you held your trades; it\u2019s been flat for the year. It\u2019s our understanding that some of your competitors did not do the same. That they actually pulled back on some trade and pulled back on some merchandising activity suggesting that you likely gained share of trade spend, share of merchandising, share of activity in the marketplace. (A) is that understanding well placed to misplaced, and if it is sort of the reality of what happened last year, any indication that some of those folks who called back maybe leaning back in? Michele Buck : Yes, so it is a fair statement that some \u2013 we won some competitive merchandising, absolutely, as we had good product to deliver to really deliver for retailers and for consumers. But we really want share in every aspect of the business, you know velocity, promotion, shelf space, season, so pretty much across the board our share gains were pretty pervasive. Jason English : Yeah, well done. Thanks a lot. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions. Bryan Spillane : Hey, good morning everyone. I guess just two quick ones on capital allocation. First, share repurchases. I think in the prepared remarks you talked about \u201821 kind of being a more normal year. So are share repurchases or reducing the share count part of the build to the earnings growth for \u201821 or the mid asset. So are we, do share purchases create any of the earnings leverage? Steve Voskuil : Yes, they do. Again more going back to historic levels, you know recent history. Last year was usual on capital allocation, the number of fronts is being cautious on share repurchase among other areas. As we look to \u201821 and plan this year, we're expecting share repurchase to revert to a more normal level. And again our goal is not to warehouse cash at the end of the day. We want to deploy it for profitable growth and share purchase becomes one levering creating some good constructive tension in that equation. Bryan Spillane : We\u2019ll warehouse some cash for you in our living room if you'd like. The other just capital spending, I think we're going to be at $550 million for this year and maybe can you remind us, I know it's been elevated because you've been investing in some capabilities and some manufacturing capacity. Just kind of where we are in this CapEx cycle and is $550 million kind of a good number to run out going forward or are we still, is that still kind of reflective of a more elevated capital spending. Steve Voskuil : Yes it's more elevated, the answer is somewhere in between. If you remember last year we started targeting $450 million to $500 million for CapEx. Again, one of the areas we were a little bit cautious on was projects last year and with COVID and pressure on resources we had to reprioritize some things last year and the net effect of that was a little bit less CapEx in \u201920 and that CapEx pushing into \u201921, and for the main project there to the biggest ERP being one and work on supply chain. The total project cost didn't change and so it shifted more into \u201821 and therefore you can imagine some shifted into \u201822 as well. And so, but this year it's usually high. I think we're going to see elevated CapEx sort of above our long term algorithm, probably \u201923 ,\u201924 and we're going to talk a little bit more about that and tag me in a few weeks, we\u2019ll give some more color on capital and where it\u2019s headed, but I would expect an elevated level for the next couple of years before we get back down to what's inside of our algorithm. Bryan Spillane : Okay, and then just last one tied into capital allocation, maybe a bit of a follow-on to question I was asked earlier about M&A. With interest rates being so low, you know it sort of you know changes the deal dynamics a little bit, right. We\u2019ve seen a couple of acquisitions either rumored or on the tape in the last few months that are very accretive, because we are borrowing it at under 2%, in some cases it\u2019s under 1%. So with that kind of backdrop, does that at all impact maybe the appetite of both in terms of just doing deals, but also size. You know we've got this unusual opportunity, there is plenty of liquidity, you know does that at all kind of change maybe the way you're thinking about M&A today verses you know might have been a year or two ago in a different environment. Steve Voskuil : Sure, I'll start and Michele can add on. I think from an appetite stand point we have the appetite and the second piece, we have great balance sheet. And so we generate a lot of cash, we've got flexibility, we like where we're at and so we are poised for the environment that we're in. I think Michele did a great job earlier kind of pointing to where those hunting grounds are you know we're aware of the external environment and where interest rates are and what may or may not be hitting the market, and we want to be able to participate in that growth just like everybody else.  Anything to add to that Michele? Michele Buck : No, nothing. Well said. Bryan Spillane : Alright, great. Thanks everyone. Operator : The next question is coming from the lines of Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed with your questions. Ken Zaslow : Hey, good morning everyone. Michele Buck : Good morning. Steve Voskuil : Morning. Ken Zaslow : Hello! Michele Buck : Yeah, good morning. Ken Zaslow : Can you talk about your pipeline for Packaging Innovation? How that should impact pricing, not just in 2021 but also 2022, and how deep it is and you're just a thought process on you know packaging innovation and the pricing that's assigned to that. Michele Buck : Yes, so when we think about packaging innovation, you know we think about pack types which are designed to meet specific consumer occasions. So this is \u2013 for me I would encompass this as part of kind of price backed architecture, which is as we look to capture incremental consumer occasions how do we have certain packs that enable that, so that there\u2019s a value to the consumer that you know our products now better meet an occasion or a need. If you go back and look at, you know we went from lay down to stand-up bags, not only was it easier to shop on shelves, but it was also, once it got into the home, in the pantry, much easier to use, much easier to see, less messy, those types of things. We will look at pack configurations in terms of you know size, like is there a smaller size than it used for certain occasions or certain demographics versus a larger pack and we'll do that on a brand-by-brand basis.  So I would say that our pipeline is largely kind of focused on what we would say price pack architecture and so as such, what we trying and do from a strategic perspective is make sure that we are at least margin neutral. I mean that would be our goal. We can get price realization, obviously that\u2019s the focus, but short of that we want to be margin neutral. Ken Zaslow : Okay. I appreciate it, thank you very much. Operator : The next question is from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions. Rob Dickerson : Great, thanks so much. Just, sorry you had some good question answered there. You know I guess in the prepared remarks you had mentioned the bar business, I guess the named ONE is the brand. You had stated that it seems like some, maybe retailer shifted space to protein drinks and powders right, through just to meet the COVID demand shift. But then also saying, kind of given the discussions with retailers, the expectation is that, kind of that bar business would come back.  So just asking, kind of broadly speaking, as you look at that bar category, relative to protein shake powders, are those conversations with retailers like fairly pointed, such that either they are suggesting, oh this is what we're doing for this period of time, but as we get through lets says Q2 or what have you, you know we would look to reallocate back to certain brands and certain bars, or is this kind of more of a you know \u201cyes, it\u2019s going to probably come back, let's kind of wait and see how everything develops\u201d and that's kind of a big question I guess for bars, but then also more holistically for the entire store. Michele Buck : Yes, I mean since retailors are \u2013 yes they are always looking to try and optimize their space according to what the current consumer demand is, and so you know \u2013 hey, nobody knows how long, what the curve of the pandemic is going to look like. So I can't tell you a specific time when it will shift and obviously it will shift at different times with different retailers too, based on who their consumers are.  So I would say it\u2019s less \u2013 we have a definitive timeline and you know we are focused on one, on how we make sure that we got the right score behind the brand and the right innovation relative to mini\u2019s which we think is a big idea and also plant based which are on trend, so that as the category does come back, we are well positioned to capture that. Rob Dickerson : Okay, fair enough. And then you know look, I\u2019m totally impressed with kind of all the different areas that you're focused on in \u201821 right and kind of on the go forward, right where we were talking about a little bit more sugar free potentially, right, obviously there's ESG going, you got some plant based innovation maybe more on the bar side, you mentioned before touching potentially increasingly into baked snacks. So I guess Michele you know the question is, as you step back right, it seems like Hershey continued to evolve right, in more of a broader snacking business, obviously outside of the core chocolate confection. So as we get through \u201821 and we think about \u201922, like very simplistically you know would you argue that you know the point here is to kind of get Hershey bigger in the store, in a bunch of different areas such that you are increasing overall distribution points on the go-forward for broader Hershey? Or do you feel like as you step back as a whole company, yes obviously you're looking for a quick distribution, but maybe there's a little bit of in-sell on a skew maybe on Sugar Free and maybe you take one out in Kisses. So I'm just trying to right size kind of that increased distribution opportunity given all the different spaces that you're focused on. Thanks, that\u2019s it. Michele Buck : Yes, so I guess I would say first and foremost you know our number one priority is always our core confection business, because it is the mother ship, it is our profit engine, we have tremendous strength, it's growing within consumer demand and so you know we always start there. And then with that as the foundation we really looked across all the capabilities that we have as a company relative to consumer insight, to taste science, to ubiquitous distribution, all of that and say how could we leverage that to capture more and more incremental consumer occasion and so I think that\u2019s where you know you see us with a targeted focus on, okay something like better-for-you should capture an incremental occasion, an incremental consumer. so I would think about that as kind of more incremental. And then if I look at you know flavor variety on the core, to me that\u2019s a little bit more where we rotate in, we rotate out, you know we have one slot for that, but it\u2019s not a permeate incremental. Some of our expansion into other categories, i.e., better-for-you in savory, yeah I look at those as gaining incremental distribution points more broadly in the store by meeting incremental consumer occasion.  So I think incremental occasion is importation for us, leveraging the capabilities, and then importantly making sure that we do a very measured expansion. We want to focus on confection, add-in area and really play to win there, and make sure we don\u2019t spread ourselves too thin, similarly to what I would say we\u2019d do on international. We have a focused select set of markets that we prioritize, that we really want to play to win as oppose to spreading ourselves too thin. Rob Dickerson : Alright, great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. At this time I\u2019ll turn the floor back to Melissa Poole for closing remarks. Melissa Poole : Thank you so much for joining us this morning. I will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Operator : Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Joining me today are Hershey's Chairman and CEO, Michele Buck; and Hershey's Senior Vice President and CFO, Steve Voskuil. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Robert Moskow : Hi. Thank you for the question and obviously, really great results. I just wanted to get a little more color on your gross margin expectations for the year. You talked about transitory reasons for why gross margin would be down in first quarter. And I think \u2013 are you still guiding to gross margin expansion? And to what extent do you need like the incremental pricing to get that gross margin to turn the other way? And I would think some of these higher costs that you're talking about, like freight co-packing, it sounds like you'll need to keep doing those things beyond just first quarter, maybe a little more color there. Michele Buck : So let me have Steve take that one. Steve Voskuil : Sure. Happy to. So yes, we are still calling for modest gross margin expansion on a full year basis. As you noted and we had in the remarks, there were some transitory impacts in the first quarter, some lapping from last year, some also cost in response to the higher volume. As we look forward for the rest of the year, some of the things that are strengths for us, the productivity gains, the additional volume, the pricing that you referenced, all of that will be part of building that gross margin. So far, for the first quarter and even as we look out for the year, I would say our inflation assumptions are largely tracking to what we had in plan, and the one exception that we noted was packaging. And I think that is one we'll watch. Our expectation is that inflation will moderate some as the year plays out, impacted a bit by weather in Texas for the first quarter. So that's one we're watching, and then in any carry forward of incremental cost to support the higher volume. And with more runway here in the balance of the year, we'll have more opportunities to optimize between customer service and manufacturing capacity and the cost of support. So we're keeping a close watch on all those. But yes, at this point, we still see some gross margin expansion over the course of the year. Robert Moskow : Okay. And one follow-up. The new price increase on grocery and non-chocolate, can you give us a sense of what it presents both in absolute terms and also on an annualized basis once its fully flows through? Steve Voskuil : Yes. So we see it total pricing for this year across all the price increases, order of magnitude about 100 basis points, about half of that is the non-chocolate piece. And again, reference there is we haven't priced that part of the portfolio since 2014. So this is in line with our broader strategy. We've talked about of rotating and refreshing pricing in parts of the portfolio. Robert Moskow : Okay. So on an annualized basis, does that mean it's 1%, 2% to the total business? Or\u2026 Steve Voskuil : Yes, annualized, it's about a point for this year. It's about 50 basis points. Robert Moskow : Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your questions. Michael Lavery : Good morning. Thank you. Michele Buck : Good morning. Michael Lavery : Just following on pricing a little bit. You said the 1 point to 1.5 on expectations for the year. And I mentioned that a lot of that reflects the pricing you just took and some of the promotional benefit in the first quarter. You also just mentioned that the packaging inflation should moderate. You've got some relatively benign things like cocoa costs and dairy at least so far. But if you were to look for more pricing, say, if packaging didn't come in the way you're expecting, how nimble can you be? And what sort of timing does it take to flow some of this through? How much upside to the 1 to 1.5, could we end up seeing? Steve Voskuil : Yes. It depends on which parts of the portfolio that we would price. Obviously, the seasonal part takes a pretty long lead time. And so really, that's not something that would be in the card for this year. On an everyday basis, we probably need at least three to four months of lead time. And so you could say there's still some optionality there, if we were to see some worst case scenarios from a cost standpoint. Right now, that's not in the plan. I think we feel good about the plan that we have for pricing. But as I said, we'll monitor what's happening from a cost standpoint. Michael Lavery : Okay. That's great. Thanks. And just a follow-up on the e-commerce side. I believe you've said that those margins might be somewhere around 100 to 150 basis points lower, but as it scales, that should improve. How have you seen that change over this past year with the benefit of the surge and obviously, a bigger scale base now? Steve Voskuil : Yes. From a dilution standpoint, I mean, you're in the right ZIP code. It's a bit dilutive to the overall margin. Obviously, that piece of the business, as we've talked about in prior calls, has gotten bigger. But at the same time, we continue to look for ways to drive efficiency there and optimize inside that business to bring those margins closer in line with the rest of the portfolio. Michael Lavery : Do you have a sense of just the timing for what that might take? Is that a multiyear process? Or would some of this surge that's kind of still sticking now would be a big help towards narrowing that gap? Steve Voskuil : Sure. It's a multiyear process for sure. I mean, the scale does help. We get more scale across some of the investments and capabilities that we put there. So there is some benefit there in the present, but really to address the full dilution, it's going to be a multiyear process. Michael Lavery : Okay. Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Nik Modi with RBC. Please proceed with your questions. Nik Modi : Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I had two questions. First is on just shelf space. So clearly, Hershey has done a phenomenal job on execution, gains in 2020, gains in early 2021. I'm just curious given how your momentum continues, if you would expect to see or have discussions with retailers, providing more space later this year, but also in 2022? That's the first question. And then the second question is just on \u2013 given the online momentum that you've been seeing and the clear stickiness that we've seen, how are you thinking about the supply chain and kind of reorienting the supply chain to make sure that you can continue to effectively execute as the online business continues to grow? Thank you. Michele Buck : Good morning, Nik. So let me first go to the space question. As we started out for the year, we always have a focused plan, focused on balanced growth across all levers, driving base velocity, using media to accelerate growth, growth in seasons, distribution gains. So that's always a focus for us. And we are fortunate that we have been able, given the strength of our performance of our supply chain, particularly overall, but also during COVID and some of the needs of our customers to be able to provide some incremental SKUs that were very viable, that our customers were looking for, and we gained about five incremental SKUs for the year. And so certainly, with that comes some shelf space gains. So that's something we've been focused on. As we get that distribution and we get shelf space now, that certainly has some staying power as long as those SKUs perform, which we anticipate that they will. So we are continuing to be focused on that. And as we look throughout the year, believe, we feel pretty good about our ability to continue to drive distribution as well as shelf space gains. And certainly, that kind of coincides with some of the share gains that we have seen on the business have been driven by that. As we look at online momentum as it relates to our supply chain, we've talked before about Supply Chain 2.0, a big initiative that we have to really prepare our business and enable our manufacturing and supply chain for the future. And certainly, as we build that program and that initiative, one of the key legs that we were focused on was the agility to enable us to adapt to the changing retail environment and specifically, e-commerce being one of those areas, because a lot of the packs sold in e-commerce are slightly different than those sold across the business. So some of those investments that we're making there enable us to more efficiently at a better margin, develop the right packs that enable us to win in e-commerce. So big focus in Supply Chain 2.0 against that and in all of our new capacity builds. Nik Modi : Thanks. Thank you, Michele. Michele Buck : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions. Jason English : Hey. Good morning, folks. Thank you for sliding me in. I want to come back to the question on pricing, but from a slightly different angle. Michele, if we look back in history, usually, you move Mars follows or Mars moves, you follow, and you follow a similar order of magnitude on similar products. And that consistency has obviously helped investors build confidence in the pricing architecture, the pricing discipline or the pricing power in the category. We're in a bit of a unique circumstance right now where Mars is moving one direction with a higher magnitude, and you're moving in a different direction with a much lower magnitude. And it strikes me is quite a unique moment in time where you guys are diverging. I guess I love a little more clarity to try to understand the motivation for you to go in a different direction? And what if any implications this may have in terms of that pricing discipline we've historically seen in the category? Michele Buck : Yes. So I continue to feel really good about this being a very rational category from a pricing perspective and there being strong discipline from that perspective. Our recent announcements regarding increasing price on seasons and also non chocolate and grocery are very consistent with the strategy we've been executing over the past couple of years of realizing price through different levers and on different parts of the portfolio. And we think that, that's proven effective for us to drive profitable growth and also be able to reinvest in the business, both for us and also for our retailers. But we do know that across competitors in the category, we each do have unique portfolios with different SKUs to our business across pack types and across brands, we have some different capabilities in terms of what we are good at executing and perhaps even different business needs at different points in time. And so while all the pricing isn't exactly pack-to-pack, exactly the same, what we think is important is while those tactics and products might differ, overall, category price realization is pretty consistent. And so if you look at us and you look at the largest player in the second largest player in the category, the magnitude and difference in terms of what we each are getting from price is probably a point or in that range. So it's a significant \u2013 it's not a significant difference between. Jason English : Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. Ken Goldman : Hi. Thank you. You highlighted some recurring headwinds to your gross margin. I think there were some incentive payments, so comment on warehousing costs. Is there any color, Steve that you can provide on how much these may have added to your COGS or just took away from your margin? And do any of those incentive payments bleed into 2Q? Steve Voskuil : Yes. So maybe just taking the incentive piece. So yes, we will see some additional incentives that I go versus prior in second quarter as well. As we get to the back half of the year, it's going to get a little bit narrower year-on-year. And so \u2013 but we'll definitely see some impact in the second quarter. We also have some year-over-year investments in capabilities. I think we touched on these a little bit in our last call, still some costs going through OpEx to support Supply Chain 2.0 that Michele mentioned and also the ERP program. So those would be, if I kind of look between the lines, some of the pieces year-over-year, that will be different. Ken Goldman : Okay. And then as my follow-up, I may be pushing you a little harder than what you're willing to talk about, but it's hard not to notice that COCO, it was of the only commodities that hasn't retired lately, has come down actually sequentially in the last couple of months. So I know you don't talk about your specific commodity buys. But can you just walk us through a little bit about how you're looking to lock in maybe some of your favorable inputs a bit longer than you otherwise might have, just given how everything else has risen so much higher? It really could help you in terms of protecting your 2022 numbers at this point? Steve Voskuil : Sure. Yes. I mean, you're right, Ken, we're not going to get too specific. Our hedging horizons vary. We kind of said in the past three months up to two years, depending on what's available on the market, liquidity, pricing, and I will say our commodities team is very good at interpreting the signals and trying to make smart moves with respect to that hedging program. Beyond that, we're probably not going to comment and said cocoa's moved around. It's down a little bit. I'll like you might interpret that as some opportunity if you were to be a little bit longer from a hedging standpoint, but we really don't want to say any more than that yet about 22. Ken Goldman : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions. Alexia Howard : Good morning, everyone. Hope you can hear me okay? Michele Buck : Yes, we can. Alexia Howard : Perfect. Okay. So I guess my first question is, I wonder if you can give us a little bit more detail and granularity around the away-from-home recovery, particularly in North America. Which regions, which channels, what exactly is playing out there that you're seeing that's so encouraging? And then my second follow-up question, I know you're not giving quarterly guidance, but obviously, 2020 was such an unusual year. And we're going to be lapping some interesting developments in the year ago period as we go into Q2. I think you mentioned the ad spend was going to be up materially in the second quarter. I'm just wondering whether you can give us any other pointers on how the top and the bottom line might be expected to develop? Or what the pluses and minuses are as we think about next quarter? Thank you. And I'll pass it on. Michele Buck : Sure. So relative to the away-from-home strength, I would say it is across the board. So first of all, we did see stronger foot traffic and consumer mobility in North America, and that was really, I believe, from the accelerated vaccine distribution as well as from the stimulus funds that were allocated and that not only drove strength in what we would call our core channels, kind of the more traditional channel, food, drug mass and even some pickup in convenience in Q1. It also had \u2013 there was also a very strong positive impact on our non-measured channels as well. So, food service, our own retail stores in a world travel retail some of those businesses that were really big decliners for us last year came faster than we anticipated. So I would say, it was pretty much across the board in terms of all of those venues improving a bit more than we had anticipated. So, some of it was due to the consumer traffic. And then, of course, we were able to also capture incremental distribution and merchandising in our US confection business. And given the strong sell-through that we saw, driven by mobility and foot traffic, strong sell-through Easter then led to accelerated shipments of some of our summer programs, which also helped us across the board. And then even beyond North America, we actually saw increased mobility in the international markets as well, a bit more than we had expected. So with that, I think those were unplanned for us in Q1. We certainly had planned to see those mobility improvements later in the year and have that in our plan, but not in Q1. And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve to talk a little bit about the quarters. Steve Voskuil : Yes. From a quarterly standpoint, as we look at Q2, building on what Michele said, we've got a lot of momentum on the top line coming into Q2. We're able to merchandise early. Some of the summer season, that will get us off to a \u2013 to a strong start. As we go forward from there on the top line, you're going to see sales growth moderate. The last get tougher. You'll see pricing start to make a contribution more in the back half. And as Michelle said, our plan assumed mobility would begin to recover as we got to the back half. So that's less of a new piece of the story as we turn the corner on the midyear. And then we'll see some margin improvement as the year progresses. You mentioned ad spending for Q2. It's going to be up pretty big. Year-over-year, that was \u2013 the quarter last year where we made some adjustments, some pricing advantage because it was cheaper to buy and some pricing or some adjustments in how much we spent just in response to COVID. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color on the balance of the quarter. Alexia Howard : Very helpful. Thank you so much. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions. Andrew Lazar : Good morning, everybody. Michele Buck : Good morning. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. Andrew Lazar : Michele, I know this can be a little hard to parse out sometimes. But as you think about how much of the gains that you've made the last couple of quarters, right, in distribution and shelf space, merchandising gains you've talked about, how do you think about like how much of those might be structural, right, based on a lot of the \u2013 the good stuff that you're doing around innovation and everything else versus a product of what's been clearly a more accommodative sort of competitive environment from a perspective of some others, whether it be supply chain missteps and things of that nature? So I'm just trying to get a sense, it's a hard one to answer, I know, but how sticky do you think some of those gains in market, right, that you've seen can be over time? Michele Buck : Yes. So I think you're right. It is a little bit tough to parse all of that out. So I would say we came into the year feeling really good about our strategies. And many of those we have laid out pre-COVID relative to really focused on we got to win at the top line with balanced growth, which is driving against distribution, the core innovation, seasons, pricing and volume growth. And I think what we're seeing on the business is that we are delivering on each of those elements. And so certainly, that is a piece that I think has staying power that some of the strategies we put in place relative to pre-COVID optimizing our balanced focus on the core and on innovation, not over rotating on innovation too much. Not over rotating on any one factor, balancing price volume, one of those things. So I think that there is some underlying strength there as well as a lot of the investments that we've made in our core capabilities in our manufacturing and our supply chain over the year that have enabled us to deliver perhaps at stronger levels than perhaps some others in the marketplace. And so some of that strength that we're seeing in terms of impact of media, those types of things, they're there without the COVID impact. We tend to always, as you know, strong category managers. So we do tend to do well when it comes to winning at retail. We have our proprietary retail sales force that enable us to do that. At the same time, I say, I guess, if I was going to parse out some places where some of the current dynamics maybe a little bit more transitory. Certainly, we have one more distribution than, I would say, it's probably at the historic level in terms of number of new items, because of our strength in being able to operate in this environment and our agility, we have won some incremental march [ph] associated with the competitive situation as well. So for me, I guess, I kind of \u2013 I narrow into probably those two factors being probably the biggest ones that are the most unique. And of course, the other one is that right now in Q1, you asked more about a couple of quarters, in Q1, in particular, we've kind of got that unique duality where we're seeing that we're benefiting both from away-from-home and from at-home behaviors, both being strong. And certainly, I think that, that can't sustain at the level that it did in Q1. So we do think that, that's going to moderate a bit. Does that help yes. Andrew Lazar : Yes. That's very helpful. It will be really interesting to see how much of the at-home moderates as mobility does return for the industry as a whole, obviously, it will be really interesting. But I hear your point about how strong both of those really were at the same time in Q1. So yes, that's very helpful. Thanks so much. Michele Buck : Thank you. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions. Rob Dickerson : Great. Thanks so much. I just wanted to touch on the international segment for a minute. I mean, obviously, performance in Q1 extremely strong. I think originally, right, the expectation was essentially for somewhat modest growth. Guidance now is up for the full year for the total company. And then I know you had comments in your prepared remarks just around basically playing it safe, right? There's some incremental lockdowns occurring, the visibility is that strong. But I guess kind of overall, the question is, could it be actually a lot stronger, right, than we would expect as we go through the year? Because it would seem as if kind of relative to what we're thinking about for North America, is that international piece does continue to play out. And obviously, given those compares are so much easier, it would seem as if the volume-driven year could actually be even more volume-driven off of that international piece as we progress through the year. So kind of simplistically, I'm just asking, I realize you don't have the visibility, but if things were to kind of self-correct and momentum were to continue in international, I mean, could you just not do much better on the top line than you're already currently guiding? That's all. Thanks. Michele Buck : First of all, I'd say, hey, we feel great that we are seeing strength across every piece of our business. In North America, in every component of North America, including US confection and amplify as well as in international. So that's great to see. And certainly, we did have a strong first quarter in international that was significantly ahead of our expectation. I think what was interesting for us was that despite this fact that COVID cases were high in many of those markets, consumer mobility still increased, and that drove demand for our category that was stronger than we anticipated. I think the potential concern and certainly, as you look at the news, you see this everywhere is there certainly are some pretty dire situations, especially in some of the markets that we're in, but certainly, India being one of those, where case counts are rising. There are other markets where the vaccination dissemination is going quite slowly. And as new lockdowns are implemented, we expect that those could hamper mobility and that these trends could moderate. So we know international, things are always volatile, but they certainly are even more volatile during this time. And those markets are not going to have linear behavior. So we expect that we'll see continued volatility. What we're trying to do is to drive what's within our control, and our teams are responding with tremendous agility in adapting the plans based on the stages and the status in each market. So we feel good that all of our key initiatives, whether it's our China transition to the new business model, a restart or upping again our focus in India on our chocolate initiative, all of those things are going well. But there's just a lot outside of our control, and we'll have to see how the year plays out. If things are positive, certainly, there could be upside. And \u2013 however, we also know that there could be downside as well. Rob Dickerson : All right. Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Morgan Fletcher with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions. Morgan Fletcher : Hi, good morning. Thank you for the question. Michele Buck : Good morning. Morgan Fletcher : So I guess my question is on how COVID may have changed your perspective on the portfolio maybe in inorganic, but also an inorganic way? We touched on e-commerce and supply chain earlier, but maybe if we could just go through more how you're looking at categories differently? Like baking mix has had very strong growth, while refreshments have seen decline. So just how you may be thinking about your portfolio on a category basis going forward? Thank you. Michele Buck : Yes, absolutely. I mean, I think one of the things that we feel good about that COVID just reinforced was the strength of the breadth of our portfolio to be able to participate in different occasions. And so I would start first within core confections and say, we have a \u2013 our business splits a-third, a-third, a-third, instant consumables, which are all about people being out and about on the go; take home, which is all about people being at home and consuming the products there; and then seasons, which is all about celebrations. And so within confection, what we saw was, wow, normally, we might focus a bit more of our efforts on instant consumable. And when COVID hit, we were able to immediately shift media, in store merchandising, et cetera, more to our take-home portfolio. And we also saw that during a time like COVID, consumers were just hungry for connection and so the roles that our brands play during season to create that connectivity and traditions and rituals with something consumers just were so hungry for. So really leveraging the full breadth of that within confection was important. You raised baking and certainly, consumers were baking more, and we were able to leverage that as part of our portfolio. So I think what it really taught us was this ability to pivot to follow the consumer and to focus on the parts of our portfolio that were most relevant to them at that time. And as I think \u2013 if we think organic and inorganic likewise, we were able to take advantage of SkinnyPop which has done incredibly well during COVID. And certainly, we know that category like nutrition bars haven't done quite as well. So it's really playing on the pieces of your portfolio at the right piece of time, but having the options and the breadth across the portfolio to be able to meet those needs. Morgan Fletcher : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call over to Michele Buck for closing remarks. Michele Buck : I'll turn it over to Melissa for closing remarks. Melissa Poole : Thank you for joining us this morning. I know, it's a busy day of earnings. As always, I will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Melissa Poole, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Hershey Company. Thank you. You may begin. Melissa Poole : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for The Hershey Company second quarter 2021 earnings Q&A session. I hope everyone has had the chance to read our press release and listen to our prerecorded Management presentation, both of which are available on our website. In addition, we have posted a transcript of the prerecorded remarks. At the conclusion of today's live Q&A session, we will also post a transcript and audio replay of this call.

These statements include expectations and assumptions regarding the company's future operations and financial performance, including expectations and assumptions related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Actual results could differ materially from those projected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other factors. The Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based on subsequent events. A detailed listing of such risk and uncertainties can be found in today's press release and the company's SEC filings. Finally, please note that we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe will provide useful information for investors. The presentation of this information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning's press release. Joining me today are Hershey's Chairman and CEO, Michele Buck, and Hershey's Senior Vice President and CFO, Steve Voskuil. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Lazar : Good morning, everybody. Michele Buck : Good morning, Andrew. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. Andrew Lazar : Hi. First off, I guess, I wanted to dig in a little bit more on the cost to serve dynamic that you talk about in the prepared remark. I guess, it should not come as a surprise that 15% organic sales growth in a given quarter would kind of stress any supply chain, no matter how efficient. So, my question is, I guess, are there any structural investments needed in the supply chain going forward or any capabilities that were exposed by the volume spike? Or is it simply -- you sort of suck up the higher costs, as they\u2019re transitory, particularly the labor part, and not need to necessarily make any changes, as that sort of volume growth is really not likely sustainable at these extreme elevated levels. Michele Buck : So, Andrew, let me start, and then let me ask Steve to give some more details. I would say at the highest level, there are certainly key parts of our portfolio that have had just extraordinary growth, and we cited some of the numbers, for example, on Reese\u2019s. So, one thing that we are very focused on is investigating capacity behind the brands and businesses that we know have demonstrated track records of strong growth over time and particularly where we've seen strong spikes that we think will have continued strength going forward. Let me have Steve talk a little bit more about some of the other elements of cost and cost to serve. Steve Voskuil : Yeah. I would add on the structural side, one of the benefits is we\u2019ve been working on our supply chain 2.0 program and the Annville fulfillment center comes online later this year, that\u2019ll provide some additional flexibility and agility, so that will certainly be helpful. As Michele said, continuing to invest where we need to on capacity, especially on those fast-growing core brands like Reese. From a cost standpoint and getting into some of the pieces, clearly like you said, Andrew, putting that much pressure on the supply chain at one time pushed us in a number of spots. It pushed us from an overtime standpoint; it pushed us from getting to contract manufacturers and expanding some of their work off an onsite contract rate, and the same on the freight and warehousing side. So, I look at those as pressure points in particular on top of that, or as the result of the higher volumes. And then in addition, I would say labor rates in general and labor availability in general are a pressure point, beyond just volume. The market for labor is challenging, and so just like everyone, we want to make sure we are staying ahead of the curve on hiring, making sure our value proposition at our plants is attractive, and packaging inflation is similar. Packaging inflation we touched on a little bit on the last call. It\u2019s still a pressure point. I think we\u2019re still optimistic we\u2019re going to see that moderate as we go forward, but we haven\u2019t seen it yet. So, it is a combination of those transitory costs on the back of the higher volume, and a few things that are a little bit more sticky here as we look across the balance of the year. Andrew Lazar : Thanks for that. And then, just using our back of the envelope math, it seems like the operating profit upside in the quarter maybe is roughly offset in equal parts by a higher full year tax rate and some of the higher costs that you\u2019ve talked about just now sort of leaving the full year EPS guidance intact. I just wanted to see if I had the magnitude of each of those impacts for the full year more or less right. It seems like they\u2019re of equal magnitude essentially. Steve Voskuil : No, I would look at it as the tax piece was by far the biggest impact on us not taking up our earnings guidance alongside the top line. I think if it wasn\u2019t for the tax piece, we would\u2019ve raised guidance. The cost to serve is a component, but think of that as the 10% or the 15% of the impact where the majority really was the tax impact in the quarter. Andrew Lazar : Really helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Ken Goldman : Hi, thanks. Steve, you mentioned that there\u2019s 130 basis point tailwind from inventory loading this quarter, and you said there\u2019ll be a deload in the back half. Two questions on this. First, what\u2019s your best estimate for how large the inventory reduction will be at retail in the back half?  Number two, I know it\u2019s not always easy to forecast this, but how should we think about the cadence of that? Is the majority in the third quarter, or the fourth quarter, just for modeling purposes? Steve Voskuil : Yeah. I think in terms of total magnitude for the back half, I think 1.5 to two points of impact. And I would -- I don\u2019t think we\u2019re clever enough to give you the precise quarter. I would say I\u2019d look at it across both quarters, maybe a little bit of skew to the fourth quarter. Ken Goldman : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then, I think it\u2019s fair to say there\u2019s some frustration among investors this morning that you didn\u2019t raise your EPS guidance. I recognize the $0.04 beat wasn\u2019t huge in the second quarter. There\u2019s some uncertainty around the world in the back half of the year, but your business is doing great. So, I\u2019m just curious, internally, was there any consideration of raising the bottom line guidance, or did you just feel it\u2019s a little early given some of the inflation and the macro risks? Steve Voskuil : Yeah. I think, again, but for the tax piece, we would\u2019ve risen or taken up our guidance. Certainly, there\u2019s caution in the back half relative to the inflation and cost to serve. I think we have our hands around what that looks like and have a pretty good bead on that. But if that were the only piece, we would\u2019ve taken up our guidance, but tax was really the piece that we had to take into account. And we want to make sure we\u2019re not sacrificing investment in the back half of the year. Michele Buck : Yeah. For perspective, tax was $0.17 on EPS, so very meaningful. Ken Goldman : Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Robert Moskow : Hi. Thanks for the question. What do you think about the tax rate going forward for 2022, Steve? This looks like a one-time impact, so do you think you\u2019ll have an easy comp in 2022? And then secondly, you talk about some of the cost elements; some are structural, maybe some are short-term. Does any of this impact how you\u2019re thinking about pricing going forward for this year and for 2022? Steve Voskuil : Sure. On the tax side, we look at it as a one-off, so if we were to reset next year -- and again, we\u2019ll talk a lot more later in the year about 2022. But as a starting point, we wouldn\u2019t factor this into the starting point for 2022. So, I hope that\u2019s helpful. And then from a pricing standpoint, and Michele can add on here, pricing is a key part of our strategy, maintaining and growing, our gross margin is a key part of our strategy. I\u2019d say we execute against the trend. We are very aware of the dynamics at play from an inflation standpoint and so on, what competitors are doing, what retailers are doing. So, we are evaluating that environment all the time. And as always, we\u2019re not going to kind of tip our hand as we think through it, but pricing is and will remain a key part of our strategy going forward. Michele Buck : Yeah. As you recall, we did take two different price increases earlier this year on our confection portfolio that will really just begin flowing through in the second half of the year. And we\u2019ll also have some upside from that in the first half of next year. Robert Moskow : Okay. All right. Well, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Alexia Howard : Good morning, everyone. Michele Buck : Good morning. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. Alexia Howard : Hi, there. I guess, the first question is whether you can give us any thoughts on the gross margin outlook from here. Obviously, a lot of other companies are seeing an awful lot of pressure. I remember back in 2018 when there was freight cost inflation. I think you also saw some pressure. Input costs are going up, packaging costs are going up, and yet you held it pretty flat this time around. So, just some thoughts on that, and then I have a follow-up. Steve Voskuil : Sure. Yeah. We were pleased with the Q2 gross margin. We were -- it was a little bit ahead of our plan, I think we managed it well, and of course, implied inside our guidance for the balance of the year is a little softening of the gross margin outlook from being up slightly to being in line with last year. And I think that performance in the face of the inflation that we\u2019ve seen would be good. But our goal, again, looking to next year, building on the last question a little bit, is we want to continue to grow gross margin over time. And we want to do that through a pricing strategy. We want to do that through productivity. We want to do that through all the levers to manage inflation and commodity cost, and so driving that forward remains an important goal. We\u2019ll give more color on next year\u2019s gross margin as we get closer to the end of the year, but that goal remains firmly in our mind. Alexia Howard : Okay. Great. And then just a question on the Lily's acquisition. You recently sold Scharffen Berger and DAGOBA. The company\u2019s been trying to make premium work for quite some time. What\u2019s the difference about Lily's that makes you confident that you can actually make this work this time, versus some of the problems that you\u2019ve had in the past? Thank you. And I\u2019ll pass it on. Michele Buck : Yeah. What we really like about Lily's is, it is a scale business, so it is close to that $100 million in size, whereas Scharffen Berger and DAGOBA were much smaller, in the $30 million range. And we\u2019ve found over time, and I think we\u2019ve shared this before that for us, a good acquisition being around close to that $100 million mark has been built enough that we can really best apply our capabilities around distribution, manufacturing, synergies, additional marketing, kind of more broad-based marketing, et cetera, to really help to make the acquisition a success. The other thing I would say is Lily\u2019s is single mindedly focused on better-for-you. So, while it is premium, it has a very distinct understandable benefit that those consumers understand, which is about the lack of sugar. That also gives us a lot of confidence that it fits very neatly into our operating model. As you know, we have already launched a broader portfolio of better-for-you on our core brands, and so that whole better-for-you area is a big point of focus for us. And there\u2019s some nice synergy in terms of our focus there. Alexia Howard : Great. Thank you very much. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Michael Lavery : Thank you. Good morning. Michele Buck : Good morning. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. Michael Lavery : Just curious how you think about elasticity, and I know it can hard to measure. The ways we\u2019ve tried to come at it, you tend to score quite well. Does that -- is that your sense as well? And how do you think about that in terms of your pricing? How aggressive you may try to be or not be, and just how you anticipate the consumer response to that? Michele Buck : Yes. We have seen -- we have very complex and sophisticated price elasticity models where we look not only at price points within our own categories, price gaps, price thresholds, also around other snack items as well. I think over time, I think we\u2019ve consistently seen that our business, our brands and our category tend to be on the less elastic side versus perhaps some other categories, which is what gives us confidence in pricing power and the ability to take price when we feel it is the right time. Michael Lavery : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And just a follow-up on Reese's. Can you give a sense for the organic Reese's launch, just how that might be tracking versus your expectations, and maybe a little bit of how it compares from a margin perspective? It looks like, with its price point, it\u2019s probably pretty nicely accretive. Is that directionally correct? Michele Buck : So, it is performing in line with our expectations. It is early days, but it\u2019s absolutely in line with what we expected. It is really in kind of a test-and-learn phase as we move forward. And it\u2019s not, I would say, a big material piece of our better-for-you launch at this point in time, as organic is a little bit more of a targeted offering than say, zero sugar or sugar free. Michael Lavery : Okay. Great. Thanks so much. Michele Buck : Yeah. And to your second part of your question, from a margin perspective, we do charge a higher price point for it. But it also does cost more, obviously, so the margins are comparable to the core. Michael Lavery : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed with your question. Ken Zaslow : Hi. Good morning, everyone. I had just two quick questions. One is the tax, is it a cash item or a non-cash item? And then the second thing I\u2019ll ask is, implicitly, you\u2019re actually raising the EBITDA, which is more cash oriented. Am I not understanding it correctly? Steve Voskuil : So, the first question is for the second quarter, it\u2019s non-cash, but a portion will become or could become cash in the balance of the year, and that portion will probably be non-cash for the balance of the year, so it is a mix of both for the balance of the year. On your second question, yes, you\u2019re thinking about it the right way from an EBITDA standpoint. Ken Zaslow : Okay. And then just to follow-up on this. The magnitude of the increase on the EBITDA exceeds the amount of cash that will be needed to pay the taxes. Is that a fair way? And then I\u2019ll leave it there. I just want to make sure I understand the tax, because it just seems like it\u2019s more -- if cash flow is actually coming up, not going down, based on what you\u2019re saying. I just want to make I\u2019m understanding it correctly. Steve Voskuil : Yes, that\u2019s true, but I\u2019d say the caveat is time. All right. So, if you\u2019re looking at a longer period of time, it\u2019s more possible that a portion of that reserve could become cash. And so, if you\u2019re looking at next quarter or the balance of the year, that might lead to one answer. If you\u2019re looking at the next two years, it could be a different answer. Ken Zaslow : Great. I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Bryan Spillane : Hey, good morning, everyone. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. Michele Buck : Good morning. Bryan Spillane : Hi. So, I guess, I wanted to maybe follow-up a little bit on Andrew\u2019s questioning at the beginning. And Michele, maybe just stepping back a little bit, this -- in this environment, right, where we\u2019re seeing not just higher cost inflation, but in addition to that, what\u2019s effectively labor shortages, right, and we\u2019ve seen this across a lot of the companies in our coverage universe. So, I guess, I had two questions related to that. One is, if supply chains are kind of running all out, just how you think about stimulating demand when there\u2019s some challenges just in terms of getting product on the shelf? And I guess the second is just, as you step back and you look at all these different dynamics in the economy and the environment in general, it\u2019s definitely a situation that is in some ways unique. Your perspective, have you seen some of this before? And maybe just how you\u2019re thinking about approaching planning for the business over the next, I don\u2019t know, 12 to 24 months, if we continue to be in this type of environment. Michele Buck : Yeah. It\u2019s certainly something that we spend a lot of time, thinking about and working on. And I guess what I would say is, yeah, we do realize that it is somewhat of a volatile time still, certainly with all the talk of the Delta variant and recent CDC guidance recently. It\u2019s all too much of a reminder that we clearly aren\u2019t fully out of the pandemic. And I personally believe, in September, we know that a lot of companies are implementing kind of a return to office. It seems like a lot of companies are doing that then. Kids going back to school. So, there will be more for all of us to learn about consumer behaviors and what some of those changes mean for that. The way that we think about the supply chain and managing where we are right now is, I guess in a couple ways. How do we maximize -- how do we efficiently maximize and profitably maximize revenue? And so, one of the key things we do focus on is really looking across the portfolio and focusing on really maxing out where we have available capacity and leaning into some of those brands and businesses with greater investment, reallocating investment to those businesses so that we can really take full advantage of that. If there are areas of the portfolio where we -- like a Reese, for example, I think we keep pointing out as an example because it\u2019s such a big piece of our business and growing at such a hefty rate. We have total confidence making big capacity investments on that one, just because of the track record and the dynamics around that. And then -- so we\u2019ll invest in capacity as a piece of that. And then there are parts of the portfolio where we\u2019re not going to lean in right away and invest in capacity, because we want things to play out a bit here more. So, we really leverage the breadth -- one of the strengths we have is the breadth of our portfolio. We\u2019ve got our seasonal portfolio with the consumable take home. We have a range of different brands. And so, we really try and leverage that as best possible to manage through. So, it\u2019s kind of a balance of investing to build supply chain even stronger, which we\u2019re always doing, but we\u2019re doing even more of that right now. Doing what we need now, kind of no regret move, and then planning for the future from a contingency perspective depending on what the potential outcomes are. Bryan Spillane : Okay. Thanks for that. If I could just follow-up with one quick one. Just as you\u2019ve sold in merchandising for holidays in the back half of the year and maybe just more in general, have service levels come up more as sort of a factor that retailers are focusing on? Like, you can sell a program or they can take a program, but are they more sensitive to actually planning to be in stock? Is that becoming more of sort of a factor in that decision-making right now? Michele Buck : Yeah. I mean, I would say absolutely. Retailers were under tremendous pressure this past year with all of the huge shifts that COVID caused on many manufacturers\u2019 businesses. They had, as we all know, tremendous issues with out-of-stocks. And so, their goal is to make sure they remain in stock. In fact, right now, we\u2019ve seen retailers really lean in a bit to inventory and carry a bit more inventory than they have in the past, because I think there\u2019s a little bit of a scarcity mentality. They want to make sure they have product. They also know that manufacturers are taking price, and so in some cases it may allow them to hedge a little bit there. So, I think it is definitely a focal area and, of course, something that we always focus on and are proud of how we\u2019ve been able to deliver for retailers. They\u2019ve continued to come to us, given how we were able to deliver during the worst of the pandemic last year, and have continued to rely on us this year. Bryan Spillane : Okay. Thanks, Michele. Michele Buck : Absolutely. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. It seems there are no other questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn the floor back to Ms. Poole for any final comments. Melissa Poole : Thank you for joining us this morning. I\u2019ll be available throughout the day for any other follow-up questions you may have. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

With that, I will turn it over to the Operator for the first question. Operator : At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. One moment while we poll for questions. Our first question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question. Jason English : Good morning, folks. Thanks for stepping me in. Michele Buck : Good morning. Steve Voskuil : Morning. Jason English : Congrats. Good morning. Congrats on a strong quarter, particularly given the strength that you're cycling in the prior year. But despite the straight, I can't help but remember that Shivery (ph) snacks have lost some of their sweetness pre -COVID, with little, if any, volumetric growth. COVID has clearly rejuvenated demand. In your capacity expansion effort seems to suggest that you believe that demand is going to stick. So, my question for you is why? Why shouldn't we believe that that -- sorry, that that's manage it's going to leak back out in the next year or two? Michele Buck : Yeah. Jason, as we look at the growth that we've seen, the category growth has really been pretty broad-based. It's really cut across regions; it's cut across cohorts. As we speak with consumers, we hear that some of that elevation of those take-home behaviors and new routines that occurred during COVID, that some of those will stick and sustain. Perhaps not all of them, not to the degree to which people were suggested that they shouldn't leave their homes, but we do believe that some of those will stick and stay around based on what we're hearing and seeing. And we do also see some of that continued strength as people are out and about, and mobility increases and that we're seeing a pretty good balance there. The other thing we've heard from consumers repeatedly that we've seen over the years is the emotional aspect of the category and how it fits with good and happy moment. And as those happy moments have continue to increase, as people, I think, are starting to believe they see somewhat of a light at the end of the tunnel in us working through the pandemic, those moments of happiness that we're really associated with, we see continuing. So that's really our perspective; is a lot of those routines, we think some of which will just continue into the future. That said, there are a lot of unknown. We certainly -- none of us know -- knew any of this was going to happen, and so we can't perfectly predict the future. As a constant capacity investment, what we've tried to do is be really prudent in our investment strategy. So, we've learned in in places on brands where we have clearly seen sustained growth over time and there's a lot of proof points that capacity will pay off and Reese's is a great example of that. Frankly, there are a couple of other places where we had elevated demand that we held for a bit before leaning into that capacity until we really thought we were at a point where we could guarantee the ROI. It is a bit of a balancing act, but at this point, we are bullish on the future. Jason English : That's helpful context. Thank you. And I too like happy moments. One more question than I'll pass it on. In your prepared remarks, you touched on your collaborate space planning of retailers and resulting acceleration growth for both you and your categories. Can you elaborate on that? What's going on with the initiative and maybe provide some specifics on the changes that are being enacted by the retailers? Thank you. And I'll pass it on. Michele Buck : I'm sorry, can you just repeat the very first part of the question I missed? Jason English : Well, your collaborative space planning for retailers. Michele Buck : Yes. Okay. Jason English : You were talking about it in your prepared remarks. Give us more specifically. What is it, what's happened, what are the changes that are being an asset on the back end of it? Michele Buck : Yes, absolutely. So, I would say over time, given that strong partnership we've had with retailers and particularly a lot of our category management expertise around analytics, we've always partnered with retailers in terms of how to think about the placement of confection in their store and ways to optimize category growth. Whether that's looking at heat maps with how people travel through convenience stores or years back when we found underutilized face under the checkout counter and convenience stores, and we put category there. Recently, a lot of the focus from our retailers, or there's been a big focus around the labor shortage and thus, a push for even more presence of self-checkout. And so, we've partnered really closely with those retailers to increase the presence of the category at self-checkout and to maximize the presence in those queuing lines leading up to checkout and particularly self-checkout. I mean it's a perfect fit with some of the struggles they're having around labor and a great opportunity to get the category out there and make sure that people don't miss that chance to have that last impulse purchase. So, I think our retailers are always focused on what's going on in the environment that they need to address in terms of their store layout. And fortunately, we've been able to help them with some of that. Jason English : Makes a lot of sense. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. You may proceed with your question. Andrew Lazar : Great. Thanks so much. Maybe just first off, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of competitive response with respect to the pricing moves that you've announced and how that impacts your expectations on elasticity because obviously thus far while early, would seem like volume trends have held up remarkably well in response to the pricing that you've taken. Michele Buck : Sure. As we have always seen in this category, it tends to be a very rational category relative to pricing. Our most recent pricing actions are on track, and we have seen several competitors take pricing actions this year, including over the past several weeks and we don't really expect that we'll see any material changes in pricing on shelf versus the competition, any changes in GAAP, etc. Andrew Lazar : Great. And then I guess more to Steve. I certainly understand all the moving parts on the supply chain right now, which makes getting overly specific right on '22, certainly a bit of a challenge. But if we take it from the top-line, consumption trends remained very elevated, Hershey 's got more pricing coming through, and it's had inventories depleted for really what will be, I guess, 2 years in a row. So, I would think all these things provide a reasonably good line of sight to -- at least an eye on algorithm sort of taper year, at least on sales in '22. Again, unless I'm missing something, and please point it out if I am. On the profitability side next year, obviously, you've already talked about, and I understand there'll be a supply chain pressures at least through the first half of the year. I guess my question is, would you expect the year-over-year gross margin pressure to sequentially improve as you move through the first half as the pricing flows through and you make improvements to the supply chain or our gross margin pressures potentially you expect it to be as, let's say, severe in the first half is maybe what you're seeing in the back half of this year? Steve Voskuil : Sure. Maybe I'll just start with the top line as you started. I think you're right. As we look at it today, it's hard to point to something that would say you don't have an on algorithm top line, you don't have momentum. Coming out of this year, we've got long Easter. You mentioned pricing, which will be a bigger factor next year than it was this year, that we also had hoped we'd see some capacity improvements would give us some upside. And then at some point, inventory replenished. And I think that's hard to call, but that -- we would expect to see some of that certainly over the course of next year. So still volatile, but I agree with the first premise. And then as you get into gross margin, I think there's still are a lot of moving pieces. Some of the things I think we can directionally point to, obviously the pricing will have a tailwind on gross margin as we look at raw material. The raw material inflation wasn't a big factor for us this year. We expect it will be a bigger factor as we look at next year. Logistics inflation that we're seeing now, I don't think we see a reason yet for that to break at least through the first half of next year. We'll have less spot market activity because some of the -- we'll be, say, better positioned for some of the stronger consumer demand than we were particularly in the third quarter. we still expect to see some labor inflation. And as we said in the prepared remarks, we've increased headcount to respond to some of the additional demand. Packaging inflation at resins. I think we keep waiting for that to break and it's probably moderated, but it hasn't reverted back to other levels or lower levels. So, I think at least through the first half we're going to see that still remain a pressure point and then we will see how capacity plays out in the broader supply chain network. The challenges we've had with logistics and trucks, warehousing, and all of those labor implications. So, when you step back from all of that, I'd say the gross margin piece is still has a lot of moving pieces. I think will give more clarity, obviously, when we get to February and provide full guidance. But right now, I'd say, particularly, for the first half of the year, we're going to see a lot of those costs\u2019 pressures in place. Andrew Lazar : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. You may proceed with your question. Robert Moskow : Hi. Michele, I wanted to ask about the decision to reduce advertising for the year. I guess it makes sense in the context of supply chain challenges and if you can't get the inventory where you want, why advertise? But the stock's done well and your sales have done well because of the market share gains. And I just wanted to know if you think there's risk to market share erosion from this decision. Do you think your competitors are doing the same thing, so it won't matter? How did you evaluate the risk and reward of that? Michele Buck : Yes. So first of all, I would say there is not a strategic change to our business model. We remain committed to investing in brands at some of the highest levels in our industry across the peer group. So, there's nothing that has changed about the strategy, so I want to be clear about that. As we looked at the decision, it really was driven by the fact that we have such elevated demand. And given that the supply chain challenges just wouldn't enable us to be able to meet the further demand that we would create through our very impactful advertising, that it just didn't make sense. It put more pressure on the supply chain. And also, we probably wouldn't get a good ROI because we wouldn't be able to fulfill that incremental demand. If we look at our market share right now, we don't think that the advertising cuts that we had executed impacted our share in Q3. And we're not the only ones having supply chain challenges and issues. So overall, I think across the board, even in the industry, we're seeing a lot of people manage advertising to supply as a challenge. We'll continue to focus on optimizing it. We will invest as much as we can, as much as we think we can sell. Certainly, we're investing in capacity going forward and we are very agile in how we're handling support behind our brands. Robert Moskow : Okay. And can you give us any update on Halloween? Will Halloween just blow right through inventory or were you also challenged to fulfill demand for Halloween just like other products? Michele Buck : Yes. It is a very strong Halloween season, the biggest that we've ever had, with very strong double-digit growth on top of the strengths that we had last year. We have done our very best to get as much product out there as possible. Certainly, I would say supply pressures hit every aspect of the business, so tallying season would be a piece of that. But we're really excited about the growths that we've seen year-to-date, both in the category, as well as our own business, and I'm seeing lots of very picked-over [Indiscernible] out there as I'm out in stores because it'd be a good trick-or-treat, they send everything we've purchased from consumers as well as the people really flock back to that behavior. Robert Moskow : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JP Morgan. You may proceed with your question. Ken Goldman : Hi, thanks so much. I wanted to start by asking about your perception of your labor relations right now. We've had a couple of strikes obviously in the food-at-home industry. So, I'm just curious for any updates how you see the risks there and so forth. Michele Buck : Yes. Absolutely. We are very focused on our labor and the first and foremost, I would just want to again, publicly acknowledge and thank our manufacturing employees. We have folks in our plants who have been with the Company for 20 years, 30 years, 40 years. And it's really their focus, their dedication from the very beginning, that has enabled us to demonstrate and deliver the growth that we've been able to during this very dynamic environment. So, we have very long focus and believed and operated in a way that we believe we have the best advocate for advocates for the needs of our people. We are in constant communication with our employees, and we're really focused on our total employee value proposition with those employees. We know that we have highly competitive wage rates, we have excellent benefits, and then we routinely benchmark all of that. But we're also very focused on the softer factors that are very important to our employees. And that includes, especially during these times of global supply chain challenge, work-life balance, stress management, flexibility in hours, being able to get time off. And so, we have an acted a lot of strategies to really try and help with that. We have an always on recruiting approach and we have really amplified our recruiting efforts this year to be able to successfully manage through the challenges and increase our net headcount. We've also leveraged the analytics to, as I said, understand some of the things most important to our workforce. So, we're very focused on that. We are very focused on prioritizing the needs of that group and continuing to look at ways that we can optimize the situation in terms of supply and demand. So, we feel pretty good about that. Ken Goldman : Great. Thank you for that. And then a quick one for Steve. Steve, year-to-date, your corporate other expense line has been up fairly meaningfully from both 2020 and 2019. I realized that grows somewhat in line with sales. But I'm curious how we should think about when an ongoing annual number for that corporate line is, especially as we think about modeling 2022. Are there any potential one-time headwinds we should be thinking about that maybe go away next year or is this kind of a good runway to think about? Steve Voskuil : You'll see incentive compensation is one of the big pieces in there, and as we turn the page to next year, that'll be one item that resets. Otherwise, there's not as much change. We talked about this year we had some planned investments in ERP and digital. We'll have some of those kinds of investments I expect next year. We also had a little bit heavier medical claims and benefits impacts this year coming off of COVID. So that may or may not continue next year, but probably the incentive reset will be the biggest year-over-year change as we start the next year. Ken Goldman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question. Bryan Spillane : Hi. Good morning, everybody. Michele Buck : Good morning. Bryan Spillane : So, maybe just to tie one more up on '22. And, I guess Steve, just below the operating profit line, this year there has been some benefit from interest expense being lower. And I -- so I guess my question is just is we're looking in the next year and we're just looking at our models below the operating profit line. Is there anything that we should be thinking about in terms of puts and takes there? Steve Voskuil : Yeah. Nothing major. I think if I was to look at tax this year has been lumpy, but if I look at where we set the final guidance for the year from a tax standpoint and I look to next year, I'd expect relatively similar level for next year. We had some one-timers this year that will not recur next year. We talked about it in the second quarter and to some extent, this quarter as well. So, I can't take those out. And I look at the finishing tax position I see they the same interest expense. I don't expect a lot of change by flat year-over-year. So, I hope that helps. Not much movement year-over-year, other than the one-timers. Bryan Spillane : Yeah. No, that's helpful. And then just a follow-up on the capacity expansion. I guess two questions related to that. One is, what type of investment is it? Meaning is it actual physical product production lines, or is it investments in further down the manufacturing, like packaging capacity? Just trying to get a sense of actually what type of capacity you're adding. Michele Buck : Yes, we're adding capacity on both. Both, in terms of product production, as well as packaging across multiple brands. I think we spoke before about building our agile fulfillment center. That is up and coming online. So, it's really across the board. Bryan Spillane : And then if we're thinking about or if you could give us a sense of the capacity now that you're planning to add just where you stand now in terms of capacity utilization or available capacity. And I guess, what's underneath my question is, we've been adding incrementally to this -- to CapEx over the last couple of years, and just trying to get an understanding of whether we're going to stay in this elevated cycle for a while or are we getting to the point where you feel like you're going to have enough flexibility in capacity? Michele Buck : I'd start by saying capacity utilization varies by brand and piece of the business, so each brand is in a slightly different position. We certainly have invested several hundred million dollars to install at least 9 new lines since the pandemic began, and we do have more planned for '23 and for '24. But Steve, do you want to talk a little bit more about where we are in that total investment? Steve Voskuil : Yeah. If you look back really the last 2 years and this year, we have done a lot of infrastructure spending. So, we talked about the agile fulfillment center. We've got a Canadian DC that's in process, and of course, the ERP transformation, which is a big component as well. Now, I'd say we have to finish those projects of our pivoting more towards the capacity side. So, I think like we talked about machines packaging. So far, we haven't had the need to build buildings and infrastructure of that sort. But as we look at the total, next year, as we talked about a slight increase versus this year from a CapEx standpoint, really due to project timing this year more than anything else. And then, as we look further, I know we get more guidance on that, as we get into next year. Bryan Spillane : Okay. Thanks. I'll leave it there. Thanks, everyone. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nick Modi with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed with your question. Nick Modi : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Michele, I wanted to ask about market share, if you could just give us some context. Obviously, I think a big question has been, how much of the share gains you -- Hershey has had over the last 12 to 18 months and how much of that was taken. Looks like quite a bit was taken. So can you just talk about where you see the most stickiness, where things have retrenched. And then obviously discussions are taking place now about 2022 shelf allocation. Just wanted to get some of your early thoughts on how you think you'll progress there. Michele Buck : Yeah, sure. Since the pandemic, we have been able to hold on to about 50% of the market share gains that we had realized. We see certain areas of the business where those numbers are very strong seasons in particular, as we mentioned in our remarks. We had gained 500 basis points and we held on to about 75% of that. Take-home also has been very strong in terms of our retention. So, we're pleased with what we've been able to hold onto. And as we continue to unlock more capacity and reinstate some of that advertising, we believe that we'll see some continued strengths going forward. Nick Modi : And then just a follow-up on assortment because I know that's been a big area that retailers have been focused on given all the supply chain challenges. So, as you engage with retailers regarding space with some of your initiatives, how are you guys thinking about your overall assortment on the shelf? Michele Buck : Yes. So, I would say, we know that assortment bags are really big sellers with consumers. And there's been a trend towards that, particularly during the seasons and especially during Halloween. So, we have definitely seen that part of the category tick up relative to assortment bag. If I look broadly at assortments and what is on-the-shelf, what we've been trying to do is to optimize our portfolio of SKU for right now based on what consumer demand is, where the demand is, and availability of capacity. And we've really prioritized a lot of our core items that the core of the core of the core items, which are the highest velocity item even to the point where we're focusing in some places, on shelf you will see double facing of those items as opposed to the presence of perhaps some second or third tier items. So, we've spent a lot of time on this, and we think we've taken a really smart approach that has enabled us to generate that very positive demand and at the same time, maximize the available output that we have on capacity and on supply. Nick Modi : Excellent. Thank you. I'll pass it on. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. You may proceed with your question. Michael Lavery : Good morning. Thank you. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. Michael Lavery : Just wanted to come back to the trajectory of capacity relief. I know you've quantified the reload hit for this year. Just in terms of at least how you're planning for it, assuming that's all set for next year, can you give us sense of how you expect that to unfold and just how soon you can start to see a relief and reloading retailer inventories? Michele Buck : Steve, you want to talk about that. Steve Voskuil : Yeah. I think it's hard to call exactly how that's going to phase over next year. We've got -- as we've talked about in the prepared remarks, we've got capacity that's come online this year. We've got more coming online next year. And I think, between consumer demand and our capacity coming online, it's going to be a challenge to quarterly profile that. We'll hear more in February. I will have a better picture at that point. Michael Lavery : But and is the issue more the production lines or labor or is it both? Steve Voskuil : It's a bit of both. Labor only from availability. Like everyone, we've done a lot of hiring this year. We talked about it again in the prepared remark. We've increased headcount but we've also seen more attrition than we've had in the past. So, there's a labor component, but there's also a machine capacity component. Michele Buck : And I'd also say there has been a logistics and shipping component, as well, although we've been able to take some actions and have seen some improvement on that. Michael Lavery : Okay. Thanks. And you mentioned in the prepared remarks about the strength in unmeasured channels and just how your total sell-through is stronger than what we see in the measured channels. Can you give a sense of if there's any certain products or channels in particular driving that and just how sustainable it might be? Michele Buck : Yeah. I mean, we're seeing it the up versus the pre -pandemic levels. And I think over a 2-year, it's relatively in line with what we would call normal. So, low single-digit growth is kind of what you should be thinking there. Michael Lavery : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. You may proceed with your question. Alexia Howard : Good morning, everyone. Michele Buck : Good morning. Steve Voskuil : Morning. Alexia Howard : Right. 2 questions from me. Firstly, you mentioned in the prepared remarks that some of the emerging markets are still holding up well. I wonder if you could give us a quick tour of India, Brazil, and Mexico. How long do all they collectively and what are the main initiatives that are in those areas? And then I have a follow-up. Steve Voskuil : Yeah. Michele Buck : Steve, do you want to talk about the size and -- Steve Voskuil : Sure. The 3 markets are doing well. I think, as we started the same point, I think on the second quarter call, but we are gaining share in all 3 of those markets in our key brands. And so, we're pleased with the progress that we're making. You can continue to see a fact from the top line due to the benefits of some of the go-to-market work, including the model in China but also efficiencies in the other markets. So, we're pleased with the way things are going with. We look to the fourth quarter, some of the same capacity challenges that we've seen in the U.S. and North America are going to have some impact on those markets as well. But really pleased -- with pleased with the distribution gains. We've seen the velocity and the share across those 3 markets. Michele Buck : I'd say in terms of the key initiatives, I would probably bucket them across in terms of it is investing in the core. So, India, we're still focused on the chocolate expansion and broadening that. In Mexico, we have both a strong chocolate portfolio as well as Pelon Pelo Rico in the sweets area and in Brazil continuing to fill out our portfolio. We launched Halloween in Brazil for the first time. We had a premium dark line that came out in Brazil a while back that's been very successful. And across all of those markets, investing to continue to build those brands and to build distribution I think are really the key priorities there. Alexia Howard : Great. And then as a follow-up. I didn't see any reference to the e-commerce channels in the prepared remarks this time around. Has that channel slowed down materially? Obviously, it was very elevated during the pandemic and I'm just wondering what's happening over there and whether that's becoming maybe less of a focus this year? Michele Buck : Yes. So overall, I think perhaps not totally unexpectedly, from a broad consumer perspective, overall trips to stores, both brick-and-mortar and e-commerce are up both versus 2020 and 2019. In-store trips have pretty much rebounded to the pre -pandemic level. And in e-commerce, what we've seen is the trips have largely maintained versus last year. But we have seen the dollar per trip go down as many of those consumers who were more exclusively purchasing in e-commerce, shifted more of their spend back into bricks and mortar. Most of the e-commerce shoppers are not exclusively e-commerce, they shop omni-channel. So, we saw some of that shifting occur. Relative to our business in particular, our e-commerce retail sales are up versus last year with our omni-channel partners, despite the significant growths that we had year ago. And also, despite the significant growth that we're seeing in bricks-and-mortar as well. Alexia Howard : Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers, with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed with your question. Steve Powers : Thanks. Good morning. With the -- just back to the capacity question. Again, just with the timing of exactly when you might be able to alleviate pressure on those most capacity constraints of brands hard to call as you talked about with Michael, I guess I wanted to cycle back to Rob's question, just get a sense for how long you think this lower run-rate on marketing could continue, and how long you'd be comfortable letting it run, just given the competitive backdrop. Michele Buck : I think relative to the marketing investment, we're just going to -- we're continuously being agile and flexible. And as we are able to either bring new capacity online or make adjustments in how we are operating, because we've done -- we've had a lot of focus in things like freeing up additional capacity by reducing changeovers, by focusing on core SKU. So, I'd say we're in a period of continuous improvement both in terms of capacity investment and maximizing the capacity we have. So, we closely monitor that so that as we do see upticks, we can then quickly reassess and adjust our spending accordingly. Steve Voskuil : Yeah. All I would add is when we talked in the past about the analytics that we have around our media investment, and we put a lot of our own investment in building out that analytics capabilities. So don't think of the media tests as sort of a peanut butter approach. It's very surgical, very precise to the areas where we have capacity constraints and very protective of the high ROI core brand advertising. Steve Powers : Yeah. That makes sense. Just if I could, how much of those analytics and those considerations are driven by your internal -- aspects that are internal to you and your control in your capacity versus, versus the competitive backdrop, right? So, right now, it sounds like you and competitors are all on that kind of a similar spot. And so, as you pull back, you're not overly concerned about share of voice being lost, etc. But if you got -- if you felt you were more offside on capacity relative to competitors and saw them picking things up, how does that affect you? And would you be ramping up ahead of capacity on marketing just to maintain that share of voice or how do you think about that? Steve Voskuil : Yes. I know our retail sales team, has very strong presence to start the week. Between what's on air and what's on-shelf and what's being promoted. We have very good data coming back on what's happening from a competitive set. And all of that does feed into the decision as we think about how we're going to optimize our marketing and media spend. Steve Powers : Okay, great. Just one last question if I could. You called out the price increase executed recently in the U.S. and your expectation for pricing to play a bigger role in next year's growth, which makes good sense. Is there any color you can provide just in terms of the cadence of how you expect net-realized price to flow? Is it going to be relatively even throughout the year, is it -- does it build? Just any context there would be helpful. Thank you. Steve Voskuil : Yeah. We're going to have more in the first half of '22. Think about the most recent price increase will kick in in the first quarter plus we'll have carryover from the price increases that we announced earlier this year. So, the first half will have more price relative to the back-half. Steve Powers : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. You may proceed with your question. Jonathan Feeney : Hey, good morning and thanks. Just a quick one for me. I'm trying to understand, for Q3 and your numbers, I'm off by a few days and your numbers probably they're mine, but clearly, I have 9, 7 for pricing in measured pricing in Q3, U.S. scanner channels. And that's significant -- when pricing broadly is -- at retail is ahead of what wholesale pricing appears to be, what's going on and does that tell us something about the kind of pricing you'd expect to flow through? And is there any possibility that retailers are margining up a little bit, at least relative to what you would consider standard operations. Thanks very much. Steve Voskuil : We're not seeing retailers margin up in a material way. What you do see is a lot of impact of mix and retail when you really got to click down to get down to pack type and see what's happening. And when you get down to that level, it's consistent. More than what you see when you look at just at the top level. Jonathan Feeney : Got you. So, you say, it's more of a mix phenomenon then? Steve Voskuil : That's right. Jonathan Feeney : Cool. Thanks very much. Steve Voskuil : You bet. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn this call back over to Ms. Melissa Poole for closing remarks. Melissa Poole : Thanks so much for joining us this morning. We'll certainly be available throughout the day for any additional questions you may have. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

With that, I will turn it over to the Operator for the first question. Operator At this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. Operator : Our first question is from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Lazar : Good morning everyone. Michele Buck : Good morning, Andrew. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. Andrew Lazar : Hi there. I guess my question is it seems like the plan of this year is, is Hershey\u2019s going to look to certainly leverage greater SG&A to more than offset some of the expected gross margin pressure during the year. I guess my question is how does the company balance sort of leaning more heavily on SG&A this year to hit certain targets, including less aggressive marketing spend, albeit in light of capacity constraints? How do you balance that with continuing to lean in on reinvestment to protect as much of the sort of the current momentum and the market share that\u2019s been gained in the last two years, really to benefit the outyears, right, of \u201923, \u201924 and sort of beyond? Michele Buck : As you know, we take a pretty balanced approach in terms of focus on delivering the short term as well as making sure that we are building all the capabilities and continued investment to build the long term. So, as it relates to\u2014let me start with some of our SG&A. We think it\u2019s important to continue to build capabilities. Some of the places that we have been very focused are in the areas of ERP, obviously, so that we can really get a solid foundation of technology that we think will bring us tremendous benefit going forward in the future. We incur a lot of the expense now, and frankly, more of the benefit in the future. Also, in terms of digital as a big investment area, specifically we\u2019ve had a big focus in advancing our capabilities to deliver more sophisticated targeting and get more efficiency in media. So we believe some of those lean-ins are really important to help us build those capabilities for the future. As we look at brand investment, as you know we are big believers in our business model that brand investment is key. We have always been very solid spenders, and we continue to believe that. We have moderated some of that spending as we\u2019ve had supply challenges and constraints to make sure that we keep our very strong returns on that investment, so it\u2019s a balancing act. Some of the investments in media have enabled us to get to efficiency so that we are still delivering a pretty strong number of consumer impressions out there. We feel good about where our share of voice is. So, we\u2019re really trying to balance that and say, \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll moderate a bit now in brand investment,\u201d but certainly keep our eye on it as we go forward to make sure that we continue to protect that for the long term. Andrew Lazar : Right. Thank you. Michele Buck : Steve, do you have anything to add to that? Steve Voskuil : No, I think you hit the highlights. We have a compensation reset that happens as we set new targets, and so that gives us a little bit on benefits side to deploy against the things that Michele said. Andrew Lazar : Right. Then just briefly, Steve, I guess where you say Hershey is right now with respect to sort of retail inventory levels and I guess finished goods inventory as well, relative to where the company might typically see itself sort of at this time of the year? Just trying to get a sense of what sort of inventory refill opportunity there might be moving forward, obviously as capacity allows. Thanks so much. Steve Voskuil : Sure. As we formed our guidance for next year, we have an assumption inside there that there is an opportunity for some inventory build back into the network. Of course, we\u2019ve also got some inventory building to do on our side, but from a retail distributor standpoint as well and that\u2019s part of our guidance. Andrew Lazar : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions. Robert Moskow : Hi. Thank you for the question. I wanted to get a sense of what you\u2019re seeing from competition. Is your competition facing the same supply chain constraints that you\u2019re facing, and therefore, should we assume that you\u2019re expecting a year of market share gains? Or do you expect to hold share this year? Do you expect them to reduce media as well? Michele Buck : Relative to the competition, yes, we would say everyone in the category seems to be having similar challenges, just as I would say pretty broadly in the industry that\u2019s the case. We anticipate the situation relative to delivering on demand to be about comparable across the competitors. Relative to market share, we believe that we will hold share this year. As you know, we\u2019ve had some really significant gains over the past two-year period of time. We will have more tepid share performance in the first half of the year, building to a bit more strength in the second half due to laps alone. And relative to share of voice on advertising, we do track that and we feel really good about where we are from an advertising share of voice perspective. Robert Moskow : Okay, great. Maybe a follow-up. Gross profit dollars, for the core business, not including the acquisitions, should we still assume that your gross profit dollars are growing? This is kind of a backhanded way to figure out what kind of gross margin I should expect for 2022. Steve Voskuil : Yes. Gross margin dollars are going to grow. As we talked about in the prepared remarks, from a margin standpoint we expect there to be some dilution comparable to what we saw in \u201921. But from a dollars standpoint, yes, up year-over-year. Robert Moskow : Okay. All right, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Nik Modi : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Just a housekeeping item and then just a broader question. I was hoping you could maybe just aggregate the shipping days and the elasticity impact that you discussed in the prepared remarks, if there\u2019s any perspective you can give on the magnitude of each. Then, in the prepared remarks you also indicated you\u2019re looking at historical elasticities when you think about this year, but as we\u2019ve seen across the broader CPG landscape elasticities have been better than expected, so I\u2019m just trying to get clarification. Are you assuming kind of what you\u2019ve seen historically, like pre-COVID? Or if you could just provide some context there. Michele Buck : Let me start and answer your elasticity question. I\u2019ll give it to Steve to do the disaggregation. Nik, what we are assuming for this year is historical elasticities. To date on our pricing we have seen a little bit better performance versus historical. As we go into this year, we want to carefully keep our eye on the potential impact of broad inflation on the consumer. We know that there\u2019s been reduction, obviously, in government stimulus and SNAP, and with the inflation across the board it\u2019s just a top of mind watch out area for us, and that\u2019s why we really chose to say historical price elasticities is what we think is a smart and prudent planning move for us. Steve, do you want to talk about disaggregation? Steve Voskuil : Yes. Just to break that out a little bit, the shipping days we would estimate to be about a 2 point impact on the quarter. And from an elasticity standpoint, if you kind of took that to the side, if you took the shipping days to the side, pounds were about flat in the quarter, if that helps give you some idea. Nik Modi : That\u2019s very helpful. Then, Michele, just one more question. Obviously the issue with out-of-stocks has been a pervasive problem for everyone and labor obviously is a big part of that. Is this one of those scenarios where you just kind of have to manage through it and don\u2019t really have a good handle on when things are going to start getting better? I mean, I guess because it\u2019s so labor dependent. Michele Buck : Well, I guess what I would say is we have a lot of actions in place to drive continuous improvement relative to our own supply. So certainly yes, there is no certain end state where I can tell you this is where the switch flips. But what I can tell you is we have had numerous programs underway. So first of all we focused a lot on optimizing demand. How do we get the most efficiency out of the capacity we have? By reducing complexity in changeovers, prioritizing SKUs, part of that included working with retailers to double and triple face our core items, which is always a great move because they are very high velocity so that makes a lot of sense. As it comes to supply, we are continuing to invest in incremental capacity. There is incremental capacity that will gradually come online as we go through this year and also into 2023 and 2024. We\u2019ve also made some significant investments in manufacturing labor. Frankly, last year was a real challenge. Our people did real yeoman\u2019s work to just do whatever was needed to produce as much volume as possible, but it really wasn\u2019t sustainable in terms of having a reasonable employee value proposition for those folks. And so we have invested in labor. We won\u2019t get the benefit of that immediately because it takes time to train people, to get them up to speed, to be as efficient as our current workforce, but we do think it\u2019s important and a lot of that really just helps us to manage some of the overtime as well. So, we do have a lot of activities underway. We think that we will make continuous improvement, but under no circumstances would we really be out of the woods totally; we will continue to have pressure throughout the year. Our goal is just to continue to make improvements. Nik Modi : Okay. Thanks much. I\u2019ll pass it on. Steve Voskuil : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jason English : Good morning, folks. Thanks for slotting me in. Michele Buck : Good morning. Jason English : Congrats on strong results and some sustained momentum. The cumulative volume growth in North America over the past two years of, at my calculation roughly 7%, it\u2019s obviously a real stand-out here, especially given that it contrasts to what was very little growth before COVID. My question is kind of on that focus. How much of the volume that you picked up during COVID do you think is durable? How much is at risk of leaking back out as we kind of come out the other side of this? What\u2019s embedded in your planning assumptions? I know there\u2019s a lot there and it\u2019s a bit tricky to unravel, but I would love your view on it. Michele Buck : We\u2019ve really tried to do a good dissection and deep dive to understand that as best possible, and I would tell you I think there are a number of things going on. First of all, we do know that there are some COVID related impacts. The change in consumer behaviors with consumers spending more time at home has clearly benefited some of our brands and categories because they\u2019re around their homes more to consume our products, and our products are more eaten in those types of environment than out and about restaurant environments, et cetera. I think that based on what we\u2019re seeing in consumer behavior, I think that while more people \u2013 and people have become more mobile, there also is a change of behavior that I think is here to stay to some degree, right? People enjoy spending time with their families. They appreciate them more given the COVID situation. They\u2019ve gotten comfortable, some of them, the portion who are flexibly working and want to continue some of that. So I believe that some of that is here to stay. At the same time, we also did implement a number of new strategies in our business over the years that we think have also helped us. We really tried to do a better job of balancing innovation and the core to get more sustainable growth. And we have seen that, that had an impact on the business. I think we also think we\u2019ve gotten smarter about pricing, where we have multiple levers on list price and price pack architecture that we can utilize. So I guess I\u2019d tell you, we believe that there\u2019s part of both of that. So we do think that there is a sustainability and underlying sustainability, may not be all of it. But in addition to us, in particular, I think the category\u2019s relevancy has just increased during COVID. So those are some of our thoughts, Rob, I hope that\u2019s helpful. Jason English : No, that\u2019s helpful. On \u2013 sticking on the topic of volume. It looks like your guidance for next year is predicated on fairly firm volume. But you say you\u2019re assuming historical elasticities, which should be a net negative drag and maybe some of this COVID stuff comes back out. What are the offsets? Is this like the inventory reload later in the year on a catch-up? Or where are you seeing the offsets of that elasticity? Steve Voskuil : Sure. Yes, a couple of things. One, we touched on it earlier was the inventory. So we are assuming some inventory rebuild with retailers and distributors. That\u2019s a component seasons \u2013 as a component of season were fantastic this past year. You get another 90% sell-through for holiday, and that will help from an ordering for this year. So we\u2019re leaning into seasons. And then continuing to activate against our brands and go-to-market strategy, a portion of that innovation, a portion of that is just working with our retail team to make sure we\u2019re bringing a new programming that we can support from a capacity standpoint. So those are the biggest factors offsetting the elasticity. Jason English : Understood. Thanks a lot. I\u2019ll pass it on. Michele Buck : Thanks, Jason. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question Michael Lavery : Good morning. Thank you Steve Voskuil : Good morning Michael Lavery : You mentioned the stimulus benefits in snap in particular. And clearly, there\u2019s some risk there. But can you give a sense of what, if anything, you\u2019re hearing from consumers directly in terms of how they may have reacted with elevated benefits? And just how much of your performance could have been driven by that? Because we survey consumers. It looks like confection is the category that may have had the least benefit of all. Is that consistent with what you\u2019re seeing? Or can you just give us a sense of how you think about some of the risk around that? Michele Buck : Yes. We do think that there could have been less benefit. That\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing as well for us than for others. So I do think that\u2019s correct. At the same time, we do know that there\u2019s significant pressure out there, and we just want to really keep our fingers on the pulse of it to make sure that we aren\u2019t missing something. I mean certainly, we\u2019re not a category where there\u2019s a big private label component and people can easily just say, \"I\u2019m going to still participate but switch to lower brands.\" That\u2019s always been a benefit for us during times like this, but we do understand the pressure consumers are under. Michael Lavery : No, that\u2019s great color. And then just on some of your outlook where you \u2013 from a planning perspective, can you give a sense of some of the timing you expect for any of the inventory restocking? And you touched on the SKU rationalizations. How significant are those? I know you\u2019re swapping them out for higher velocity items. Is that a net positive? Is there timing for that, for anything we should keep in mind from how we think about modeling the year? Steve Voskuil : Sure. I\u2019ll take the first part of that. If we look at the inventory deal, we\u2019re kind of planning it to spread evenly over the year. Obviously, it\u2019s gated a little bit by our capacity coming online. And so that\u2019s one factor. If I look more broadly at the sales profile for the year, we\u2019ll have more M&A benefits on the top line. In the first half of the year, we\u2019ll have more pricing benefit in the top line for the first half of the year, but the inventory build will be spread more evenly. On the SKU side, we see a minimal impact from that for the reasons Michele talked about, where we\u2019ve had to make choices for things we can supply. We\u2019ve been able to gain more facings and sell more core product. So net-net, that hasn\u2019t been a big factor. And we always \u2013 we had done SKU rent before we got into COVID just to make sure we were always thoughtful when we did add new innovation SKUs and make sure we had good velocity on those products. So we don\u2019t see a big impact. Michael Lavery : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Ken Zaslow with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question Ken Zaslow : Hey, good morning guys. Michele Buck : Good morning. Steve Voskuil : Hey Ken. Ken Zaslow : Just two questions. One is you\u2019re hitting your 9% to 11% EPS growth in a capacity-constrained environment with higher labor costs, even with lower ad spending. If we \u2013 you are in a normalized environment, how much incremental EPS growth? Or how would you kind of frame the pent-up that may not be in the 9% to 11% as you emerge from this capacity constraint issues? Steve Voskuil : Yes. That\u2019s a tough one to kind of think about because there are so many interconnected variables inside that equation. We\u2019ve got the robust volume, which is driving very high utilization on assets \u2013 too high, to be honest, which is why we\u2019re adding capacity. So you pick up some benefits there. But a lot hangs on that relative with the pricing drop through in response to commodity costs. So that\u2019s a tough one to say. There are too many interconnected components inside the P&L, Ken, to really probably give you a clear answer for that. Ken Zaslow : Would you think it would be higher or lower? And I\u2019ll leave that question, and then I have another question. Steve Voskuil : Sure. Even that\u2019s kind of hard, Ken, because if I start at the very top, we would probably not be taking as many price increases as we\u2019ve taken, but for the need to cover the costs that we have coming through both commodities and the rest of the P&L. And so even at that very top line level, it\u2019s hard to say how the construction then below the rest of the P&L would flow through. Ken Zaslow : Okay. Then my second question is with Pirate\u2019s Booty and Skinny Pop, you guys are obviously crushing it on the sales line. What were the key learnings that has changed your acquisition strategy with that? And what are you going to apply to Dots that continues to keep this \u2013 the snacking business at these levels, right? So your acquisition strategy has clearly evolved into something that has been quite successful. Can you talk about where the evolution is done and how you apply it to Dot\u00e2\u0080\u2122s? Michele Buck : Absolutely. We know that at the beginning of our journey into snacks, we had some challenges in some of our first acquisitions. And I guess it goes to maybe you catch a few toads on the way to the prince. But we learned a lot about what we\u2019re good at and what we\u2019re not good at. And we established some principles. And one of those principles was there\u2019s a certain size threshold that\u2019s critical for us in order to absorb a business and be able to really build it from there. We\u2019re not good creators of very small businesses and making them big. We also understand that our business model is all about a high gross margin, a strong gross margin that enables us to invest to grow capabilities and invest in our brands. And we got very, very stringent about those guidelines and those criteria for success. We focused a lot on building capability. Frankly, we didn\u2019t have a lot of M&A capability. And so we got a lot smarter about how to do the right due diligence, what were really the key questions we needed to understand. We started to see what we have to know going in. And I think as we did each acquisition, we got better at that. So with Pirate Booty and Skinny Pop, we got amazing brands. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re good at, is really getting a brand that has a strong consumer following. We\u2019d like to see brands that have tremendous repeat but low household penetration because that\u2019s \u2013 as consumers love them, and we can apply our capabilities to expanding distribution and investing to create awareness of the brand. The other thing we learned was the importance of supply chain. And early on, we had some struggles absorbing a lot of these smaller companies, didn\u2019t have their own supply chain. So thus, you saw when we went forward and bought Dots, we decided to buy the co-manufacturer Pretzels Inc. as well. So I think we\u2019ve consistently applied those lessons. As I said, we built a lot of capability and muscle along the way and got better at those key criteria of support of the brand\u2019s margins and the right supply chain. Ken Zaslow : Great. I appreciate it. Thank you guys Operator : Our next question is from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Ken Goldman : Hi. Good morning. Thanks so much. I just wanted to follow up on one thing. I know you talked about investing in digital capabilities. And I hear the goal, part of it is advancing targeting and efficiency in media. I guess I\u2019m not quite sure what the mechanics are there and why those efforts would cost a good deal of capital. And maybe I\u2019m digging a little bit too deeply here. I just \u2013 those things historically seem to be more about learning, education, hiring consultants to help you in capital. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of connecting the dots there, if I can. Michele Buck : Sure. So one of the things that we have seen has been really critical is what\u2019s the data set. In the past, we relied on our own internal data set that we would analyze and do a traditional marketing mix modeling kind of activities. But we\u2019ve really created what we think is a proprietary approach to what we\u2019re doing, investing in other data sources and then integrating them into ours, building the tools that allow us to do that, utilizing the cloud across what we\u2019re doing. And so a lot of that has been in investing in those different areas to truly kind of break out in this space. Ken Goldman : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then I may just be missing it, but I hear that \u2013 I see in the press release and in the prepared remarks commentary on strong innovation. I\u2019m not sure I see a list of products that you would consider strong innovation. I can\u2019t recall Hershey ever not listing the new products as a new \u2013 as the year starts. And I realize this year is a little bit unusual, just as last year was. But I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of what those new items are that you\u2019re most excited of \u2013 or for and how you might qualify them? Michele Buck : Absolutely. I mean I\u2019d start by saying, first, hey, given where we are in a capacity-constrained world, our first focus is the core, the core, the core. And if we are masking out capacity with the core, we\u2019re really balancing what\u2019s the right innovation to continue to drive news, but we also want to be very efficient and we just want to maximize throughput. But that said, we do have several items that we are excited about. Reese\u2019s Potato Chip, Kit Kat Dark Chocolate with Strawberry, Kit Kat Hazelnuts. We also have, importantly, some really great new pack types. So we\u2019ve talked to you about price pack architecture, and we\u2019ve put a lot of focus on understanding different consumer occasions and where there was a need or an opportunity for a pack type that best meets that occasion and drives incremental consumption. So we\u2019re really excited about two of those. One is called the Pantry Pack. And think about that as \u2013 I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m going to describe it as almost a case of your product or a case pack of your product that\u2019s designed to sit easily either in your refrigerator or in your pantry that you can easily get out multiple units of single-serve product. And then we also have an item that\u2019s called the Super King. We have a standard bar, which is a smaller instant consumable item. We have a king-sized bar, which is a bigger instant consumable item. And consumers identified interest in Super King, which is an instant consumable pack that has more products and more individual units for sharing. And those pack types have tended to be really great innovation for us over time, highly sustainable. Ken Goldman : Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question is from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Bryan Spillane : Hey, good morning, everyone. Just a couple of quick ones for me. First, just \u2013 as we\u2019re looking at the gross margin guidance that you\u2019ve given for 2022. Just what do the acquisitions \u2013 are the acquisitions accretive, dilutive or neutral to gross margins? Steve Voskuil : Yes. On the gross margin line, they\u2019re dilutive. And you can get a little sense for that with the new segmentation detail that we provided, but particularly dropping those in versus where before does create some dilution. Bryan Spillane : Okay. And then I know there\u2019s been a few comments, Steve, that you\u2019ve \u2013 or questions around just phasing. Could you just help us a little bit if \u2013 with regards to how we should think about the phasing, I guess, of margins through the year? So does pricing help a little bit more later in terms of gross margins? Just any guidance or any color you can provide in terms of how we should be thinking about the phasing of costs over the course of the year. Steve Voskuil : Sure. Yes. We have \u2013 if I go back to kind of first half, second half, I won\u2019t get down to the quarters, but we expect to see tougher laps \u2013 a lot more pricing in the first half of the year. But we expect to see probably tougher gross margin in the first half. And probably Q2, in particular, will be a tough, just looking at the lap that we had last year. And we would expect to see gross margins \u2013 again, everything else equal in the plan, gradually improving as we get to the fourth quarter next year. Bryan Spillane : Okay. And then, Michele, in the prepared remarks, there was a comment around Salty Snacks talking about being in a position, I think, to integrate \u2013 more efficiently integrate future acquisitions. Can you just touch on that a little bit, just what that means? Michele Buck : Yes, absolutely. So we\u2019re at a point now, where we are continuing to build scale in Salty Snacks. We started with SkinnyPop and Pirate\u2019s Booty. With the Dots business, we have sizable brands and so we are really looking at what is the optimal way to build the operating model around that entire piece of business. And that includes everything from \u2013 obviously, right now, we\u2019re very focused on integrating Dots and Pretzels Inc. But what\u2019s our end state of \u2013 from an operating model, how we operate, from a supply chain network, how we operate. This array of products do not require condition distribution, so they are very different than our core portfolio. So that\u2019s really the work that we\u2019re talking about there. Bryan Spillane : Okay. Great. And then last one for me. Plain household is very activated right now around the Cadbury Bunny Tryouts. Michele Buck : All right. Bryan Spillane : All right. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks, guys. Michele Buck : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Growe with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Chris Growe : Hi. Good morning. Michele Buck : Good morning. Chris Growe : Just to add an editorial remark following Bryan there, we\u2019ve really enjoyed Super King. They\u2019re very dangerous, by the way, but we do enjoy those as well in our household here. I just had two quick ones. There\u2019s a comment in the prepared remarks about you have pricing coming through but that won\u2019t fully offset cost inflation. You also threw in though some manufacturing investments and that kind of thing. So, I just want to get a sense of how much inflation you have and then will pricing offset inflation but there\u2019s other factors that may weigh on the gross margin. Is that the way to think about it, or do you have any more color on that, Steve? Steve Voskuil : Yes, a couple of things. In general pricing will offset the majority of our inflation. If I look at our commodity basket, we\u2019ve got the biggest increases year-over-year in places like sugar and dairy and packaging materials and specialty ingredients. We have pretty good visibility into that. We\u2019ve talked in the past about our hedging program and that gives us a pretty good picture. We\u2019ve also got inflation from a labor standpoint, and as one of the things that Michele said, labor and manufacturing value proposition is one area that we\u2019re leaning in pretty strongly this year. That\u2019s a differential investment than what we\u2019ve done in the past. And so, to answer your question, yes, pricing offsets the majority of the inflationary pieces, but it doesn\u2019t fully offset the additional investment that we\u2019re also making to improve the value proposition for employees. Chris Growe : Okay. Have you given a level or a range of inflation for the year? Just to get a level set on where you are right now. Steve Voskuil : Yes, so as we look across, I\u2019ll say the commodity basket but also other sources of inflation, you\u2019re talking mid to high single digits. Chris Growe : Okay. Thank you. Then, just to be clear, your capacity that stands today, can you produce enough to meet demand, or are you still using third parties more heavily? Things like that that are going to weigh on the gross margin in addition to other inflation, given the fact that you\u2019re trying to catch up on production here. Steve Voskuil : Yes. Today we don\u2019t have enough capacity to meet all the consumer demand. We\u2019ve had some floor manufacturing lines come online in 2021. We have more in Reese\u2019s and PayDay and Jolly Rancher Gummies that will come online in 2022. But even with that we feel like we\u2019re behind consumer demand. There is inflation through co-mans and partners in the network. Inflation flows through those lines just like it does from an internal standpoint and so that is a factor. But even as we rotate that outside support into internal production, we\u2019re still going to have inflation on the same labor lines and some of the materials lines. Chris Growe : Okay, thank you. Then just one thought \u2013 I\u2019m sorry. Go ahead. Michele Buck : I was just going to say and there\u2019s not a lot of material change in our use of co-mans. Some of the items that are in highest demand are items that we uniquely produce. If you think about the uniqueness of some of the forms of some of our big confection items, so while we are trying to use any external co-mans and network as we can, there are some that it\u2019s just not available because of the proprietary nature of our product. Chris Growe : Makes sense. Thank you. I just want to follow on Bryan\u2019s question. I think he asked about Dots and I think you mentioned that as dilutive to margin. Is that dilutive to EPS as well? Perhaps you answered that, but I may have missed that. Steve Voskuil : No. The Dots deal is accretive to earnings in the first year and it\u2019s about a two-point benefit. Chris Growe : Okay. Just wanted to be sure on that. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question is from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. David Palmer : Thanks. Good morning. I noticed you\u2019re calling the two segments Confectionary and Salty Snacks. Those are two different parts of that snacking mega segment that you might have shown in a chart years ago, in a past Analyst Day. You don\u2019t say Sweets versus Salty, for example, capturing even more of that. Does that mean that for the foreseeable future those are the two segments that are going to be the company\u2019s focus? If you just kind of roll back the clock, just how did we get here, that Salty is the best adjacent category for Hershey? Michele Buck : Certainly, if you look at our business, these are the largest two areas of our business today and thus from a reporting perspective is exactly where we went to how we segment the business. As you look at some of the bets we\u2019ve placed, I think some of the larger assets, at least on the scale of the acquisitions we\u2019re doing, do tend to be available there. We\u2019ve tended to like many of the assets we\u2019ve seen and the growth there. So that had always been in our eyes early on, was that the two incremental areas of incrementality for us beyond Confection that we were most excited about were salty snacking and better for you overall. David Palmer : I remember years ago there was some \u2013 it didn\u2019t always go great with some of the adjacent category acquisitions and there was some talk that you didn\u2019t have the \u2013 that going into another aisle wasn\u2019t always easy. Could you talk about the capability building that you\u2019ve done in parallel to these growth brands that you\u2019ve acquired that look like they have fantastic momentum, but in terms of the internal workings what have you done to really make sure that you\u2019re going to give us the best growth possible in terms of the salty snack area? Then I\u2019ll pass it on. Thanks. Michele Buck : Yes. So certainly, I think if we think about winning in the store, I think we\u2019ve built some scale in the warehouse delivered snack general space. So from a in-store perspective that\u2019s been a key area of focus, but I guess I\u2019d go back to really some of my earlier comments around M&A and where we\u2019ve really built the best capabilities. I think we got very tight about what an asset needs to look like in order for us to \u2013 for it to be attractive for us and be a good fit for us, and that\u2019s about it has to start to be \u2013 obviously after identifying the two areas of incremental opportunity, it has to be significant scale, $100 million and above, and have strong gross margins because that lets us build the brand. Go for brands that have very strong repeat, which signifies that they have got a loyal consumer base and there\u2019s a bear there that we can build from, that we can build awareness with consumers through advertising and we can increase distribution and availability. Make sure that we\u2019ve got a good solid supply chain plan, because our whole goal is going to be about growth and we have to be lined up to do that. And then really, given it was a focus, building our talent and our capabilities and our inter-workings and our process. We spent a lot of time on that and getting much more robust in terms of the talent that we\u2019re applying in these spaces. Accountability and ownership across the enterprise, both with our M&A team, with the commercial units that are picking this up, and building a lot of muscle in due diligence and every piece of that, whether it\u2019s legal, whether it is analyzing the business. I think all of those things have been key. David Palmer : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Steve Powers : Yes. Thanks and good morning. Going back and just to round out the conversation you were having with Jason and others earlier around volume, is what you\u2019re saying that you expect volume in terms of consumption and consumer takeaway to perhaps trend negative year-over-year given elasticities, but that you think your own shipments can remain flat to up given the dynamics that Steve talked about with respect to the seasonal activity and the inventory rebuild? Is that the read, or am I misinterpreting? Steve Voskuil : No, you\u2019ve got it. That\u2019s exactly right. Steve Powers : Okay, great. And then if we could, just because we\u2019re kind of getting a first look at the Salty Snacks business kind of standalone, can we just drill down there may be and talk a little bit about how you expect that business to shake out, price versus volume, maybe margin progression-wise in 3/22? Just I don\u2019t know, anything to call out there as we think about that business standalone? Steve Voskuil : Like the other parts of our business we look at both price and volume, but volume is very strong right now on Skinny, Pirate\u2019s and Dots. And so in some ways we\u2019re facing the same challenges that we have on the Confection businesses; we need capacity and trying to solve for capacity to continue to unlock the volume momentum that we\u2019re seeing. That\u2019s probably I would say one of the biggest issues, just like it is for the Confection business right now, but price also plays a role. Steve Powers : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Rob Dickerson : Great. Thanks very much. Just have another question on the Salty Snacks side. Maybe it\u2019s a bit longer term strategic. Michele, obviously I realize business is doing very well, growth is excellent. Demand, as you were suggesting, cemented your top brands in the segment, it\u2019s very strong. But it\u2019s still obviously a very small piece of your total company, total portfolio, and margins are still a bit obviously lower than your much higher scaled confection business. So if you think forward a few years, is there an argument to be made that maybe there can be some kind of overall margin progression up for Hershey, but that would likely be driven by the Salty Snacks area, just given increased scale, attention, media spend, what have you? I also kind of ask this in the context of kind of where your total company operating margin has been over the prior, call it seven years. Thanks. Michele Buck : Yes. I mean, we see a lot of opportunity in front of us. As you mentioned, we have been building scale, so you could say that we are subscale but we see tremendous opportunity for efficiencies and synergies as we integrate and gain scale. As we\u2019ve taken on these businesses, for us job one these are growth businesses. We bought them to accelerate our growth and to participate in high-growth segments that were very appealing to consumers. First and foremost, we wanted to go after that. Then, as you know, it takes some time to get to the right ultimate structure, the right phase of integration and really build towards that efficiency. And so we\u2019re in the middle of that right now. It will take us a few more years, but you see the growth rates from a top line perspective and a lot of the work that we\u2019re doing on the operating model and on the supply chain network are intended for us to drive up the margins to take advantage of the synergy that we think exists. Rob Dickerson : Okay. Fair enough. And then just quickly, obviously, we\u2019re close to Valentine\u2019s Day, smaller holiday for you, Easter if forthcoming and usually large. If we just think year-over-year, I guess just any perspective color in terms of demand you kind of feel so far with conversations with retailers relative to last year, which was obviously strong. And then, like, are there material differentiating factors in how you would actually provide supply for that season? Versus last year where demand was already high, and you did well and had decent supply. That\u2019s it. Thanks. Michele Buck : We\u2019re feeling good about both seasons. We see both of them being up versus prior year. We know that for us we had record sell-throughs throughout the seasons and that always leads to a strong season for us the next season, and also, it\u2019s a bit of a longer Easter season and that bodes well for us as well. So we\u2019re focused on working really closely with our retailers to get them the product that they\u2019re looking for, but we are anticipating that we\u2019ll be able to see growth on both those seasons. Rob Dickerson : All right, super. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question is from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Feeney : Thanks so much for taking my question. With so many companies really struggling to take pricing, and I measure that in terms of not so much the level of pricing but the adjusted gross margin compared with the apparent elasticity, which in your case you out-gross margined trend year-over-year at negative 40 basis points is all world and the elasticity is limited. What specifically is it do you think about your categories or your company execution, your corporate mindset, that has allowed you to communicate and execute this pricing better than peers in the rest of the industry? I\u2019d just love to hear your perspective on that because I know you\u2019ve invested a lot in the kind of capabilities, not just now but I mean that\u2019s been a buzzword for Hershey for years as far as understanding what the data is telling you about your ability to price. Is it that? Is it the people? What is it? Michele Buck : I mean, I\u2019ll take a crack at a few things. First of all, I think that we all believe that at the root of that is having great brands that consumers see the value in. And right, it\u2019s about the consumer value proposition. It\u2019s one of the reasons that over the years we\u2019ve been such strong believers in investing in our brands, because the more we invest the greater awareness, the greater connectivity consumers have, and with that connectivity they\u2019re more connected to the brands, they don\u2019t want to switch to another brand. And so I think, I would say fundamentally I think that\u2019s one key thing that\u2019s an advantage for us. Secondly, we have had great analytics over the years. We\u2019ve always had a big focus on our elasticity models. You know that over time we\u2019ve always focused on pricing pretty aggressively is one of the tools in our toolkit to deliver our P&L and to deliver our business. And I think we just continued to try and take that capability to the next level all the time as we\u2019ve broadened it to, okay, we can get the insights on pricing in our category. Then we started to look at cross-category price elasticity so we could understand any trade-offs that could occur between our category and other categories. Then we started to invest in price pack architecture and look at how could we generate price realization without a list price but by changing the game. So I guess, I would say to me at the heart of it are those things, and I wouldn\u2019t underestimate as well the trusting relationships we have with our retailers. We\u2019ve always taken an approach of looking out for what\u2019s best for the category, not being so self-serving and so I think our retailers appreciate that and work really hard with us to get to the right outcomes because of that. Jonathan Feeney : Helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Pamela Kaufman : Hi. Good morning. Michele Buck : Good morning. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. Pamela Kaufman : I wanted to see if you can elaborate on what level of pricing growth is embedded into your guidance for 2022. And in terms of demand elasticity, it seems you experienced some elasticity in Confectionary, but this wasn\u2019t as evident in Snacks. Do you have different expectations for demand elasticity within Salty Snacks versus Confectionary? And how will pricing growth vary across the North America segments? Steve Voskuil : I\u2019ll take the first one. Overall pricing that we\u2019ve assumed in the plan is 5 points to 6 points. In terms of the difference with the Salty Snacks business, really not a big difference from an elasticity standpoint is the way we look at that and plan for that. Those two are pretty similar. The last question I might have missed. Was there a third one? Or was that it? Pamela Kaufman : That was it. Thank you for that. And on media spend, can you elaborate on what your plans are for media investment in 2022? Do you expect it to increase? I know you mentioned that it will be stronger in the back half of the year, but how should we think about it overall? And what are some of the key initiatives there? Michele Buck : So, our dollars will be up slightly for the year in media. More of the increase will come towards the back part of the year as we\u2019re in an increasingly better supply position. And there aren\u2019t really a lot of big changes fundamentally in terms of how we\u2019re advertising. We do a significant portion of our spending that is in digital like we have been for many years and so there\u2019s not a big shift in how we\u2019re spending the dollars. Pamela Kaufman : Great. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. Operator : Our next question is from John Baumgartner with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. John Baumgartner : Good morning. Thanks for the question. Michele Buck : Good morning. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. John Baumgartner : Just building on, coming back to John Feeney\u2019s question and your areas of focus and sort of differentiation. Michele, can you speak to where you feel you are right now on the distribution side? You\u2019ve had quite a bit of success these last few years in terms of gaining new front end displays, modernizing middle of the store and the packaging there, the self-checkouts. At this point, where is your focus regarding those efforts for 2022 and beyond? Where are the opportunities that remain for TDPs and distribution and quality placements from here? Thank you. Michele Buck : Sure. I think some of the areas of focus for us going forward, self-checkout, queueing lines are a big area of focus. Right now, we\u2019re seeing a lot of retailers, given some of the pressure on labor, focusing there. And the other big area and push for us is in what I would call non-traditional channels. We have over the years kind of started distribution in areas like home improvement stores, and as our products have done well there it then gives us the opportunity to expand from having some instant consumable items to putting our take-home portfolio, to even putting seasons during those specific times. Those are the biggest opportunities for focus in 2022. John Baumgartner : Then I guess related, thinking about distribution internationally, whether it\u2019s Brazil, India, Mexico, you\u2019ve been expanding distribution there as well. How do you think about the opportunities, whether it\u2019s traditional trade, modern trade, what\u2019s sort of driving that? Is there a way to think about either ACV penetration or total outlet penetration? How much opportunity is left as you think about sort of reframing international growth going forward? Michele Buck : Our businesses in most of the international markets \u2013 set aside Canada where we\u2019re very developed \u2013 we continue to have distribution opportunities. If I looked at Mexico I would say yes, traditional trade is an untapped and an area of opportunity going forward. If I look at the other markets in which we do business, the bulk of the business in India is traditional trade and so there I would call it more just getting broad distribution is the opportunity and building scale, continuing to build scale in areas like Brazil. Western Europe, we\u2019ve had a lot of strength just in getting our brands in distribution across the board in modern trade, in the regular trade there. Great success with Reese. We\u2019re seeding growth in a lot of other countries through our export model, which is really just a distributor model where we get our products on shelf. Again, a lot of that is in either Western Europe or parts of EMEA. John Baumgartner : Great. Thanks, Michele. Thanks for your time. Michele Buck : Sure. Operator : We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I will now turn the call over to Melissa Poole for closing remarks. Melissa Poole : Thank you so much for joining us this morning. I\u2019ll be available throughout the day for any additional questions you may have. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Melissa Poole, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Hershey Company. Thank you. Please go ahead. Melissa Poole : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for The Hershey Company\u2019s first quarter 2022 earnings Q&A session. I hope everyone has had the chance to read our press release and listen to our pre-recorded management presentation, both of which are available on our website.

Reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning's press release. Joining me today are Hershey's Chairman and CEO, Michele Buck; and Hershey's Senior Vice President and CFO, Steve Voskuil. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] The first question is coming from Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Please go ahead. Andrew, your line is live. Please make sure you're not muted on your end. Andrew Lazar : Good morning, everybody. Can you hear me? Operator : Yes, we can hear you. Melissa Poole : Yes, yes, we can. Andrew Lazar : Great. Thank you. I guess, first off by our estimate, it seems like you're raising full year organic sales by essentially the over delivery in the first quarter, meeting expectations for the remainder of the year haven't changed. Is that the way you're looking at it? And if so, I guess, why is that given the momentum in the business? And I realize you'll start to lapse some of the pricing as the year unfolds. Michele Buck : Hey Andrew, good morning. I'm going to kick it off with a few responses and ask Steve to jump in as well. So first of all, I'd say we are really pleased with our first quarter results and the momentum that we see on the business. But it is pretty early in the year still. And as we all know, we continue to see significant volatility in the marketplace, whether it's record inflation, the Ukraine-Russia situation, continued disruption in the supply chain. As we dissect the business in the first quarter, clearly within the first quarter, the large majority of our sales were related to stronger elasticities that have been realized in the marketplace. But we do anticipate as we look further out in the year that we'll see some moderation on those elasticities, perhaps back to more historic levels. And a lot of that is driven by that reduction in government subsidies and the continued inflation pressure that we think consumers will experience. There was another component of our Q1 sales beat that was about a raise, that was about Dot's and our ability to really get our arms around the Dot's business and better understand what we thought it could deliver for the year. We have pretty good visibility into that. So we feel like the number there is pretty good. And then lastly, as we look at inventory, we've been really working hard to build inventory and we did get more inventory out to retail. We made a decision to do that in Q1 to really try and increase on-shelf availability. So from a sales perspective, as we look at what we realized versus how we think that will impact back half of the year, we think the strength in Q1 from sales is much stronger, but Steve, do you want to comment more about that and also relative to the constant profit situation. Steve Voskuil : Yes, on the top line, I think you hit all the key points. The inventory piece was about a three point benefit to the first quarter. That'll come out in the back half. So that's one of the unique things, I guess, that drove the first quarter performance. And then Michele touched on the elasticities, we saw big benefit in the first quarter. We do expect to see elasticities normalize a bit as we go forward quarter-by-quarter through the year so those are probably the two biggest things that's soften a little bit of the outlook on the top line. Andrew Lazar : Great. And then I guess, the second one would be sort of a similar thought process, but more on the EPS side, obviously the first quarter came in some $0.40 higher than the Street and raising the full year by $0.07. Maybe can you bridge that gap for us a little bit? Are you trying to be just somewhat conservative in your thought process given obviously an increasingly dynamic environment, which makes total sense or are there some other things that are more discreet that we want to make sure to keep in mind on the profit side? Thank you. Steve Voskuil : Sure. Yes. The biggest driver for first quarter earnings was that volume \u2013 4.5 points volume in the quarter that dropped through to earnings. So that was the biggest factor. And there were some unique pieces as well. I think we called out a couple in the remarks. One was inventory reevaluation, which is sort of an unusual thing. We see it in times of higher inflation which has the impact of giving a benefit to the P&L and putting more cost on the balance sheet to reflect the cost of goods value there. So that was 100 basis points to the confection segment in this quarter that won't repeat going forward. And as you said, we do expect more year to go inflation. In the first quarter saw a little bit of that incremental inflation, but as we look forward, despite the hedging that we have in place, we're still going to have some incremental exposure, particularly to the commodities impacted by the events in Eastern Ukraine \u2013 or Eastern Europe, sorry. Andrew Lazar : Thank you so much. Michele Buck : Thanks Andrew. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Moskow : Hi, thanks for the question. There's a lot of detail in the prepared remarks about competitive activity that caused you to lose some market share during the Easter and your capacity constraints that led to that. As we head into Halloween, are you in a position to ramp up sufficiently so that you can hold your share? And the reason I ask is I remember during the pandemic, Halloween was a real tipping point for your distribution with retailers. You gained a lot of Goodwill after that. You gained a lot of distribution, are you in a position so that that there's no risk of that reversing? Michele Buck : Yes. So Rob clearly over the past two years, we have had some nice gains in share and certainly those have contracted recently given some of the capacity pressure. I think we're up about 50 basis points versus where we were pre-pandemic and our share versus our next largest competitor that gap has clearly widened and remains pretty strong about 200 basis points ahead of pre-pandemic levels. We are doing everything we can relative to building capacity, investing in new lines, distribution centers, hiring more people to build our supply as much as possible and working really closely with retailers as well on our plans for Halloween right now. So we expect that as we go through the year, we will continue to have supply challenges, although they will improve as we progress throughout the year. And we're working a hard to maximize the opportunity for Halloween. Robert Moskow : Well, Halloween commitments are probably made pretty early. Can you give us any color as to what you're able to commit to right now? Michele Buck : So we believe that just as we've seen strengths in the seasons over the past two years that we will continue to see strengths in the seasons throughout the year. This year we've seen it in Easter, but at this point in time, we're not going to give any more specifics on exactly what those growth numbers are going to be. I guess, I would say overall, what I would say is we're not really seeing any big changes in how our competitors are operating or in their strategies. So really it's a focus on us continuing to build supply. Over the past two years, we grew pounds about 7% versus our competitors in the marketplace collectively had a 1% decline in pounds. So we are just a little tighter on supplying capacity than the environment. Robert Moskow : Okay. Thanks for the question. Michele Buck : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Ken Goldman of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Ken Goldman : Hi, thank you. I wanted to ask about the margins and profitability in Salty Snacks. Steve, you gave a helpful explanation of a lot of the reasons behind, maybe what could be considered a little sluggishness versus what people were looking for, but I'm curious, to what extent did it fall below your expectations, if at all, what were the key drivers of that shortfall if there was one? And how quickly might we see a little bit of a rebound there? Steve Voskuil : Yes, thanks Ken. Yes, it was sluggish from our side as well. Some of the margin degradation we expected. So the mix piece that we called out, obviously, as we brought Dot's into that portfolio. We also planned on higher raw materials for the portfolio for the year, but the incremental inflation that we've seen more recently again following the events in Eastern Europe are falling more into the Salty Snack space. So thinking cooking oil, wheat, and then just the smaller business impact on oil price flowing through that P&L so that was I could say a surprise piece relative to the raw material side. We're also in the process of starting up a new distribution center that began in the first quarter, we'll continue through the second quarter. And I'd say the startup there's been a little bit bumpier than we expected, although we're working our way through it and expect to see improvement as we go through with the next quarter. And then we did have also some higher advertising expense in the first quarter and that will moderate. That was part of the plan to spend more in the first quarter in part to offset some of the elasticity due to price increases there, which I think we've done a good job of because that business is growing strong double-digits, but we'll see that begin to moderate as we get to the next couple of quarter. So if I kind of point to the things that were a bit unusual, I'd say the DC startup, the incremental inflation, and probably higher advertising spend that we would normally see in that business. Ken Goldman : Thank you. And just a quick follow up. I know these things are hard to sort of parse out, but is there any way to think about what the gross margin roughly might have been in the first quarter, if you were to exclude the inventory fill, you may have called that out and I missed it. I'm just curious for an estimate there. Steve Voskuil : Yes. We didn't go that far in the remark and sort of back into what it might have been. What I would say is we talked about this a little bit on the last call as well. The opportunity here is really to optimize the new snacking division. So as we look at, even the work we're doing with the distribution center that's all pointed towards driving network efficiency. We're going to be working through supply chain efficiencies and of course, eventually back office efficiencies as well. And so we continue to be excited about the opportunity to drop more margin out of that business as we gain scale and get some of those integration points together. Ken Goldman : Thanks so much. Steve Voskuil : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jason English : Hey, good morning, folks. Thanks for letting me in. Michele Buck : Good morning. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. Jason English : Couple questions. So first snack margins, I think you said you had about 500 basis points degradation from mix. I imagine a good chunk of that's coming from the manufacturing asset you picked up. So question on that, how much snack capacities in that asset and you mentioned in prepared remarks that you're beginning to lean in and start producing some of your other snack items on that network, how much can you move over and how far can you shrink that 500 bps as you improve asset utilization and presumably migrate production from outsource providers to in-source? Steve Voskuil : Yes, so a couple things there. One, inside that makes us also the amortization, the incremental amortization that deals with. So not all of it is capacity related. That's going to be around for a while obviously. As we look at combining supply chains, those assets are pretty well utilized. They were a little bit less utilized in the first quarter than will be for the balance of the year. But we continue to see opportunities to continue to leverage those assets. They've got some world-class manufacturing assets. That's one of the reasons we are able to bring a Pirate Booty asset into that mix as early as we did. And we want \u2013 the plan is to see more of that sort of consolidated manufacturing. And so, we'd expect to see some mitigation of that mix impact as we continue to leverage those assets and drive more volume through that system. Jason English : Got it. And back to the comments on market share attributed to capacity constraints. I just pulled your brand level data just to get a snapshot of like, which brands are holding you back a bit. And it's brands like Kit Kat, Reese\u2019s, Twizzler, those don't seem like the types of brands you'd be capacity constrained on, are they \u2013 or where are the capacity constraints? Michele Buck : Yes. So our biggest capacity constraint is really on Reese and some of our assorted bags, but primarily Reese as you know, Reese is our biggest brand by far, it's over \u2013 it's a couple billion dollars in size and when it is growing double-digits, as it has been and had such a track record of strong growth that is \u2013 that's where some of the biggest rub and the biggest dollar opportunity that we're focused on. And then some of our other take home brands, obviously given the strength of consumers now consuming at-home, there's a lot of pressure on some of the brands in terms of how they show up in take home and that's spread across a number of different brands. Jason English : Got it. Okay. Thanks. I'll pass it on. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Alexia Howard of Bernstein. Please go ahead. Alexia Howard : Good morning, everyone. Michele Buck : Good morning. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. Alexia Howard : Okay, so a couple of questions here. The Dot's Pretzel acquisition, obviously incredibly strong growth year-on-year that you reported in the remarks, could you talk about the distribution opportunity, where is the ACV at the moment, where could it get to? I mean, is this something that I guess how large is the opportunity, we'll start there. Michele Buck : Yes, so we are continuing to build distribution on Dot's. So clearly as we're acquiring the brand, the distribution remains skewed to kind of the West Coast, the middle of the country. And we've had a big focus on trying to close the distribution gap on the East Coast in particular and then to also fill in, in some of the key retailers and classes of trades throughout. So it's been a constant build. We had a lot of distribution growth in Q1, and I believe that we're in the mid-70s right now on distribution. So there remains some upside that we're experiencing now, we continue to drive through the back part of the year. So we continue gain household penetration as a result of that. And that continue \u2013 as more consumers find out about the brand, household awareness of the brand continues to be low. And we see that as a key opportunity as well. Alexia Howard : Great. And then can I ask about on a different topic, on the C-store dynamics, there have been concerns in the past that when gasoline prices spike that leads to fewer trips and therefore that hits your C-store sales. Can you talk about what you're seeing in that segment and whether that's the case this time around or if you're seeing something different. Thank you. And I'll pass it on. Michele Buck : Yes. So we have seen some changes in consumer behavior within convenience stores, as gas prices have risen. But what we're seeing is that many consumers seem to be trying to manage the higher price by not fully filling their tanks. So they're making more trips but just not filling as full. And to-date, they have not reduce their non-gas purchases in a meaningful way. And we haven't seen an impact. Our business remains quite strong in convenience stores. So we haven't really seen an impact on our business that we do expect that these trends will continue to evolve as we see some of those pressures we talked about earlier relative to reduction in government subsidies and the continued persistence of inflation and the impact on consumers. Alexia Howard : Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on. Michele Buck : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Bryan Spillane : Thanks operator. Good morning, everyone. Michele Buck : Good morning. Bryan Spillane : I had just one question and it's around inflation in gross margins. So can you just help a little bit with based on the incremental inflation you saw in the first quarter, you've widened your expectation for growth margins changed, is we're kind of looking at this kind of moving even past the fiscal year. Like what will you be able to do to begin to mitigate or offset that margin pressure? Is it going to be as some of this new capacity, come on, there's more efficiencies, is pricing potentially a lever in the mix, just really trying to understand as we move forward, are you going to be able to mitigate that margin pressure? Steve Voskuil : Yes. It\u2019s really all of those Bryan. We\u2019re certainly going to look at all our usual levers, driving productivity and efficiency from a manufacturing standpoint. And we will see more of that as we get more scale and more assets coming online. So that\u2019ll be a factor. But we \u2013 pricing is always part of our strategy. We look at it all the time. We\u2019re very sensitive to both the consumer and what\u2019s happening from a cost \u2013 input cost standpoint. And we\u2019ll continue to look at that as we think about our plan for next year. Bryan Spillane : Okay. But as it stands now, you haven\u2019t contemplated or you haven\u2019t embedded in the guidance isn\u2019t any incremental pricing actions or other actions to offset that inflation. You\u2019re just absorbing the inflation right now. Steve Voskuil : That\u2019s right. What\u2019s in the outlook right now is the pricing that we\u2019ve already announced that flowing through the P&L for the year. Bryan Spillane : Okay. Perfect. All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Michael Lavery of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Michael Lavery : Thank you. Good morning. Michele Buck : Good morning. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. Michael Lavery : I know the gas price increases is a factor that may make it a little bit harder to tease this out or really recognize it. But can you talk about mobility? And just some of the consumer patterns you\u2019re seeing there as things are reopening more, consumers are getting out more. How does that impact some of your obviously higher margin instant consumable products? Are you seeing any shifts or anything that\u2019s notable in terms of the mix of what they\u2019re buying and where? Michele Buck : So, yes, we definitely are seeing consumer mobility has returned its strong, it\u2019s interesting. It\u2019s certainly dialed up versus what it was before. And at the same time, we\u2019re still seeing a lot of interest in some of the at-home behaviors where people haven\u2019t totally returned to some things like restaurants and some activities, frankly, not as much because of COVID a little bit more because of some of the price pressure of inflation. So we are seeing some consumers try to consolidate trips, but we haven\u2019t really seen a meaningful impact to our total trips. And we\u2019ve been looking across each class of trade. I\u2019d say food is strong, has accelerated, C-store I mentioned before, quite strong, which is a key indicator of mobility. But really across most classes of trade dollar, mass, food and C-store, the trends remain quite strong. Michael Lavery : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And just on international, those margins were better than expected and very strong. That segment has some pretty significant seasonality. But can you just help us understand some of what\u2019s driving that and how to think about the rest of the year? Is it likely to keep up some of those gains? Or what\u2019s the right way to frame how that plays out over the course of the year. Steve Voskuil : Yes. The business has done really well. All of our core markets had double digit top line growth, so that was a good starting point. And then we\u2019re still seeing through the first quarter, the last bits of some of the restructuring that we did in China. So that\u2019s giving a little bit of an incremental benefit to the first quarter that I would say is probably not going to be a year-over-year component going forward. But I would also commend the international team for looking at the whole P&L and managing their cost structure and executing a smart pricing strategy as well. Michael Lavery : Okay, great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Cody Ross of UBS. Please go ahead. Cody Ross : Good morning, everyone and thank you for taking our questions. You just noted that you don\u2019t plan on taking additional pricing the rest of the year. However, most companies that have already reported this season discuss taking additional pricing. Why is that? Michele Buck : We remain very confident in our pricing strategy and our ability to get price realization. As Steve mentioned, what you\u2019re seeing in our P&L right now is the pricing that we announced last year flowing through into the business. We all know that this remains a volatile environment. The cost side has continued to evolve, especially with continued supply chain pressure and also the Ukraine-Russia situation. And as always, we will continue to look at every lever at our disposal as we always do to make the best decisions for the business. Cody Ross : Got you. And then you noted the Russian-Ukrainian war is affecting supply availability. Are there any commodities you can call out that you\u2019re having difficulty securing? And do you expect to have any issues securing supply for balance of the year? Thank you. Steve Voskuil : Yes. At this stage \u2013 taking the last part first, we don\u2019t foresee a challenge and availability for the balance of this year. Where we\u2019ve probably seen the most pressure is in the cooking oil space. A lot of that source out of Eastern Europe but our business is resilient and we\u2019ve got other sources and other solutions that working through to ensure that we be able to satisfy consumer needs, even if we face some more pressure next year on that commodity. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll move on to the next question, which is coming from Chris Growe of Stifel. Please go ahead. Chris Growe : Hi. Good morning. Michele Buck : Good morning. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. Chris Growe : Good morning. I just had a question for you. Just to follow-up on the fact you\u2019re able to rebuild some inventory this quarter. It sounds like you\u2019re going to have some more in the second quarter now, and it\u2019s more heavily favored towards the first half. I just want to be \u2013 so before we had thought about that happening in the second half, do you continue to build inventory in the second half? And I guess what I\u2019m ultimately getting to is when can you start \u2013 will you be at a point where you can start to market and promote more normally like you had historically? Steve Voskuil : Yes. We\u2019re going to continue to build inventory. We\u2019re going to see \u2013 you should see sequential improvement more for this year pulled this first half. But we want to continue to build inventory. And as Michele said earlier, and we\u2019ve got a lot of capacity coming online, the first quarter was our highest production quarter ever. And as we get more capacity coming online, we expect to see that build and be able to catch up both on our own internal inventory and trade and retail inventory. Chris Growe : And then is that \u2013 can marketing start like more aggressively this year? Or is this more like next year? Steve Voskuil : Well, we\u2019re going to make sure that we\u2019re fully participating in seasons. Just as we talked about earlier with Halloween and make sure that we\u2019re getting all of our products out of inventory and onto the shelves as quickly as we can so that we can continue to support the brand. And we\u2019ll see more of that support pickup as we get to the back half of the year. Chris Growe : Okay. And just one follow-up question on the gross margin. You have a little more aggressive decline, because of the increase in costs that you expect now for the year. Is that any differently weighted by quarter? Is Q2 any worse or Q3? It caused me to have to bring my estimates down for the remainder of the year for the gross margin, given how strong it was here in the first quarter. I just want to get a sense of how that plays out across the rest of the year. Is it just a timing of inflation that will dictate sort of the quarterly progression in the gross margin? Steve Voskuil : Yes. I\u2019d say it\u2019s mostly that. As we look at our plan, we probably see the most pressure in quarter two, but then begins to improve because the last get a little bit easier. So if I had to pick a quarter, I\u2019d probably say quarter two would be the worst. Chris Growe : Okay. Thanks so much for your time. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Steve Powers : Great. Thank you. Two questions actually. The first one just to build on the gross margins theme. The prepared remarks suggest to call out the 120 to 140 basis points of contraction, but then equate that with gross profit dollars increasing mid single digits, my math may be wrong, but I think given your top line that seems a pretty conservative combination of top line and gross margins. So just wanted to get some color on that mid single digit dollar profit growth language in the prepared marks. And then secondly, you call out seeing some impact in certain consumer goods categories from the inflation that we\u2019re all seeing and from the declining government assistance that\u2019s occurring. I was hoping you could just give a little bit more color as to what specifically you\u2019re seeing and how you\u2019re monitoring that going forward. Thank you. Steve Voskuil : Sure. On the first part of that question, there\u2019s no intentional conservatism between what we are seeing on the top line and what we\u2019re seeing on the gross margin line. And so it should tie, but technically we should see about 7% gross profit growth mid \u2013 kind of mid high single digit range growth. And I think that math will work, but happy to take that on the side, if we want to go into more detail. Steve Powers : Mid to high makes sense. Sorry, mid to high makes sense. Just the language in the text actually just says mid. So thank you for clarifying. Steve Voskuil : Yep. Michele Buck : And on your other question, we are constantly looking at a couple things relative to the strength of retail takeaway in other CPG categories, as well as our own. And also how much market share is going to private label as that has typically also been a predictor of the consumer. We\u2019re fortunate in our category, not to have significant private label, but certainly in other categories where that\u2019s present we do look at that as well. Steve Powers : Okay. Very good. Thank you for that. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Edge. Please go ahead. Jonathan Feeney : Good morning. Thanks. A question and maybe a follow-up all at one. The question is, you guided us on the magnitude of this retailer inventory replacement for the full year. But has that grown significantly with the better than expected experience in the first quarter, not only in your brands, but across the category to the elasticity. I can\u2019t imagine retailers and your competitors thought the uptake to this magnitude of pricing would be that good. I mean, maybe I\u2019m wrong about that. So that is my first part \u2013 my first question. And then how does Easter play into that? Because you called out in your prepared remarks that people were buying more every day product because of the shortages of Easter product. And that certainly seems to be born out in the data. I wonder, doesn\u2019t that add to the retailer inventory need going forward and maybe augment the opportunity to fill to greater levels throughout the year, not just what you had talked about it, and you may be pulling it forward from your prior guidance on inventory fill. Thanks. Steve Voskuil : Taking the last bit first. Yes, Easter will \u2013 the Easter sell through was high. We saw more every day takeaway. And that will put more pressure on retailer and trade inventory. So that will happen. As we look at the full year though, we still \u2013 I said, we\u2019re not seeing a fundamental shift in what we had planned relative to being able to restock. As we said earlier, we got to benefit in the first quarter, we pushed more out. The elasticity has put for the full year a bit more volume through. And so that\u2019s true. But also, we have \u2013 we expect to see additional production pick up as we go through the year to help compensate that to some degree. So I think net-net it\u2019s not a big change in total. But to your point, the sell through on Easter is going to put a little bit more pressure on some trade inventory. Jonathan Feeney : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from John Baumgartner of Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. John Baumgartner : Good morning. Thanks for the question. Michele Buck : Good morning. John Baumgartner : Michele, one standout over the past two years has been your increases in share of distribution points, whether it be chocolate or non-chocolate candy. And I can appreciate the capacity constraints right now sort of work against that. But putting that aside, how are you thinking about the resources to sustain and grow as capacity improves? I mean, just given all the upheavals over the past two years, whether it\u2019s more promotion, more in-store sales force hours, more advertising investment. Where \u2013 how do you see those levers of engagement requiring change in a post-COVID world? Michele Buck : Boy, I\u2019d say, my first answer to that question is the resources to sustain and grow are in supply chain building capacity to really be able to drive against the very strong demand. So probably first and foremost, I think that\u2019s the focus. I believe we have the retail resources that we need from a sales perspective. Our sales organization, from a marketing capability, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s maybe as much about people we\u2019ve continued to invest in capability with a new media partner, better targeting capabilities. Certainly that helps us to really maximize consumer demand and then maintaining the strong relationships that we have with retailers and just continue to evolve the total bundle of investment we have to drive against demand with our retailers and our consumers. But right now I think we\u2019re focused really on supply chain, hiring more people in manufacturing facilities, engineers to execute the capacity work. That\u2019s really where the focus is. John Baumgartner : And I guess, just sticking with that theme on supply chain. You\u2019ve done a lot of work there, adding manufacturing lines, fulfilment center and so on. And I guess, weak link is probably too strong of a term. But where do you think the supply chain still needs more work right now, whether it\u2019s modernization, automation. Just outsize, does it increases on capacity? What sort of is kind the next phase of I guess, evolution there? Michele Buck : Well, clearly as we are executing this capacity and looking at the future, automation, yes is a big lever across the business. We still have opportunities in some of our manufacturing facilities for what we call single point of automation, say an automated case pack or whatever the basic automation is. And then we kind of go to the connectivity of all the different parts of our system, talking to each other. And across our entire business, not just supply chain, we continue to look at opportunities where technology can allow us to operate more efficiently, give us better insights, et cetera. And then certainly as we look at our Salty business, now that we are gaining more scale and have many more businesses in that portfolio. As Steve mentioned earlier, we\u2019re doing a lot of work on just optimizing the overall supply chain network and what that looks like. And that\u2019s more efficient distribution. It is more efficient manufacturing, really across the board and that\u2019s somewhat of a transformation. John Baumgartner : Okay. Thanks, Michele. Michele Buck : Yes. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from David Palmer of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Palmer : Thanks. Just a quick question about scanner data. It looks like Hershey\u2019s behind some of the competitors in pricing, although we don\u2019t always see a perfect lens into what actual list pricing is. Do you think that that Hershey\u2019s behind the competition when it comes to list price increases lately? Or are we just seeing some noise in there? Michele Buck : Yes. I don\u2019t believe we are behind. This is a category where it tends to be line priced. It\u2019s really noise related to Easter and just the mix of items that vary across different competitors during the Easter timeframe. I think as we go forward, you\u2019ll see that really even out. David Palmer : And then just a question on advertising and promotions those were down lately, sort of understandable given the capacity constraints. But what\u2019s your outlook for advertising spend? And then maybe you can layer on top of that your general philosophy and what you\u2019re thinking there? One thought is, you might layer in as your capacity increases some more advertising, but some of the industry are talking about digital marketing becoming more expensive and maybe lower ROI. So just any thoughts on that would be helpful. Michele Buck : Okay. So, we are big believers in advertising. I think we\u2019ve talked a lot about our model is we are pleased to have some of the strongest gross margins in the end of street, and we believe in the model and then using some of those funds to reinvest in our brands and be one of the highest investors in the industry. It\u2019s a highly responsive category with a strong impulsive nature as well. As you look to the rest of the year, we believe we will be up mid to high single digits and we will continue to invest as we expand capacity wherever we can because we\u2019re big believers. Media efficiencies have really helped us to control the dollar cost because as a result of a new partnership and also new capabilities, we\u2019ve gotten more efficiencies in our media. I think from a philosophy perspective, relative to your question about digital. We have not seen decline in list and return. And I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s \u2013 if they\u2019re being offset because we\u2019ve built capabilities, new capabilities to better target. And so we\u2019re actually seeing a stronger targeting capability and thus better efficiency. David Palmer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Ms. Poole for closing comments. Melissa Poole : Thank you for joining us this morning. I will be available throughout the day and tomorrow for any follow-up questions you may have. Thank you for your time this morning. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today\u2019s event. You may disconnect your lines or log off the webcast at this time and enjoy the rest of your day.",

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Melissa Poole, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Hershey Company. Thank you. You may begin. Melissa Poole : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for The Hershey Company's second quarter 2022 earnings Q&A session. I hope everyone has had the chance to read our press release and listen to our prerecorded management remarks, both of which are available on our website.

Reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning's press release. Joining me today are Hershey's Chairman and CEO, Michele Buck; and Hershey's Senior Vice President and CFO, Steve Voskuil. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Lazar : Great. Thanks so much. Good morning everybody. Michele Buck : Good morning. Andrew Lazar : As you discussed in the prepared remarks, inventory refill has certainly been nicely additive to volume growth through the first half of the year. Where do you think retailers are at this stage? And how much more of a benefit, I guess, can this be in the second half from the prepared remarks, if I'm reading it right, it seems to suggest maybe the bulk of that inventory refill is behind you at this point and maybe no longer enough to necessarily offset what volume elasticity you are seeing? So just some clarity there would be helpful. Steve Voskuil : Yeah, that's exactly right, Andrew. We saw a pretty strong inventory replenishment in the second quarter as we commented. A portion of that was a pull-forward from the second half, so really a timing move. So as we look at the back half, we're really not seeing any additional meaningful inventory replenishment in the second half guidance. Andrew Lazar : Right. And then sort of following on that, I guess, as you and others slowly start to get back to a better inventory position and some of the supply constraints slowly ease. I guess, not surprisingly, we're starting to hear from, I think from Hershey and others that they'll be in a better position, maybe for the first time in a while, right, to begin to kind of ramp back up merchandising activity to drive volume and traffic. And I can understand why in this environment, some might simply see that as retailer concessions, given all the pricing that's come through in the industry and with commodities starting to roll over. I assume you see this as more getting back to maybe a more normal cadence of spending and really looking just to drive volumes and traffic and protect elasticity\u2019s that I still think can be, in many cases, incremental to the business, but I was hoping, Michelle, you could kind of comment a little bit on that, if you could. Thank you so much. Michele Buck : Yeah, absolutely. As we have always talked about our investment model or our model and running the businesses, we strongly believe in investing to drive the top line and with our strong margins that enables us on the bottom line. So we always want to be spending to the consumer advertising our brands, having the right levels of promotion, the right levels of innovation. And as we mentioned earlier, given some of those supply constraints, we did have to pull off on that a bit just because it didn't make sense to make those investments given some of those constraints. But we very much look forward to re-upping the investments as we look at the second half. We have always planned an increase both in DMEs as well as incremental merchandising coming back online. Andrew Lazar : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Alexia Howard : Good morning, everyone. Michele Buck : Hi, Alexia. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. Alexia Howard : Hi there. So can I ask about the -- you talked about the general supply chain disruption that you're still experiencing. Can you talk about exactly where the pain points are? And I'm thinking across raw materials, packaging, labor, where are the things that you're really wrestling with at the moment? And are you seeing light at the end of the tunnel at this point? It sounds as though things are getting a little easier. And then I have a follow-up. Michele Buck : I mean I'd say, generally, we continue to see struggles across the supply chain. How I'd characterize it is what those are have evolved. So where we are now, I would say, early on, it was some of the basic logistics issues largely driven by labor. And as we've evolved, I'd say, we're now starting to see bigger concerns relative to scarcity of ingredients, needing to leverage different suppliers at higher costs and price points in order to secure production and then also the geopolitical environment has put certain strains on the business. Certainly, the Ukraine-Russia issue created some scarcity and issue with ingredients. And more recently, there have been additional restrictions from Russia on the EU relative to natural gas. Germany will be impacted. That's an area where we source a lot of equipment, supplies, as do many of our suppliers. So I would say that that's kind of evolved. Steve, would you add anything to that? Steve Voskuil : The only thing I would add is that we're also starting to see more cost flow through from third parties, so co-packers, co-manufacturers, and those -- a lot of those are under contract, and so it happens as those contracts renew but they're facing the same cost pressures and disruptions that we're facing. And so we're starting to see more of that impact the P&L as well. Michele Buck : I guess I'd also just add, we have made significant progress in investments in capacity, significant investments. And so part of our short-term pain was once you make those investments, it takes some time to get them up and running to get to the lines actually in place. And so part of some of the relief we're seeing is the gradual coming online of those capabilities as well, which is helpful. Alexia Howard : That's super helpful. Thank you so much for all the color there. And just as a follow-up, how big is India these days. You called it out in the prepared remarks, I haven't seen much news on India for a while. And I'm just wondering, how do you avoid the same problems coming up that you had in China several years ago? I know you've moved -- backed off from China and doing it more arms length these days, why is India a different market? Why can that work over the longer term? Thank you and I\u2019ll pass it on. Michele Buck : India is still relatively very small for us, growing high double digits. But back when we really made our decisions on China and India, for me, the key difference in India is the cost of doing business in that market is very different. So media costs, labor costs. And so in both markets, we thought we had the potential to drive top line. But as we really did assessment and looked at the NPV of our investment, India is a market that we feel good about our prospects of getting to profitable growth. Frankly, we're already in a place that we like relative to where gross margins are on that business, very different than where we ever were in China. Alexia Howard : Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on. I appreciate the color. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Robert Moskow : Hi, Michele. Hi, Steve. Michele Buck : Hi. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. Robert Moskow : Good morning. I thought the comments about 2023 were pretty encouraging, albeit at a pretty early stage. You said that you expect your pricing actions to be partially offset by high single-digit inflation and then you also have productivity. So is that -- do you expect the pricing lap to offset inflation, cost inflation in 2023 because you've had lags in 2022. So I guess that's a positive. And then maybe you could talk about the advertising increase that you're thinking you need to do. How much of that is just restoring what's lagged so far? And how do you think about how much investment is needed? Steve Voskuil : Sure. Yeah. I mean, for 2023, we're still talking at a pretty high level. We'll get a lot more fine-tuned as we get through the third quarter and get more picture for next year. But we are seeing high single-digit price is the expectation to come through. Volume wise, we'll watch and see how consumers be able to know more about elasticity\u2019s as we come out of this year. And as you said, overall inflation, we're still seeing high single digits. When you peel into that, we'll have some -- I expect some commodity impact still as we'll be rolling off to more favorable hedges into hedges that were struck at prices that look more like recent times. We still see logistics and third-party cost impacts in there. And I think it's too soon yet to say whether the price is going to fully offset all of those inflationary impacts, we'll know more again as we get through the third quarter towards the end of the year. But we do want to increase advertising and we called that out in the remarks. We see that growing faster than the rate of sales. And as you said, it's really, as Michele said minutes ago, making sure that we continue to reinvest in brands, reinvest in consumers and have a healthy level of investment once we have supportability. Robert Moskow : Okay. Did you say that, Steve, that you expect your pricing to be up high single digit next year because of the flow-through? Steve Voskuil : That's correct. Robert Moskow : Okay, all right. Thank you. Michele Buck : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Ken Goldman : Hi, thank you. One quick one and then a longer one on Halloween. I just wanted to get a sense, if possible, for the North America salty snacks business, the margin going forward. We've seen some volatility there. Just wanted to kind of get a sense for how to model that in the next couple of quarters, given some of the cloudiness we have in our model or at least our model on that one? Steve Voskuil : Sure. I'd be happy to take that one. So as you saw in Q2 looks a lot like Q1. We continue to see higher raw material costs and logistics costs that for these two quarters are more than offsetting the price that we've taken so far. That said, we've announced more price increase in the second quarter. So as we roll forward through the next two quarters, we do expect to see some stability and relief there. We're also going to begin to lap in the back half some of the higher logistics costs that we've been talking about. And so that will provide a little bit of relief there as well. And then longer term, as we talked about on last quarter's call, we continue to advance the structural changes that we need to do for that division. So things like setting up or formalizing the supply chain, some of the back-office efficiencies that we need to put in place. And longer term, that will drive more structural improvement. But right now, it's kind of fighting the balance between pricing and inflation and commodities costs. Ken Goldman : Thank you for that. And then I wanted to ask about Halloween. It's early to be precise, but you guided to high single-digit sales growth. And you said that part of the reason is you're still capacity constrained, I was a little curious why the guidance wasn't higher. Maybe it's just -- there was a very difficult comp or you're facing a difficult comp from last year. Maybe it's just a little bit of conservatism because it's still early. But I would have expected maybe capacity to be less of an issue just given how important the holiday is. And maybe you could be rather in an all hands-on deck mode right and producing as much seasonal candy as possible. But maybe that's just an overly simplistic view of your supply chain. But I was just curious why that guidance wasn't a little bit higher? Michele Buck : So Ken, as we look at the business, we had a strategy of prioritizing every day on-shelf availability. It was a tough decision to balance that with the seasons, but we thought that was really important. And so that was a choice that we needed to make. We had opportunity to deliver more Halloween, but we weren't able to supply that. And we were really producing. We began producing Halloween back in the spring. And that's really when we needed to make these key decisions on what we were going to produce, so tough trade out to make. We feel really good about having high single-digit growth, but we also feel good about as we get into the future being able to have more capacity to really fulfill more of the demand that we see during the season. Steve Voskuil : It's definitely all hands on deck. You make mistake. Ken Goldman : Understood. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jason English : Hi, good morning folks. Thanks for letting me in. Michele Buck : Hi, Jason. Jason English : I guess I want to start on capacity because there's a little bit of conflicting messages here. I think on one side, you've got enough capacity to be refilling retailer inventory levels. But on the other side, you don't have enough capacity to meet demand for some products. Can you help me put those two conflicting things and also give me a little bit better understanding of where the bottlenecks are, and what the pathway and time line is to relieve those bottlenecks? Michele Buck : Yeah. So capacity is constrained, but obviously in certain parts of the portfolio, more than others. So there are certain places we have no constraints and there are other places that we are more constrained. We've shared previously that Reese's is one of the areas where we have seen high double-digit growth for extended periods of time. It's our very largest brand. So that's certainly been a pressure point. And then there are a few other places that have been pressure points and where we've needed to make trade-offs in order to prioritize some parts of the portfolio. So we continue to work through a capacity investment plan to address where the soft areas are and bring capacity online. So that might be part of the mixed messaging is there are certain places we're not constrained others that we are. Refreshment specifically Icebreakers Mint is one area where we had some production difficulties as we ramped production back up after the COVID softness. And so that's one place as well that we're continuing to work to get more supply available. Does that help? Jason English : It does. It doesn't shed a lot of light on when you think the issues will be behind you, but it certainly helps in understanding where the issues are. Michele Buck : So as we get through the issues, I would say we're making -- I would characterize it as gradual improvement. Certainly, we are, I would say, quite constrained this year. We see that gradually improving as we get through 2023. And as we get to 2024, we feel much better about our ability to be able to fully meet demand. So that's how I would characterize it. Steve, anything\u2026 Steve Voskuil : Yeah, just the color around in the last three years, we've invested on the order of $800 million on capacity mostly in the core. And so we've got 13 new lines in place coming online. We've refurbished 11 and so as Michele said, over the next year or two, we're going to start to see more significant capacity available. Michele Buck : If it helps. The investments that we made will result in about a 15% increase in our internal volume production capability. That should allow us to catch up but also to deliver some of that future growth. Jason English : For sure. That's helpful. And I want to come back to Rob Moskow's question real quick. It was -- I was surprised that you were offering color on 2023 this early? It's uncharacteristic of you. And it begs the question of why? I guess Rob showed one interpretation of, hey, like you have inflation, but your price above it. Don't worry gross margins are weak now, but they'll come back to growth next year. I guess, it's one way to interpret it. The other is your emphasis on we're going to lean into spending next year, so don't get out over your tips in terms of how much margin flow through is going to drop to the bottom line. Which were those two interpretations do you think we should be leaning towards? Steve Voskuil : I would just say it's still pretty early. We're trying to just give some broad movements on the top line and inflation. That's really the part that we could share. I say we're learning more every month and quarter that goes by, we'll have a lot more to share as we get to the end of the year. So really not trying to get ahead of our skis just extending some of the color we see right now. Michele Buck : And Jason, if I would just add a little bit was just related to some of the pricing that's in the marketplace and expecting to come, trying to put that in perspective around how much 2023 factored into that choice and just trying to make sure that everybody was understanding some of the inflation that we see coming in 2023 to help put some of that pricing in perspective as well. Jason English : For sure, for sure. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Bryan Spillane : Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. Michele Buck : Good morning. Steve Voskuil : Hi, Bryan. Bryan Spillane : Just wanted to follow-up on, I guess, the -- just the commentary around inflation. And I guess two things, Steve. One, you mentioned -- it's been mentioned in the call that there's some of the pressure is like scarcity of ingredients, and it's more than just like market-based type things, right? So I guess what I was trying to understand is just how much of the increase in COGS that you're experiencing now as maybe a more permanent shift? And how much of it is still a function of just the current environment, and maybe there will be some relief like disinflation at some point in time? So just trying to understand how much do you think is really just, hey, look, this is now our kind of permanently rebased higher costs, or is there -- or do you think some of this could be more variable and you get some disinflation in the future? Steve Voskuil : Yeah. So it's a really good question, and it's hard to answer that one with precision as you look at all the moving pieces there are clearly some that we would see as temporary. The scarcity issues, hopefully, some of the commodities pressures that are being influenced by the events in Eastern Europe, things like that. On the other side, we've seen more labor inflation and other things that could prove to be more structural. And so again, as we get to the end of the year, and we get some guidance for next year, I'll probably give some more color on that. But it is a mix. Some are temporary and some at least have the potential to be longer lasting. That said, we also focus on productivity and continuous improvement every year and extend the goal of that program is to be able to more than offset over time some of those structural costs. And so that also has to continue to advance. Bryan Spillane : Right, right, right. Okay. All right. That's all I had. Thank you. Michele Buck : Thanks. Steve Voskuil : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Michael Lavery : Thank you. Good morning. Michele Buck : Good morning. Steve Voskuil : Morning. Michael Lavery : I just wanted to come back to Dot's, which obviously is up very strongly. I would love to understand a little bit more some of the dynamics there. How much is distribution driven? And maybe more importantly, how much distribution upside runway do you still have left? Michele Buck : Sure. So we are absolutely very pleased with Dot's performance in the marketplace and the momentum that we see. I think what we're really happy about is we continue to gain distribution, but we are maintaining our velocities as we continue to broaden reach. And that can be a challenge to do as you continue to broaden reach into sometimes some of the smaller accounts. So all the trends are in line with our expectations. Retail sales growing about 50% over the past 12 weeks, share up about 370 basis points. We are right now lapping some large distribution increases from prior year. So we do expect to see a little bit of softening in trend as we overlap that, but we do have continued distribution upside as we took over the business, the distribution was really concentrated primarily in the center of the country and the West. And we're really still filling out the East and importantly, just making sure that we have the right placement in stores and then, of course, beginning to actually market and drive consumer messaging to the brand, which we help think will further drive upside in velocities. Michael Lavery : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up on the pricing, I know you've said you've got at least most if maybe not all of it that's announced. Is there any of that's sort of TBD or to be negotiated, or is it all locked and loaded and just a question of on the cloud ready to go out the door? Michele Buck : Our recent announced pricing action is being executed. It is going as planned, and we're starting to see some of the new retails in the market already. We feel good that we really took a consumer focused approach for the right retail price points, and we're also beginning to reset some of the promotional points. So overall, the prices are moving in line with our recommendations and our expected ranges. And we are pleased about that as we want to really move ahead with further investments in the business and capacity and consumer spending, new capabilities and the right programming and all of this will allow us to do that to drive profitable category growth. Michael Lavery : Okay, great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Growe with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Chris Growe : Thank you. Good morning. Michele Buck : Good morning. Chris Growe : Good morning. I just had a question first on your -- the recent price increases you put into place in particular, across confectionery. I guess, to understand, I guess you see very little of that coming through this year. It would seem like some would come through but very little. And then just to what degree that's caused you to build in a higher degree of elasticity into your second half assumption? I just want to get a better feel for that. Steve Voskuil : Sure. Yeah. I mean it's right. Most of it will impact next year. We will get a benefit in the fourth quarter. But even a portion of that benefit, we're reinvesting in \u2013 with the trade and to drive merchandising and so forth. But most of it will impact next year. In terms of elasticity assumptions, we do have in the back half in elasticity that is a little bit better than what we've seen historically, but a little bit worse than what we saw in the first half. It actually looks a lot like the second quarter, if you adjusted for the volume replenishment, that level of elasticity is the assumption for the back half. And then, of course, the range on guidance kind of goes up and down from there. Chris Growe : Okay. And then one related question to that would be, do you expect pricing to sequentially accelerate in the second quarter \u2013 I'm sorry, in the third quarter from the second quarter or maybe more Q4 with the confectionery pricing coming through? And then do you believe you can grow volume in the second half of the year? You've had some really strong volume trends to date. Steve Voskuil : Yeah. So we don't see sequential improvement in the third quarter. We do in the fourth quarter, and that's when we'll see the beginning effects of the price increase. And we don't expect to see volume growth. Again, with that elasticity impact defined with the pull forward of the inventory replenishment from the second half into the second quarter. Chris Growe : Got it. That's all I have. Thanks so much. Steve Voskuil : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Cody Ross with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Simon Negin : Good morning. This is Simon Negin filling in for Cody Ross. Could you give some additional detail into the delays in capacity coming online next year? Is this only impacting lease? And how much of an impact is expected? Steve Voskuil : The \u2013 so most of the capacity that will be coming online is focused on the core Reese's one significant component of that. I don't think we're going to be specific about exactly how much is coming on when, but that is the focus of the capacity. Simon Negin : Got you. And just one smaller question. Obviously, dots is demonstrating incredible growth largely distribution gains. Moving forward, do you expect a change in consumer's trialing new brands and products when budgets are squeezed more in this environment, perhaps sticking to what they're comfortable with? Michele Buck : It's a good question. I think across snacking, what we tend to see is consumers very much like their brands. So if you look across total food, as budgets are tighter, certainly, private label brands have grown share versus with across snacking, private label has not and consumers tend to like their brands. So I think that consumers will continue to try new brands, given that they have a real focus on brands within snacking. So we will closely monitor that. But at this point, we haven't seen any concerns around the slowdown in trial as a result of that. Simon Negin : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Feeney : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. And great quarter. As far as pricing over the next 6 to 12 months, assuming we have, if we did have a moderating cost environment, how you lived through a lot of ups and downs in cost in this business. How do the \u2013 if there's been so much conversation, so much acceleration in pricing, much of that headline cost driven. How does it work \u2013 if \u2013 what changes about the conversation if costs move sharply in the other direction? Like they did in grains, for example, at least so far, off their peak? If costs moderate, how do you handle that? Do people \u2013 does it typically play out that it's increased promotion? Do you see decreased list prices, or do you see no impact in just a significant increase in gross margin? Thanks. Michele Buck : Yeah. I mean our focus is always on driving profitable category growth and looking at how we can invest to do so. We have a deep list of investment priorities and growth driving opportunities and so we believe that this enables us to really invest to unlock whether that is in capacity, whether that is in the right consumer marketing support, whether that is in more impactful promotions, investments in innovation, technology, et cetera. So, we like to invest back in the business. And I would say that's the overall approach and strategy that we take. Jonathan Feeney : Okay. Thank you. Steve Voskuil : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to pass the floor back over to Michele Buck for any closing comments. Michele Buck : Thank you very much for your time today. We appreciate all the questions, and I know that many of you will have follow-ups with Melissa throughout the day. So thanks. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn this call over to your host, Ms. Melissa A. Poole, Vice President, Investor Relations for The Hershey Company. Thank you. You may begin. Melissa A. Poole: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for the Hershey Company's third quarter 2022 earnings Q&A Session. I hope everyone has had the chance to read our press release and listen to our pre-recorded management remarks, both of which are available on our website. In addition, we have posted a transcript of the prerecorded remarks. At the conclusion of today's live Q&A Session, we will also post the transcript and audio replay of this call. Please note that during today's Q&A Session, we may make forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. These statements include expectations and assumptions regarding the company's future operations and financial performance. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based on subsequent events. A detailed listing of such risks and uncertainties can be found in today's press release and the company's SEC filings. Finally, please note that we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe will provide useful information for investors. The presentation of this information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning's press release. Joining me today are Hershey's Chairman and CEO, Michele Buck; and Hershey's Senior Vice President and CFO, Steve Voskuil. With that I will turn it over to the operator for the first question. Operator : Thank you. Our first question is coming from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions. Andrew Lazar : Great. Thanks so much. Good morning everybody. Michele Buck : Good morning, Andrew. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. Andrew Lazar : Good morning. Maybe first off you discussed in the prepared marks, say you expect a strong top and bottom line performance in 2023. I guess given where the markets are it seems like items like pension and interest expense will be sort of incremental headwinds obviously for the group as a whole next year. I was wondering if you would be able to help level set us a little bit on sort of where some of these items, at least that you do have visibility to might sit for next year. And I guess if they are material enough to kind of derail the earnings performance in the year. Michele Buck : Sure. Andrew, let me start with a little bit of an overview and then I will let Steve dive into a few more of the specifics. So, overall, we believe we can deliver an on algorithm year next year. We believe our sales will be slightly ahead of algorithm. Pricing will be about comparable to 2021. We anticipate that our gross margins will be stable. We will have a step up in investment as we reinvest, reinstate some of the DME spend. Now that we have more capacity available to really be able to be able to take advantage of that and also to invest in capabilities to secure profitable, sustainable future. And we think all of that will net down to strong earnings performance that will likely be at the high end of our algorithm. So that's a little bit of an overview, but Steve, I'll let you kind of go a little bit deeper. Steve Voskuil : Yes. Just on the discrete items, kind of to answer your question at a summary first, we don't see any derailers in terms of those discrete areas, we will have more pension expense. Our estimate today would probably be $5 million more year-over-year for next year. On the pension side this year we've picked up about $10 million of incremental pension expense. Next year I would, again, markets can change, but today I would probably estimate that is probably twice that number for next year. But neither of those are material enough to shift the needle. Michele Buck : Yes. Sorry, just to clarify that first $5 million moves to interest for the year. Steve Voskuil : Yes, sorry. Michele Buck : And then the pension probably about a $20 million. Steve Voskuil : Yes. Andrew Lazar : That's really helpful. Steve Voskuil : Yes. Andrew Lazar : Very helpful. And then just lastly, I mean, as you mentioned, you've got incremental pricing on top for 2023. And I appreciate you're planning for greater elasticity than you've seen thus far, which is prudent, but obviously you delivered strong volume this year in the face of high single digit pricing. You've got more capacity coming online. I think ANC is expected to grow faster than sales next year. Dot's entering, I think, the organic calculation to start the year and obviously strong underlying momentum. So I guess at a minimum, shouldn't these help at least mitigate the potential for building elasticities in 2023? I'm just trying to make sure I'm not missing anything else on either side of the ledger. Thanks so much. Steve Voskuil : Yes, I mean, I think, that's the right way to think about it. As Michele said at the top, I think, we've got a lot of positives in the story for next year as some of the things you mentioned rolled through. And I'm sure we'll have challenges, but we don't see anything yet that is a derailing sort of a factor. Andrew Lazar : Thank you very much. Michele Buck : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions. Bryan Spillane : Hey, thanks operator. Good morning everyone. Hey Michele, in the prepared remarks you referenced consumer behavior and maybe seeing some changes in where people shop, I guess, channels and pack types. Could you just elaborate a little bit more on that and maybe how Hershey is adjusting to that? Michele Buck : Yes, absolutely. So we are seeing some of those changes in how they are spending. Fortunately, we are seeing them continue to spend, but there is some reprioritization. So specifically value channels and value packs are selling well. We are also seeing some improvements in private label performance and really we're seeing this across the board slightly more noticeable with lower income consumers, but really across all different income levels. Within our categories the trends have really remained very strong as the consumer continues to prioritize snacking and particularly sweet treats. And obviously we have minimal private label presence. So we continue to see that our products remain an affordable treat for families and for consumers. And we know that part of that is they want to reward themselves when times are tough. They also use these products to relieve stress. And we think that those trends will continue. I think on a class to trade basis just to augment relative to the channel piece we have seen particular strength in mass, in club, and in dollar. So certainly in channels that represent strong value. Bryan Spillane : Okay, thank you. Michele Buck : Sure. Steve Voskuil : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is in the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Michael Lavery : Thank you. Good morning. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. Michele Buck : Good morning. Michael Lavery : You've got strong momentum on Reese\u2019s obviously up, I think, it was 16% in the quarter and certainly adding capacity is paying off even Payday which we don't hear too much about typically, is up very strongly behind some new capacity. Can you just maybe give us a little bit more specifics looking ahead in terms of how some of the capacity unfolds? I think you've given maybe like a five-year outlook, but in terms of say next year, would it be \u2013 is it about a fifth comes over the next five years? Do we have to wait longer? Is there a bigger bump near term? Just help us maybe think about some of the pacing because the capacity certainly is working when you can add it. Michele Buck : So, we certainly have, I would say, a continuous effort against broadening our capacity, certainly focused only on where we see those really strong returns. Next year, for example, we are planning for five new manufacturing lines to start up throughout the year and that includes three new Reese\u2019s lines. So we do expect a pretty nice increase in capacity. However, some of the investment that we have in 2023 will also be for production that doesn't come online until 2024. So, not all of the incremental spend directly relates to 2023, but we do have continuous capacity coming online into the future years with a big focus on 2023 and 2024. Is that helpful? Michael Lavery : That's helpful, yes. It's a little bit more near term skewed it sounds like. And just on Dot's, if I could follow up there, very strong momentum, it looks like it came in about 40% ahead of what we had thought the run rate was when you bought that business. Can you just point to what some of the drivers are and how to think about the sustainability of that kind of momentum? Michele Buck : Yes, absolutely. So on Dot's, a big piece of our gains has been continuing to grow distribution. As we purchased the business, there was significant opportunity, particularly on the east coast and with certain customers we were somewhat underdeveloped with Walmart. So Walmart was a big gainer on distribution. Obviously that's a huge customer. At the same time, we're also focused on optimizing the consumer model and all of the spend to maximize impact and starting to drive incremental investment and brand building which is our model across our entire portfolio, which we think will give us further upside beyond the distribution going forward. The other thing I want to just clarify on the capacity piece is while we have significant effort in 2023 and 2024, there will be continued \u2013 if you look across our entire portfolio, continued capacity coming online into the future years beyond that as well. If you look at confections, snacks, et cetera, across the board. Michael Lavery : Really helpful color. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is in the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed you with your questions. Robert Moskow : Hi, thanks. Two very different questions. Are there any initial efforts being made to try to consolidate your snack brands together in either route to market or any other operating functions? My understanding is that they get to market in very different ways. And then also for Steve, just wanted to know if you can help us with seasonality in 2023. First half looks like a tough comparison but maybe that's just OpEx [ph]. Michele Buck : Yes. So relative to our snack brands, to date we have been running those businesses separately as we have had a dedicated focus on continuing to drive ahead the amplified business and also to really integrate the Dot's business as we just took it over in December. Going forward, we are now starting to take a much more holistic look across all of salty with the focus as we go into 2023 on really how we integrate those businesses together across the board to really capture and leverage scale and synergy across everything. Supply chain, marketing, go-to-market, et cetera. So that's really the phase that we are entering now, and I think we believe that's how we will also begin to unlock some of the gross margin expansion that we need to go after on that business. Steve? Steve Voskuil : Yes, very good. Nothing to add there. On the seasonality, I don't think there is a big story. We've got a big year to laugh, full stop first and second half, and so I don't think \u2013 we're not thinking about a big nuance right now, first half versus second half. I don\u2019t know if that's helpful. Robert Moskow : It's simple. Thank you. I'll take it. Steve Voskuil : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your questions. Ken Goldman : Hi, just a very quick clarification. First Michele, I think, in response to Andrew's question, if I heard correctly, you said that pricing in 2023 will be similar to 2021. I assume you meant similar to 2022. Unless I heard you wrong. Michele Buck : Yes. Sorry about that. Ken Goldman : That's okay. I've lost time has lost all meeting to me post-COVID. Steve Voskuil : I understand. Ken Goldman : And then really just a quick summary of next year to make sure I heard you correctly there. So you're talking about sales growth being very strong. You don't have an EBIT algorithm, I think. But is it fair to assume, just to summarize that you're expecting very strong sales growth, maybe a little bit higher than EBIT growth, which in turn is a little bit higher than EPS growth, but EPS growth still closer to maybe that 8% organic range with, I guess a small haircut from FX? Am I kind of summarizing that correctly? Steve Voskuil : Yes, I think you're in the right zip code. Yes. Ken Goldman : Perfect. That's all I have. Thank you. Steve Voskuil : All right. Michele Buck : Thanks. Operator : The next question is from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please just proceed with your question. Alexia Howard : Good morning everyone. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. Michele Buck : Good morning. Alexia Howard : Can I ask about the high-single digit increase in cost in 2023? I think generally we've been expecting that things might get a little bit easier. Obviously that is easier than what we've seen in 2022, but it's still a pretty big hurdle to get over. Specifically, where are the pain points? What's continuing to go up? How much of it is locked in? Do you have good visibility into that? And is it likely to moderate through the course of the year? So maybe hiring the first half versus the second half. Thank you. And I'll pass it on. Steve Voskuil : Sure. Yes, as you said, it's high. It's not as high as this year. And to that extent I like to be in a position when we give more guidance for next year to say we're sort of stabilizing gross margins overall. But nonetheless, still expecting high-single-digit inflation. And where is it coming from? On the commodity side, we still have some commodity pressure in some commodities where we don't have complete hedging coverage, packaging costs, logistics, still seeing inflation in people costs, some energy costs. I would also say technology is probably another one that's starting to be a bigger component. And so across that basket, we're still seeing high-single-digit inflation. I would hope by the time we get to the back half of next year, you're again, starting to see more moderation as we start to lap more of those inflationary costs, but still expecting a pretty significant list next year. Our visibility is pretty good. With our hedging and longer term contracts, I think, we do have pretty good perspective on that number today. Alexia Howard : Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions. Pamela Kaufman : Good morning. Michele Buck : Good morning. Melissa A. Poole: Good morning. Pamela Kaufman : Can you discuss the shipment timing dynamics that impacted Q3 results? You pointed to earlier seasonal shipments and inventory replenishment benefiting top line in the quarter. So where are retailer inventory levels now and are there any additional timing shifts that we should be aware of over the coming quarters? And then just on the Q4 implied guidance, which points to deceleration to low-single digit growth, is that largely reflection of the inventory dynamics or are there other factors contributing to the outlook? Steve Voskuil : Sure. On the inventory timing for Q3 the two big factors that we talked about were one, some inventory build as we mentioned, we didn't expect as much inventory build as we saw in Q3. Again, what we did see wasn't as big as we saw earlier in the year but it was a factor of bottom point. And then we also saw some seasonal pull forward, and this continues a little bit of a trend of retailers pulling seasons in earlier and earlier and saw \u2013 we saw about a two-point benefit in the third quarter from that. As we look to the fourth quarter we also expect we'll see some seasonal pull forward with Valentine's and Easter, so that will have some impact potentially on Q4. But the \u2013 probably the biggest factor in the Q4 guided really just the assumptions around elasticity and again, being a little bit prudent as we think about what's happening with the consumer and not being quite as aggressive as maybe more recent elasticity we've seen. Pamela Kaufman : Great. And can you comment on current promotional levels? You indicated that they're back to more normalized levels. Can you address what types of promotions you're implementing and how you're balancing higher promotions with the capacity constraints? And then do you expect promotions to continue to step up next year? Michele Buck : Yes. So our promotions are pretty much in line with historical. When we do promotion in this category, it's always our first objective to get display because these can drive \u2013 this category can drive a lot of impulse. So a focus on feature and display, display where possible and as usual we always put a big focus on our core brands. So we may use news to create some excitement on a display, but we know that our core brands are the strongest mover and that's really where the bulk of the focus will be. So it's a bit where we are on promotion. If we think about next year we think we'll be at about the same level as we've been. There might be some shifts across the quarters, but pretty much in line. Pamela Kaufman : Great, thanks. I'll pass it on. Operator : The next question is from the line of Nick Modi with RBC. Please proceed with your questions. Nick Modi : Yes. Thank you. Good morning everyone. Michele Buck : Hi, Nick. Nick Modi : Hi, Michele. So I was just wondering in terms of growth drivers, we've been getting a lot of good feedback on the pantry pack especially on the online channel, so I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about that and what your insights are saying, and maybe how \u2013 where you can take that strategy going forward? And then the second thing would be just on alternate channels. I mean obviously FDM has been a very strong area for Hershey, but there seems to be a lot of pockets of opportunity and in other channels not measured. And I just wanted to get your thoughts on that strategy as you move forward? Michele Buck : Yes, absolutely. So as we approach innovation we've really evolved our strategy over time to continue to provide product news, but also really to look at packaging as a big unlock because packaging enables us to provide consumers with our core brands, which they love but in a different packaging format that tends to open up a new occasion and that can be very powerful and very sustainable and that's really what the pantry pack did. As consumers are spending more time at home it's almost the ability to have their own single-serve dispenser in their pantry or in their refrigerator if they so desire. So we're really pleased with how it's doing to date. We still have some distribution upside opportunity to further capture but it's done what we were hoping to and we'll continue to focus on packaging for new occasions. Relative to non measured and alternate channels, yes, this has always been a focus for us. I would say its capacity got tight, we pulled back a little bit, de-prioritized a little bit during COVID but we are really leaning back in now and the team is aggressively focused on really trying to get our products everywhere that they possibly can. Nick Modi : Thank you. I'll pass it on. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jason English : Hey folks, good morning. Thanks for slotting me in. Michele Buck : Good morning. Jason English : A couple of questions. And so first in prepare remarks; I think you noted that you're expecting growth trends on everyday products to moderate. Can you elaborate on what you're seeing and also comment on how this influences your view of I guess how much more capacity you have to push price on every day and whether or not you should be looking to layer on a bit more promotion to counter whatever trend you're seeing? Michele Buck : So we've been pretty happy with the strong trends that we have seen on retail takeaway. And certainly throughout the year we've been trying to balance the seasonal sell through with everyday business and really look at the two somewhat holistically. I think we've been held back a little bit as you mentioned through capacity. We're excited that next year we open up a bit more capacity, which then allows us to reinstate some of the spending that we had pulled back on, which we think will also provide some momentum for us going forward. Jason English : Okay. Switching gears; M&A, your track record of late has been pretty successful. Your balance sheet certainly suggests you have capacity for more. Do you have organizational bandwidth to do more anytime soon or is all eyes of detention focused on integrating dots and also it sounds like not just integrating dots, but addressing the whole structure of salty snacks as you look to combine those businesses and leverage those synergies you discussed? Michele Buck : I mean, certainly I would say job one for us is the integration and continued growth and acceleration of the entire salty portfolio. So we do really have scale there now and a lot of opportunity ahead of us. Great top line momentum and then opportunity to leverage that scale to improve the margin structure; so that's clearly job one. That said we are always looking and evaluating the marketplace and given the health of our balance sheet, we certainly would consider something that made sense for us that we believe we could execute well. Jason English : Understood. Michele Buck : Yes. Jason English : Understood. Thank you. I'll pass it on. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions. Chris Growe : Hi, good morning. Michele Buck : Good morning. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. Chris Growe : Hi. I just wanted to ask a little more of a near-term question around the fourth quarter. You had \u2013 it sounds like you have some further pull forward of next year's season or 2023 seasons? And then I also think you have an easy shipping comparison with the previous year we had less shipping days in the fourth quarter of 2021. I just wanted to get a sense what that means for a volume in the fourth quarter with little extra seasons and then a little extra benefit from the shipping day factor? Steve Voskuil : Yes. On the season side, it's not a net benefit because we've pulled some of the Q4 into Q3 season, so we got a little bit of a deficit that will be potentially partly made up by pull forward at 2023 seasons, that's probably the biggest piece; in terms of calendar-days it really not a big factor for shipping days. Chris Growe : You had two less shipping days on the fourth quarter of 2021. Does that not compare beneficially to this year no? Steve Voskuil : Not. Michele Buck : I think the calendar only shift by maybe one-day this year, so it shouldn't have a material impact. Chris Growe : Okay. Got it. And I did \u2013 a quick question around the gross margin as I look at the gross margin decline year-over-year and look at the margins by division, I'm just curious is there more of a gross margin kind of lag or shortfall basically a pricing versus cost inflation shortfall in salty snacks versus confectionary. I'm just trying to get a sense of the pricing coming through in confectionary, should that benefit the margin and would that therefore benefit the overall gross margin more so? Or is it salty snacks that needs more pricing here to offset the inflation? Steve Voskuil : Yes. So there's a lot in there. I think obviously pricing on confectionary is great in the plan. We'll see \u2013 we'll see the full effect of that in the fourth quarter and it'll be a big factor in the 2023 outlook. On salty we have taken price, it probably hasn't come to the market quite as fast and as Michelle said, as we look at strengthening that business and the gross margins and at the same time continuing the rapid growth on the top line pricing is a lever like it is for all our businesses that we'll continue to look at. And what I'm pleased with is we look at the progression of the salty margins even this year. We started out the first quarter order of magnitude, I think 1,200 basis points down year-over-year, that's improved sequentially and we'd expect that to approve again in the fourth quarter. So as we get to the \u2013 as we get to next year continuing to drive margin improvement in that business through all levers available is going to be a high priority. Chris Growe : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Cody Ross with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Cody Ross : Good morning. Thank you for taking our questions. Based on the prepared remarks, it sounds like your underlying volume excluding the seasonal shipments and retailer inventory replenishment was down. Is that correct? And how did that compare to your expectations? Steve Voskuil : Q3 is roughly flat overall and I would say it was in line with expectations. Like I said, we probably put a little more inventory than we expected, but where we landed on base volume was more or less in line with what we expected. Cody Ross : Thank you for that. And then I think you mentioned your chocolate market share was up versus pre pandemic. Can I assume that's dollar share? Can you just comment on how that compares from a volume share perspective? Thank you. Michele Buck : Yes. That was dollar share and it is similar from a volume share perspective. Cody Ross : Okay, great. I'll pass it on. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Feeney : Good morning. Thank you. Michele, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about a lot of food industry leaders have mentioned while reporting pretty good numbers in the past couple of weeks. A sense of, I think it was concern about or concern about the stress that inflation was bringing to consumers. And I think that's certainly true and it's certainly an impact on retailers, but if I just dived into the data you have like where are you seeing that, if anywhere? Is trade down behavior happening? And how, if you think about I don't know prior periods where there's nothing quite like this period, but say consumer distress accompanied by rising inflation. I think we had something like that dynamic in 2010. How did consumers behave and as you look forward how is this go around with the consumer reacting to a tougher environment driven by crowding out factor some other costs; how does this compare? Michele Buck : Yes. So we remain very focused on the consumer and certainly we are aware of the pressures that are on them. What I would say is overall it has not impacted our total performance and overall product performance to a large degree. Yes, there are some shifts in terms of seeing more consumers buying value packs, purchasing in value channels, and then certainly in other categories where private label has really dialed up. But I would say overall we need to continue to be always focused on the consumer and when they could hit a breaking point, but to date as we look at our elasticity we really aren't seeing signs of that impacting our business. That said, we're going to be very focused on it going forward because we don't want to \u2013 we don't want to miss a trend. I would say historically our category has tended to fare pretty well during these times because it is an affordable indulgence when consumers can't afford a lot of other things. Jonathan Feeney : Very clear. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. David Palmer : Thanks. Good morning. You mentioned in the prepared remarks that capacity was added for Reese's and Gummies in 3Q. How much of a capacity increase was that? And were you in any way constrained on these platforms before this or is this just simply anticipatory of ongoing growth? Michele Buck : Yes. We're not going to get into a lot of the specifics around specific brand capacity just for overall competitive reasons. But yes, we were constrained on both and this capacity did allow us to unlock whether it was broader distribution, reinstating of promotions, upping our marketing spend selectively et cetera. David Palmer : Yes. Understood on that. I wanted to ask on convenience channels and single-serve packaging, I've heard certain retail measures of food service like convenience store, food service have gotten stronger lately. I wonder where is your volume in convenience and single-serve packaging? If you look at checkout counters too; how does that compare versus pre-COVID? Are you all the way back is \u2013 is that ramping more quickly than some of your other packaging? Michele Buck : I would say that overall for convenience stores in total not specific to our business, some of the trends have moderated particularly with regard to unit purchase, though I'd say snacking and confection products continued outpace the overall store and they are growing double digits. So certainly we had seen a pretty significant decline when consumers were not mobile and now that consumers are much more mobile than they were previously, we've seen that business really come back. David Palmer : Is that going to be a meaningful help to profitability mix or is it not a big deal? Michele Buck : No, not really. I mean, overall we sell single-serve in other units or in other channels as well. So no. David Palmer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time I'll turn the call back to Melissa Poole for closing remarks. Melissa A. Poole: Thank you for joining us this morning. We look forward to catching up with you throughout that day to answer any other questions you may have. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

As a reminder this conference is being recorded.  I'd now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Melissa Poole, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Hershey Company. Thank you. You may begin. Melissa A. Poole : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for The Hershey Company's fourth quarter 2022 earnings Q&A session. I hope everyone has had the chance to read our press release and listen to our pre-recorded management remarks, both of which are available on our website. In addition, we have posted a transcript of the pre-recorded remarks. At the conclusion of today's live Q&A session we will also post a transcript and audio replay of this call.

These statements include expectations and assumptions regarding the company's future operations and financial performance. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based on subsequent events. A detailed listing of such risks and uncertainties can be found in today's press release and the company's SEC filings.  Finally, please note that we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe will provide useful information for investors. The presentation of this information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning's press release.  Joining me today are Hershey's Chairman and CEO, Michele Buck, and Hershey's Senior Vice President and CFO, Steve Voskuil.  With that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question. Andrew Lazar : Thanks so much. Good morning, everybody. Michele Buck : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Lazar : I guess just one from me. Trying to get a better sense of how you're thinking about elasticity for '23 versus what you saw in '22, which was very little? And what percentage increase in capacity you're expecting for this year? And I guess I asked because, if elasticity were to stay as benign as it has been, and you ramp some capacity, trying to get a sense of whether it could render your flat, just slightly down volume outlook for the year somewhat conservative, or will continued capacity constraints limit the potential for top line upside from here? Michele Buck : Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. As we look at price elasticities, we are assuming that they will be closer to last year than they were to historic, but not quite as good as last year. And as we look at our capacity, we will have low single-digit increases in capacity which do give us some ability to flex with demand as we see it. Steven, you can add. Steve Voskuil : No, that's fine. Andrew Lazar : Excellent. That's it. Thank you so much. Michele Buck : Thanks, Andrew. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Robert Moskow : Hi, thanks, and congrats, everyone, for such a great year. I wanted to know, the guidance for '23 is more aggressive than normal, like you normally start the year rather conservative. But this year, you're guiding above your normal algorithm. And I want to know if could kind of isolate what the key drivers are, and why you've raised it compared to three months ago. Maybe drilling down looks like gross margin is coming in better than you thought, maybe you could explain why. And then also on market share. Are you expecting market share gains in confectionery in '23? Thanks. Steve Voskuil : Sure. Want me to start out. Michele Buck : Yeah, go ahead, Steve. Steve Voskuil : So just on, the big movers on the top line, obviously price driven, and we have good visibility into that. We saw that effect be part of the driver for the fourth quarter performance, but we see that carrying forward, especially through the first three quarters of next year. And we do have elasticity factors, as Michelle said in the last question. Our planning isn't quite down to the levels of historic elasticity, but something looks more like last year. And if you sort of drop further through the P&L, we do see some benefit from the gross margin side, as we could see more stabilization, the pricing coming down and some cost efficiencies, and a return to more historic levels of productivity. Now we still have efforts for more productivity. But at least this year, we're starting to see something that we hadn't seen in the last two years. So those are some drivers through the P&L that far. On the market share side, yes, we do expect to have a positive market share next year. I think that's one that we're disappointed about this year and want to see turn the other direction Next Year. Michele Buck : Yeah, and some of that market share will be helped by the incremental marketing investment, as we've taken that up, as we have additional capacity online and certainly, the additional capacity as well. As we think about the pacing of the market share, you should think about it relative to the beginning part of the year will be slower, and we won't see those declines, probably till we get into the spring. But once we hit the spring that will really kick into gear. We know that we had some lost opportunity this year around seasons that we weren't able to fulfill totally all of the orders. And then also a little bit of a mix impact from refreshment, being a late rebounder given social behaviors, but we think that'll neutralize going. Robert Moskow : Okay, makes sense. Just one follow-up. On the gross margin side, are your cost, like inflation cost coming in better than you thought or is this really just productivity is accelerating more than you thought? Steve Voskuil : Yes, probably more on the productivity side. We have pretty good visibility in the cost, with the hedging program and so forth, particularly on commodities, and we're still expecting high-single-digit, year-over-year inflation through commodities, and a lot of the materials items and mid-single digits on things like labor and logistics and other supply chain costs. I don't think those assumptions have changed much from our outlook, but probably a little bit more productivity. Robert Moskow : Great. Thank you. Michele Buck : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Ken Goldman : Hi, thanks. You're guiding to a gross margin of around 44.5% next year. I'm just curious for this coming year, what do you see as a, I guess, \u201cnormal level\u201d, if there is such a thing in this kind of environment? And I guess more specifically, if you can grow your gross margin by a healthy amount in an inflationary environment, is there any reason it can't ultimately get back to 45% or above? Steve Voskuil : Sure, again, our model is growing gross margin every year. That would be the goal. That's really part of the growth algorithm. And so we've had two years where that's been a challenge. We see that now turning for 2023 and really getting back on the algorithm. And so I would like to say it's price and inflation agnostic in terms of the strategy. How we get there will change based on the external environment. But yes, we do see restoring to gross margins that we had in the past and frankly, continuing to drive that forward. Ken Goldman : And then, how do we think about the breakdown of sales growth and operating margins by segment in 2023? You gave a little bit there. But are there any unusual items we should be aware of for either of these segments, just as we consider our models, maybe drivers that aren't necessarily apparent at first glance? Steve Voskuil : Yeah, the only things that are unusual or different, I kind of go to salty, and we mentioned some of this in the remarks. Salty is going to have a strong top line. We're expecting that. We're also expecting to see gross margin improvement year-over-year. We saw some of that in the fourth quarter, finally seeing pricing catch up in that business a little bit to inflation. But still some room to grow.  But we'll see some reinvestment below that. And so we're going to activate more against the brands next year. We're going to do some capability investments between the lines to really scale up the infrastructure. And part of that infrastructure is the ERP transition that we talked about in the prepared remarks. And so that's probably the one area where I see strong sales growth, some gross margin improvement, less route through to off margin that we might see in a normal year on the back of those capability investments. Other than that, I think the other segments are probably, pretty traditional in terms of the growth characteristics. Ken Goldman : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Bryan Spillane : Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. My question is just around the advertising and consumer spend investments. And I guess I had two questions. One, in the prepared remarks, one of the things you talked about investing in is workforce. So I wanted to just understand, is that like more merchandisers and people in the field or something else? And then maybe I'll start with that, then I had one other follow up. Michele Buck : Yeah, I mean, as we look at some of the investments that we're making in our employee base, clearly, one of our key strategic goals this year is really to integrate scale our salty business. And so we are adding some increments of talent there to really make sure that we have the right skillsets, and that we have all the employee base and talent needed to do that heavy lifting and the work, some of that also around improving our planning system. Some of the things that whey we buy a smaller company, we need some more sophisticated capabilities.  Then obviously, given a lot of the work across the business on supply chain, where we are continuing to invest to build capacity and resiliency in the network, we have made investments in supply chain talent as well. Bryan Spillane : Okay, but it's not specifically adding merchandisers or like front -- more people, frontline sales people? Michele Buck : Oh, no, no. Bryan Spillane : Okay. Okay. And then the second, just was related to the kind of the thinking behind the double-digit increase in advertising and consumer spend. Is that partly a -- sort of a function of just inflation has been so persistent. Now obviously, you've got price increases on your own product lines, but consumers are just seeing -- have seen a lot of inflation across a lot of consumables. And is it -- if you're going to have that level of pricing, you really need to advertise in order to sort of make sure consumers stay engaged, because they're going have to start making some choices. Or was there something else that kind of drove the decision or the need to increase advertising at that rate? Michele Buck : Yeah, absolutely. So our long-term model, we believe in advertising. We've seen the impact and the returns that we get on advertising in terms of having very strong ROI. So we take a very databased approach to media spending, and we invest where we see that incremental profitable growth. Over time, we do know that that advertising builds consumer connectivity. And we know that, that consumer connectivity is -- what part of what helps us to have the elasticities that we do.  People are connected to our brands. And during the tough times, we know that that connectivity leads to them continuing to buy. So yes, it is important during an inflationary time, and we've done statistics over that, analysis to validate that. And then, as you know, we reduced spend last year really due to capacity constraints. And we did see an impact in demand on several of our brands. And so those are really the priorities where we are reinvesting this year. And we're also investing in some of our whitespace opportunities, like gummies and better for you to strengthen the business, as well as our salty brands, where we're really in a major growth mode, gaining household penetration, gaining market share, and we want to continue that momentum. Bryan Spillane : Right. Thanks, Michele. Michele Buck : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Michael Lavery : Thank you. Good morning. Michele Buck : Good morning. Michael Lavery : I just want to start by following up on the spending. Could you give us a sense -- I recognized last year, you adjusted spending to match your -- better aligned with the capacity limitations. But would this year be restored levels to sort of the optimal targets? Or do you still see that ramping into next year as well? We're just trying to understand a sense of, if you'll be back on your sort of steady run rate or kind of ideal level or if we're not even quite going to be there yet until maybe 2024. Michele Buck : Yeah, I mean we are always looking at the returns that we're getting on our spending, and making decisions as we go forward based on that. So we think that we're in a reasonable zip code. I think we've said before that we don't think we have to go back up to the very highest levels that we were at historically. We've done a great job over time, getting a lot of efficiency, getting very tight in our targeting, so that we're getting even greater returns. But I wouldn't also commit that this is the high mark, above which we're not going to move above. We're still probably not quite back to exactly the point we want to be. Michael Lavery : Okay, that's really helpful. And just want to unpack a little bit more if we can, a comment you made in the prepared remarks about seasons being a growth driver. You said it's off to a great start. Obviously, last year went really well as well. And so just would love to understand a little bit better how that unfolds and how to be thinking about that. Michele Buck : Yeah, we continue to anticipate very strong growth in the seasons. We've continued to see that in the category. Consumers, during the past several years, have even dialed up their interest in season. So it is a strong part of our portfolio. It's a place where we do very well. It's a place where there's a lot of emotional connectivity. There's an anchor event, people want to participate in those anchor events with the brands that they love. And so we think that there's opportunity. We had some missed demand that we weren't able to fully fulfill because of capacity. And we're going to be in a much better position this year to be able to more fully capture that opportunity.  And the first part of the year, as I mentioned earlier, from a share perspective, we won't be as strong as we anticipate that we will be for the seasons towards the back part of the year. Michael Lavery : Okay, great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Cody Ross with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Cody Ross : Good morning. Thank you for taking our questions. I just want to go back to the last question on volume and perhaps unpack cadence throughout the year. You have increased capacity for seasons coming on, but you're also lapping the over shipment in the first half this year. Can you just unpack a little bit how you expect volume to progress throughout the year, understanding that you expect for the full year to be flat to slightly down? That's my first question. Thank you. Michele Buck : Steve, can you talk that through? Steve Voskuil : Yeah, going into the first part of the year, the seasons we've got already identified the volume and shipments there. So as Michele said, we still -- we're dealing with some capacity constraints leading into the seasons in the front part of the year. When you look at the year overall, we're not expecting any big material differences by quarter for volume. Cody Ross : Okay, that's helpful. And then just one last question on capital allocation here. You're at the low end of your leverage target over the long-term. Are you beginning to look at making additional acquisitions or perhaps return more cash to shareholders in the upcoming years? Thank you. Michele Buck : I just say job one right now for us is integrating the amazing acquisitions that we bought SkinnyPop, Pirates and Dot's, and we're investing to leverage their full potential. However, we do always continue to be in the market, looking at assets that can continue to advance our strategies, expand our portfolio appropriately into high growth, consumer demand segments. And we certainly do have a lot of balance sheet flexibility to be able to do the right M&A, if it becomes available. Steve Voskuil : That's right. And I would say more broadly, from a capital allocation standpoint, no major changes. We definitely want to be giving back cash and repurchasing shares as part of our strategy. That puts good tension on the internal investments and M&A to make sure we're getting the best return. And so that's an area we'll continue to monitor. We've got a lot of CapEx this year. And so that's one thing that we're taking into consideration as we look at the overall balance of capital allocation. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Chris Growe : Hi, good morning. Michele Buck : Good morning. Chris Growe : Hi. I just had a question. First, if I could a bit of a follow-on to an earlier question, but in particular in the salty snacks division, with the margin being so strong, and in the fourth quarter and reaching over 20%. Was there anything unique to the quarter? And then I certainly heard about investments you want to make both internally and advertising throughout 2023. I guess I just want to understand how you expect the margin to fare throughout the year as margins expand, but just not to the level of which it did here in the fourth quarter. Steve Voskuil : Yeah, we're really pleased where the fourth quarter finished. Probably two things drove that. One we did have easier laps in the fourth quarter. And then second, you know, we said earlier, we are seeing pricing, catching up a little bit more to some of the inflation that we saw over the course of the years. We've got a little bit of a benefit of that. As we look to a margin for that business going forward and into next year, we want to again, on the gross margin line, expect to see some continued advancement. We got a lot of plans to still optimize that business. And we've talked before about streamlining the back office, streamlining the supply chain, network, better integrating all of that with our existing Hershey systems, and so forth.  And so in fact, we'll talk more about that when we get to our March Investor Conference, and spend some time on that. But have aspirations to continue to see that profile up over the course of the year. But as Michele said, we are going to reinvest some of that back between the lines to accelerate the top line to invest behind the brands. And then on the capability investments like ERP.  But I'd say the key takeaway is we have still high margin aspirations for that business as we look forward over the next couple of years. Michele Buck : And most of those will occur over the longer term. We don't expect significant margin expansion or margin expansion in '23. Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up, if I could on to understand how inventory will fare for the year. You talked about depleting some inventory late in the years. You've converted -- or moved to the new ERP system. Should inventory grow to the year and then you deplete it? Or does it hold this level? Then it goes just goes lower as you kind of move that inventory out? Have you built it already, I guess is the question, or do you expect to build more? Steve Voskuil : Yeah, we haven't built it already. I mean, there will probably be some build, not that material. I mean there's a limit to how much salty inventory we can build. But as we said, when we get to the fourth quarter, we expect a pretty significant depletion. And that's really just to allow the cutover between systems. And so on a net-net basis that will look like a negative for the year for that business. We would expect to see that come back next year, probably with a strong start to the year. Chris Growe : Okay. Thanks so much for your time. Steve Voskuil : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Nick Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Nick Modi : Yeah, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hi, Michele, hi, I was hoping you could just comment on fill rates, kind of where you guys are now versus kind of where you'd like to be. And I know things are below where they have been historically. Just curious, is that just a function of capacity? There's also a labor component to that. And then I had a bigger picture question. Michele Buck : Yeah, so I would say our fill rates are much better than where they were. There's been some significant improvement versus last year, as we've been able to invest in capital and get additional capacity on the ground. So and really, there's minimal impact from labor. It was really, largely very much tied to capacity. Now we did step up in labor to enable us to be able to obviously execute against the capacity, and the incremental lines. But we're seeing less network disruption than we've seen in the past, not all the way back to the perfect situation it was before the pandemic, but it certainly improved. Nick Modi : Right, thanks for that color. And then just the bigger picture question is, look these categories, especially on the chocolate and confectionery side, I think, clearly, we can see a renaissance. And maybe we can attribute some of that to COVID. But I'm just curious like, what does your research, internal research say about what's actually going on with the consumer and these categories? Because I think we can all agree the underlying trend rate has been much better than I think anyone would have expected a couple of years ago. Michele Buck : Well, certainly we know that snacking has been on the rise, has continued to be on the rise as a consumer behavior, pre-pandemic, and also post-pandemic. We know that there still is a bit more at home behavior versus folks cutting back on going to restaurants. And certainly that's a benefit across packaged goods snacking. We also know based on our insight that consumers are interested in snacking and particularly in confection and chocolate on two diametrically kind of opposed parts of their emotional state.  One is when they are incredibly happy and it's a treat time, and they want to treat themselves and the other is when there are downtimes, and they want a bright spot. But they do view these categories and especially chocolate as a part of kind of emotional wellness, what it does and how it makes them feel. And then of course I think that the more that we interact with consumers and this really hasn't changed over time, consumers have emotional connectivity to our brands. Our brands are more about the products -- more than just about the products. They are about the moments of connection. Many of them are used in special times. And we get letters all the time with people talking about the special role that some products played in their life. They remember when they were with a friend, experiencing it or with their kids at a season. And I think that continues to be timeless, and perhaps has even dialed up a bit since the pandemic. Nick Modi : Great. Thanks for that caller. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jason English : Hey, good morning, folks. Thanks for fitting me in. My apologies I didn't get a chance to go through all the prepared remarks. We have a lot going on this morning. Apologies if you have answered the question. I have two quick things. First, the capacity expansion. You give some quantification for the year? What's the cadence? When should we expect to see that capacity coming along? Michele Buck : Yeah, it's going to be coming online throughout the year. And again, this sort of fits into a broader discussion we've had on capacity expansion. I think we've talked in the past, if you look at the 2020 to 2024, period, we were looking for a 15% ish increase in capacity across the network. And so what we're going to see in 2023 is going to be a low single digit contribution towards that goal. And I would kind of think about it coming in ratably over the course of the year. Jason English : Okay, and the elevated CapEx, it sounds like it's a long slog. Should we expect this elevated level to continue into next year, for the year beyond as well? Michele Buck : Yeah, not at this level. But I would say at least for the next -- for 2024, we will have some amount of elevated capital. We will still be finishing off the ERP program, and still probably having some tail investments from a capacity standpoint. So those are the two things I would point to and, on the CapEx, as we talked about all the time, the majority of that CapEx is targeted on capacity expansion. If you click into that a large portion is driven by recent fantastic growth we've had there and recent capacity and network capacity has improved significantly. But we still have opportunities, some are recent, some in other brands to unlock more efficiency and capacity. And so that capacity expansion plus the ERP investments that will eventually drop out are the two kind of biggest components of the CapEx right now. Jason English : Understood. The last question for me. I've always considered your European venture to be a bit opportunistic. It's a small tactical export business. Yet, recently, you've kind of carved it out as a standalone business. Does this signal anything in terms of your strategic intent on expansion in Europe? Michele Buck : No, not at all. If that's in reference to any of the talent changes that we made, they were really in the course of just normal development and expansion for people to get new opportunities. Europe continues to be small. We continue to feel that we are making great strides and seeing a lot of growth there. But there is no strategic change in our approach to that market at all. Jason English : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Pamela Kaufman : Hi, good morning. Michele Buck : Good morning. Pamela Kaufman : Can you talk about your key innovations planned for '23? And how are you thinking about the drivers of top line growth between innovation versus existing brands, where you've been capacity constrained? Michele Buck : Sure. So innovation continues to be an important part across our portfolio. And we have several items that are launching this year that we think will generate a lot of consumer excitement and merchandising. And if we look at our core confection business, the highlights there would be Reese's Stuffed with Reese's Puffs. We have a limited edition, which is a Reese's Creamy, and then a Reese's crunchy product. So a line of limited editions that let consumers pick their favorite, which texture they like. And then we have an exciting new kisses flavor that is called Milkilicious [ph], which is a kiss filled with a milk chocolate filling.  On our salty business, we launched as a limited time edition this year, a dot cinnamon sugar flavor. And so folks will see that in the market as it's been very successful. So those are probably the highlights of some of the biggest innovation. We continue with our strategy that we employed several years ago, that's really helped to accelerate our top line growth, which is while innovation is important and we will support innovation across the board, for news and excitement. We really don't want to stray away from a primary focus on our core. Our core are brands that are sustainable. They have been out there for a long time. Consumers love them. The velocities on them will always be stronger than innovation. So across our entire portfolio, driving our core is job one. And then using new innovation for news and excitement. Pamela Kaufman : Great, thank you. And just in terms of your organic growth outlook for '23, how are you thinking about the growth between North America confectionery and salty snacks? And maybe if you could just touch on some of the key growth drivers behind the salty snacks business for '23? Michele Buck : So I can talk about some of the growth drivers and then let me have Steve talk a little bit about the part of your question. So as we look at salty snacks, we will be, as Steve mentioned investing in marketing, so that we can continue to expand those brands and business and continue our growth in household penetration. So that is clearly an investment that will drive growth. We continue to have some level of distribution upside, especially on Dot's. We saw distribution upside as well as increased item counts in 2022. And we'll see some of that growth continue as we go through '23.  Once we get beyond that, we think will then start to be going more to velocity increases and price pack architecture opportunities. So those are some of the biggest ones. Investments in SkinnyPop, in advertising as well will continue to unlock growth potential. So I think those are some of the biggest growth drivers across the salty business. Steve Voskuil : Yeah, just at a very high level, from a projection standpoint, we're expecting high single digits, top line price being the primary driver there. And as we talked about earlier seasons, underneath best seasons, and then media investment behind the brands are going to be big components of that. On the salty side, double digit growth, which is, what we should expect from that business, and more is price there as well, but also volume. And again, as we said, there are two we're investing behind the brand. We have some distribution opportunities, as Michele mentioned.  On the international side, solid mid-single digit performance on the back of distribution, volume, some pricing as well, and some innovation. So at a high level, those are sort of the big targets. Pamela Kaufman : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question. Christopher Carey : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. Michele Buck : Good morning. Christopher Carey : Steve, you gave good information on gross margin ranges for the year, a little bit on cadence with the Q1 and the impact of inflation. It's just striking to see high single digit commodities with labor, which is this dynamic of sticky inflation that we're seeing, across the staples landscape. But clearly you have good visibility into that outlook. I guess what I'm wondering is, this is going to be a probably a volatile environment for inflationary drivers, namely commodities over the next year.  And I'm just trying to frame if there is a change in the commodity outlook. Is that something that changes your own outlook? Or are you so locked in on costs at this point, that it's we have good visibility on the year and we're fairly locked in. And that's really more of a consideration, from a year from now, something like that. I have a quick follow-up. Steve Voskuil : Sure. On the -- in general, we have pretty good visibility, I would say across cost and commodities. I'd say the hedging program gives us some of that visibility. The caveat is that if you look at the last two years, where we've been bitten, in some cases, those are the things that we don't hedge and have been volatile, things like packaging, and resins and specialty ingredients and so dairy. So those are ones that I think we keep an eye on and movements at some of those, material movements can move the needle on. We saw some of those material movements in the last few years.  I think our expectation is some of that will settle down and with that settling down in our visibility into the rest of the talks. I agree with you it's still potential for volatility, but we feel we've sort of picked the guidance range to try to accommodate most of that volatility. Christopher Carey : Okay, that makes sense. One quick follow-up and perhaps something that's even better suited to, the Investor Day coming up. But this sounds confidence on long term margin improvement. And clearly we saw an inflection in the snacks business today with positive commentary on the medium term in that business. So when you think about that long term margin between the confection the sack size do you have any sense of what would be driving that between those segments? Or is it more of a holistic target for the organization over time? Thanks so much. Steve Voskuil : Yeah, that is a great one for the investor conference. And -- but I will say, our expectation is we want to see margin improvement across all parts of the business, all segments. And so we've seen a lot of improvement in international in recent years. But we have the same expectation that that's going to continue also. And that we're going to optimize and grow but grow in a sustainably profitable way there.  Salty, probably expectations, given the capital that we've deployed in those acquisitions and the opportunity, we touched on things like private label and the impact that still has on the business as we look to the future. Opportunities to extract more margin out of that business. And in always on the confection side, we want to have a model that drives margin accretion. Christopher Carey : Okay, thanks for the answers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. David Palmer : Thanks. A question on gross margin in this latest quarter, especially versus the third quarter. The reason I'm asking for color about what might have been your biggest unlocks that fourth quarter is because on a one and multi-year basis, it looks like pricing was rather similar to the third quarter. Yet your margin trend improved. And that fourth quarter was actually higher than it was in the in the fourth quarter of 2019. So any color about unlocks and gross margin would be helpful? Steve Voskuil : Yeah, I think the biggest drivers that we touched on, we did have some better productivity dropping through supply chain efficiencies that had ramped up and essentially, Michele said we're not all the way back in terms of that supply chain efficiency. But we'll get to see an uptick in the fourth quarter. And then the -- I'll say the volume growth on the elasticity side, helping dropping some fixed costs absorption through the P&L as well. Those are probably at the point, just a couple of things, those are the ones I point to. David Palmer : And just a big picture question, one I've been thinking about is in a during this COVID era, clearly, at home snacking did well. You guys have made your own thunder with s'mores and your Seasons. And you've seemed to have a pretty good visibility into what you're doing each year in seasons. And so it looks like you're going to -- you're poised to have a pretty good 2023. But I'm wondering just as you just think about the overall energy for at home snacking as an occasion, do you have a view about whether that can sustain in terms of its growth rate?  I wonder about this not just for Hershey, but for other companies as well. Any comments there would be helpful? Thanks. Michele Buck : Sure. So let me start by saying as much as we have benefited on our take home business, with at home snacking, our instant consumable business has also been quite strong. So we've really seen growth across all what we say, all three segments of our business seasons, take home and instant consumable. We don't expect that we're going to lose volume on those segments going forward. So we don't see a reversal in the trend. But we would say that growth may moderate. We would expect it to moderate a little bit versus where it's been as consumers just shake out into their normal ongoing behavior. David Palmer : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Steve Powers : Yes. Hi. Good morning. I wanted to go back to the two topics you talked about already. The A&P investments and the workforce investments just a little bit, drilling down into those. Just any -- on the A&P side any notable phasing of the incremental spending that you're planning and if so just the drivers, of that phasing, if you could. And then on the workforce side, Michele, you walk through a number of priorities, especially on the salty side, and I think there makes sense and they are frankly, intriguing. I guess, question is, where are you with those hires? Is that something that we should anticipate?  You kind of have in the near term pipeline and in the investment show up early in the year and carry forward? Or is it something that builds and is more the spending progressively layers out as the year goes on? Just where you are in in making those hires that you talked about earlier? Thank you. Michele Buck : Yeah, so as we looked at the investments in marketing spending, you should think about the confection investments being fairly stable throughout the year. On salty, our investments will be more front loaded during the year because of the -- towards the end of the year is when we're doing the S'more conversion. So we're really going to you know drive the volume harder at the beginning and those investments harder at the beginning of the year.  On SG&A spend, we will see that across the quarters, and especially beginning in Q1. Steve Powers : Okay. Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Max Gumport with BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your question. Max Gumport : Hey, thanks for the question. Just one for me, and it's on gross margin. So you expect gross margins to be up 40 to 50 basis points year-over-year in 2023, given net price realization and higher levels of productivity, which are expected to offset inflation. But it sounds like 1Q '23 gross margins will be pressured due to lack of a timing benefit related to inventory valuation last year. I'm trying to get a sense if you could close frame the magnitude of that 1Q, '23 impact. Thanks. Steve Voskuil : Yeah, so you're exactly right. For quarter one that will be our most pressured gross margin quarter. In fact, I expect we will be still down year-over-year for the first quarter because of those laps. And I don't know if that I'll dimension -- get specific as the guidance for that. But you're exactly right. That'll be our most pressured gross margin quarter. Max Gumport : Right, I'll leave it there. Thanks very much. Steve Voskuil : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line John Baumgartner with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question. John Baumgartner : Good morning. Thanks for the question. First off, Michele, in confection, you're bringing more capacity online, increasing brand spending as well. But how are you thinking about in store activation at this point? I think going back pre-COVID, there was an increased focus in the aisle with the king size and some different shelf sets. Then you move to the checkout lines, and then you would take in some shelf space for magazine [ph] and non-consumable. So as we think about 2023, and I guess even beyond at this point, where the levers you see as most impactful from here? Where do you can you still benefit from activation going forward? Michele Buck : So we are always looking to optimize across the entire mix of levers that we have to drive activation. Managing the shelf distribution, shelf space is always a priority. There were some areas as we were lighter on capacity, where we were unable to fill some of those distribution needs. So we see some of that ahead of us as an opportunity as we have improved service. We talked a little bit earlier about the marketing spending where we had pulled back again, because we were lighter on capacity, so reinstating, that.  We know that there's a very strong return on that, reinvesting the front end. Retailers are always looking at how they optimize front end space. And so we partner with them. And we continue to see opportunity there. And as we look at our in store promotional spending, we do believe that getting visibility and display in store is important to our business. That said, our promotional spending is below COVID levels. And we've seen that we've continued to be able to drive the business, where those promotion levels are today.  So that's not a key priority to reinstate back to the past. John Baumgartner : Okay, thanks for that. And then Steve, on the salty snacks margin. There was a lot of noise this year, you mentioned the catch up on pricing. You had the warehousing in Q4. You had some reduced promo and advertising spending. As we think about the sequential increase in margin from Q3 to Q4, is it possible to bucket those tailwinds across the different elements? Or maybe what do you think the underlying run rate is for segment margin exiting '22? Is mid-teens, high teens, just trying to think about the moving pieces versus the structural improvements there, just far. Thank you. Steve Voskuil : Yeah, it's a fair question. There have been a lot of movements across the quarters. I think, think about run rate in the mid teens. That's probably a good baseline to operate from let's say. There will still be movement across the quarters, probably, especially as we look to the back half of this year with that ERP transition that we talked about. As we get further into the year we will give more color to some of that variability. But if you think about mid-teens, that's probably a good starting spot. John Baumgartner : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Feeney : Good morning. Thanks very much. So it's been about 15 points or so over the past two years of pricing. And I was wondering if you could characterize -- I know that's data driven. But I wonder if you characterize how much of that was driven by this narrative about rising costs and if costs continue to moderate or even decline, should we expect some -- is the expectation from the retailer that some of that pricing goes away if costs go down, or has this just all been a change in the conversation to let's work together to grow the category? Just curious about how much risk do you have, if cost in fact start to moderate or decline? Thank you. Steve Voskuil : Sure. Michele Buck : No, we always work together with retailers to try and maximize category growth. That is our fundamental premise, especially being leaders in all of the categories that we are in. If the category is growing, we feel really good that we will benefit from that growth. Historically, there hasn't really been a move in the category to execute price declines or price rollbacks. As prices kind of have gone up, they have tended to stick in the marketplace, as a matter of principle of how that category dynamics have worked.  And what we really try and do is to leverage some of that favorability in price in our holistic model, to reinvest for growth, whether that's reinvesting in capabilities to get smarter about managing the shelf with the retailer, helping them to find new points of interruption, or whether that is incremental consumer investment. Jonathan Feeney : Makes sense? Thank you. Steve Voskuil : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question and answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Ms. Poole for any final comments. Melissa A. Poole : Thank you so much for joining us this morning. We will be available for any follow-up questions you have. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

As a reminder this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Melissa Poole, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Hershey Company. Thank you. You may begin. Melissa Poole : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for The Hershey Company's first quarter 2023 earnings Q&A session. I hope everyone has had the chance to read our press release and listen to our pre-recorded management remarks, both of which are available on our website. In addition, we have posted a transcript of the pre-recorded remarks. At the conclusion of today's live Q&A session we will also post a transcript and audio replay of this call. Please note that during today's Q&A session, we may make forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. These statements include expectations and assumptions regarding the company's future operations and financial performance. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based on subsequent events. A detailed listing of such risks and uncertainties can be found in today's press release and the company's SEC filings. Finally, please note that we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe will provide useful information for investors. The presentation of this information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning's press release. Joining me today are Hershey's Chairman and CEO, Michele Buck, and Hershey's Senior Vice President and CFO, Steve Voskuil. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Lazar : Great. Thanks so much. Good morning, everybody. Melissa Poole : Good morning. Michele Buck : Good morning. Andrew Lazar : Yes. First off, I wanted to ask a little bit about the guidance update on the top-line. The company beat by a few points on the top-line in the quarter. But when we take out the earlier summer shipments, which is really just timing, I guess, results on organic were only slightly ahead of the street view. But Hershey raised its sales growth guidance to the high end of the previous range for the full year. So I guess my question is, what are you seeing at this stage that that gave you the confidence to shift the top-line guidance the way you did? Michele Buck : Yeah, thank you, Andrew. Yeah, you're exactly right. For the first quarter, the timing impact was about half of the - half the beat on the sales line and also strong performance in international. So those were the two big drivers and we look to the balance of year. Obviously, the timing is going to wash out in the second quarter, but we do expect to see a little bit better elasticities in the year to go period. We still see a moderating versus some of the strong performance we've seen the last six to nine months. But a little bit more improvement and we're spaced that a little bit more on media investment that we also have incrementally in the year to go plan. So between, I would say, with the strength we saw in the international business, what we're seeing on the back of improved elasticities a little bit in the year to go period, that's what gives us the confidence in the race, right? Andrew Lazar : Great. Thanks for that. And then, with the pull-forward of some shipments from to Q2 into 1Q, along with the tougher, I guess, year ago organic sales and EPS growth comparisons in 2Q, I guess what are some of the key puts and takes to keep in mind when we're modeling for 2Q? Thanks so much. Michele Buck : Yeah, 2Q will be probably our most challenging quarter. I look to the balance of the year. We're going to have the timing piece shift back out, but then also recall last year it was a big inventory till quarter as well. And so, when you look at the laps, it's pretty tough lap. That combined with that point and a half coming out, we'll put, more to the mid-single digit range, probably from a sales standpoint. And that will put more pressure on the EPS side than the rest of the quarters. Andrew Lazar : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Ken Goldman : Hi, good morning. Two questions on capacity, if I could? First, I think your prior guidance, if I had it down right, was for five new lines to come on this year. I think you're calling for some more now. So am I reading that wrong or was one delayed? And then, I'm also curious to learn a little bit more about the Weaver acquisitions just in terms of how they may help you down the road in terms of added capacity or efficiency, obviously, bringing plants in houses is generally a good thing for efficiency. But just in light of the fact that they already did make products for you. Just trying to get a little bit of a better sense of some of the benefits down the road for you. Thank you. Melissa Poole : Sure. So there is no change to the number of lines. There are five lines and I think there's one that we just didn't specifically call out in our remarks. So, so no difference there. Relative to Weaver, we feel very good about the acquisition. Weaver manufacturing is currently a come in of SkinnyPop. We acquired two plants and really what it gives us are three things that gives us sufficient capacity to be able to support growth for several years to come. And as you know, we are seeing very strong growth on SkinnyPop. It provides us with resiliency and also flexibility just so that we can continue to support the strong growth that we are seeing. As you know, as you look across our business for strategic categories and businesses that we are in, we do like to have at least some degree of own manufacturing across our network.  And we also feel pretty good about the investment return at the investments that we made. We believe, given the quality of the assets, the fact that facilities are on the newer side that it is faster and cheaper than if we needed to build this on our own. Ken Goldman : Thank you. Melissa Poole : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Cody Ross with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Cody Ross : Good morning. Thank you for taking our question. You're implementing a high-single-digit price increase on 50% of your confection portfolio effective at the end of May. I believe that's correct what you announced at the Analyst Day. How much do you believe will benefit fiscal \u201823 versus fiscal \u201824? And can you explain the mechanics of the benefit by the year? Michele Buck : Yeah, at the high level it's going to have, as we talked about in the Investor Conference more impact in \u201824 than it is in \u201923. That\u2019s based on partly the implementation date and then also the fact that we have protection in place for big promotions and programming for a good part of the year. And we're still working with retailers on the implementation.  And so, all of that will continue. I think, by the time we get to the mid-year mark, I have more visibility both on balance of \u201823 and \u201824 impacts that we\u2019ll be able to talk more about it at that time. Cody Ross : Great. Thank you. And then, just a quick question on gross margin. Your gross margin came in higher than both yours and the street\u2019s expectation this quarter. You raised your outlook to expansion of 70 to 80 basis points for the year. What gives you confidence to raise your outlook this early in the year, especially in context of your retail Partners, who are struggling to expand gross margin this year based on their guidance? Thank you. Michele Buck : Yeah thank you. Yeah, it is early in the year I think, in general, we probably wouldn\u2019t look at raising our guidance top-line or bottom-line this earlier in the year. On the gross margin side, though, a couple of things, one, it\u2019s clearly we have some commodities that are getting more expensive than some cocoa and sugar in particular, are moving in the wrong direction that we have a few smaller non-test ingredients that are a little bit more favorable right now than they were. Time will tell whether that's going to be able to stick around.  But probably the biggest pieces than just freight and logistics improvements and if you recall last year at this time, when we did the call, that was one of the big, I'll say surprises on the downside was increasing and freight and logistics costs. And for the first quarter at least, we saw some improvement in that both on our supply chain but also contracted support for getting truck show up for appointments and freight costs and so forth.  So, those are really the drivers in the first quarter that we captured in the outlook. Time will tell as the year goes on how the rest plays out. But that's what gives us the confidence is really just the first quarter performance. Cody Ross : Thank you very much. I\u2019ll pass it along. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nick Modi with RBC. Please proceed with your question. Nick Modi : Yeah, thank you. Good morning everyone. So just a quick clarification. Hey, good morning. On international, I saw the comment you put in the prepared remarks. But maybe any more context on exactly some of the specific initiatives outside of a recovery in travel. I'm just curious, on there was a very strong number relative to expectations.  And then, if you could just touch on the market share commentary you made in the U.S., kind of what's driving some of that? You talked about the mix, but I was kind of unclear exactly what that was referencing. Melissa Poole : Yeah, I mean if we look at the initiatives in international, we've seen category strength across the markets. We saw a stronger Easter season in Brazil than we had anticipated. We continue to see distribution gains in Mexico and also in India. So, across the board some strength there. We do expect some moderation, going forward because we have some pretty strong laps. But our demand has really remained pretty, pretty resilient.  And then, we're also seeing some impacts from timing as if you may recall in Q4, consumer demand outpaced our shipments and we've recovered some of that in the first quarter. And can you repeat your share question one more time? Nick Modi : Yeah, I was just, I was just hoping you could provide some context on the US share commentary you had in the prepared remarks and the press release? You had referenced I think in the prepared remarks, mix was a driver and I was just unclear. But if you could just provide any context on some of the market share trends that you are seeing? Melissa Poole : Yeah, absolutely. So, we definitely - if we look at Easter, we had some impacts from supply constraints. We anticipate by Halloween and holiday, those will be behind us. But that impact - impacted us. And then also, we've continued to see very strong growth in sweets and then also that rebound of refreshments from some of the weaker trends in that post-COVID type of the year. So really mix as an impact. Nick Modi : Great. Thank you. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Pamela Kaufman : Hi, good morning. Melissa Poole : Good morning. Michele Buck : Good morning. Pamela Kaufman : I was hoping that you could talk kind of generally about what you're seeing in the consumer demand environment? You've seen strong volumes despite strong pricing growth. So how are you thinking about the consumer and elasticities over the course of the year? Melissa Poole : So, I'll start by talking a little bit about the trends and I\u2019ll let Steve talk about elasticities. Certainly consumer behavior continues to evolve and we know that many consumers have made changes to their spending to respond to inflation in the marketplace. We certainly continue to see that food has performed well compared to other categories, specifically food at home as it's a much more affordable option for consumers versus dining out. And we also know snacks and candy continue to perform even better than broader food and elasticities in those categories have continued to remain pretty strong. And we do expect that we'll continue to see strengthen in those elasticities.  We know the consumers are being increasingly mindful about where they shop. They are looking for more affordable options. Whether it is the channels in which they are shopping, whether its private-label, whether it is deals and increased promotion. And we are constantly carefully monitoring those trends, just to make sure that our media and our in-store activations are really optimized, so that we can align to the trends that we're seeing. Steve, do you want to talk a little bit about elasticity - on the elasticity side? Steve Voskuil : We touched on this a little bit in the first question. We still expect elasticity to moderate as the year goes on, but in our outlook now a little bit less severely than we did in our original plan. And we'll see how the year plays out. But that's our current assumption. Pamela Kaufman : Okay, thank you. And my second question is just on the ERP implementation within snacks. Can you touch on what benefits you expect to realize from it? And what impact is factored into your guidance for this year from the ERP implementation? Steve Voskuil : Sure. So, we have, we have the impact of the transition on the ERP baked into the guidance. We profiled that out across the quarters including some inventory build in advance of the changeover and then the changeover itself in the back half of the year. In terms of benefits, it's a critical ingredient to driving efficient scale across that businesses. We touched on that a bit in our investor conferences. Well, one of our goal is to drive scale efficiency on all parts of that business on the front-end, the supply chain side, and so forth. And this system is important to get them on the same system. The rest of the company will operate on, so we can operate the back office efficiently. We can operate the front-end efficiently, have more inventory visibility that are planning capabilities. And so, so it is the integral. We are excited about it. Everything to-date is on track and we'll look forward to getting that behind us later this year. Melissa Poole : And Pam, I think we did on the last call. We might called out the impact. It's about a half a point headwind for us for the full year related to that transition all focused in the fourth quarter results. Pamela Kaufman : Right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. David Palmer : Thanks. Good morning. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned \u2013 good morning - you mentioned that you'll be in a strong position to fully support consumer demand for the rest of \u201823. I wonder if you could give some color about that. It's obviously ahead of some of that 5% increase in production that you're expecting to add. So, is that the COVID era issues with labor constraints in your supply chain? Is that the upstream suppliers coming through? And I have a quick follow-up. Melissa Poole : Yeah, I mean, I would say, the recovery that we anticipate is really driven by the increasing Investments that we've continued to make over the past several years in capacity. Obviously, some of them take some time to be able to get equipment, get it up and running et cetera. And so, that's the point at which we believe we start to get ahead. So, I think we've pretty consistently talked about and end of \u201823 and \u201824, that we anticipate being beyond many of these supply issues. But yes, I would It's a predominantly, they've been focused on capacity. Certainly, in the early years there were some other industry dynamics, as well. It's even - I'm not sure maybe your question, the 5%, just to clarify, that is actually that the pound number not a sales number. I mean, we were clear enough in the remark.  So that that 5% growth in production pounds will be well ahead of what the guidance calls for volume and that's kind of how we catch up. David Palmer : Got it. And in that capacity that you're ramping up with the three new Reese's plants and the one new Hershey plant, will that be more than the 5% into \u201824? Because it's ramping through the year. I am wondering what's the impact of capacity increases for 2024 do you think? Melissa Poole : There will be a carryover into \u201824 from those, as well as some additional capacity expansions that we have coming online. So there will be a low-single-digit increase in pounds production available next year as well from carryover and some new initiatives. David Palmer : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Max Gumport with BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your question. Max Gumport : Hey, thanks for the question. I was hoping you could give us an update on what you're seeing with regard to the retailer pricing environment. It feels like we're seeing more headlines in the media talking about retailers pushing back to physically again packaged food manufacturers, but we're continuing to see companies like yourself getting strong pricing through in quarterly results. So just hoping you can give us some color on this debate that seems to be emerging. Thanks. Melissa Poole : So we always partner very closely with our retail customers to try and do what we believe is best to meet consumer demand and also to drive category growth, which is good for both of us. So we continue to have very collaborative discussions with our retailers relative to our pricing implementations, which also includes a lot of discussion about with the right plans to have business reinvestment that will enable the support of very strong unit conversion. Max Gumport : Thanks and one follow-up on gross margin. I realized \u2013in the year and that taking up guidance is a bit unusual and it speaks to the confidence you have in your outlook. But one question I'm getting is that, if we look at your gross margin results in the first quarter and think about what your guidance implies for the remainder of the year, it seems like it would imply some sequential step down in the gross margins through the year even after taking into account some seasonality. And so, I'm just curious what type of factors might be going into into those assumptions there? Thanks. Steve Voskuil : Yeah, the big \u2013 I think the biggest factor is it is still early in the year. We still have a lot to play out and so we're certainly taking stock of the upsides that we saw in the first quarter. But we're still being cautious also on what is to come in or the world has changed a lot over these quarters there is still a lot of volatility potentially ahead. And so, we're factoring that. And then also, as we go forward, particularly in Q4 the laps get tougher. And so, that's the other factor weighing in the guidance. Max Gumport : Thanks very much. Steve Voskuil : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Bryan Spillane : Hey, thanks operator. Good morning, everybody. I just wanted to ask a question about seasonal, you talked about the, - what part of what impacted market share on seasonals in the first quarter was capacity constraints. And I think, right, we've talked about more capacity available for seasonals as we move through the year. So if can you just kind of talk about that and how that sets up for especially the fall or the third and fourth quarter? And whether you feel like you'll be adequately supplied with seasonal products there? Melissa Poole : Yeah, sure. So, absolutely. We believe that with the additional supply that we have ramping up as we go through the year, that we will be in good shape to have a very solid plan to meet Halloween and holiday demand. So, some of the issues that we encounter during Easter we should be passed in the back half. Bryan Spillane : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Michael Lavery : Thank you. Good morning. In the press release, you had mentioned just the ability to sustain momentum into 2024 and beyond, obviously it's early. But just kind of caught my eye that you would call that out, what are you seeing at that would you drive a reference that come up that far ahead and how much color can you give on how you're thinking about 2024 right now? Melissa Poole : I mean we're not going to give a lot of \u2013 we are not really going to talk about 2024. I mean, at the very high level I\u2019ll talk a little bit about the consumer piece and Steve can talk about the P&L component. But we feel good about the momentum that we're seeing on the business, certainly in terms of consumers\u2019 engagement with the category.  A lot of the underlying consumer behaviors that we're seeing sustain which continue to support performance. We're continuing to see good response to the investments that we\u2019re making in media behind the business across all parts, really. I mean CMG, as well as our salty brands where we're just getting started on some of the investments in salty.  And certainly, as we saw in the first quarter, strong momentum in international. So right now, we don't see any big signals that suggest to us any big hurdles on the top-line. Steve Voskuil : Yeah, I would agree. I just point to, as Michelle said, capacity \u2013 having capacity available as we exit the year to be a little bit more on the gaps from that standpoint versus some of the limits we've had in the last couple of years the salty aspirations that we have talked a lot about that at the conference coming off of the back of the ERP and rolling into next year, we're excited about that.  And then the commercial capabilities that we talked more about at the conference, as well that being able to help drive sustainable growth in the US business in particular. So, those are just some of the reasons that it we feel pretty good about the momentum. Michael Lavery : No, that's helpful color. Thank you. And just a follow-up on that, we got see the \u2013 at the Investor Day obviously and just curious, if you have a sense of how big a lift do you think that can drive and maybe specifically at least what's factored into your thinking and guidance around that. And just sort of we've already seen obviously a very strong momentum there. How much further can it go? And then what - how you think about your expectations? Melissa Poole : You know, I would say it's too early. We've just started the support on air. We feel very good about all the work that we've done in terms of understanding the dots consumer and the consumers\u2019 relationship with dots. And so we feel good about the messaging direction, the creative execution and certainly it's scored incredibly well and the responsiveness that we tend to see across our snacking categories with advertising investments.  So more to come and we'll share more as we have actual in-market results on that. But we think that will clearly only help us given that we haven't been investing in that brand in the past. Michael Lavery : Okay. Great, thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Rob Dickerson : All right, great. Thanks so much. Two kind of easy questions. The first is just in international, obviously impressive on the volume side, but really don\u2019t see any incremental pricing year-over-year. So I am just curious let me clearly it's intentional just kind of curious as to why that's intentional why we're not seeing much pricing in international that\u2019s kind of given the cost complex and kind of what you've been able to push through in the US? And then I have a quick follow-up. Steve Voskuil : Sure, we are pursuing a price strategy in international. It's just more modest of what we're seeing so far. And it\u2019s offset by some of the other laps that we had in the quarter. They are having some impact on how much of that price is coming through, but we should see more price come through in the next three quarters. Rob Dickerson : Okay, fair enough. And then, just quickly back to you Steve too, buying the incremental popcorn facilities, which I get, but clearly not that much cash out lay - cash outlay for those facilities and if we think - kind of think about where the top-line probably headed into \u201824 and CapEx gets a little bit better next year markets been decent, there should be a step up in free cash flow while the balance sheet is strong. So, and I know you kind of always reiterate kind of your standard issue capital deployment priorities.  But would you say kind of at this point given all the CapEx that's being spent on the on the new facilities or the new lines and then the recent - the acquisition of the new popcorn facilities they kind of broadly speaking you feel like you're probably in a pretty good spot in terms of kind of what you need to grow. And therefore it is there a possibility for, let's say you know other cash deployment whether being around the dividend or buyback the what have you? Thanks Steve Voskuil : Sure. Yeah, great question. So we \u2013 we do - the short answer is, yeah, we do feel good with that additional capacity in place or coming in place for the Weaver acquisition will be very helpful to support the growth of that business for a time to come. And I also like the fact that, we're buying well-maintained state-of-the-art manufacturing facility. What we're not doing that is still much more capital efficient than building from whole cloth.  And so, it is capital efficient to pick up assets this way, as well. So, as we look to the future, I feel good about the capacity that we're going to have installed on both the confection business and the salty business. And that will have an impact on free cash flow as we look to the future. Rob Dickerson : Alright. Fair enough. Thank you. Steve Voskuil : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Feeney : Thanks very much. Could you comment on the role of fate, not just recent distribution growth, but distribution growth over the last 12 to 18 months in the salty snack business driving at really outsized volume growth?  Because, I guess, I'm trying to understand how when you take these products whether it's dots most recently or others into new markets, is there a necessary to care like, you have all this great innovation into Hershey capabilities and then that kind of seasons and it slows down. What data or insight can you offer to help us understand that and may be if you think about what a sustainable organic volume growth looks like for salty snack going forward? Thanks. Melissa Poole : Yes, absolutely. So, clearly distribution is job one, when we buy a business like this. I mean, that's one of our key strengths and we want to fully utilize it. So on dots in particular, there were really opportunities to kind of fill in on distribution. Previously, they really didn't have a very large Walmart business and they were underdeveloped in the northeast.  So that's been a big area of focus and that certainly has driven - has been a key driver of the business. But we've also seen increases in velocity at the same time, given the very strong repeat potential that we see from consumers behind this product. Then as you think about the growth trajectory, over time, I would kind of describe it as it basically will evolve in terms of what the drivers are.  So as we fill out the distribution, we start to really employ our category management capability relative to optimizing the shelf. As you saw in March, we then start to apply our media capability with advertising behind the brand to really increase awareness and household penetration. And then beyond that, the other kind of key focus is relative to price pack architecture and other drivers. So, I think we will see the revenue coming from it will continue, but we will apply the other capabilities we have to really generate that. And as we mentioned at Investor Day, we do anticipate seeing growth in that 15% kind of range for the next few years. And then, but a deceleration from the twenty plus percent that we've seen more recently. Jonathan Feeney : Thank you very much. Much. Steve Voskuil : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Mizuho Securities USA. Please proceed with your question. John Baumgartner : Good morning. Thanks for the question. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. John Baumgartner : Maybe just building on John's question, Michelle sticking with the salty snacks distribution. And another focus here is building availability in mass and grocery, but the ACV opportunity seems pretty significant in C stores, as well.  Are there any considerations whether it's dislodging competitors or, the routes to market that you \u2013 in the DSD model given the velocities that didn\u2019t makes the path to building ACV in C stores a bit slower for these categories. Just you how are you thinking about closing that distribution gap in C stores over time? Thank you. Melissa Poole : Well, C store is really a core capability for the company for our base core CMG businesses. Certainly we realize its importance in reaching certain specific consumers and really certain specific occasions when consumers are out and about. So it is a priority for us. We have been focused on that. I think in SkinnyPop, we are certainly making progress. But there's more opportunity to go.  And so, it'll remain a focus for us going forward. I don't know if I'd say that there is any key barrier. Certainly, there are folks who have DSD capability more broadly. But we've done a good job with our CMG business, where we don't have it building distribution in convenience stores. So, we feel very good about that.  And then across our salty snacks network, we do have both warehouse and DSD capability. And we're really working right now to optimize how we best utilize each to maximize the potential of the business. John Baumgartner : Okay. And then in terms of the popcorn assets that you're acquiring, in addition to just the pure growth in volume capacity, is there anything augment your capabilities whether it\u2019s pack size or anything else in terms of opportunity there? Michele Buck : Yeah, and beyond just the capacity and one of the things that gives us the opportunity to optimize the supply chain network more, broadly. So if you think to the future, other assets are potentially coming in, if you think about some of the strategies we talked about around price pack architecture, and being able to make sure we have the right packs and mixes to support the business going forward. So by having all of that in our hands, in our control, just gives us more flexibility and agility to deliver that growth plan. Melissa Poole : Yeah. And as I mentioned earlier, we do have that gives capacity ahead of demand. So it gives us that trajectory for the next few years. John Baumgartner : Thanks Michelle. Thanks Steve. Michele Buck : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jason English : Hey, good morning, folks. Melissa Poole : Good morning. Jason English : A couple quick questions. So, Colgate just recently did something similar in past we would think going out and buying some capacity. When that came into the floor, there was lot of other products to do making it created some margins torsion near term. Is there anything to be aware of like a similar on that front with the Weaver acquisition? Melissa Poole : No, I mean, bulk of the capacity is ready to eat popcorn. So it didn't really come with a big negative overhang. Michele Buck : That's right. Melissa Poole : Other than that there will be excess unused capacity for a while, so that there's some fixed overhead there. Steve Voskuil : Yeah. Some fixed overhead and some transition cost that would be normal. But not a portfolio overhang like you're referencing, Jason. Jason English : Good to know. Thanks for that. And then, bigger picture question, You've got \u2013 as you mentioned elasticity has been very low. That's not a Hershey comment or even a confection comment, the industry comment because we have a lot of cross price left, if you ever moving the same direction, it sounds like in \u201824 you\u2019re kind of have to kind of break from the past and push through quite a quite a bit of pricing that it\u2019s by where, we're not expecting a lot from the industry at large.  So, how are you managing this cross price elasticities? Which category should we be watching? And where you tend to see switching between confection? And I'll leave it there. Steve Voskuil : Yeah, I would say, first of all, it's a little early yet to be starting to think about the cross elasticity for \u201924. You\u2019re right. We're trying to think ahead in terms of the pricing strategy. We're also watching the commodity space like we talked about earlier and some of the upward movements on cocoa and sugar. And so, I think that's getting us in a good starting position. But then what happens to the other categories and peers is all yet to be seen.  And we will be able to communicate more on that, obviously as you probably turn the corner and get to the back half. But Melissa do you want to add? Melissa Poole : Yeah, that's the one piece I might add is just, ours is a kind of come through a little bit slower and more elongated because of the timing it takes for us to implement particularly with seasons. So, kind of, as we think about \u201824 pricing, we won't have an outsized price gap versus kind of pre-pandemic levels versus a lot of our competition.  As you see many of them are posting high teens or 20% pricing versus up at 10%. So some of those just ours is a little bit more spread out. But we will certainly be watching it very closely and particularly within, snacking to look at where the share of stomach is going and how those cross elasticities progress. Jason English : Yeah, that's a good point. Thanks a lot. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question. Chris Carey : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. I just have a question on confection margins. Very strong in the quarter even despite a tough year ago compare, pricing is clearly building. How should we be thinking about confection margins not just this year, but certainly over time, as it seems like we're coming through very strongly with pricing and cost perhaps are easing. And so, again just your trajectory of confection margins would be helpful. And I think you had mentioned some inflation in cocoa and sugar, just remind us of your duration on those hedges and when we might be seeing that inflation coming through and just so we can kind of assess when the pricing might be needed to offset it? Thanks so much. Steve Voskuil : Sure, I'll take the last piece first. Just on cocoa and sugar we don't get specific on the duration of our hedging programs. Obviously, for those two commodities we do some hedging. But we don't share the duration. We do expect to see potentially more impact in \u201824 than \u201823. But we'll see how the markets play out.  On pricing and just more generally as we talked about the investor conference, our goal is always have a mix of volume and price. That's part of the balance in our growth formula and as part of that we also want to see margin accretion over time for both sources. And so, confection margins have been strong, but even in the future, across All levers, pricing, including price pack, architecture and mix, and other things, we want to continue to put upward pressure on our margins because that's part of our growth formulas so. Melissa Poole : And we continue to see some of our inputs rise, cocoa and sugar recently which is one of the reasons that we decided to lean into that more recent pricing action. Steve Voskuil : That\u2019s right. Chris Carey : Okay, that's it for me. Thanks so much. Steve Voskuil : Thank you. Operator : We have reached the end of the question and answer session. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Melissa Poole for closing remarks. Melissa Poole : Yes. Thanks so much for joining us this morning and all the great questions and the continued interest and investment in our company. So I'll be available today and in the coming weeks to answer any additional follow-ups you may have. Thanks so much. Have a great day. Operator : And this concludes today's conference and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Melissa Poole, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Hershey Company. Thank you. You may begin. Melissa Poole : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for The Hershey Company\u2019s second quarter 2023 earnings Q&A session. I hope everyone has had the chance to read our press release and listen to our prerecorded management remarks, both of which are available on our website.

Joining me today are Hershey\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Michele Buck; and Hershey\u2019s Senior Vice President and CFO, Steve Voskuil. With that, I will turn it over to the Operator for the first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions. Andrew Lazar : Great. Thanks so much, and good morning, everybody. Michele Buck : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Lazar : Good morning. I want to ask a bit about the pricing versus volume commentary regarding the full year sales growth outlook. And the comments sounds like you expect price to be a bit better in the second half and maybe volume is a bit worse than originally planned. So just two questions on this. First, how do we think about the balance between the two in the second half and could volume be down year-over-year in 2H? And then more specifically on volume, is the weaker than anticipated volume fully due to just the new pricing actions or are you reflecting a tougher consumer or a competitive environment in that outlook or both? Thanks so much. Steve Voskuil : Yeah. I am happy to take that one, Andrew. Your math is right. That\u2019s the way we are looking at it. And the price piece, it really is driven or the volume impact really is driven by the extra price impact as we look at the back half. And as we look at volume in the back half, yes, year-over-year, we expect it to be down. But it really is price driven. There\u2019s probably a very small portion attributable to the salty misstep in Q2, but the vast majority is just the reaction to price. Andrew Lazar : Great. Great. Thanks so much. I will pass it on. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions. Bryan, could you check if yourself muted please. Melissa Poole : All right. Let\u2019s come back to Bryan. Operator : Okay. Our next questions come from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. Ken Goldman : Hi. Thanks so much. You have done a great job obviously implementing pricing to offset inflation, but cocoa and sugar are up a lot more. I know you can\u2019t talk about pricing that hasn\u2019t been announced to the trade yet. But is it reasonable to think that you are maybe considering another list price increase and at what point do you start to ask how high is too high, how do you think about elasticity in the consumer in that environment? I just wanted to get a sense for kind of the puts and takes as you think about how to deal with and manage maybe what continues to be an inflationary environment for you? Steve Voskuil : Sure. I mean, you are right. Cocoa and sugar are historically high. I think I saw a news article this morning talking about cocoa being at a 12-year high on the New York Exchange. The good news is we have got experience managing through commodity rushes up and down. And so as we talked about in the past, as we look at dealing with that, price is a lever, but it\u2019s not the only lever. And so we look at driving more productivity, driving efficiency through other parts of the P&L, and in general, driving revenue management is part of our ongoing strategy. And so all the usual levers will be applied, and as I said, it\u2019s not the first time we have had to deal with something like this. So we are pretty good at being able to navigate, and you are right, we are not going to get more specific than that at this stage. Ken Goldman : Thank you. And then just on the comment about increased competitive, I guess, innovation in confectionery in North America. How incremental is the innovation that you are seeing, any real surprises in there versus your prior expectations? It\u2019s been such a -- I don\u2019t want to say a benign competitive environment, because, obviously, you have some tough players in the market, but is it getting more intense than what you would have expected, I guess, is what I am going for there? Michele Buck : Yeah. So I would say the innovation is up off of a relatively low base. So it\u2019s having an impact based on that. I think many folks have been focused, certainly, we have been focused a lot on execution and meeting demand for the past few years and focused on the core with innovation not playing as big of a role. And I think now we are just seeing competitors in the marketplace start to dial up the innovation more back to historic levels, and as we go forward, that\u2019s certainly an area that we are going to be focused on as we are continuing to increase capacity at the same time. Ken Goldman : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Max Gumport with BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your questions. Max Gumport : Hi. Thanks for the question. With regard to the increased chocolate capacity this year and the additional co-manufacturing capacity secured in sweets for next year? Is there any way you can help us dimensionalize how sizable those capacity increases are, just as we try to get a sense of how impactful these additions could be for volumes in the second half and also in 2024? Thank you. Steve Voskuil : Yeah. We -- I think we have said in the past that if you took a look at the capacity that we have coming online this year that\u2019s already gone into place and then what\u2019s coming in the back half, and look kind of year-over-year, you are somewhere in the 5% range of the incremental capacity across chocolate and sweets. Max Gumport : Great. Thanks very much. Steve Voskuil : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your questions. Michael Lavery : Hi. Good morning. Michele Buck : Good morning. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. Michael Lavery : You have got the integration in salty snacks and the transition to SAP that you have been talking about and those never seem to be totally smooth or easy, you mentioned there\u2019s some hiccups that you have seen. But can you just maybe give a little sense of what those look like in a little more detail, and specifically with an eye on just having a sense of what\u2019s to come, what have you learned and how confident are you that the rest of the year can avoid some of those hiccups or just be even smoother still? Michele Buck : Yeah. I mean, I would say overall, certainly, one of our key focuses as we planned for this year, was that at the enterprise level really focusing on the stellar execution. We planned the business in a way to assume that we would be trying to front-load performance knowing that there are always hiccups in the execution and so in Q4 we do expect to see volumes be down and we put that in our plans. The teams are all over it. It is a focused effort, not just within IT, but across every functional area of the salty business. And so far we have been doing pretty well on salty with household penetration growing, repeat frequency, strong sales. We did have the promotional shift into Q3. We feel good about being able to execute that. But we feel like we are well geared up to be able to execute that. That said, we certainly do believe that there will be volatility in the back half of the year with the ups and downs that\u2019s forward. Michele Buck : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And just back to pricing, you have got delays in some of the timing between the announcement and implementation, and then the seasons, of course, have a staggered effect and with just some of the maybe layers to it. Can you give a sense of just what you have announced already or put in place already has as an impact on 2024? It looks like at least the low single-digit, maybe my math, I guesses or estimates close to it, 3 points that you might already have in hand. Is that about right or what are some of the moving parts, just so we have kind of a little bit further look ahead of what\u2019s already put in place? Michele Buck : So we have high single digits in the second half of this year and as we look to 2024, low single-digit pricing. Michael Lavery : And just to clarify, that\u2019s without any other -- that would be before there\u2019s anything else that might still be to come, right? Michele Buck : That\u2019s what we have announced. Michael Lavery : Perfect. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions. Pamela Kaufman : Good morning. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. Michele Buck : Good morning. Pamela Kaufman : Your advertising spend was up 15% this quarter, which is an acceleration from Q1. Given the better-than-expected performance in gross margins for the year and what you are seeing in the competitive and demand environment, are there any changes to your plans for marketing spend for this year relative to before? Steve Voskuil : No fundamental changes. We had expected this year to be a year to invest in brands, and again, as we have capacity coming online and leaning into seasons, especially if we get to the back half, a significant increase in brand investment was planned and we are executing to that plan. Michele Buck : And also as mentioned, we were working to really front-load more of our salty planning because of S/4. So our plans accounted for that as well. Pamela Kaufman : And then just in the prepared remarks, there are comments about some private label launches in your Salty Snacks categories. You are generally in categories that face very little private label competition, but considering the launches that you alluded to. Just curious to hear how you are thinking about managing private label competition in your categories and how you are addressing it? Michele Buck : Yeah. So, certainly, there is a bit more private label in salty than in CMG. But we have considered -- we have continued to see that, while private label has ticked up a bit, our brands have continued to remain quite strong and do incredibly well. And as we look at private label, even within the confection category, while there has been increased activity there, it\u2019s remained a very small part of the category less than 3% and the entries we have seen in the marketplace this year are still relatively small. So we don\u2019t take our leadership for granted. We certainly continue to invest in our brands to make sure that our propositions are strong. But we feel very well about how we are competing right now in the marketplace on that. Pamela Kaufman : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. Nik Modi : Yeah. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I was\u2026 Michele Buck : Good morning, Nik. Nik Modi : Good morning. I was hoping you could just kind of address the Halloween season as it relates to some of your competitors still struggling with supply chain and have cut back their orders. I am just curious, do you -- how can you take advantage of this, do you have visibility at this point in terms of maybe securing some of that missed opportunity by some of your competitors? Just wanted to get some clarity on how you think about that as it relates to the third quarter? Michele Buck : Yeah. So we are expecting a very strong Halloween. We know that customers are planning big displays and we are certainly participating in that and as well have strong marketing support to consumers planned as well. So we have certainly taken an approach of leaning into Halloween. We feel good that there will be plenty of candy out there. So feeling good about that. As we look at overall in the back half as it relates to market share, we think that there will be a stable approach overall, but some pressure on everyday despite some of our strengths around the seasons. Nik Modi : Great. And then if I could just clarify, in terms of the execution issues in Salty Snacks, what exactly happened, so you talked about systems changeover, but can you just provide just the details on exactly like what the problem was? Michele Buck : Yeah. I mean, I\u2019d say, two key things. One is we had some promotions that we had planned to occur in Q2 that shifted to Q3 and then we have had some just basic issues as we have been bringing together all of those businesses that you would expect during a transition like that around sales and commercial and supply chain execution. So things just weren\u2019t as connected as they needed to be. We feel very good that the team is on it and focused on it and execution is something that we tend to do very well, so we have a lot of confidence in our ability to focus and get that back around. That said, of course, the back half of the year, as we have mentioned, is going to be -- have a lot of volatility that\u2019s really tied to as we build inventory and then work through the implementation and anticipate that we will have lighter sales in the fourth quarter as a result of that, but we have confidence in our ability to fix the execution. Nik Modi : Great. Thanks so much. I will pass it on. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions. Alexia Howard : Good morning, everyone. Michele Buck : Good morning. Alexia Howard : Can I ask, first of all, about market share trends in U.S. chocolate? It sounds as though capacity constraints and other issues have caused some of those declines. Do you have a view as to when those market share trends should start to improve and turn positive again? Michele Buck : So we expect to continue to see pressure in the back half of the year. We believe that we will start to see some improvement, but there are a couple of things that are really impacting share. So one certainly is around category mix, with refreshment and sweets being stronger than we had anticipated. Chocolate should improve and we are focused on increasing our level of innovation to be even more competitive and we will be in a better position to do that as we continue to have more capacity come online. Alexia Howard : Great. And then as a\u2026 Michele Buck : We have increment in REIT [ph]. Yeah. Go ahead. Alexia Howard : I am sorry. No. I was going to say, moving on to Salty Snacks, you talked about a double-digit decline, I think, in the fourth quarter because of the transformation. Is that choppiness expected to persist into 2024? Steve Voskuil : No. Michele Buck : No. Steve Voskuil : Not at this stage. Really it\u2019s just -- Q3 we will be getting ready and building inventory for the switchover, Q4 will be the switchover and the recovery. So by the time we get to the first quarter, we would expect to be back on -- back or very close to a regular glide path. Yeah. Alexia Howard : Great. Thank you very much. I will pass it on. Steve Voskuil : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Matt Smith with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions. Matt Smith : Hi. Good morning. Michele Buck : Good morning. Matt Smith : Steve, I wanted to dig in a little bit on gross margin. You had a really solid first half with margin expansion up near 100 basis points and you again increased the margin expectations for the year. So could you talk about the drivers of margin expansion relative to your initial expectations and what\u2019s weighing on the expansion in the second half relative to the performance in the first half. Is that tougher comparisons in relation to the balance of pricing and inflation or are there other factors at play, like, increased promotion? Steve Voskuil : Sure. Yeah. We are pleased with the gross margin performance through the first half and we have had a few things, I think, that have broken our way. We have seen less inflation in things like packaging and logistics and even some material costs. Our productivity progress has been strong. I think we feel really good about where we are at the midyear mark on productivity, and then, of course, we have had pricing drop through. So all of those have worked in our favor and will continue to some degree as we go to the back half. If you look at the back half, taking the volume impact, we are going to have some more fixed cost absorption impact that will be a little bit of a weight. And again, we have got hedging against commodities, but still from a year-over-year and beginning of the year, end of year perspective, we still have a bit more cost for some of the inflationary commodities, cocoa and sugar, smaller weights, and again, smoothed out by hedging, but still some impact. Those would probably be the two biggest drags as we look to the back half. But again, overall, I still feel confident in taking our guidance up and the team is doing a nice job managing the cost side. Matt Smith : Thank you for that. And just as a follow-up, if I understood what you were saying about the second half. There should be a nice gross margin benefit in the third quarter as you build inventory with retailers ahead of the cutover in Salty Snacks, is that right? Steve Voskuil : Yeah. Yeah. We will get some benefit. Again, salty is not the biggest business, but we will get some absorption benefit as we build inventory in salty. Yeah. Matt Smith : Okay. Thanks for that. I will pass it on. Steve Voskuil : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Cody Ross with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. Cody Ross : Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. A couple of housekeeping ones and then a longer term one in nature. First one, I think, you spoke about inventory headwinds in the quarter. I think they were lapping the inventory replenishment last year and the pull forward of sales into 1Q from 2Q. Is that correct, and if so, can you quantify each one for us? Steve Voskuil : It is correct. In terms of breaking out the pieces. There\u2019s about 300 basis points we attribute to the last and about 150-basis-point shift relative to Q1 order of magnitude. Cody Ross : Great. Thank you. Other housekeeping question, just as far as the 4Q, I think, you guys said that, sales should be down double digits in the salty business due to the ERP implementation. Can you just quantify that for us or give us an expectation for magnitude? And then just one last one. Steve Voskuil : In terms of dollars or... Cody Ross : Yeah. The dollars that you are expecting from the implementation. Melissa Poole : Yeah. As we get that... Michele Buck : Yeah. No. That\u2019s a double-digit decline. So we not going to go any more specific than that. Cody Ross : Understood. And then last question, just on the competitive environment. There\u2019s been a lot of news in the headlines lately about private label and other branded competitors becoming more competitive. What are you seeing in competitive -- in the competitive environment? I know you said you have seen branded players pick up more innovation, besides that, are you seeing any step-up in promotions and what\u2019s kind of your expectation going forward? Thank you. Michele Buck : Yeah. I mean, I\u2019d say, the categories that we are in have always been very competitive. But the good thing is we have rational competitors. And what we are seeing overall, I\u2019d say, is pretty consistent with what we have seen historically. We have seen some higher levels of innovation as supply chains have gotten stronger and people have been able to support innovation. We have seen some increases in private label, I think, with the economic environment in both confection and in salty. But frankly, the results of those entries have been somewhat mixed, and certainly, our brands have held up really well. We continue to focus on driving sustainable profitable growth. As it relates to infection and promotional activity, display has always been important for that impulse-driven category and so we didn\u2019t see as much of the change in promotion as perhaps some other categories have seen. So that\u2019s been much more stable for us and we anticipate we will continue to going forward. So we will continue to invest robustly to drive our brands with innovation, marketing support, what we think is the right level of promotion. Cody Ross : Great. Thank you very much. I will pass it on. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions. Jason English : Hey, folks. Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. Couple of questions. Michele Buck : Hi. Jason English : First, on Salty Snacks, promotion shift, it seems odd, usually promotions are locked in well-advanced retailers. So was this an issue of you actually not having a promotion your planned for like at this time was your sales and finance functions or did a retailer actually cancel activity on you? Steve Voskuil : Yeah. Michele Buck : Yeah. Retailers did not cancel activity on us, but it was really our choice to move a promotion. So that piece is that. And then relative to our broader execution issues, we had some temporary out of stocks. We go to market differently with dots than we do with SkinnyPop and the team quickly adjusted and we have seen our service levels improve. So we don\u2019t expect to see that kind of impact in the second half. Jason English : Okay. So you canceled promotional activity on your retailer. Is that because of supply constraints or what drove that decision? Michele Buck : No. We have really shifted to investing a promotion in the third quarter that we thought made a lot of sense in advance of S/4. It was a big opportunity for us. Jason English : Okay. Switching gears, kind of coming back to Mr. Goldman\u2019s line of question earlier, I had a couple of other lines of question on competitive activity. Your release has a tremendous amount of focus on market share and rather than driving category growth and we have seen the category actually weakened quite a bit in recent data. It\u2019s a two-part question. First, what do you attribute the accelerating volume declines in chocolate confection to be driven by? And second, are you incenting organization on share and assuming you are based on the heavy emphasis in the release and prepared comments, how do you manage the risk of us getting back to where we were five years, six years, seven years ago, where it was sort of you always duking it out promoting away value in the category rather than what has been a much more, I would say, constructive competitive environment we have seen over the last couple of years? Michele Buck : Yeah. Well, as we look at the category, certainly, we have had significant pricing in the category. We have 20% price, and over time, we should see some moderation and the volume decline should moderate as well. So, certainly, price has played a factor. I would say we are always focused on driving the category, as well as market share, because being the category leader, we know if we drive the category we stand to have some of the greatest benefits. So we certainly don\u2019t approach this as duking it out, but rather, how do we continue to connect with consumers and partner with our retail customers to maximize what\u2019s going to be best to drive the overall business in category? Steve Voskuil : And we have got a lot more tools and sophistication today to look at the ROIs for how we are deploying things like promotion and there\u2019s no intent to get into an arms race of bad returning investments like that. We will have -- we want to win with innovation, which we talked about in the remarks not just spending. Melissa Poole : Yeah. I think, Jason, if it helps a little, too. We had the past, call it, two months or so, multiple price increases, three different price increases hitting retailers at the same time, which is kind of what drove that 20% Michele mentioned as kind of some of we were at the tail end of lapping some and some new ones we are going in. So we would expect that pricing number to come down and with that the volume declines to moderate as well. So in the next couple of months we would expect that to normalize a bit. Jason English : Okay. And I am going to cheat with one quick follow-up related to that question. But to my point on how are you been sending the organization, your sales force in particular, is the market share component to the bonus or is it just deliver the revenue? Steve Voskuil : Yeah. Today market share is not a component of most bonuses, it\u2019s about delivering the revenue, but we have other metrics around quality of delivery and how it\u2019s delivered and where... Melissa Poole : Sales activity based margins that enable a balance between sales and profitable sales. Steve Voskuil : That\u2019s right. Jason English : Got it. That is helpful. Thank you very much. I will pass it on. Steve Voskuil : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Connor Rattigan with Consumer Edge Research. Please proceed with your questions. Connor Rattigan : Good morning. Thanks for the question. So I guess as we think about the pricing environment and increasing elasticity going forward, should we view your on capacity is just meeting existing underlying demand or is there may be an opportunity to allocate some of that newfound capacity to take advantage of some strategic revenue management opportunities, such as package resizing or bar weights to drive net price realization going forward? Michele Buck : Yeah. We have been very focused on strategic revenue management and pack price architecture on both confection and the salty categories. I think a few years ago, we talked about evolving our pricing approach from just list pricing to how we look more holistically at strategic pricing. And in these categories in particular, it\u2019s a big opportunity. We continue to focus there in confection and on salty it\u2019s certainly something that as we acquired these businesses was a real underdeveloped area of opportunity. Connor Rattigan : Great. Thank you. I will pass it on. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions. Rob Dickerson : Great. Thanks so much. I just have two questions. I just want to circle back to some of the comments you made, Steve, just on cocoa and sugar inflation that Ken asked. It sounds like there clearly are other offset besides pricing that you can act to kind of help alleviate, let\u2019s say, soften some of that pressure over the next two years given your hedging schedule, but clearly, cocoa has also inflated fairly materially over the past few months. I am just curious like when I try to combine the comments from the offsets, but then the comments, I think, or which -- in the prepared remarks about potential more promotional activity next year and all the pricing you have taken is like, do you feel like you are kind of reaching this point such that maybe market share is a little softer, maybe that\u2019s driven by capacity, capacity is coming online or maybe you need to promote, but also maybe you kind of have kind of hit certain price points that you have to be like very careful with at this point on the everyday side of the business and maybe you don\u2019t really want to take more pricing, but if you hadn\u2019t, you would? So I am just trying to get a sense as to like why you wouldn\u2019t want to basically take a little bit more given where the input cost complex is? Thanks. Steve Voskuil : Yeah. I mean, we will take -- those are all the kind of considerations that we look at when we think about 2024 and beyond. And again, we look at the whole P&L, we look at market share, we look at what competition is doing. And clearly, we look at commodities and where we think they are headed. And so I don\u2019t want to get more specific on the construct of the 2024 plan, but those are the kind of things we will consider. Again, we have navigated this before. We have got a lot of levers at our disposal. Pricing and revenue is reset just one of those levers and it will be interesting to see what happens in the cocoa and sugar market. I do think in those cases there\u2019s still a lot of speculation. And again, our hedging strategy gives us an element of smoothing and protection to a degree to that. But we will be watching to see how these markets hold up, because they are at pretty high levels atypically and it\u2019s not driven by fundamentals to a large degree. Rob Dickerson : Okay. Fair enough. And then just quickly, the comment on Halloween should be very strong. Michele, you said plenty of candy, it sounds like Halloween seasonal sales expected to be up double-digit. So I am just curious, like, why do you think Halloween will be so strong this year, number one? And then number two, I think, last year you did have some benefit from early shipments, so I just want to make sure there aren\u2019t quite earlier shipments coming? That\u2019s it. Thanks so much. Michele Buck : Sure. So we get a lot of visibility to the seasons, because we plan with customers in advance relative to needing to build inventory for the season. So we have a lot of good visibility in terms of what is being bought and we have very strong programs to drive sell-through. So that gives us a lot of confidence. We know that during difficult economic times, consumers are particularly interested in enjoying kind of the simple things in life, like these seasons, like Halloween and so that\u2019s another kind of tailwind of focus relative to our conviction and why I think we and our customer partners really want to lean into Halloween. Rob Dickerson : Okay. Fair enough. And then on the shipment side, it doesn\u2019t sound like there\u2019s any delta there relative to the year ago? Steve Voskuil : No. Michele Buck : No. Rob Dickerson : All right. Super. Thank you. Steve Voskuil : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your questions. Chris Carey : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. Michele Buck : Good morning. Chris Carey : So just a question kind of clarification around salty. We have seen some deceleration in consumption, namely volume in recent scanner data. And I am just trying to understand and apologies if this has kind of been addressed in some form, but just to clarify. Was any of that because of lack of supply because of a shift in promotional programs? Said another way, as supply ramps in Q3, it sounds like there\u2019s some shift in promotional programs, would you expect the consumption trends? I realize what you are saying about your reported results in Q3 and Q4, but would you expect consumption trends to pick up or is what we are seeing perhaps more indicative of underlying demand? So I just want to maybe understand how you think about the balance of those things? Michele Buck : Yeah. So promotional declines did drive that deceleration, and yes, we do expect that to pick up in Q3 going forward. Chris Carey : Okay. That\u2019s helpful enough. Thanks so much. Steve Voskuil : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions. Bryan Spillane : Thanks, Operator. Hey. Good morning, guys. Michele Buck : Good morning. Bryan Spillane : So two quick ones for me. One, just a follow-up on elasticity and another one on capital allocation. So first on elasticity, Michele, is there any pronounced differences across channels? So I guess small format immediate consumption versus large box, just anything there to call out in terms of where the -- if there\u2019s any differences in terms of elasticity across those channels or consumption occasions? Michele Buck : I don\u2019t think that we have seen anything significant across channels. No. Bryan Spillane : Okay. And then, Steve, just on capital allocation, I noticed the dividend increase of 15% and that, obviously, makes the dividend more competitive, I guess, with interest rates going up. But just can you remind us, again, as we kind of think about, think over the next couple of years and as capital spending normalizes and again assuming that there\u2019s not some major strategic event that would affect the balance sheet. Just how you are thinking about capital allocation and returning cash to shareholders going forward, and again, would it be more dividends, would share repurchases become a more pronounced piece? Just kind of how you are thinking about that as we think about it over the next couple of years would be helpful? Thanks. Steve Voskuil : Sure. Yeah. I\u2019d be happy to. No fundamental changes in our capital allocation philosophy that we talked about back at the Investor Conference. It is a great dividend increase. When you look at that and you look at our target for payout ratio and so on. We are still, even with this increase a little bit behind where we would like to be and where we have been historically. So that just reflects the great earnings progress over the last few years, but pleased with the 15% increase. And you are right, as we look forward, as capital spending moderates off some of the really high spending we have had here recently, we are going to look for other ways to be thoughtful with the capital and returning cash to shareholders through repurchases, for example, is our stop gap when we don\u2019t have better-returning alternatives and so still that\u2019s not going to change. Bryan Spillane : Okay. Thank you. Steve Voskuil : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your questions. Robert Moskow : Hi. Thank you for the question. Similar to Bryan about elasticity look slightly different. I want to know if you have seen any differences in elasticity within the portfolio, like, multi-serve bags versus single-serve, especially heading into Halloween, some of those bags can cost $20, $25 at retail. Have you seen any observations in consumer behavior about just the absolute price points affecting demand? Michele Buck : So nothing material relative to the pack size piece. I mean, what we have tended to see over time is, seasons tend to perform better, to be less elastic and I think that\u2019s just the nature of people are going to participate. So that\u2019s the biggest difference that we see. Robert Moskow : Okay. So -- and any -- so no real change in like single-serve demand affected by traffic or just the absolute price point of the bars getting up there? Michele Buck : No. Robert Moskow : Okay. Michele Buck : We have not seen. Robert Moskow : All right. Thank you. Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your questions. David Palmer : Hi. Thanks. At your Analyst Day, you provided guidance of North America Confection organic sales in the low single digits including flattish volume. Could you remind us again of the drivers to sustain that sales growth with low single-digit pricing at flat volume as perhaps competition returns in a more fulsome manner? Thanks so much. Steve Voskuil : Yes. I would say nothing fundamental changing in that algorithm the way we think about the sources of growth for U.S. Confection or the rest of the business. I mean we always expect it to be a competitive category over time and so we are looking at it the same way. There\u2019s nothing that\u2019s happening this quarter or even for the balance of this year that we think fundamentally changes any of that. David Palmer : Thanks very much. Steve Voskuil : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. I am showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I\u2019d like to hand the call back over to Ms. Melissa Poole for any closing comments. Melissa Poole : Yeah. Thanks so much for joining us this morning. I know it was a particularly busy morning of earnings. So thanks for all of the great questions and look forward to catching up with you all later today for any outstanding ones you may have. Have a great day everyone. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.",

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Melissa Poole, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Hershey Company. Thank you. You may begin. Melissa Poole : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for The Hershey Company's third quarter 2023 earnings Q&A session. I hope everyone has had the chance to read our press release and listen to our prerecorded management remarks, both of which are available on our website. In addition, we have posted a transcript of the prerecorded remarks. At the conclusion of today's live Q&A session, we will also post a transcript and audio replay of this call. Please note that during today's Q&A session, we may make forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. These statements include expectations and assumptions regarding the company's future operations and financial performance. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based on subsequent events. A detailed listing of such risks and uncertainties can be found in today's press release and the company's SEC filings. Finally, please note that we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe will provide useful information for investors, the presentation that this information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning's press release. Joining me today are Hershey's Chairman and CEO, Michele Buck; and Hershey's Senior Vice President and CFO, Steve Voskuil. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Lazar : Good morning, everybody. Michele Buck : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Lazar : Thanks. At Hershey's Analyst Day earlier this year, I know that the company expressed confidence in sort of generating the high end of its sort of long-term growth algorithm for 2024. And we know some things have changed since then. There's been some more inflation. You talk about what seems to be the need for maybe some more aggressive investment spend behind stepped-up innovation as well as some shifting between trade and consumer spend and some consumer behavior shifts. So I was hoping maybe you could take us through, I guess, some of the key puts and takes for next year, how you're seeing all of this rolling up at this point? And basically, if 2024 can still be sort of an on-algorithm year even if not necessarily at the high end. Michele Buck : Sure. So certainly, Andrew, we recognize that the world continues to be very dynamic out there, but we think we're very confident that we can pivot and adjust to those changes. If we think about things that we're anticipating strength on from a top line perspective, we've got good visibility with the capacity enabled growth, the capacity that will come online. Gummies in particular, is an area where we've not been able to fully take advantage of the growth in the Sweet segment. We're going to be in a much better position next year to do that. Certainly, some of the capacity that came online this year has been helpful to us relative to seasons and better being able to take full advantage in that area. That will be a benefit next year as well as additional Reese. Certainly, we have higher levels of innovation. Reese's' Caramel is one that we have highlighted already, but that's going to be very helpful for us in terms of driving the overall business as well as merch. We have some opportunities in distribution on salty Dot's in particular. And of course, we also have pricing carryover from this year. From a margin perspective, we know that we've got inflation that's a bit of a headwind with all-time high commodity costs in cocoa. But we also have pricing and productivity that will help to offset that. It will have some one-time pressures related to the S/4 transition. But again, that's really a transient event and will create some issues relative to inventory in the first part of the year. So that's kind of a little bit of an overview. Steve, anything you would add to that? Steve Voskuil : No. I think you hit all the key pieces. Obviously, the next time we talk, we'll have a lot more details on next year. So\u2026 Andrew Lazar : Yes. Great. And maybe just as a follow-up, you mentioned pricing and productivity. We know that there's already some pricing that will flow through and benefit 2024 from initiatives you've already announced and sort of put into the market. Have there been any other incremental pricing actions announced or that you think there'll be potentially the need for given where some of the cost increases are coming from? Michele Buck : We have not announced any incremental price increases. We always evaluate the marketplace and have a lot of factors that we consider to determine how to best grow the business. Pricing is certainly one tool. I mentioned productivity. Now that we're in a better shape from a capacity perspective, we have more ability in our supply chain to activate productivity, and then we also look at productivity across every line item of the P&L, whether its trade, media, organizational processes and make sure we're really leveraging the best capabilities and investments to drive the business. Andrew Lazar : Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Ken Goldman : Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to follow up on Andrew's question a little bit about next year. I very much understand you're not necessarily in a position yet to discuss all the details of 2024, but you have given us some sales outlook and EPS outlook for next year. And I guess the question was whether you can hit the high-end of algo or the numbers that you put out there, and I realize things are still changing and pivoting. But I'm just really curious, because I think it's an important question to kind of follow-up on that guidance that you had given and really get a better understanding of how the incremental headwinds that have come since your Investor Day? I guess it's been a little more powerful than some of the tailwinds that have come as well. I'm just trying to get a sense of kind of balancing all that, I think, a little bit in the context of the fact that some numbers have been provided already. Thank you. Steve Voskuil : Sure. Yes, I'm happy to take it. It is an important question, and we'll address it a lot more fully on the next call. I think, the key right now is there are a lot of moving pieces even since we had that call, and some things are progressing in a positive way. We talked about productivity a little bit already. Productivity was one of the upsides we talked about on the call, we're having a great year from a productivity standpoint, and I expect that to carry forward. As Michele just said, we'll continue to look at pricing in all variables, pack price architecture, regular pricing and other places for productivity. And then we're watching the commodity markets closely. And there's been a pretty significant change there, too, from the beginning of the year. And so as we get together next time, we'll be able to pull all of that together and give you a better picture on how we feel about what we said back at the investor conference. But right now, we're still looking at, as Michele said, a pretty dynamic environment. Ken Goldman : Okay. Thank you for that. And then my follow-up is, as we think about the trade de-load, you mentioned with the key retailer. Can you talk a little bit about what drove that and what some of the risks are that additional de-loads happen with maybe some of your other customers? Michele Buck : Yes. And really, what we saw from the key retailer was a reduction in merchandising, which did pull back on shipments into that retailer. And this is really about their strategy to improve the shopping experience for their consumers and also to make fulfilling online orders easier for their pickers in store. This was a change that impacted many categories. Confection was one of those, and we had a disproportionate impact because we have had a very high share of merchandising. And therefore, that pullback impacted us, but it impacted many other categories in both edibles and nonedible.  Now this, I want to point out, this is really related to every day. So as you think about Q4 and the importance of Halloween and Holiday this did not impact season. So we don't expect the same impact in Q4 given how much of our business is seasonal. We do think that this will be a headwind in the first part of 2024, where we're lapping higher levels of March. Ken Goldman : Thank you for the clarification. I appreciate it. Michele Buck : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Max Gumport with BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your question. Max Gumport : Hi, thanks for the question. First, I just wanted to follow up on your commentary on the retailer merchandising reduction. It sounded like it was to help improve the shopping experience and the e-commerce and picking ability as well. Is there any reason to think other retailers could follow the same path? It sounds like it's just one key retailer for now. But are there any reasons to expect other retailers will follow? Michele Buck : I don't anticipate that. I think this retailer, the degree of merchandising at this retailer was much greater than at many others. So I wouldn't anticipate that. Max Gumport : Great. And then on Halloween, it sounds like it's up slightly so far. I know there was a low double-digit expectation. And I know that this year, shopping patterns have been a bit more normal, so less shopping earlier in the year. So I think that would be one key reason to think you can still get to that low double-digit number, but I just wanted to make sure you still have visibility to low double target for Halloween this year. Thank you. Michele Buck : Yes I think the way you characterized it is certainly correct. We have seen a normalization of patterns from consumers in terms of when they're shopping as their concerns about potential availability are not there this year like they were last year. 50% of the season does sell through in the last two weeks of October. So we still do have a bit of product to sell through. And with Halloween falling on a Tuesday, there will be a lot of sales this weekend. We have seen a little bit of softness in the season from some cohorts that have indicated affordability was a concern in their participation and it wasn\u2019t just candy it was some other seasonal categories including decoration, costumes et cetera. But we are out there building aggressive displays, the product is out there and we are continuing to drive to deliver our expectation for the season Max Gumport : Thanks very much. I\u2019ll leave it there. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Michael Lavery : Thank you. Good morning. Michele Buck : Good morning. Michael Lavery : Just I was wondering if you could catch us up on Cocoa. Obviously, we see the market rates or the spot rates. But you've always done, I think it's anything from three to 18 or maybe even more months of hedging and contracting. And, can you just give us a sense of maybe what, if anything, you expect the market to do, how you're positioned relative to that? I know the pricing question came up a little bit earlier and you haven't announced anything, but is there any reason to believe that you would have any different approach than normal where if it remains an elevated source of pressure, you could take the pricing to cover it? Just some thoughts on how all that looks from your seat? Steve Voskuil : Sure, I'd be happy to do that. On the Cocoa side, our policies haven't changed. You reference the hedging horizon and those fundamentals haven't changed. I would say as we sit here today, we probably have less visibility on a full year 2024 pricing locked in that we might have had in prior years. And some of that is driven by the high pricing right now. But we're staying very close to the market and of course that influences other parts of the strategy as you mentioned like pricing. From the pricing standpoint, as Michele said, there's also nothing fundamentally has changed there in our strategy. Pricing is one -- tool and there's a lot of ways to deliver pricing and there's productivity and other things in the P&L that also have to be part of that equation. So I would say there's nothing off the table, but as we come back in 2024 and give guidance, we'll be able to give more color. And by then we'll also have another picture on where the cocoa market is headed. We talked a little bit in the last call that there is some divergence between, what we see in pricing and some of the underlying fundamentals. And we still have an aspiration at some point that that will normalize. But to the extent it doesn't, we thought that earlier this year, and it didn't play out that way. But every quarter that goes by, we get more visibility, and that will inform how we think about the pricing question. Michael Lavery : Okay. Great. That's helpful. And just to follow up on buybacks, you mentioned you didn't have any in the quarter. Obviously, the stock has been more attractively valued from a buyback perspective. How do you think about that going forward? Is there, how are you saving for M&A or is buyback something you might ramp back up? Steve Voskuil : Yes. It is attractively priced. I agree with you. And so as we think about our capital allocation principles, share of purchase always plays role. We are looking at it closely again as we talk next year and how we're going to allocate capital. You can imagine that's going to play a role and we'll continue to watch what's happening on the stock price and other calls for capital. I will say, we're coming off a pretty big year of capital spending this year. It's not going to look like that next year and so that is going to allow some more cash flow to deploy to other uses. So we'll keep that in mind as we think about 2024. Michael Lavery : Okay. Great. Thanks so much. Steve Voskuil : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Pamela Kaufman : Hi. Good morning. Michele Buck : Hi, Pam. Pamela Kaufman : We've seen consumer demand soften across categories, including for chocolate, as you mentioned in the prepared remarks. You also pointed to your outlook for demand elasticity to continue to return to normalized levels, but historically the chocolate category has exhibited relatively limited demand elasticity. So can you talk about how you're thinking about demand going forward in Q4 and for next year? Michele Buck : Sure. So, I would say we're certainly continue to feel good about our category and the price realization potential in our category as we have had over the years. We focused a lot on the value equation, investing in our business and our brands to keep that strong. At the same time, we're also cognizant that, it is a different time today. We know that value and affordability continue to be top of mind for consumers as budgets are stretched, some less government assistance, the restart of student loan repayments, higher interest rates. So we've heard from consumers that they're needing to make difficult choices. So we are certainly focused on that, and making sure that we're really focused on our value equation in terms of selling to value channels, having the right opening price points, et cetera. Food has been more resilient than some other categories but we know that some of the Snap households are reporting that they're eating and buying left. So we're very cognizant of that. And we've also seen some increase in sales in some of the perimeter categories where there's been deflation versus some of the inflationary categories. That said, where we focus on, where are the growth levers that we can continue to drive, to engage consumers and that is having the right levels and the right media targeting approach to continue to keep our brands relevant. But with both the media and the creative, we know that that's important. We didn't have as much innovation this year as we think was ideal on the business, and we've really stepped that up for next year. Feel great about Reese's Caramel in particular, and we'll share some of the other innovation that's coming as we go down the pike. Seasons continues to be a big piece of our business and winning during those seasons, getting that merchandising and it is a time where there's a lot of emotional connectivity with consumers. So it's a natural time for them to come in the category. And we continue to have distribution opportunities, both in terms of some places where we were short on capacity. And we had to pull back on some core items that we're now going to be able to supply as well as some of the innate distribution opportunities that we have on the Salty business. So those are some of the places that we're focused on to really drive growth. Pamela Kaufman : Thanks. And for my follow-up, just wanted to talk about the competitive dynamics in the Salty Snack segment and within Popcorn, specifically that you highlighted, what do you, what are you observing in the segment? And how are you addressing these competitive pressures? Michele Buck : Yes. So I'd start by saying that we have seen some softening in Salty Snacks overall. Volumes held fairly steady throughout the quarter. But growth decelerated as pricing lessened. And there was also some growth that shifted to non-measured channels. Again, we know that affordability and value are of increasing importance to consumers. And we're also seeing them really prioritize some of the more satiating snacks. So as we look at our business, certainly, we're seeing a lot of strength in Pretzels in the category as well as our Dot's distribution opportunities. And as we look at ready-to-eat Popcorn, certainly, we do know that consumers are focused a little bit more on satiety. And we've had some retailers focus on private label and merchandising in particular. As we go into next year, certainly, we'll be focused on productivity in the category. We know that some of the branded items have greater productivity and making sure we're working with retailers on taking full advantage of that continuing to invest in those brands to really grow household penetration and connectivity with consumers. And then certainly, as we look at this year, S4 impacted some of our ability to execute and really lean in as we had to focus on pulling back a bit on support on the business during Q3 and Q4, to enable that build that we needed in inventory and just to make sure that we could move through that very smoothly, and that will be a headwind for us next year. Pamela Kaufman : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions. Bryan Spillane : Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. So I guess, I have two questions, and it's kind of more related to, I don't know, the momentum in the business, I guess, and what we should be reading from the fourth quarter in the implied guidance. So I guess two areas if you could touch on them. One is, if we look at the revenue guidance, and I think in the press release, you talked a little bit about in Confection, in North America Confection shipment timing help a little bit. So just if you're thinking about the revenue guidance being held, is that, is what happened in 3Q versus the pull forward or however you want to describe it, is that just purely timing shipment? Or is it a reflection at all that is kind of the softness in every day had an impact as well in terms of the way you're thinking about revenue outlook. So I don't know, is the category or the business kind of slowing more than you thought? And then maybe, Steve, if you can touch on same thing implied margins for the fourth quarter kind of lower in 4Q versus 3Q. So can you just touch on that? And is that somewhat a reflection of the potential for margin degradation? Or again, is this just more timing? So you can kind of touch on those two things, would be helpful. Thank you. Steve Voskuil : Yes. We have to do. So I'll start with the sales side. So the biggest driver between Q3 and Q4, and Michele said it before, was seasonal timing. We have a big seasonal timing benefit in Q3 at some at the expense of Q4. Now Q4 also has seasons. We've got Holiday as a big factor and maybe even some early Easter shipments potentially. But Holiday is not as big as Halloween. And so just from a seasonal impact, that's one of the factors. We've kind of modeled historic elasticity. So we saw some of that coming in, in Q3, and we've modeled that more fully into Q4. And, we also have a slight inventory headwind on sales. So those are some of the drivers. I would say, as I think about the guide on sales for the full year, and I guess the implied Q4 around 8%. I would say there's probably less likely to be upside to that number. And if some of the risks would persist, we've got a lot of mitigating actions, but if some of those risks would persist, it's probably more likely to be around to the lower side than around to the high side of guide on the top line. On the margin side, yes, a couple it sort of reverses some of the benefits that we had in Q3. So you're losing some of the fixed cost absorption benefits that we had in Q3 with the higher volume. So we've got a little bit less pricing coming through in the fourth quarter that has an impact and then a more difficult lap also as part of that. So nothing structurally different in Q4, but reversal of some of those benefits that we saw in Q3, just manifesting themselves in Q4. Bryan Spillane : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your questions. Robert Moskow : Hi. A couple of questions, please. One is, since the inflation you're facing is largely in cocoa, it would think, one would think that like the chocolate category would have to raise prices much higher than other snacking categories. Michele, when you think about how that would affect chocolate category elasticity, do you have to factor that in? Do consumers make pricing, choose chocolate over other snacks. Do they have pricing as part of that algorithm or not? Michele Buck : Yes. So certainly, people are making choices across snack categories. And one of the things that we do factor in is kind of looking at cross category price elasticity, in our models. So that's always the case. I think the past two years, in particular, have just been a little bit unique in terms of what's going on in the marketplace overall. Inflation and pricing. So seeing some different dynamics there. Robert Moskow : Okay. And then one quick follow-up. You mentioned some headwinds related to, I think, the ERP timing and shipments for the first half of 2024. I think you said headwinds, but sometimes you ship ahead of ERP conversion. So can, Steve, can you be a little more specific as to how to think about shipment movement in the first half of next year? Steve Voskuil : Sure. And we'll talk more about this when we give the 2024 guide too, including the inventory build and the takeout. But yes, you're right, it's more of a sales movement in first. So there's some inventory build we'll do in advance to risk mitigate just like we did for Salty here. And then we would expect to see that bleed out in the second quarter, mostly in the second quarter. So there'll probably be some higher sales or higher inventory build and some fixed cost absorption on the front end and then the reversal of that in Q2. And there'll be some costs. We'll talk more about the cost profiling, some of that we take through, the regular P&L and some of that gets non-GAAPed out, but we'll give more clarity to that as we give 2024 guidance. Michele Buck : And that's similar to what we saw, what we've experienced on Salty this year. where in Q3, we have the inventory build and then Q4, it starts to bleed out, work out. Robert Moskow : Right. Okay. Thank you. Steve Voskuil : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Chris Carey : Hi good morning. Michele Buck : Good morning. Chris Carey : Just a quick question on Salty as well. I guess one is near term. One is more medium term. Has anything changed about how you view the category over time given the slowdown? And then can you just maybe be a bit more specific about why consumption trends should improve? Is it really just lapping comps, increased promotional activity after Q4? I know you're not doing it in Q4, but maybe more the kind of two to four-quarter trajectory and why things get better? So just what's changed your thinking of the category, if anything, over the medium term and that two to four quarter kind of dynamic on improvement? Michele Buck : Yes. So, I don't have any different views on the category. Snacking continues to be very strong consumer behavior, and I love our portfolio of having a very strong leadership presence in both Indulgent Snacking and Confection as well as participating in savory snacking, especially with the brands that we've acquired that have very strong consumer engagement and growth potential. So continue to feel very good about those. I think relative to the trends improving, we can't talk really about 2024. We'll come back and talk a bit about that more. But we continue to feel that we'll see similar trends in Q4 as we've seen in Q3 relative to takeaway. I mean, some differences in shipments related to S4 because the inventory will now be coming out. We built inventory in Q3. So from a shipment perspective, we'll see that difference. But from a takeaway perspective, we anticipate a continuation of what we saw in Q3. Chris Carey : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. David Palmer : Thanks. Good morning. A question on seasons, there's been a lot of discussion about seasons on the call. I wonder how, can you remind us what percent of your business in Confection is from seasons? And it feels like you've won in seasons in recent years. Can you just give us a sense of how much of your growth in Confection has come from seasons in recent years? Michele Buck : Yes. So, Seasons is between 25% and 30% of our total business on a full year basis. It varies by quarter. Obviously, Q4, we have Halloween and Holiday. So it's a much bigger percent then and of our growth, probably about the same proportion of our growth, about a third in the back half of this year. David Palmer : And then just looking ahead to 2024, wondering how you're thinking about Seasons growth in an answer to a previous question, you talked about how Seasons would be helped by capacity. You just have more ability to fulfill demand? But, and I'm wondering how you would marry that with what you're seeing from retailers and perhaps even the consumer and how you're seeing the consumers respond to existing Halloween, how you think about Seasons in 2024? Thanks. Michele Buck : Yes. So we think our Seasons business will be very solid in 2024. One of the key things to anticipating the next year is always realizing what your sell-through is on each current year season. So we need to get through Halloween to see what that sell-through turns out to be. We have, as mentioned earlier, a few more days about a week that we need to be able to look at that and then obviously have strong sell-through in holiday. So we need those data points, but we feel good based on where we are to date, but we'll have a better feel afterwards. The other thing that will impact 2024 is there will be a shorter Easter depending on where the date falls. And this year, Easter in 2024, I think, is March 29. So it's on the shorter side, which creates a shorter season and a little bit of pressure perspective, it just won't be as large as in years with a long season. David Palmer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Alexia Howard : Good morning, everyone. Michele Buck : Good morning. Alexia Howard : Hi. So I guess two questions. The short-term one is really about market share trends. I know that they've been weak in chocolate in the U.S. recently. I think the hope was that against an easy comp on Halloween that things might start to turn the corner sooner rather than later. But do you think we're going to have to wait until the beginning of next year to really see that improvement with improved innovation? And then I have a follow-up. Michele Buck : So from a short-term perspective, to-date, our data suggests we are winning share of Halloween. So we are pleased with that and feeling good about that. As it relates to the everyday business, there we will need to wait until 2024 to see improvement, driven by some of our stronger innovation that will really help the everyday business. Alexia Howard : Great. Thank you. And then on the follow-up, the GLP-1 question, which we're all chatting about out here. I know it's too early to tell how big it's going to get probably not having a big impact today because there's, too few U.S. adults on these drugs right now. But today, how do you plan for different scenarios on that. Obviously, adult consumption versus kids is going to be different, low sugar versus full sugar items portion control. How are you thinking about planning for that scenario as it unfolds given that it's early days. Thank you. Michele Buck : Yes, absolutely. I mean I think you've captured it correctly. It certainly is very early days. We don't believe the GLP-1s are having a material impact on our business at this point in time. And I think we all know there's a lot of data coming out. There's still so many unknowns regarding the rate of adoption the impact on food choices, the medium- to longer-term impacts on consumers, and we're doing more work constantly to understand those future potential impacts on our categories. We have a robust planning and forecasting process, and we try and factor in all of those consumer behavior changes that we're observing, inclusive of GLP-1s and thinking through all of those right strategies that will be important for us if they do increase in adoption. One thing we feel particularly good of is the emotional nature of our categories and our brands and the role that they play in moments of celebration, Joy as you think about the Seasons but we will continue to adapt our portfolio as we have over time to make sure that we are providing consumers with what they're looking for, whether it's the products, the ingredients, the innovation, certainly, there are opportunities around portion size and pack type. And I think a lot of companies have been focused on that as you think about the potential impact of GLP-1s. And then certainly, we're always looking at opportunistic M&A as well as we have in the past. Alexia Howard : Great. Thank you. And I'll pass it on. Michele Buck : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Rob Dickerson : Great. Thank you so much. Michele, I think in the prepared remarks and you mentioned it previously, you've commented on products, I guess, on the perimeter of the store. I'm assuming where you're kind of speaking to kind of more fresh bakery and you also spoke to kind of more satiating foods. By the -- on the Salty Snacks side, you commented on snacks right? Michele Buck : Right. Rob Dickerson : Is this, is this all kind of around the price point demand? Are you just trying to basically find more value at an appropriate price. And therefore, even though you let's say, you need a candy bar now you're on a cupcakes. Just trying to figure out exactly what you're speaking to? Thank you. Michele Buck : Yes, absolutely. That is what it's about. It is about the value equation. And certainly, we do see in times where consumers are really struggling a bigger focus on kind of the gut fill, the bang for the buck in terms of filling you up. And we've seen that and heard that from, especially from lower-income consumers before. So yes, that focus on society, where we're seeing categories like Pretzels, Meat Snacks, Tortilla Chips, some of the things that are more filling, behave more strongly from a category perspective and something aerated like a rice cake or cheese puff or ready-to-eat popcorn. So yes, it is about that value for the book. Now the other thing, in addition to things like cupcakes that we did see, we did see some increase in fruit consumption, and there was not a lot of inflation in fresh produce like that. So I think there was a value perception there as well. Rob Dickerson : Okay. Makes sense. Thank you. And then just quickly, International segment. Slowed somewhat materially, especially on the volume side. And I know you called out kind of a competitive dynamic, the moderation in category growth. If you kind of optically, at least when we see the numbers in Q3 relative to the year ago and vis-\u00e0-vis what we saw in Q2. It does seem like it's almost somewhat sudden and I don't know if I'm missing something. So maybe if you could just explain what that drop is and maybe it's fully defined by just the shift in the non-U.S. holidays? Thanks. Michele Buck : Yes. So there was definitely the shift in the non-U.S. holidays with Diwali in India coming a little bit later. The other big thing was the rationalization of our beverage business in Mexico, which I'm not sure that we've talked as extensively about, but we had a small drink business, maybe not that small in Mexico. It was sizable for Mexico. Not highly profitable and in our continuous efforts to make sure that we are focused on the best opportunities and putting our resources against those best opportunities. We made the decision to discontinue that drink business. So that did have a meaningful impact in the range of three to four points from a top line perspective and we really first started experiencing that in Q3. We will lap for a year, have that be an impact, but it was a minimal impact on profitability because it just wasn't a highly profitable business. Rob Dickerson : All right. Super. Thank you so much. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question. John Baumgartner : Good morning. Thanks for the question. Michele Buck : Good morning. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. John Baumgartner : Maybe first off, Michele. I just wanted to come back to the market share in chocolate, because we're seeing in the Nielsen data, their share gains accruing on an accelerating basis for premium brands and even private label, which is pretty unusual. And it's coming at the expense of the more mass price offerings. To what extent do you think the strategy needs to respond more broadly to these shifts, be it through more promotion, maintaining a larger brand investment for longer? It sounds as though your view is it's more of an innovation timing issue that reverses out next year to your benefit. But is there a chance that a larger pricing or promo pivot might be required going forward? Michele Buck : So as we look at the market share overall in confection, certainly, we've had a negative impact from category mix with faster growth in refreshments and sweets. And with the incremental capacity we've added going to be able to unlock more of the potential for us on share within sweets. The innovation that we've talked about, in addition to helping the everyday business innovation drives merch and so that's going to be very helpful in terms of helping promo. And then also we're working through the one retailer partnering very strongly to make sure that we can adhere to some of their direction and at the same time, make sure that we're recognizing the impulsive and expandable nature of our category and making sure that we have the right plans to take that into account. We have continued to invest in our brands, and we will continue to going forward. So at this point in time, I wouldn't say that we're anticipating a very large, substantial change in our investment levels. We have strong levels in trade and consumer on the margin, we are always open to adjusting those as we see fit. And we also are really focused on making sure that the allocation is as strong as it possibly can be between trade and between media as we look holistically. We haven't seen a big, huge increase, frankly, in premium, a bit of an increase in private label, but it continues to be a very small part of the category. John Baumgartner : Okay. And I guess just following that line of thought with the just merchandising adjustment at the retailer. You mentioned it wasn't confined to Confectionery, but I mean Confectionery is also pretty valuable to retailers for profit and velocity. Do you have a sense for which categories benefited from this adjustment? It just seems odd this happens ahead of the holidays given the importance of the category and then your own innovation and capacity ramping next year. I mean, I don't know how surprising that decision was for you, but I'm just sort of curious like what, who sort of benefited from this change? Do you have any sense? Michele Buck : So no category really benefited, because it was an overall reduction in merchandising. So it was more of a focus on consumer experience for more open aisles and also to enable growth and support of omni-channel and the digital business from a picking of products. So we are counting on trying to drive and the retailer counting on increases in everyday velocity to be enough to offset that. And we're certainly partnering really closely to make sure we have all the right programs and plans jointly to jointly drive the category, as you mentioned, it's highly profitable. It is expandable consumption and there is an impulsive opportunity. So we continue to work hard to drive that. John Baumgartner : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Salera with Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your question. Jim Salera : Hi, guys. Thanks for squeezing us in. Can you maybe offer some commentary around the dots distribution, gaining permanent distribution at club? I know very attractive kind of value proposition for consumers. Is there a lot of bigger wins like that on the table? And does this help you kind of accelerate the value proposition when you go to retailers to say that you can have it in a large concept? Michele Buck : Yes. I mean I think it helps us in terms of household penetration because we are still in the process of building the household penetration on that brand. Frankly, the business is quite big given the relatively nascent household distribution. So Club is always a great venue to get that. And we continue to have some distribution opportunity on the Pretzel business overall. So we continue to be excited by that and excited that the velocities have held up pretty well despite those increases in distribution. And we also have some opportunities for select innovation. We introduced Cinnamon Sugar, which has been a great hit in the marketplace as well. Jim Salera : Great. And then maybe if you can offer some commentary just given that Dot's seems to be insulated from some of the demand elasticity that maybe we've seen in some of the other more premium Salty offerings. What is it about Dot's? Is it just their core kind of consumer is higher income or they just have a really on-trend offering? What is it that seems that they've been able to be insulated compared to some of the other more premium Salty offerings? Michele Buck : Yes. I mean I think one of the biggest things we've seen from our consumer work is the society of the category. It's a very satiating snack. It's very filling. And therefore, even though it is a premium product and some of the price points are high, it delivers on that value equation with very strong society. And I would say it certainly is a very differentiated product. Jim Salera : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Ms. Melissa Poole for closing comments. Melissa Poole : Thank you all so much for joining us this morning, and we look forward to catching up with you in the coming days and weeks. Have a great rest of your day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Joining me today are Hershey\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Michele Buck and Hershey\u2019s Senior Vice-President and CFO Steve Voskuil. With that I will turn it over to the operator for the first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Lazar : Great. Thanks so much good morning everybody. Michele Buck : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Lazar : Maybe to start off your guidance for 2024 calls for that 2% to 3% net sales growth with volume flat to slightly down so implies over a three point year-over-year benefit from price which seems to be mostly carry over related from actions taken last year. So I guess my question is just recurring outlook embed any additional pricing actions this year to address the currently elevated cocoa cost and if not I guess if Hershey were to take additional pricing actions. Would those benefit 2024 or with the typical timing lag and kind of complexity of the system's transition, would that likely really be more of a 2025 benefit at this stage? Michele Buck : Hey Andrew, let me talk a little bit about our pricing approach and strategy and then Steve will go into the numbers. It's a dynamic environment out there and we are taking a measured approach given historic inflation. As we can't talk about future pricing, but I do want to be very clear that there's no change to our pricing strategy and our commitment to use pricing to cover inflation and to support the investments that we think are critical to drive the business. So given where Cocoa prices are, we will be using every tool in our toolbox, including pricing as a way to manage the business. Steve, do you want to talk about some more of the specifics? Steve Voskuil : Yes, the way you laid it out, Andrew, is correct. The pricing that we're counting on that 3% or so, a lot of it's carryover, some of it from 2022 to Easter and Valentine's Day, some we took mid last year on everyday chocolate and then a small increase we announced earlier this year on grocery items and food service. And you're right, when we think about the impact of future price increase, we're really challenged in the first half of this year just because of the ERP implementation, like you said, it puts some limitations on what we can do. And you can imagine enormous collaboration between us and retailers to execute that transformation. So we're trying to keep things very stable during that period. And so further price increases should they come with benefit more the back half of the year and probably more so 2025. Andrew Lazar : Got it, thanks for that. And then the EPS in 2024 is expected to be sort of flat for the year. There's obviously a big discrepancy between what you're looking for in the first half versus the second half in terms of EPS growth. I guess, I'm trying to get a sense of how much of this is anticipated improvement in the consumer environment versus what you have maybe more visibility and control over with things such as timing of your plan system spending and timing of cost saves and productivity. Just trying to get a sense of the visibility to that, to the swing, if you will, and EPS growth between the first half and second half. Thanks so much. Steve Voskuil : Sure, yes, it's not banking on cocoa relief and it's not banking on some kind of surge in the consumer or really even a surge in the base business. The biggest factor is really two things driving it. One is the lapse from last year. And as we started out really strong the first quarter last year and then ran into things like softer, salty category growth in popcorn, the ERP implementation in salty, and then the change in strategy at a key retailer. So as we think about the lapse of those, that's one factor that impacts this profile because the lapse gets much easier in the back half. And then the second thing you mentioned, Andrew, are things in our control. So the savings on the agility and automation initiative will get more traction in the back half again because the ERP places some limitations there. The same with productivity in the manufacturing areas, back half loaded. And so those will accumulate as we turn the corner from the first half and pivot from the ERP sort of period of stability to period of driving impacts against those savings initiatives. So it's really lapse combined with the things in our control. Andrew Lazar : Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Ken Goldman : Hi, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to ask a little bit, you have more innovation coming this year, you have more capacity, you're battling an elasticity situation that I think it's fair to say is higher than many people expected, but your media spending is only being increased by the same amount as sales growth. I realize you're focusing on some key items a little bit more and you're kind of rebalancing some of that, but just trying to get a sense of the risk of some of your more flanker type brands if media is pulled away from them, if that's the impression I'm getting, if that's the right one. And how to really to think about your decision to maybe not raise media spending a little bit more than sales growth to kind of make sure that, you're battling elasticity in the way that's appropriate. Michele Buck : Yes, thanks Ken. As we are big believers and our business model relies on media as a key lever to continue to drive our brands over the long-term. We're constantly, we feel good about media going up in line with sales. We also constantly look to try and make those dollars work harder and harder for us. And we've made some pivots in terms of some of our targeting that are actually going to give us expanded reach levels that will be greater than sales. So the impact we will get from that media will be more than the dollar increase, but we will constantly evaluate that. And if we are seeing even better than we expected, we'll revisit decisions and decide if we should be spending more as we always do during the year. Ken Goldman : Thanks. And then quickly, it's not often we see kind of a venerable, established category like popcorn maybe slumping to this degree. Not really thinking about share gains or losses for Hershey in particular, but what do you see happening most recently in popcorn and what do you think needs to happen for the category to rebound? Michele Buck : Yes, I mean, I think what we saw this year was we did start to see some pressure in the category related to value. The fact that popcorn wasn't quite have as much satiety as some other snacks and we saw some private label entries also get some focus. So I think what needs to happen and then compounded by that, in the back half of the year, we are the number one or number two player depending on the time frame in the category. And in the back half of the year, around our ERP implementation, we pulled back on merchandising and advertising support to make sure that we didn't have issues with supply. So that certainly had an impact as well. So as we've gone into this year, what we think needs to happen, we have done. So we have made some improvements in the value proposition, introduced a value side, a bigger pack. We've sharpened some of our merchandising price points and also increased merchandising. And we are back to a much heavier investment in advertising and innovation that we've had over time. So we think we'll continue to see some of that lap through the first five months of the year and then really rebound to nice growth and market share gains in the back half. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Max Gumport with BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your question. Max Gumport : Hi, thanks for the question. With regard to cocoa prices, you've previously talked about how there's a divergence between fundamentals and current market prices. I'm assuming you're looking at underlying supply, demand and the stock to grinding ratio, but I'm curious for an update on that front and how that informs your visibility into cocoa for 2024. Thanks. Steve Voskuil : Sure. Yes, we look at a variety of things, as you can imagine. I'll say the fundamentals. And when I say look at, we have an internal team of experts in this domain, but we also have outside folks who also give us points of view to make sure we're not myopic in the way we look at the market and what's happening. But we look at the fundamentals, we look at grind data, we look at crop yields, we look at weather, we look at all of those fundamentals and, of course, demand. But at the same time, there's a lot of financial activity, transactional sort of activity and speculation that overlays the fundamentals. And it's been difficult, certainly, to untangle those two pieces. And so, that's part of the reason that we have a hedging program is that, we're not here to try to outsmart the market and beat the speculators per se. We want to make sure that we have visibility and have the opportunity to reduce volatility to the extent we can in the P&L. But it's certainly a very dynamic market. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Bryan Spillane : Hey, thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. Michele Buck : Morning. Bryan Spillane : Hey, so I've got two questions. And the first one is just, I don't know if it was actually in the press release or not, but Steve, have you given us a sense of just what your overall inflation is or maybe what cocoa inflation is? I've got that question a few times this morning. So what's the inflation rate, I guess, in the guide? Steve Voskuil : Sure. If you look at it, kind of break it into two pieces, I'll just say commodities of which I'll just say cocoa and sugar are the two most inflationary. Low double digit inflation, if you look at other parts of the P&L, it's more mid-single digit. So if you sort of average it over everything, it's high single digit. Bryan Spillane : Okay. And that's pretty well locked in, right? I'm assuming that, like you've got coverage on commodities for the year. Should we, is that a good expectation? Steve Voskuil : Yes, that's correct. Bryan Spillane : Okay, cool. And then, Michelle, just to, I guess, a bigger question or a broader question is just on the cost savings, the incremental savings this morning. Can you talk a little bit about maybe how you came, how as an organization you came to that? And, I think the question that some folks are asking this morning is just, are the cost savings a reaction, right, to inflation? You're trying to preserve as much earnings as you can, which maybe implies cutting too much. You've got a lot of stuff going on, an ERP system transition. Like, is it really burdening the organization too much to try to focus so much on costs when there's so much other stuff going on? So just your perspective on that, I think, would be helpful for folks. Michele Buck : Yes, sure. So I would say, a year to 18 months ago, we had started working on some initiatives that we thought could create some real opportunity and value for the company. And executing those was dependent on two things. It was dependent on us getting through the S4 implementation, which we will be through Q2 of this year. And it was also dependent on us doing the unification of our Salty Snacks business, taking those disparate acquisitions we had and combining them together, which obviously we did this past year and also put in place S4 across that platform, across that business unit. That then can become an accelerator for us to really go after what we saw as some opportunities, both in terms of creating greater end-to-end connectivity and also using technology for automation and efficiency. So this is really where we expected that we would be. Certainly with some of the pressure on coca prices, we accelerated that work a bit versus our original timeline, but the work was planned and underway accordingly. And we're trying to be very choiceful about where are the choices that we are making across those initiatives, and certainly making sure that a lot of that implementation won't happen till post S4, till we get through the implementation. So really measuring out when we do what to match with the organizational capacity. Steve, anything you would add to that? Steve Voskuil : No, we're excited. We're going to get through ERP. We'll have 95% of our business all on one platform and the opportunities that will unlock. And then as Michelle said, thinking ahead to things like integrated demand planning and bringing more automation to supply chain. These were things we had in the vision before, but now we're much closer to being able to make them realized. Bryan Spillane : Steve, you may be the first person that use excited in ERP in the same sentence. Steve Voskuil : Oh, you might. I look forward to seeing you guys in Florida. Bryan Spillane : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Alexia Howard : Good morning, everyone. Michele Buck : Good morning. Alexia Howard : Can I ask about honing in on the chocolate category in the U.S? You've obviously seen some nice recovery in volume and market share over the last two or three months. It's been fairly sharp. Can you talk about what the main drivers of that are? I imagine that innovation with the Reese's Caramels launch might be a piece of that. Just giving us some idea of what's driving that and whether that trend is expected to continue. Michele Buck : Yes, absolutely. I'd say there are two things that have really created some nice momentum on the business. One was we saw consumers have a huge affinity to the seasonal traditions. And we had very strong growth in the category in both Halloween and holiday. And we also won share. So that was certainly a key driver. And as you mentioned, we had talked about earlier this year, the opportunity for us in 2024 to really dial up innovation. We had a later year in 2023. Our innovation for 2024 is up about a third versus where it was in 2023. And we're really excited that we have some big innovations. Reese's Caramel, we believe will be a very nice addition. And that's doing well in Q4, continues to. We'll be featured on the Super Bowl. So you can look for that as well. And then we have some exciting sweets innovation later in the year. Alexia Howard : Perfect. And just continuing on the theme of innovation, you mentioned a third increase. Are you able to quantify where you're at in terms of percentage of sales from new products introduced over the last three years? I imagine that that would have come down significantly since the pandemic started. Michele Buck : Yes, so we are up about 35% higher in terms of innovation versus prior year. And we are up slightly versus pre-pandemic as well. I think we've chosen not to talk about innovation as a percent of net sales. Alexia Howard : Okay, perfect. I'll pass it on. Thank you. Michele Buck : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Pamela Kaufman : Hi, good morning. Michele Buck : Good morning. Pamela Kaufman : A question on your capacity expansion plans. I think you previously mentioned you had a 15% increase in capacity coming online this year. Can you just give an update on that? And do your cost savings initiatives impact these plans at all? And then maybe you can remind us what products the capacity is going to be used for. Michele Buck : So I'll cover some of that and let Steve cover some of it. We've continued to invest in capacity in brands and businesses across the portfolio that have growth and opportunity ahead. Over the past couple of years, we've focused on Reese\u2019s where we were short on capacity so that we could fulfill consumer demand. And then the other big area of focus we had was on the gummy side of the business in suites. And the first part of this year, we complete and have capacity coming online for that business that we will be able to leverage to better participate in that segment in the back half of the year. Steve? Steve Voskuil : Yes, the only thing I would add is everything is on track. Yes, we're proceeding per plan and the cost savings project that we talked about doesn't have any direct impact on those plans other than as we look to the future, more opportunities to automate and create some agility and supply chain beyond those projects, so. Pamela Kaufman : Great, thank you. And in the prepared remarks, you pointed to 200 basis points of gross margin contraction this year. Can you walk us through how you're thinking about the puts and takes around gross margins in 2024? And if you could give some color on the cadence of gross margin progression this year. Steve Voskuil : Sure, yes, I'll give a highlight that the prepared remarks actually have a good section on that. So whatever I missed here, refer back to that. But with overall full year basis down 200 basis points, as you said, we're going to see more of that in the first half than the second half for some of the reasons we talked about even earlier in this Q&A session. We will have in the second half higher commodity inflation, but in the second half, we'll begin to see more benefits from continuous improvements, so manufacturing cost savings, the agility and automation program that we talked about will kick into more gear in the second half as we get past the ERP process. And then we're lapping some one-time costs in the back half related to Salty and the ERP program. So those laps plus the accumulated benefits that pick up on the savings side are what drive the biggest inflection from a gross margin standpoint as we look at the second half having less drag than the first half. Pamela Kaufman : Okay, thank you. And just one more quick question. How are you thinking about the outlook for cocoa prices from here? And how is that influencing your hedging strategy? Steve Voskuil : Yes, our hedging strategy has not changed. Our kind of principles around how we manage commodities hasn't changed. It's a dynamic market, and we're not going to comment too much about future pricing. Our business, as Michelle said, we've seen cycles like this before. We've got a lot of tools at our disposal to manage the impact of cocoa, and we plan to use all of those, so. Pamela Kaufman : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Robert Moskow : Hi, thanks. I guess I have two questions. The first is market share assumptions in the U.S. for 2024. Is it fair to say that you think you can grow share in confectionery? And the second thing, on the pricing strategy, Michelle, nothing's changed, but this is a different strategy than what you've had in the past. The idea is to kind of squeeze out the pricing in maybe more frequently and in smaller increments. And I guess, is that still possible to do in an environment like this when the input costs spike so significantly? It sounds like that, it sounds like you're doing it this year, but, is it more difficult to execute when you see this much volatility in the inputs or not? Michele Buck : Okay. So I'll take the first question, first relative to market share. We expect to see sequential improvement as we go throughout the year. The first half will be pressured by a shorter Easter. Easter comes much earlier this year. And also we will have about five, roughly five months in the first half of lapping the reduced merchandising and distribution at that one key retailer. And we know from this past year, the impact of that was about two points in total. We offset about one point of that on a takeaway basis. So that will pressure share. In the second half, we then are past those laps of the shorter Easter and the retail merch. And so we expect to see sequential improvement and to end the year in a much better place than where we're starting. As I think about our pricing strategy, I'd say what is consistent is our goal to cover inflation with price over time. Within that, how exactly we do that relative to smaller, shorter, more frequent, or bigger, the timing and the magnitude, to me are heavily influenced by other factors, such as where our input costs and general inflation are. So I think, yes, that the overall, we have a strategy to expand growth margins to price to cover inflation and allow reinvestment. That hasn't changed, but how we go about doing that will be a bit different. We're also very much focused, price pack architecture is an opportunity, all the tools in the lever. Robert Moskow : Got it, so you can be flexible depending on the cost conditions. Michele Buck : Yes. Okay, thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Michael Lavery : Thank you, good morning. I just wanted to come back to Easter and the ERP transition. You'd mentioned with Salty in 4Q, how you cut back on some of the merchandising and even I think a little bit of the marketing spend. You mentioned Easter being a little bit shorter, but is there sort of an amplified headwind from the timing that, would you be doing a similar approach to promotions or marketing in conjunction with the transition to dial that back a little bit? Or is there a reason that they wouldn't apply the same way as the Salty transition did? Steve Voskuil : Yes, we're not applying the same approach we did with Salty in that respect. We'll still be building inventory in the first quarter, we'll still be draining that inventory in the second quarter just to de-risk the transition, but we are not going the extra step of like freezing from all activity in store, merchandising promotion. We have a full merchandising and promotion plan. Those are going to proceed, they were planned well in advance and we have full confidence in being able to support them. So that is a difference. Michele Buck : Yes, we felt like we got really good learning through the Salty and this was our plan to do Mexico first, then Salty and then the mother ship. And we got really good learning that we've been able to just incorporate and fine tune along the way. We also don't have the complexity as quite as many different systems that we have to bring together with our business as we did with all of the acquisitions. Michael Lavery : Okay, that's great color. And then can you just give us a sense on elasticities maybe both how they currently look versus history and then also what your assumptions are in the guidance as far as how they might progress over the rest of the year? Michele Buck : Yes, so we're expecting our elasticities to be similar to the historic levels. So that's our key assumption. Michael Lavery : Okay, great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Palmer with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Tom Palmer : Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Maybe just first-off on the pull forward of the productivity and cost savings, I just wanted to follow up from the earlier question. Are there new found savings embedded in this or are these largely initiatives that would have been done in future years? Just maybe clarify that piece of it. Steve Voskuil : Sure, so when we did our investor conference back in March, we talked about incremental productivity savings in the manufacturing area. So this is incremental to that to start with. This is beyond that. As Michelle said, in the longer term view, we saw these as opportunities, but it's new opportunities really built off the back of some of the technology now coming to fruition is the way to think about it. Michele Buck : And we've really beefed up or are beefing up our capabilities in technology. We hired a CDTO in the fourth quarter who's really bringing us capability and further expanding what we can do as a company, we believe. Tom Palmer : Okay, thank you. And I know there's some questions that kind of danced around this, but maybe I'll be a little more direct on it. Just on pricing, what exactly is flowing through as we think about 2024? So kind of what pieces of the portfolio are being touched? Are there incremental pricing actions embedded at all in guidance or kind of what we start out in the first quarter is the run rate is kind of the full magnitude? Steve Voskuil : Sure, yes. So we have sort of three pricing components that are embedded into the Outlook. I touched on a couple of these earlier. There's the Easter Valentine's Day action that was taken in 2022, that's reflected this year. There's everyday chocolate increase that we executed mid last year, that's reflected. And then there's a small new price increase on some grocery and food service items that really went just into effect this month. So that's happening right now. Those are the only assumptions that are embedded in the outlook right now. Tom Palmer : Right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question. Chris Carey : Hi. Good morning, everyone. So just a few follow-ups, if I could. Just on gross margin, again, just kind of put a fine point on this one. Do you expect expansion in the back half of the year, or are you saying that it's just going to be less contraction in the front half? Steve Voskuil : It's going to be less contraction. Yes, the contraction will be more significant in the first half, less in the back half. Chris Carey : Okay, understood. That's what I thought. Thanks. And then just on a segment basis, right, there's this dynamic where most of the inflation clearly is hitting you on the confection side, but probably some of the more fundamental category dynamics are more pressured on the snack side, clearly, because you're expecting low algorithm for next year. And so just from a margin dynamic between the segments themselves, is there a dynamic where \u2013 and this quarter is so hard to assess with snacks because of the \u2013 because of the RP \u2013 but will snacks require more investment in a strange way? It'll have more margin contraction than what we're going to see in confection. Is there any way you can just kind of frame investment needs and sort of fundamental margin pressure in snacks versus just, I guess, inflationary driven \u2013 inflation that we would see in confection? And then I apologize for just one more cleanup in a way. But I think to Brian's question on SM&A as a percentage of sales, we're probably implying a roughly 15-year low for this year. Maybe just help us contextualize why we're not getting too low from that standpoint. And maybe that 15-year journey is just about increasing efficiency relative to sales base. It's come up a couple times. So any added context there would maybe be helpful. Thanks. Steve Voskuil : Sure. On the segment margins, you're right. The confection business is going to bear the brunt of the margin impact due to cocoa. Salty margins are up for 2024 year-over-year. And that's even on the back of some pretty heavy investment. And so we feel good about the journey that we're on there. It's not impacted, obviously, by the cocoa component. On the second question, could you just say the question again? I want to make sure I heard that one. Chris Carey : It's effectively that operating costs as a percentage of sales look to be implied at a roughly 15-year low in 2024. And it's really just understanding why that's not cutting to the bone or going too low relative well, we're just getting more efficient relative to sales base over time. And that's what we're doing next year and the year after. So maybe just contextualizing that history would be helpful in putting 2024 in context. Thanks. Steve Voskuil : Sure. Yes. Well, let me first say we're not cutting to the bone. That's not the intent of the program at all. We want to continue to protect the brands and the capabilities that give us differentiated opportunities in market. When you look at operating expenses, if you look back over time, definitely getting more fixed cost leverage, the business is bigger. Even with a little bit slower growth year in 2024 than we've seen the last couple of years, we get significant leverage. We have efficiencies elsewhere in the P&L, efficient driving efficiencies through the P&L is an every year activity. And that's not new. And we've also seen more efficiencies in the international business. If you think back, the margins were quite a bit lower a couple of years ago before we made some of the transformational moves there. So a combination of all of those things have led to the improvements that we're seeing, but we're not cutting so far that we feel we're putting in jeopardy any of our key capabilities or growth potential. Chris Carey : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Rob Dickerson : Great. Thanks so much. Michelle, I just wanted to come back to your, I guess, brief commentary today. And I think you've mentioned it on the prior couple of calls just around consumer shopping for products with maybe a bit more satiation. Because, clearly the conversation today seems a little bit more focused on cocoa for cost inflation, salty, and then also pricing potential from here. But like if we just separate all that out and we just, focus more on kind of current consumer shopping behavior, especially within the confection category. Would you say, there are kind of ongoing behavioral shifts that are still taking place or you kind of foresee that, maybe reversing out as you get through the year or just trying to get a sense as to kind of how you view the consumer shopping that category relative to other parts of snacks? Thanks. Michele Buck : Yes, I mean, I'd say first of all, overall with the consumer, certainly I think there is some increase in consumer confidence. We've seen unemployment rates, employment be stable. However, we do continue to see some value-seeking behavior in some pockets of consumers. We believe that the behavior across confection has largely normalized and we think that we have some of the right steps in place to kind of offset that satiety issue that we've seen with popcorn in areas like adjusting value across different pack types, enhancing marketing communication in ways that, build the value proposition. So we do expect that we'll start to see some normalization in popcorn as we go through the year. Rob Dickerson : Okay, got it. And then I guess I just want to ask on kind of longer-term salty segment growth potential. While I realize you may not be giving, providing new long-term targets relative to what you presented at the Investor Day last year, I mean, clearly it seems like, enough has changed, let's say, to at least ask the question. So if we're thinking kind of past 2024, like do you think broadly that kind of low double-digit kind of growth for that segment is still feasible or like, could distribution maybe be a little slower? There needs to be a little bit more investment required to get there. Just kind of any color as to how you're thinking about that. That's it. Thanks so much. Michele Buck : Yes, no problem. We continue to feel great about the salty snack business and their long-term potential. We've seen such tremendous growth over time. There's no change to our long-term outlook. Our long-term outlook and the algorithm has always been around mid-single-digit growth. We had never expected low double-digit on the long-term. We had expected originally that this year might be a bit stronger but not on a long-term basis. So no change to that long-term outlook. Rob Dickerson : Okay, super. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, our final question comes from the line of Jim Salera with Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your questions. Jim Salera : Hi guys. Thanks for squeezing us in. In your prepared comments, you mentioned that we would be seeing some joint merchandising activations between confection and salty. Can you just give us a sense for -- is that to increase, buy rates in Hershey households that maybe buy the confection part of your portfolio but not salty? Or is it more of a way to increase the visibility for salty by kind of piggybacking on, the good merchandising activations you already have for confectionary? Michele Buck : Yes, it's really some of both. Certainly there's power to that visibility of all of these great brands together. Our salty brands now are two of our top ten brands. So they have the velocity that warrant being with some of our other really major brands. And then of course it does encourage some of that cross household purchase as well. Jim Salera : And then if I can maybe drill down on Dot\u2019s in particular, I think you mentioned, incremental club distribution for Dot\u2019s. I can say in my neck of the woods at least, it certainly feels like I or Dot\u2019s placements when I shop my local club store. How much more distribution upside should we think about for Dots in some of those untracked channels where we don't have as much visibility? Michele Buck : We still do have some distribution upside on Dot's. So I'd say more than several points of distribution upside still remain. Jim Salera : Okay. Great, thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question. John Baumgartner : Good morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to come back, Michele, to the outlook for ad spending in 2024, I guess, more or less in line with sales. Is that a function of just having spent ahead of sales in 2023 and now it's a more normalized year? Or is there an expectation for maybe a shift in reinvestment to other drivers, whether it's trade or anything else where your total spend growth is actually above the rate of sales because it just seems as though the larger innovation coming through the need for more pricing in the market. I'm sort of surprised that the ad spend is not going to be up higher this year. Michele Buck : We always really do look across the entire bundle. And certainly, we have some trade spending increases in 2024. And so we look at what's the right bundle across DME, across marketing, consumer marketing and trade that we think will have the biggest impact and most efficiently on driving revenue. So it is some of balancing the total view of all of that spending together, which is a big area of focus for us. How do we make it all together work as hard as each individual piece. John Baumgartner : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Ms. Poole for any final comments. Melissa Poole : Thank you all for joining us this morning. We look forward to catching up with you later today to answer any additional questions you may have. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Melissa Poole, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Hershey Company. Thank you. You may begin. Melissa Poole : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for The Hershey Company's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Q&A Session. I hope everyone has had the chance to read our press release and listen to our prerecorded management remarks, both of which are available on our website. In addition, we have posted a transcript of the prerecorded remarks. At the conclusion of today's live Q&A session, we will also post a transcript and audio replay of this call. Please note that during today's Q&A session, we may make forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. These statements include expectations and assumptions regarding the company's future operations and financial performance. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based on subsequent events. A detailed listing of such risks and uncertainties can be found in today's press release and the company's SEC filings. Finally, please note that we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe will provide useful information for investors. The presentation of this information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning's press release. Joining me today are Hershey's Chairman and CEO, Michele Buck; and Hershey's Senior Vice President and CFO, Steve Voskuil. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar : Michele, I guess excluding the inventory build, underlying organic sales in North America Confectionery rose 2%. I think we and the Street had modeled it broadly more flattish. And recently, market share trends in chocolate have inflected following a year of weakness. I guess my question is, am I overplaying this? Or maybe are you, too, starting to see sort of building underlying momentum in the core Confectionery segment outside of all the ERP inventory noise? And would you expect to see a sequential improvement in volume trends in 2Q? Michele Buck : Yes. So Andrew, we are definitely -- we're very pleased with our Q1 top line performance. I would say that, overall, it was in line with our expectations. However, our market share did exceed expectations. And our strength was really driven by very strong performance in seasons, both overall and takeaway, as well as market share and also the strength that we had in innovation with Reese's Caramel, which not only did well with consumers, was the best innovation in the category and also was able to drive strong merchandising for us, particularly as we launched around Super Bowl. So we're feeling good about what we're seeing. And as we look to the rest of the year, we do expect some improvement in trends as we enter throughout the year and proceed towards the end of the year. Andrew Lazar : And then you mentioned in the prepared remarks improved display activity in the first half of this year versus the second half of last year. I know there's a lot that goes into that, but can we also take this to mean maybe that some of the headwinds you faced last year from a major customer going through what seems like yet another sort of clean store effort maybe has started to realize a bit that display and sort of multiple points of interruption for snacks improved sales? Or is that too strong a way to characterize it? Michele Buck : I would -- yes, I would say we are partnering very strongly with that retailer as we always do. And certainly, I think we both recognize some of those opportunities that we can go after. As we look at the performance year-to-date, a lot of the strength that we had seen versus second half of last year in merch was really across other customers versus that customer with seasons innovation and then really tying some of our media to events like the Super Bowl or March Madness driving merch. So we do anticipate that we will see some of the strength from merch with that retailer in the second half of the year. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Alexia Howard : Okay. So 2 questions. First of all, I know you're not going to comment on what you're doing with your cocoa forward contracting and hedging strategy. But could you give us a little bit more detail on the levers and options you have regarding sourcing for 2025, whether it's sourcing from other regions, obviously, timing of contracts, the amount of flexibility you can build into the system. Just some ideas of the types of levers that you can pull, given the amount of volatility that's out there in the cocoa market today. Steven Voskuil : Sure. Yes, I'm happy to take that one. So multiple ways to deal with the volatility. Obviously, the hedging program and the financial side is one way to deal and then the supply chain side, making sure we've got diverse sourcing. And we've done a good job of that over the years of really trying to diversify that supply chain footprint. And no doubt, looking back at the last few years, we'll continue to move that diversification forward. But that does give us some flexibility on sourcing. And of course, we have recipes that went and taste profiles and things like that, that guide those choices. But within that, we've got quite a bit of flexibility on the sourcing side. Alexia Howard : Great. And then are you able to comment on what you're seeing in terms of the state of the American consumer? We've been hearing a lot about this recently with lower-income consumers becoming more vulnerable. Any comments you can make on how much the SNAP spending cutbacks last year hit you? I don't know whether you're able to quantify that, but just comments on where you're seeing the American consumer headed at the moment. Michele Buck : Yes, absolutely. So we do know that we saw impact from the SNAP reductions in the business in the back part of last year. We are beginning to see some stabilization as we start to lap some of those reductions. Consistent with our expectations as we built our plan, we anticipated that, that would occur. However, we do continue to see value-seeking behavior from consumers. So that still hasn't changed. I'd say it's improving a bit, but it's still there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Kenneth Goldman : I just wanted to follow up to your answer to Andrew's question about North America Confectionery. I think you said that you were -- that in general, it came in underlying, right, excluding the ship ahead, kind of in line with your expectations, but that your market share exceeded your expectations. So I guess, just mathematically, the category maybe didn't do quite as well as you had hoped. So A, I'm just trying to make sure I'm hearing that correctly. And B, if so, what do you attribute that to? Again, we all know there's been some elasticity and you mentioned the lower end struggling a little bit. Is it really just tied to that? Or are there other factors maybe we should consider? Michele Buck : Yes. I mean I'd say some of that is always tied to each key competitor and what their programming is like versus prior year. So our largest competitor, Mars, was a little bit soft for the quarter with share down. And I think a lot of that was driven by their innovation, the lap versus prior year with some of that innovation not sustaining, and those things do impact the category. So that looked to be one of the biggest drivers. Kenneth Goldman : And then just pivoting a little bit to Salty. Obviously, your sales trends were much improved. I think it's fair to say that there's still maybe some opportunities in margin ahead. I just wanted to get a level of -- or get a sense of the level of how content you are with the A&P investment in that business? Do you expect to have to invest any more in price? Just I guess, how confident are you in kind of the building blocks to really get that business a little more stable to a position where you can grow it and expand margins at the same time? Michele Buck : Yes. So overall, Salty was on track with our expectations as well. We had very strong Dot's performance. And then, as expected, while SkinnyPop improved, we knew that the majority of that improvement would not occur until we get to lapping the Q2 period and going forward. SkinnyPop does remain pressured along with some of the rest of the ready-to-eat popcorn category. And we think that, that will shift once we get past that lap. As we move through the year, we do have strong media and trade investments behind both of the brands. We also have flavor and pack innovation that will help us both grow and also drive share gains in the second half of the year. From a profitability perspective, Q1 Salty profit was the weakest for the year where -- of where the business will be for the year. So you can expect that to get better going forward. And also the bigger increase in our advertising really starts to happen in Q2 and beyond working forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Max Gumport with BNP. Max Andrew Gumport : I realize you're not getting into 2025 pricing conversation on this call or commenting on cocoa inflation. Just curious if you could talk about some of the other factors that go into that framework, though. So you've talked a little bit about market share trends, but also what you're seeing with category volumes, health of the consumer overall, the competitive environment, cross-category elasticity concerns just as we try to think through what you're seeing. Steven Voskuil : Yes. We -- so on 2025, and I think that's where you're pointing the question, I would just say we're in the midst of building the '25 plan. And so obviously, yes, we're not going to talk about cocoa. As we look to the plan, there are a lot of levers we'll be looking at. And so pricing is a lever we'll look at, other supply chain savings. As we talked about in our last call, we've got some transformation savings that we'll be building in the years to come, including 2025. And so as we get further into the year, we'll be able to talk more about what we expect for 2025, including category health and what we think about the consumer and so forth. Max Andrew Gumport : Okay. And then turning to the comments on gross margin for 2Q '24. Any help you can give us in terms of the cost absorption that might reverse out in 2Q after a strong 1Q, given the inventory dynamics associated with the ERP cutover? I'll leave it there. Steven Voskuil : Sure. Yes. We expect to see that fixed cost leverage that we benefited from in the first quarter effectively fully reversed out in the second quarter. So order of magnitude, we had $20 million to $25 million of benefit of fixed cost absorption and then also a little bit of mix just based on the type of inventory that was built in the first quarter. And so both of those components should reverse out in full in the second quarter. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : Just 2 questions. Michele, I was wondering if you could just comment on kind of what you're seeing from a channel perspective, primarily C-stores, because some of the feedback we're getting is the traffic is really starting to come under some pressure. So would love your thoughts there. And then just kind of more broadly, one of the things that, obviously, we've talked about in the past has been this kind of cross-elasticity between what's going on in your business versus other potential alternatives for the consumer, whether it be snack bars or what have you. And I'm just curious, as you kind of think about the year, are you framing your promotional plans and your pricing -- and your price gaps more from that lens? Or are you still just more holistically or focused more specifically on just the categories in which you're competing? Michele Buck : Yes. So as it relates to C-store, our business in C-store has been holding up pretty well for us. So we really haven't seen a big change in trend, I would say, that we are focused on there. And as we look to price gaps, we always look at price gaps, both -- and price points, absolute price points, both within the category as well as across the snacking category. So that is really the standard way that we view our price elasticity, and we continue to evaluate it that way. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Michael Lavery : I just wanted to come back to the comments on 2Q. You called out the high single-digit decline you expect from the inventory reversing. But the last quarter, you said how you expect double-digit EPS declines in the first half. I don't, unless I missed it, believe you reiterated that, but would that still apply as well? Steven Voskuil : It does. Yes. Michael Lavery : Okay. Great. And then just as you think about any of the moving parts with some cocoa volatility or cost, maybe uncertainty at least, how -- you've also reiterated how you just think for the long term and want to approach the business that way. Would it be right to assume that, that does some amount of protection for AMC? How do you think about managing that as one of the variables? And is it something that is in play or is protected? What's kind of the approach there as far as the marketing spend? Michele Buck : Yes. I mean, I think strategically, we want to always continue to invest in our brands. We believe that's a key part of the model. And we know that if you break that investment, it can take some time to rebuild to get to kind of your threshold levels again. That said, every year when we build a plan, we reevaluate the return on all of those pieces of spending. And we have to have the right news. We have to have the right increases in effectiveness and efficiency to set the right level. So it's not to say that we are set at a specific budget or percent of net sales. Every year, we do adjust that based on what we're seeing in the returns, where the opportunities are, what kind of news we might have that we want to support, et cetera. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : I guess, Michele, can you give us some perspective, if you can, I guess. If you look at seasons in the first quarter and maybe just how consumers purchased around Easter and what the display and merchandising was like, does it give you any insight into Halloween maybe being any different this year or maybe needing a different approach for Halloween? And I guess, I say that in the context if we think about last year with the everyday business being so under pressure, right, it put a lot more pressure on seasons in Halloween and kind of the balance of the year to sort of drive the business. And trying to -- and it seems like that every day is, at least as a category or the small-format stores are under a lot of pressure. So I'm just trying to get an understanding if we have a lot of dependency on Halloween as we go through the end of the year and whether or not there's any sort of difference in the way consumers are shopping around holidays. Michele Buck : Yes, absolutely. So if I start with the beginning of the year, Valentine's, the category was strong and we performed very well there from a share perspective. The Easter category declined, but it was a shorter season, which always makes it more difficult, but sell-through was very good. And again, we gained share in that season as well. As we look at the second half of the year, we do feel like those trends are positive for the second half. But obviously, we had some very strong seasonal performance in '23. So we think second half will grow, but we think the growth will moderate and perhaps be more in line with our overall growth as a company versus kind of super-sized in the back half. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Robert Moskow : Michele, I thought I remembered last quarter you saying that once you got past the ERP conversion completely and after second quarter, that's when you would start to evaluate pricing actions to cover higher costs. Did I get that right? And is that still your strategy? And then lastly, I was wondering like how do you know that -- how did you go about estimating how much extra inventory the customers pulled forward? You're expecting one thing, like maybe they would take a month of inventory. And did they just say, no, we want 2 months instead of 1 month extra? And then how do you know that maybe they weren't pulling forward shipments ahead of a perceived price increase? Michele Buck : So first of all, our teams have done an amazing job with the U.S. and Canadian S/4 implementation, and we don't take that lightly. So we're thrilled about that. And I think we are consistent with what we've said all along, which is, hey, we are in a pretty good position. We're shipping products, invoicing customers, et cetera. But we do consider ourselves at the end of that ramp-up phase and making sure that we have a stable system, can close the books at the end of the quarter and all of that. So yes, end of Q2 is when we believe we're maybe officially stable on S/4 and have options available to us. Of course, we never speak about any of our intentions or strategies around pricing or when we might or might not, but rather just that the capability exists to be able to. Relative to the excess inventory, frankly, we worked closely with customers because we wanted to understand how much inventory they wanted. I think a few things happened. We had some customers who maybe had not put in as much and communicated fully the requirements. So we had some of that, that added to inventory. Frankly, I think we saw some others who, in the face of other companies in the marketplace who were struggling with ERP implementations, it spooked some retailers into wanting a little bit more inventory. So I would say relative to what we saw and was communicated to us, that's really -- and we were actually able to execute more than we anticipated. We actually thought we had to plan for some kind of disruption in the start-up and assume that there'd be a cap on how much we could give retailers. So we were actually able to better fully meet what they really wanted versus originally, I think we kind of tried to cap them a little more just because we weren't sure we'd be able to deliver. Steve, is there anything you want to say? Steven Voskuil : And where we landed in the end, we feel, was a healthy level. And so in the second quarter, we'll see the vast majority of that bleed out. It wasn't too much. And we don't see that as a sign about trying to get ahead of price increases. The way price increases these days work their way to the market, prebuying inventory isn't really the common practice. So not much risk there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. David Palmer : Question on price elasticity. What do you think your price elasticity is on the chocolate products today? And do you have a sense of how that might change if you were to -- if cocoa prices remained elevated and if you were to need a large price increase heading into '25? Any thoughts about how that price elasticity might change? Michele Buck : What we've seen is no material change in our elasticities over the past several months. We remain in line with historical levels, which is about minus 1, and that's what we would assume going forward. David Palmer : Got it. And you're always so good on insights. There's been this post-COVID slowdown in at-home snacking and perhaps there's that overlay of the SNAP reductions causing -- or influencing that. But now there's talk of a weakening low-end consumer and perhaps convenience channels being relatively weaker now. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about the net of all these things going forward and if you're seeing crosscurrents between your different channels as you go through '24. Michele Buck : Yes. So certainly, I would agree that with value-seeking behavior that a lot of that is coming from lower-income consumers. And we've seen that relative to SNAP reduction and the trends that, that drove, frankly, in our business as well as, I think, across other edibles based on what other companies have shared as well. I would say that our C-store business is okay. And I would say mass, club and dollar are very strong. So you may be seeing a little bit of that value seeking based on where that shakes out. But I wouldn't say it's something that we have seen as significant or dramatic. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Christopher Carey : One quick question on gross margins. Did the complexion of your gross margin evolved at all through the year? I know there's some timing dynamics between Q1 and Q2, and the full year outlook is unchanged. But is productivity coming in better? Or are parts of inflation coming in worse, some parts of inflation coming in better? Just any insight on how your delivery against this target has evolved over the past few months and evolving over the balance of the year relative to your going expectations. Steven Voskuil : Yes, no change. We're still, as we talked about on our call last time, about 200 basis points down year-over-year for the full year. Productivity savings off to a good start, right in line with plan. So at this point, nothing material that would point to a reshaping. Christopher Carey : Okay. Yes. Just the follow-up is on the category comments. The way that I interpreted it was that some of this lower category at the beginning of the year is almost entirely innovation relative to your going expectations of your peer? Or is there anything else that you're seeing, which you would highlight as over and above just that one comment regarding the lapping of innovation for one of your important competitors? Michele Buck : No, nothing else that I would highlight on that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tom Palmer with Citi. Thomas Palmer : I wanted to just ask a little bit differently. I know you're not talking about cocoa inflation for next year, but there are some moving costs beyond just the headline cocoa inflation. You've got conversion costs and I think you're buying more butter and liquor than powder. So when we just look at headline cocoa inflation, do these items like conversion and then the kind of the sub-items within cocoa that you're buying, do those soften the magnitude of inflation? Are they adding to it right now? Just trying to understand that piece of the dynamic. Steven Voskuil : Sure. Yes, you're right. Cocoa is sort of the headline, the big headline. But when you look at the cocoa derivatives, they are also increasing. And we won't comment about percent increase relative to cocoa price increases, but they are inflationary just as cocoa itself is. Thomas Palmer : Okay. Understood. And on the Salty Snacks side, you noted nonmeasured channels as a driver maybe of outperformance versus what we see in scanner. Where is that really coming from? And is this like other retailers? Is this more on the e-commerce side? And should we think about it as velocity or expanded distribution? Michele Buck : Yes. So it is from club, especially some very nice increases on Dot's that we shared last year. We got incremental distribution. So at this point, it's from both distribution and velocity there. So Dot's was up about 30% to start the year, and we gained over 300 market share points. And club was one of the drivers of that. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Robert Dickerson : Great. Michele, maybe Steve, too, we fully understand, right, not speaking to hedging practices and where you're positioned or how you're positioned or how you're thinking about the internal hedging dynamic. But I am curious, maybe just more broadly, we heard from another large confection company earlier this week that was able to speak in general as to just how you're thinking about this like global cocoa supply, right? I'm sure you have plenty of internal and external advisers trying to provide that perspective, and I'm sure it's a lot better than ours. So I'm just curious if you have any general comments around that is the first question. Michele Buck : Yes, we're happy to share. So I would say, overall, our views about what has driven the market are somewhat consistent with what that large competitor shared earlier. As we think about it, we think both structural and transient forces have been at play impacting prices over the past several months. It certainly started with poor weather, a poor weather that impacted crop. And then concerns about supply. But as we've mentioned previously, it's also about much more than just supply-and-demand economics, but rather the impacts of regulation like the EU deforestation regulation, market speculation and also the lack of liquidity. So we continue to closely monitor supply and demand in the short term, which are the things that we can most get data and information on. The market will start and has started to get some signals on the supply outlook for the main crop. That will happen over the summer. Early reads on mid-crop look good, but it's really early. So we continue to monitor that. We also have full coverage for '24. We have some coverage into '25, and then we remain very focused on executing what's within our control. Our business strategy is to drive growth, improve share, innovate, enhance our capabilities, drive cost efficiency as we continue to monitor that environment. Robert Dickerson : Okay. Great. That was very helpful. And then maybe, Steve, this one's a little bit more for you. I know you have the 2 programs focused on productivity and savings that grosses over the next 3 years $700 million. There's obviously some cost inflation already in the system, could be more forthcoming. I don't really think you've spoken much to the net productivity and savings, and I also don't expect you to give me an actual number. But I am just curious, how should we feel about the net impact ability on the P&L, again, broadly speaking, given just the -- what clearly is a material amount of savings and productivity over the next 3 years. That's it. Steven Voskuil : Sure. Maybe if I just take cocoa to the side and look at the rest of the business, our model is to offset inflationary costs over time through a variety of levers in the P&L. And that fundamental model is still in place. Of course, cocoa is certainly stressing it in the near term. But longer term, that is still the model to cover inflation. And so as we think about these savings programs, both the earlier one we discussed in the investor conference focused on productivity and the most recent one, which is a mix of SG&A savings and productivity, both of those, we like to focus on being a net benefit to the P&L over the horizon that we're talking about, which would imply we have to get other ongoing normal efficiencies to offset normal ongoing inflation. And so that's the way we're looking at those cost programs. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jim Salera with Stephens. James Salera : Michele, I wanted to circle back to seasons and just dig down on -- you guys mentioned you gained share in Valentine's and Easter. Can you just talk through what's driving that? And then maybe if there's any learnings that you can take to apply to, I don't know if you'd characterize it as like a mini or a bonus season with the Olympics this year? Michele Buck : Sure. So as I look at winning in season, certainly, it starts with the right product portfolio. We feel good about the portfolio. We always have innovation at the seasons, and we feel good that we have the right innovation. Another key driver is merch. We did a very nice job with merch. And our retail sales teams work in stores to get the visibility that we really desired for the category and overall for our business. And then also, we had the ability to provide even more supply. As we've mentioned over the past several years, we had a couple of years where we were constrained by what we were able to deliver. And end of last year, we really got to a much fuller place in supply across our portfolio. And yes, all of those lessons we apply to those not traditional seasons, but those other occasional seasons, things like Super Bowl, March Madness and Olympics. And so we certainly plan to leverage those same levers to make Olympics a strong event for us in the summer. James Salera : Great. And on the Olympics specifically, if I'm not mistaken, I think it's 2 weeks. And so should we expect like in-store activations on that to run for like 3 weeks or 4 weeks or any way to kind of size that up as we think about that at the end of the summer? Michele Buck : Well, we usually start some of those activations ahead of the event. Retailers like to kind of highlight the event and get people engaged on ahead of time. So you will see some of those displays start as early as June, really leading into the Olympics. And then depending on the retailer, you'll see them throughout the summer. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Mizuho. John Baumgartner : So in terms of the International business, I mean, there's been some high-level comments about Europe over the past year or so, I think recognizing your presence there a bit more than in the past. And I'm curious how you're thinking about that market longer term. And would you say you're still on a trial period? Is there anything that still needs better understanding at this point? Just how do you think about Hershey's desire to maybe take the next steps? And I guess it's a pretty big market with some differentiated products. Michele Buck : Yes. So yes, it is a large market. And I think the approach that we've always taken over time is it is a very well-developed, established market. And therefore, we believe our best chances of succeeding are with a differentiated product. And after a lot of work, we have been successful in bringing Reese's to Europe. And really starting in the U.K., we've had some phenomenal success, but frankly, not a ton of investment in support in terms of on-the-ground people or other investments. So we now have a business that we feel good about that's profitable there, and that's really our primary focus. So we think about Europe a bit more from where we have that elements of a differentiated portfolio that we think can win. And depending -- I'm not looking at it as a big investment, but rather doing it efficiently to maintain strong margins. John Baumgartner : Okay. In the U.S., I'm curious, as the consumer encounters just sort of extended period of high inflation, are you seeing any changes in terms of demand drivers for your categories where maybe the pull in advertising isn't what it used to be? Does it require more price promo? Does it require more in-store display, more front-of-store presence? How do you think about -- or are you seeing any changes in sort of the efficiency of the demand drivers that are out there? Michele Buck : Yes. I mean, I guess one way that I think about it is making sure that we look at each occasion, which really comes down to kind of the pack types across the portfolio and ensuring that we have good entry-level prices based on how the consumer -- well, and I guess price is based on how the consumer perceives value. A lot of times for the lower-income consumer, it's about an entry-level price point that enables them to participate. In some categories, it's about volume that has a better price per ounce. So I think, to me, that might be the bigger piece. I do think areas like seasons and innovation also drive value above and beyond the base products. And so we've seen that as well. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Alejandro Zamacona with HSBC. Alejandro Zamacona Urquiza : Just a follow-up on the cocoa pricing discussion. So I'm curious on hearing any comments regarding the recent normalization. So recently, prices have declined 30% in the last couple of weeks. So any comments around that would be helpful. Michele Buck : Yes. Well, I think, first of all, that decline is just further evidence of the tremendous volatility that we're seeing in the marketplace. It's hard to peg what some of those declines. There are no new signals relative to supply and demand that are meaningful yet. I mean perhaps some early signs about the mid-crop, which leads us to believe that more of the decline is driven by some of the nonsupply-demand economic factors but some of those other factors that we've discussed relative to speculators, thoughts on regulation, et cetera. Operator : We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And with that, I would like to turn the floor back over to Melissa Poole for any closing comments. Melissa Poole : Thanks so much for joining us this morning. I know there's another call, so we'll let you all go to make sure you can attend that, and look forward to catching up later today.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Anoori Naughton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Naughton, you may begin. Anoori Naughton : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for The Hershey Company's second quarter 2024 earnings Q&A session. I hope everyone has had the chance to read our press release and listen to our prerecorded management remarks, both of which are available on our website. In addition, we have posted a transcript of the pre-recorded remarks. At the conclusion of today's live Q&A session, we will also post a transcript and audio replay of this call. Please note that during today's Q&A session, we may make forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. These statements [including] (ph) expectations and assumptions regarding the company's future operations and financial performance. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based on subsequent events. A detailed listing of such risks and uncertainties can be found in today's press release and the company's SEC filings. Finally, please note that we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for investors. The presentation of this information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning's press release. Joining me today are Hershey's Chairman and CEO, Michele Buck, and Hershey's Senior Vice President and CFO, Steve Voskuil. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Ken Goldman : Hi. Thank you. And Melissa Poole, I think you're probably somewhere in the call. I think you're still there. Thank you for all your help over the years. And Anoori, congrats on your new increased role. I wanted to ask within North American Confectionery this quarter, as you mentioned, there was 6% impact from lower retail inventory and around 2% to 3% from the Halloween shift. You seem confident that these impacts will have no real material effect on the year, which I understand. But my question is, is it unfair for investors to ask if there isn't at least a small red flag underlying this news? And I'm just asking because historically in food, destockings, delayed orders haven't always been for benign reasons. Sometimes they're, I guess, outgrowths of softer end user demand. So, just curious what gives you confidence there's not a relationship between the delays and demand, which seems to be implied by your commentary. Michele Buck : Steve, you want to take that? Steve Voskuil : Yeah, I'd be happy to. I mean, as we've seen in the last few years, there's been actually quite a bit of volatility around inventory levels, partly based on the COVID era and supply chain challenges. And so, I think what we're seeing now is a more reversion to the way it's been more traditionally, which is [handling ships] (ph) more in the third quarter than in the second quarter. So, the change from prior year -- but we had good visibility into our seasonal orders already. Most of those orders are in hand. We've got strong expectations for the seasons, a lot of retailer collaboration. And so, I think as we look at it, we don't see it as a red flag. We see it as a more reversion to a traditional order pattern. Ken Goldman : Okay, thank you for that. And then, quickly, I wanted to ask about your recently announced pricing. Can you perhaps give us a sense of which products it covers, the magnitude of the increase? And can you walk us through the degree to which you're comfortable taking this pricing right now, given some elasticity and that you're one of the few categories to be doing so? Thank you. Michele Buck : Absolutely. So, as you all know, we have experienced historic cocoa prices for some period of time now. And while we believe the current cocoa price is not sustainable, we do believe that the future prices will be higher levels than we've seen before this kind of recent historic pricing cycle. Our approach on the pricing has been to take a measured approach. We've absorbed a lot of inflation already, but we do believe we need to pass some of it on. And we're seeing the category hold up fairly well in this tougher environment. We think it's historically been very rational. We think it will continue to be. So, overall, we are not going to price the entire portfolio. We do have a robust internal process where we take a lot of factors into consideration to determine what our approach will be, but that's what gives us confidence. We will be getting about 6 points to 7 points of net price realization. At this point, we don't want to go into a lot of the specifics around the pricing. It was very recently announced, and so it is still out there being sold into customers. And we think from a competitive perspective at this point, we shouldn't go into too much more detail. We are assuming that we'll see historic elasticities, which is a little bit worse than we have seen in our recent price increases. So, we think that that's the right approach as we plan for this on the business going forward. Ken Goldman : Great. Thank you. Michele Buck : Thanks, Ken. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Lazar : Great. Thanks so much. Good morning, everybody. Michele Buck : Good morning. Andrew Lazar : Michele, I wanted to dig in a little bit more on market share trends in core chocolate. I know share trends have been weaker I think than expected particularly in everyday items even though Hershey is lapping some share losses in core chocolate last year. And I know last year there was more of a focus on capacity additions, but I guess I was -- I thought this year would mark a return to more innovation, more normal levels of sort of in-store commercial activity and such. So, I'm just trying to get a better understanding of what you think is driving those share losses and maybe when you'd expect to start to see those trends start to inflect, particularly in light of your intent to take some incremental pricing, albeit justified pricing? Michele Buck : Yeah, absolutely. So, first of all, I'd say we are encouraged that we continue to see category growth in that roughly 2% range. All along as we planned the year, we had expected our second half to be stronger, better than the first half due both to lapse as well as the timing of programming. And we had also anticipated Q2 to be a weaker takeaway quarter for us than Q1, given the timing of season, Reese's Caramel and then also some programming shifts where we had some programming that prior year was in Q2 that we shifted to Q3. That said, Q2 was a bit lighter than we anticipated both from a category perspective in terms of where consumers were shopping and what they were buying and certainly also from a share perspective. If I look at the areas of pressure in share that we saw in the quarter, sweet is an area that continued to be strong and certainly we under-indexed on sweets. As we look at the back half, we have significant incremental innovation with the Shaq launch, with new forms, et cetera, that we think is really going to help offset that. We saw pressure, particular pressure that hit us in C-store, given some of the weakening of those C-store channel trends, as well as an uptick in take home in club where we're less developed. And then finally, of course, the biggest factor that we had spoken about in the past, kind of the reduction -- continued reduction in key retailer merch, which reverses in the back half. So, as we look at the back half, we feel good about the progress that we'll have on sweets. Certainly, the strength of our programming from an innovation perspective, lapping that merch reduction at the big retailer, we have visibility into resets and we know that we're going to have advantaged position in resets in several key retailers, that's going to be a plus for us. And also, as we look season second half to first half, we are a big share player at seasons. First half had the weekend Easter with a short season and we have strong visibility to seasons in the back half. So, we know that that will drive share as well. Andrew Lazar : Great. And then, just a quick follow-up on the reduction in retailer merch that's kind of impacted the last couple of quarters that you'll be lapping, I guess, what was like the sort of post-mortem on that, if you will? Typically, some of these things kind of -- the pendulum swings too far maybe in one direction and then key retailers sort of figure out that it does make sense to put -- to have lots of different points of interruption, if you will, across the store because it's such an impulse item. So, I'm just curious like any lingering effects that you expect from that or not so much? Thanks. Michele Buck : I would say, I think that we're seeing things I would say neutralize. I would say that sometimes those things do go to more extremes and I think they -- while they don't revert back to where they were, I do think that there's more neutralization down the middle a bit more. Andrew Lazar : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Alexia Howard : Good morning, everyone. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. Michele Buck : Hello. Alexia Howard : So, can I just start with the question on the incentive comp being down? Does that imply that this quarter was something of a disappointment relative to plan maybe because the timing of the shipments for Halloween or the retailer inventories were run down? And what should we expect to have happen on those incentive payments going forward? Steve Voskuil : Yeah. The biggest driver on the incentive side is just tracking with what our expectations are from a full year standpoint. And so, we -- at any quarter, we true-up where we're at year-to-date and the outlook for the full year. And that's the benefit that we're -- say, benefit that's flowing through into the incentive comp right now. Alexia Howard : Okay. And -- but the full year is the same or ish, I mean, there's only minor reduction in guidance this year. Obviously, this quarter was a disappointment relative to expectations. So, I was just trying to -- does that mean that the comp sort of bounces back next quarter and normalizes? Steve Voskuil : No. We wouldn't expect it to bounce back. We are -- incentives are structured as more than just, say, the headline numbers. There are things other goals and objectives underneath there. There's different parts of the portfolio that have different goals. So, even though the headline numbers may not change that much, some of the underlying incentive calculations can change. And so, as I say, we trued-up every quarter. We're not expecting it to come back. I would look at it as a step down for the second quarter that will continue to pull through the back half. Michele Buck : And that's [full-year] (ph) reduction in guidance does have an impact, I mean, a meaningful impact on the comp. Alexia Howard : Got it. Okay, perfect. And then, on the gross margin, you mentioned that this quarter, obviously, you're still expecting 200 basis points decline for the full year. This quarter, you talked about input cost timing favorability. Which input cost was that on? Presumably, it wasn't cocoa, because I thought you had that locked in at the end of last year. So, just curious about the dynamics on input costs. Steve Voskuil : Yeah. There are a couple of things inside there for the second quarter. One is that we did have some movement in mark to market of derivatives for our hedging. And so, it's not a change from the past. We always have for current periods some mark to market that flows through the segment reporting. In this case, because of the volatility in commodities plus the business performance, and as always, the mix of instruments and tools that we use to hedge, we had some favorability there that came through relative to input costs. That's hard to predict. It varies quarter to quarter, but that was one of the pieces. We also made some small changes to -- as part of our ERP system in the way we match cost to products, that didn't have a big impact on the quarter, but slightly positive as well. As we look at those pieces, we look at them all as timing based and so we expect to see those come back in the back half. Alexia Howard : Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Bryan Spillane : Hi. Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. Michele Buck : Good morning, Bryan. Bryan Spillane : Hey. So, Michele, I guess, a question I think you're going to get or we're all going to be asking over the balance of the year is just consumer receptivity of a price increase and maybe why normal elasticity. And I say that in the context of if you look at your own results, right, it's clearly a value shift, right? Dollar stores, club stores doing well, convenience stores not doing as well. Pepsi is cutting prices, right, on Frito, because they priced too high. There was -- the lift on merchandising wasn't very good. Mondelez is trying to get a $3 price point instead of a $4 price point in front of people's eyes. So, it just seems like a lot of the other snacking peers are adjusting down maybe to start stimulating demand. So, just how you think about that in the context of trying to take another price increase? Michele Buck : So, certainly -- as we put together the pricing, certainly we're experiencing outsized inflation versus I'd say some other peers. That said, we do really focus on the consumer. As we look at historic price elasticities, our recent pricing increases, we have been better than historical elasticity levels. So, we are putting in place a more conservative assumption on elasticity than we've seen in the past. That said, we also really take a surgical approach across the portfolio, with a lot of analysis to look at the key price points we need to be at, to offer the right range of opportunities for consumers. We've got a pretty significant amount of our portfolio that's under the $3 price point, and we've made choices across the portfolio about where we think those price increases will benefit and work and some places that we've chosen not to lean in on price. We also continue to optimize reinvestment and look at the total bundle of value because we know value includes both price points, but also seasons provides value, innovation provides value, and then reinvestment in the right precise price points from a promotional perspective as well. So, kind of that holistic approach is what makes us feel good about it. Bryan Spillane : Okay. And then, Steve, if I could just one quick follow-up, I think you mentioned it might have been in the prepared remarks, cocoa and beginning to start laying in a little bit for '25. If we think about the gross margin expectation for this year for '24, should we assume that you've got visibility or you're pretty much locked in on cocoa? So, if it moves around, it's more of a '25 versus '24 factor we should think about? Steve Voskuil : Yeah. For '24 itself, I'd say we're pretty well locked in on cocoa. And the only caveat I would say is like we saw this quarter, there's still some potential for some mark to -- some in-quarter mark-to-market movements that could go through this year, but cocoa supply and largest part of the cocoa cost lapped for this year. As we get to next year, of course, as we get further into the year, we'll share more about expectations for next year. I mean, it's no surprise, current cocoa prices still significantly up versus where they have been in the past. That's, of course, necessitating the price increase that we're talking about. So, more to come on '25, but for this year we feel pretty confident about where we're sitting from a commodity basket standpoint. Bryan Spillane : Okay. Thanks for that, Steve. Thanks, Michele. Steve Voskuil : You bet. Michele Buck : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. David Palmer : Great. Good morning. Just a quick follow-up on the previous question on pricing. You mentioned the 6% to 7% price increase. Is that consistent with what you would expect for North America Confection in your reported results for '25, or is -- are there timing issues there? Just wanted to check on that. And then separately, your commentary and guidance seems to imply stabilization or at least some acceleration into the second half in North America Confection. I just wanted to get your temperature. What of the stuff that you've talked about, Shaq, the new Reese's, the channel expansion that you talked about maybe with club and then the restoration of merchandising with that key retailer, what about that is the most important to that acceleration? Steve Voskuil : Sure. On the -- let me take. On the pricing side, you can't take the 6%, 7% net for the full year for Confection. This price increase is going to be phased in. Some parts will be phased in later this year. Some parts will be -- have impact next year. So, don't take that all the way. But we look overall mid single-digits in 2025 is the way to think about it. Michele Buck : Yeah. I guess, if I was going to zero-in on some of the biggest second half driver, certainly the lap on the large retailer, merch and resets is significant. So, I would put that first and foremost, and we have really good visibility into what that should look like. Secondly, the impact of season, that differential, also large and strong visibility into the sell-in for those seasons and then the sweets innovation is also one of the big drivers. And then lastly, I'd say the continued salty -- we really haven't talked much about salty, but the continued salty acceleration, we have seen the momentum shift on that business. Certainly, Dot's has remained strong, but SkinnyPop is seeing a regaining momentum and we expect to continue to see that in the back half. David Palmer : Great. That's helpful. I'll pass it on. Thank you. Steve Voskuil : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Max Gumport with BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your question. Max Gumport : Hey, thanks for the question. In the prepared remarks, you discussed consumers pulling back on discretionary spending and C-store weakness. So, I was hoping to get a bit more color on what you're seeing there, particularly around the remark about seeing it really pick up over the last two months. And then, also a bit more color on how long you expect this dynamic could persist? Thank you. Michele Buck : Yeah. I mean, I think in times where consumers are forced to make choices and pull back on some of their discretionary spending, they're even more focused on getting the best value that they can. And so, shifting where they are making some of their purchases, where normally they may not go out of their way to do that, I think during those times, this is something they're doing, and I think that's why we're seeing some of the shift away from convenience store into more mass dollar, et cetera. And I think we've started to see that the first part of this year. I think I would expect to see that as we continue through the year. We do have confidence that we can continue to shift and offer the right offerings across all those channels. One of the strengths in our business is our ability to do that. And certainly, as we lap that, we will see that stabilize and/or grow. Max Gumport : Thanks. And then, with regard to the commentary of historic elasticity expected with the price increase on the North America Confection business, is that historic elasticity right around 1 or a 0.9? And just a bit more color on what's giving you the confidence that it will be right around that level? Thank you. Michele Buck : Yeah, you're right. It is right around 1. And based on the models that we use and what data points we have, we would say that we feel pretty good that that's our -- a good estimate for now. We are building in some of that conservatism versus where we've been in the past. And that's really for price in isolation. There are other levers that can help to offset that relative to things like increased innovation, seasons, improvements in activity at customers, et cetera, et cetera. Max Gumport : Thanks. I'll pass it on. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Palmer with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Tom Palmer : Good morning, and thanks for the question. You mentioned your view that current cocoa prices are not sustainable. And I just wanted to understand in the context of the round of pricing that you announced, how you're thinking about covering longer-term pricing, so -- sorry, longer-term inflation. So, does this round of pricing kind of cover your view of where cocoa prices might migrate longer term? Michele Buck : So, our strategy regarding pricing to cover commodities hasn't changed, that remains in place. But as we've discussed before, we don't view that as totally linear, as in when the price goes up there's an automatic coverage. So, I'd start by saying, if we look at where prices have already been in terms of -- and the fact that we've mentioned that we have some coverage for '25, it would be a fair assumption to assume that this pricing will not fully cover inflation. Steve, anything you want to add to that? Steve Voskuil : Yeah. No, that's right. We continue to manage pricing as one of many levers. And so, we're also looking at cost reduction productivity, we're looking at formulation, we're looking at all kinds of levers that we've talked about in the past to manage cocoa price, still very volatile. And as I said before, given even where it is today, and it's down from where it was earlier this year, if we kind of took current prices and flash ahead to the future, it's pretty still a very significant year-over-year inflation piece. And so, this pricing action will help. It's not by itself going to mean that we're already at long term covering the total cost, but it's a good first step, and you can expect we'll take other steps across all the levers that we have in the basket to address. Michele Buck : And we'll continue to monitor cocoa pricing. Certainly, we know there's been some positive news recently, but we also believe there won't be any significant impact in pricing until there's much greater visibility in the fall harvest, which is a bit of time from now. Tom Palmer : Okay. Thanks for that detail. And then, just any help kind of thinking about the puts and takes as we think about the third quarter versus the fourth quarter in terms of maybe some of the earnings cadence? Obviously, shipment timing is a big factor, but maybe any other help on kind of the progression of gross margin or underlying sales trends? Steve Voskuil : Yeah. On the -- it's a little more tricky to probably go quarter by quarter, but maybe if I just say, hey, as we look across the back half versus the front half, as we look at the back half, we're going to expect to see more AAA savings. We've been saying most of that's back-half loaded. We'll see some of that come through and some of that does impact gross profit. We'll have our regular CI productivity that I think we said on the earlier calls about $140 million target for the full year. We're right on track for that, but there's more of that to come in the back half than we saw in the first half. We'll also be lapping some incremental costs that we had in the back half of last year. Some of that was that for related warehousing and so forth. Most of the timing items, we would expect to reverse in Q3. So, I think we'll see more of those benefits reverse in Q3, but the others will continue over the back half. On the other side, as I think about back half gross margin, we'll have more commodity inflation, we'll have more seasons mix naturally coming in, and that seasons mix is slightly dilutive to margin. We'll have a little bit more sweets growth and sweets growth also a little bit dilutive from a margin standpoint and the reversal of some of the mark-to-market and other timing items that we talked about, again, mostly in Q3. Tom Palmer : Okay. Thank you for that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Robert Moskow : Hi, thanks. Just wanted to know if you could kind of elaborate on your thinking for marketing support. There was a big increase last year and I think the plan was for another increase this year. Where do you stand on your how much marketing is going to increase this year? Has anything changed? And as you get into 2025, because of these incremental costs that you're going to have to take into account, how do you think about marketing relative to sales into '25? Thanks. Michele Buck : Yeah. So, we don't see a significant change in our marketing support versus what we had planned. As we look to this year, still up in line with our sales growth. Robert Moskow : And the next year? Michele Buck : Yeah. And as we think about next year... Steve Voskuil : For next year, I'd expect also to match roughly in line with sales. And we're not far enough down all of our game planning for next year. We'll get more details later in the year, but I think from a planning standpoint, assume that it's going to at least match what we're doing from a sales standpoint. Robert Moskow : Okay, great. Thank you. Steve Voskuil : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Salera with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Jim Salera : Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking our question. Michele, in the prepared remarks, you talked about in salty strong trends with Dot's and then kind of improvement for SkinnyPop in the back half of the year, but the salty category as a whole has seen some pressure, and obviously more promotional activity probably coming into the category. So, just maybe walk through puts and takes on what gives you the confidence for Dot's maintaining momentum in the back half of the year and then SkinnyPop reaccelerating? Michele Buck : Yeah, absolutely. So, certainly, we've continued to see tremendous growth on Dot's. I'd start by saying on Dot's, we continue to have a lot of more upside on expanding our depth of distribution. There are still distribution opportunities, whether it's by geography, whether it is depth within a store, space on shelf, given velocities. And we also have continued strong investments in Dot's relative to both marketing support and then also innovation relative to pack types and flavors. One example, recent launch of Parmesan Garlic. So, we continue to just have all the marketing levers still present opportunity on Dot's, because that brand has really still been in the kind of introductory phase. As I think about popcorn, I would say, yes, there's been some pressure on the category. We are seeing some stabilization as we lap some of the consumer concerns in that category and we continue to feel good about the stepped up innovation opportunities on SkinnyPop as well relative to flavor pack size and also marketing investments, which we have dialed up more recently as well in combination with lapping some of the softness from last year. Jim Salera : Okay. That's helpful. And maybe to drill down a little bit on the Ready-to-Eat popcorn, is part of the softness there just consumer preference for like trading out or opting for another substitute good instead of the popcorn, or is there something particular with that cohort, where the consumption trends are a little bit lighter there relative to something like Pretzels or Dot's? Michele Buck : Yeah. I mean, what we uncovered was the satiety factor was impacting total value proposition. And so that's what we started to see some softness on last second quarter. And we're now at a point where we're really starting to lap that and see it stabilize as we head through the back half of the year. Jim Salera : Great. Thanks for the color. I'll hop back in the queue. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Michael Lavery : Thank you. Good morning. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. Michele Buck : Good morning. Michael Lavery : You touched on having some coverage for 2025 for cocoa. I'd imagine you don't want to be too specific, but more than halfway through the year now -- more than halfway through 2024 and with at least sort of an average maybe of kind of typically looking 12 months ahead, would we estimate or assume reasonably that you're kind of half covered for the year? I guess part of the question is, how much are you maybe looking to be patient for better rates, or kind of more focused on securing supply? Maybe just a sense of how kind of that securing product for 2025 is progressing? And related to that, maybe, I know you would ordinarily give an update in February when you report 4Q on the next calendar year. Is there any chance later this fall, when you've got plans put together, you might give a little preview sooner than normal, or should we expect just the typical cycle in terms of that news? Steve Voskuil : Sure. Yeah, on the -- specifics on hedging, you're right, I can't really give color around how far out we're hedged for 2025. As I said, our policy hasn't changed. And so, we've got some guardrails. It's fair to assume we've got some level of coverage in 2025, but we're still watching the market and the volatility. And so, we'll continue to, through our normal process, monitor that and take coverage as appropriate. As we get later in the year, as our visibility increases, I would hope to be able to provide a little bit more color. Again, a lot will depend on, as we sit here, for example, on the third quarter call what we see and how much visibility we do have into cocoa and probably some other variables as well. That would be the hope. We'll see how we're sitting when we get there, but we'd love to be able to provide more color once we have the visibility we can give you to rely on. Michael Lavery : Okay. That's helpful. And just as far as -- obviously, the cocoa cost pressure is very well known, does that do anything to influence how you might think about portfolio optimization, maybe diversifying a little bit more away from chocolate specifically, or any other way that it might impact how you think about managing the portfolio? Michele Buck : Hey, I mean, we're always looking at the best portfolio to meet consumer needs. We love the categories that we're in. And as you know, we've made decisions to expand and leverage our core capabilities that are so strong in snacking more broadly across snacking with our -- particularly with our launch into salty a few years ago. We also look across our -- even our chocolate portfolio and try and optimize our demand creation. We have certain parts of the portfolio that have more cocoa and chocolate, and certain parts like cookies and cream that may have others, but our goal is always to go where the consumer is. Michael Lavery : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks so much. Steve Voskuil : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Chris Carey : Hey, good morning. Thank you for the question. I just have one follow-up on levers, and then a clarification on the back half. Steve, just regarding the levers, in the prepared remarks, there was a statement that the pricing was the first step to cover inflation. I couldn't tell if the implication was that you're assessing the pricing in market before perhaps taking other pricing, or pricing is just one of your many tools in the toolkit to manage inflation. And then just regarding the toolkit, where is the most effort being put right now as far as levers to offset inflation, whether that's product reformulation, price pack, incremental productivity, maybe even have some tax savings. Doesn't feel like marketing will be a key source of savings. So, just you've had time to kind of prepare for this. Where is a lot of that work going right now? And then -- sorry for the long question, but just in the back half of the year, the 4 points visibility seems about 1 point is seasonal. Is the rest [Technical Difficulty] the innovation, or is there any of the 6-point kind of destock in Q2 coming back in the back half? Thanks for all that. Steve Voskuil : Sure. On the first part of your question, this is really just our normal strategy. We're always looking at the market. We're looking at cost. We're looking at pricing. And so, this isn't -- the comments weren't intended to say, hey, this is a tripwire pricing, and we're waiting to -- we will always be looking at pricing, and we'll be looking at all the levers. So, just to address that. In terms of levers, I would say we're focused on all of that, but some -- we've talked about in the past, PPA is a big one. We want to make sure that we are, as Michele said earlier, bringing value to consumers going where they are. We've got a lot of initiatives underway, some of which are contemplated in this price increase, but other things that we're working in collaboration with retailers to bring to bear in the next couple of years. So that continues to be a focus. And then things like the transformation program to drive cost savings all through the P&L, also one of the pieces, one of the levers that we can use, and driving production efficiency off the back of some of those technology investments. So, wide span of tools, but those are ones that are getting a lot of attention. And then on the back half, your question was just -- can you -- just ask you to repeat that last piece. Chris Carey : The question is basically there's roughly 4 points in the back half of shipment visibility highlighted in the prepared remarks. I can get to about 1 point of that being seasonal. The rest of that, is that incremental innovation, or just other proactive initiatives you have? Or is any of that this 6-point retail reduction in Q2 -- I couldn't tell because there was a comment about retail inventory should be in line with current levels into the full year. So, I didn't know if you were getting some of that back, or the rest of the shipment visibility and other things. Thanks. Steve Voskuil : Sure. The back half guidance doesn't require any increase in retailer inventory. So, like I said, we're at a level now that we might have expected to be at. The end of the year would be typical, but we're not expecting any increase in retailer inventory. And as far as some of those drivers we touched on some of them earlier for the back half and you have as well, we will have more innovation relative to the first half season will play a role. We'll have some easier laps in a couple of businesses. We mentioned in the prepared remarks, international will have some easier last salty as well given the ERP implementation there in the fourth quarter of last year. So, those are the things that give us confidence in what we can do from a business standpoint in the back half. Chris Carey : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Rob Dickerson : Great. Thanks so much. Maybe just a quick question for Steve. Just in terms of those levers, right, I mean clearly, you've outlined the $700 million in gross savings. I think it's through '26. So I'm just curious, kind of given the clear elevated cocoa cost situation, like is there a little bit more flex in those savings maybe to help offset some of those costs, or you just kind of preplan that too well, there are reinvestment needs that have already been earmarked, and we'll see what we can do, but not really? That's the first question. Steve Voskuil : Yeah. I'll say we're very focused on the cost side, absolutely. And so, as we look through the transformation work, as we look through the ongoing productivity work and even now moving past ERP and some of the savings we can leverage off the back of that, so all of those things are helping us focus on costs to help make some impact on what we can do from a cost savings standpoint. And as we said, we're expecting a net $300 million savings over that period. So, if not $300 million, then reinvest portion. We want $300 million net after reinvestment to hit the P&L. Rob Dickerson : Yeah. I guess I would just say like, could you take the $300 million to like $350 million because maybe the cost situation changed? I mean, it sounds like you're not budgeting... Steve Voskuil : Sure. Rob Dickerson : Yeah, okay. Steve Voskuil : Yeah. Well, I would just say we felt like we went pencils down on cost savings once we put that program in place. We continue to look all the time for cost savings. And believe me, all the pressure is up to find more. Rob Dickerson : Yeah. Fair enough. Okay. Cool. And then I guess, Michele, just kind of a question around some of this kind of ongoing discretionary spend softness on chocolate, because I kind of ask because, I mean, clearly, we've seen a tremendous and kind of ongoing growth on the sweet side of the business, so which you -- I guess, one could argue it's still somewhat discretionary and clearly still a much smaller piece of the U.S. broader confection market. So I guess, just first, kind of maybe like why do you think consumers have maybe increasingly shifted to kind of non-chocolate confection, one? And then, two, maybe how broad is the Shaq-a-licious launch expected to be as we get through the back half of the year? And then, three, like could there be any acquisition opportunities that you would maybe dream of, you don't have to name names, but yes, it could be an area of interest? That's all. Thanks. Michele Buck : Yeah. So first of all, I'd say chocolate is still growing. And the non-chocolate growth that we're seeing doesn't appear to be sourcing much from chocolate. We do believe that there's growth in that area due to some of the kind of the emotional factors around fun, dress release, and frankly, there's been a lot of news and innovation in that segment. So, in addition to value playing a role, there are many other main drivers, I would say, that do make sweets appealing, and it's one of the reasons that we've really ramped up our innovation in that space with Shaq with the launch of a new form in the back half and continued investment in those brands. Rob Dickerson : All right, fair enough. Thank you so much. Michele Buck : Thanks. Steve Voskuil : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Powers : Good morning. Thank you so much. So, I know we're late in the call. I wanted to ask maybe kind of a wrap-up and longer-term question. A little over a year ago, you obviously outlined a number of initiatives to drive the next phase of long-term growth for the company at your Investor Day. And a lot of news at that time a discussion around upgraded commercial capabilities, digital network and supply chain optimization, workforce planning, et cetera. A lot of that you've touched upon it in bits and pieces today as well. But I guess when you step back, just given all the volatility you've experienced in the time since that day and kind of what you see ahead over the next 12-plus months, how would you assess your ability to keep pace with the cadence of change and improvement that you had envisioned during that Investor Day? Have you been able to largely keep pace amidst all this noise, or are there areas where the honest assessment is you'll have to do some catch up when the demand and cost environment hopefully stabilizes? Michele Buck : Well, I would say we have continued to drive really hard on all of those capabilities around digital workforce planning, et cetera. Steve referenced the transformation program. And that transformation program includes a lot of those components, and we have continued to make progress on that. So, starting with the completion of S/4, which we were able to successfully do, so that is now behind us. That was the foundation. Many of the work streams that enable us to deliver the transformation cost savings that we are on track to deliver involve technology and automation and digital solutions to enable that. So, those things are continuing to move ahead. So, I'd say it's kind of an 'and', which is dealing with the current pressured environment and continuing to drive ahead on all of those initiatives that are part of the transformation. Stephen Powers : Okay, great. I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor over to Ms. Naughton for closing comments. Anoori Naughton : Thank you all so much for joining us this morning. We look forward to catching up with you in the coming days and weeks. Have a great rest of your day. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

A question-and-answer session will follow. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Anoori Naughton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Anoori Naughton : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for Hershey Company's third quarter 2024 earnings Q&A session. I hope everyone has had the chance to read our press release and listen to the prerecorded management remarks, both of which are available on our website.

Reconciliations for the GAAP results are included in today's press release. Joining me today are Hershey's Chairman and CEO, Michele Buck, and Hershey's Senior Vice President and CFO, Steve Voskuil. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question. Operator : Thank you. And we will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Ken Goldman : Hi, good morning and thank you. I wanted to ask a couple of questions around the comment regarding top line being roughly on Algo for next year. The first question is Street is looking for a pretty decent step-up in your realized price for next year. I wanted to make sure that's the right way to think it? And then the second question is, is it reasonable for us to assume that your guidance will factor typical or historical one-for-one elasticity on certain products that you've mentioned in the past? Thank you. Michele Buck : Steve, do you want to take that? Steven Voskuil : Sure. On the reference to the algorithm, we're talking about our long-term algorithm. So that's two to four on the top. So that's the reference point that we're looking to. In terms of realized price, all-in, we'd expect pricing next year to year to look a lot like this year. As the price increases, we took this flow through. Obviously, we'll work to make sure we're competitive. And work with retailers to make sure we get good execution of that. And then from an elasticity standpoint, we expect historical elasticity, which is what we've seen as we progressed further through this year. Ken Goldman : Got it. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thank you. Steven Voskuil : You bet. Thanks, Ken. Michele Buck : Thanks, Ken. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Lazar : Great. Thanks. Good morning, Michele and Steve. Michele Buck : Good morning Steven Voskuil : Hi, Andrew. Andrew Lazar : I guess, I want to put all things cocoa sort of aside for the moment and focus again on core underlying trends. What would you expect core, I guess, chocolate market share trends to look like as you exit this year? Can market share get back to stable? Or do you think it takes maybe more into the first half of next year? And what should we be looking for in the data, I guess, as we move through the fourth quarter? And I ask because, obviously, if we're supposed to be looking through the anomalous cocoa cost inflation in '25 to potentially a year of maybe outsized growth in '26 as costs normalize. It's really this underlying share trends that obviously are most important. And in core chocolate, we're going on, I think, like 2 years of some share weakness. So that's really what I'm trying to get at. Thank you. Michele Buck : Absolutely. Thanks, Andrew. Yes, let me step back and talk a little bit about category and market share trends. So first of all, we continue to feel really good about the category resiliency that we've seen consistently growing about -- around that 2% range, which is what it's been historically and continuing to outpace other snack categories. So we think that's a really good starting point for us. We do see us ending the year with greater momentum than we have had particularly if we look at some of the green shoots that we called out in the script relative to sweets and the acceleration that, that innovation that we launched in the marketplace is really taking hold, driving takeaway and also increasing share with each 4-week period that goes by, we had a great Halloween and expect that we will have one share in Halloween. SkinnyPop, certainly, we called for a reversal in trend. We've seen that in the past 4 weeks. Innovation remains strong. And then we have a few labs that we are starting to get into that period that lessens the pressure that we're facing. We had spoken before about reductions in merge the key retailers. Last 12 weeks, we've seen over 2% growth there. So, as we look forward, we feel good about a lot of those things, combined with as we get into next year, a longer Easter other headwinds that are bit less relative to SNAP, Mexico drinks and some of the retailer inventory issues. So, I would say it's going to be, I would say, a gradual improvement that we do think will build both in terms of dollars and percent. And probably the piece of the portfolio that will remain under pressure will be instant consumable because convenience stores, we really saw some of the pressure in that channel start midyear. So we think it will take us through the first half to get through that. The other pieces of the portfolio we're expecting to continue to see recovery. Andrew Lazar : Got it. Thank you. And then real quick, just a new head of North America Confectionery. And maybe just a little bit about what you see him bringing to the table and where strategy could well change or is it more a continuation with just more sort of energy around it. Just trying to get a better sense for that. Thanks so much. Michele Buck : Yes, absolutely. So obviously, Mike is a really strong exec coming to us from PepsiCo. Several things that I think he will bring, number one, always appreciate external perspective and always a good chance to relook what we're doing well, where we can continue to be better. Secondly, he has a very deep and rich background of being incredibly close to customers and retail. And I think that he will significantly that up even further as we go forward into the future to unlock new growth and continue to evolve our portfolio to those channels where consumers are migrating to. Andrew Lazar : Thanks so much. Michele Buck : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Peter Galbo : Hey, Michele, Steve, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. Michele Buck : Good morning. Peter Galbo : Steve, in your prepared remarks, you did give a bit of insight on 2025 inflation and that rate expecting to be more of a headwind versus what it was in 2024. But just wondering if you could elaborate. I think your guidance for this year is high single-digit COGS inflation. And so when we think about more for next year, is that a low double-digit number, low teens, mid-teens? Just anything else more you can give us to kind of help as we think about modeling. Steve Voskuil : Yes. Not surprising me the biggest piece is going to be Cocoa. And the year-over-year move will be significant. You look at the rates that we've been paying for Cocoa this year, we set that back when we set our guidance in February. And so said back then, we're well hedged for 2024. So the cocoa prices we've been paying this year reflect getting into the market really from earlier this year in preceding. So now you flash ahead to current pricing and you look at pricing for next year, it's a pretty significant step up. And it's not just the cocoa side. The cocoa beans of course, the biggest piece, but there's also cocoa butter, coco liquor and some of the other physical derivatives of cocoa that will be inside that inflation. And so we'll get into a lot more detail on that when we come back in the fourth quarter. But that will be the biggest source of inflation clearly. I expect we'll see some labor inflation that we'll probably see some other inflation in specialty ingredients and things like that. And alongside that, we'll be talking about our plans for productivity and so forth to chip away at some of that inflation, but cocoa and sugar probably are going to be the two biggest pieces. Peter Galbo : Got it. Okay. No, that's helpful. We'll wait for February for more detail there. And then if I can just ask on the gross margin actually in the quarter. It seemed like it maybe came in below not only just Street, but maybe your own internal expectations. And -- just kind of what drove the variance? Is the deleverage piece from volume more than you expected? Is it more mix? Just can help us understand what happened there? Thanks so much. Steve Voskuil : Sure. It was below what we were expecting just as we said we're disappointed on the top line, disappointed by the margin performance as well. The biggest piece was the sales flow through and in fact, the sales were down and then the mix of sales, we talked about C-store, for example. So there was some negative mix inside the sales delivery that had an impact on gross margin. And then as you mentioned, we also had some volume deleverage when we have that big of an impact in the quarter. So between the sales flow through the mix and the deleverage, those are really the biggest pieces that drove that disappointment. Peter Galbo : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Michele Buck : Alexia? Alexia Howard : Hi, there. Can you hear me okay? Michele Buck : Now we can. Yes. Alexia Howard : Okay. Perfect. Can you bring up the topic of the GLP-1 drugs? There seem to be a few data sources now. Obviously, it's early days that are suggesting that maybe mid single-digit percentage of U.S. adults absolutely higher are currently using these. That was a little faster than we expected them to be adopted this time last year. Can I ask how you're going about exploring what these patients need? How to respond to that whether you're seeing any impact on the chocolate sales at the moment and what the path forward is on that? And then I have a follow-up. Michele Buck : Yes. So we would say we're seeing a mild year-on-year impact, I'd say, consistent with what I think we've shared before in line with what we would expect, which I would say is more a gradual impact. We've continued to see multiple sources of data validating that the consumers on those drugs are eating disproportionately less our categories. I know there's been some mix data, but we've seen a lot on that. So it's in line with what we expect, and we are carefully monitoring that behavior, how it's evolving and certainly understanding what the needs are of those consumers so that as we continue to evolve our portfolio, which we're always doing over time, that are evolving it in a way to make sure that we have the right offerings for those consumers as well. Alexia Howard : Many thanks. And then a quick follow-up. You mentioned an increase in competitive activity in the international segment from global competitors confectionary. Can you elaborate on that? Is that pricing competition? Or is there something else going on? Thank you. And I'll pass it on. Michele Buck : Yes. A lot of it has been pricing competition where certain competitors have chosen to really deal back somewhat deeply on price point. And that's in some of the markets where we tend to be a smaller player. Yes, and it's a smaller market for us, but it's been intense in those markets where it has occurred. Steve Voskuil : Yes. We've had pockets of strength. The UK, Europe winning with Reese's, and I think we're really pleased with the progress, but particularly in Mexico and Brazil, we've seen higher levels of competition, some of which has been price related. Alexia Howard : Great. Thank you very much. I will pass it on. Steve Voskuil : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Robert Moskow : Hi. I guess two questions. I don't think I heard you, Michelle, if you felt like 2026 can be an above algo year. I know a competitor of yours is really calling that out based on what they think cocoa costs will do. So maybe you can give more specifics on how you think that works? And then I also wanted to make sure I understand the comment from Steve on pricing. I think you said it's going to look a lot like pricing in 2025 will look like 2024, but you have a high single-digit price increase on chocolate. So if it looks like before that just looks lower than what I would expect. So maybe I'm wrong there. But can you give more clarity? Michele Buck : Yes. So I'll hit the 2026. So we do feel good that can be on algorithm if cocoa is stable and if cocoa prices really declined, there could be some outsized growth possible, certainly. So we're watching the cocoa price carefully, but we are feeling good based on what we believe and see that we would be on algorithm or have some upside. Steve Voskuil : And on the pricing side, I think the piece is we've taken pricing on about half of our chocolate pounds. And so when you factor that in, it ends up netting out to low mid single-digit pricing in total. And that's why I say it's largely similar to what we saw this year. Robert Moskow : Okay. Thank you. Steve Voskuil : Thanks, Rob. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your questions. Michael Lavery : Thank you. Good morning. Michele Buck : Good morning. Michael Lavery : Just wanted to understand how you're thinking about marketing spending. Your advertising spending was down slightly, but of course, so were sales. And it wasn't down quite as much as sales. So -- on a percent basis, obviously, even in this quarter, that's held up. But you've obviously got a cost-pressured environment is marketing, one of the ways you can have some flexibility with the bottom line? Or how do you think about just protecting that or really trying to protect share as well given the price increases? Michele Buck : I'll share some thoughts and I'll ask Steve to as well. So clearly, we continue to believe in the importance of investing in our brands. We think that's also really important in an environment where prices are where they are. That said, we have really good marketing mix models. We continually look at generating higher ROIs each year. We hold ourselves to that standard. We are also always looking at things like new media agency RFPs that can drive meaningful productivity. We do have that as we approach 2025. So we're trying to be very thoughtful about investing where we think it makes sense. Strategically, there's an area next year that we really want to focus on in terms of incremental investment in our variety brands to really bolster the instant consumable business. Steve, other things you want to add there? Steve Voskuil : Yes, I would just say Q3, we index a little bit to sales on the way media hits P&L. So there's some impact there. No pullback in terms of supporting our brands. And as we look to next year, our top priorities are going to be driving top line, driving share, driving consumption and we're going to leverage media as one [indiscernible]. And that's not to say we don't want efficiency. As Michele said, we're looking to new agency that will drive some efficiency. We're bringing new tools to bear to make sure that we're allocating that money wisely, but we're absolutely not pulling back. Michael Lavery : Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up on your inventory comments at tighter inventories you had called out as impacting the outlook. Coming into the quarter, you had pointed to a second half inventory restocking that would have been fourth you skewed, I believe, even maybe kind of a four or five-point lift in lease confections in 4Q. I don't know how specific you can be, but it sounds like that's not coming through as expected. Can you just give us a sense of maybe how much of the guidance cut is from an inventory reset that isn't materializing the way you had initially expected? Steve Voskuil : Sure. Yes, we still expect in the fourth quarter to see a mid-single digit. If I kind of say all shipping timing impacts, it's still going to be pretty significant in the fourth quarter. If I take a look at full year guidance, the impact of all of these inventory moves is probably about a 0.5 point drag on the adjustment that we made. Just to give some perspective. And I think we acknowledge this is a noisy quarter with lots of -- between lapping S4 in the case of ALD [ph] and timing and the way retailers have laid out seasons have lots of factors. So -- but when you look across all of it, the biggest piece is 0.5 point. We expect to see less of that all in 2025. It should be a lot cleaner conversation. Michael Lavery : Okay. Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Palmer with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Tom Palmer : Good morning. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. Tom Palmer : I know it's still early for a full 2025 outlook. But I wanted to just get maybe more specific on a couple of items you noted for 2025. Just any help on the incentive comp, how much that's tracking below this year? And then second, you have multiyear plans for productivity and cost savings you've laid out. To what extent might you be able to flex these a bit higher in 2025 versus what the plan was for 2024? Steve Voskuil : Yes. Sure. We can take that. The comp reset, we'll talk more about that when we get to the fourth quarter. So we're still -- excuse when we talk about fourth earnings, we're still working through this year. But obviously, with the performance this year, you can imagine the incentive comp is going to be -- need to be reset next year back to target levels. And again, we'll give more color on that. But it's a meaningful year-over-year impact. On the productivity, absolutely. We have a great history of driving productivity here before. We talked about things like the AAA program, which are incremental, just our base level of CI is something we try to push up every year. The teams are working hard to do that to continue that trajectory. And then we'll continue to look even within the bounds of the AAA program, what more can we do to help offset some of the inflation. I'd say it's going to be tough. The teams are working on it. The savings that we share as a net savings, so it takes into account some level of reinvestment. But we will definitely be looking to drive as much savings as we can for next year. Tom Palmer : Right. Thanks for that color. Just a quick one on cocoa. The prepared remarks indicated, it would be inflationary throughout the year. Are there periods we should be thinking about next year where we will see that rate of inflation more significant than others? Steve Voskuil : Yes, I would say that's hard to call right now, just because we're still getting through this year and cocoa has been so volatile. We'll try to give more of that color when we do talk about full guidance for next year to give a little bit of prospect fact. By then, we'll have a pretty good picture price some of those year-over-year movements. Tom Palmer : Okay. Thank you. Steve Voskuil : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Max Gumport with BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your question. Max Gumport : Hi. Thanks for the question. Just going back to cost savings for next year. It feels like what we know now, there could be $140 million or so coming from the productivity program benefiting COGS, and then maybe $40 million or so benefiting COGS in the AAA program, so call it $180 in total. One, do I have that right? And then two, your remarks about it being your teams are working, but it will be tough to get after those savings. Are there incremental savings above and beyond those two buckets? Or should we really be thinking about $180 million or so being the number for 2025? Thanks. Steve Voskuil : Yes. I don't want to give -- pin down exactly how that's going to allocate. The $130 million to $140 million in CI is typically targeted at the operating supply chain area. So I'll say, tick the box correct on that. We'll give more details on the split of AAA when we give our guidance for the fourth quarter. It's a mix, as we talked about before, there is clearly a COGS component, and there's a pretty significant SG&A corporate expense component as well, and we'll give more detail on that breakout when we get there. And what was the second question you had? Was that it? Max Gumport : That was really -- that was helpful. Steve Voskuil : Okay, fine. Max Gumport : But I will ask a second question, which is on -- going back to Alexia's question on GLP-1. And I think you talked about seeing a mild impact. Really I'm curious if you could put a finer point on what type of impact you're actually seeing. And then, related to that is, I think we're all of the mind that much of the snappiness we're seeing right now is due to the consumer feeling financial pressure which you talked about in your prepared remarks. But I'm curious if think there is a meaningful portion of the snacking weakness right now that is due to category level shifts related to GLP-1, particularly as we see some of these higher protein categories even within snacking, such as meat snacks doing better than others? Thanks. I'll leave it there. Michele Buck : Yeah. All the analysis that we have done has continued to show that the year-on-year impact is not significant and that the pressure in the snacking categories are really driven by the consumers feeling pressured financially. So, every piece of data that we've seen has really indicated that. And then, of course, on some elements of our business, some opportunities for us to be executing better. So that's really what our data has shown. Max Gumport : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. David Palmer : Thanks. I'm wondering, if maybe at the end of this call, obviously, we're all going to have to take a crack at earnings for 2025. And I'm wondering, if maybe we could put some brackets around how you're thinking -- how you would think right now, given some base case assumptions, some of the things you're talking about, the reset incentive compensation, that 2% to 4% top line cohort cost realities today. Is it safe to say we'd be thinking something like a double-digit earnings decrease for 2025? How can we maybe think about that further? Steve Voskuil : Yeah. I mean, we'd love, David, to give more precision around what that range would look like. I think, the challenge, and you kind of said it in the question is the cocoa reality today is evolving. And so it's very hard to kind of give guidance on the total until we get more visibility or full visibility, let's say, into what that impact is going to be next year. We've talked about some of the headwinds from our tax normalization and incentive normalization. Clearly, there's going to be a significant year-over-year impact to cocoa, but exactly what it is, we're just not in a position yet to share it. David Palmer : Okay. Understood on that. And just one question on the top line, you went through in the prepared remarks, a great reminder about the long-term growth of 15-year growth in the confectionery category. And not only that, but Hershey has done a great job in terms of market share growth and had big areas of growth and outsized growth from things like Seasons, the Reese's Power brand I'm wondering how you're thinking about the sort of the shape of your growth and the contributors of growth maybe those outsized areas of growth as you're going forward? Whether that be non-chocolate confectionery, which has been outperforming chocolate recently, maybe channel, how are you thinking about the candidates for outsized growth for you in 2025 and beyond? Thank you. Michele Buck : Yeah. So I would say, certainly, salty, as we look at our entire portfolio is going to be a big area of growth. Strong growth in the category, lots of household penetration upside for us on those businesses. Distribution expansion, suite certainly because suites is a growing area of the category, also an area where we are underdeveloped. Certainly, seasons, we've continued to have strength and so we will continue to look at ways for that to drive us going forward. I would say some of the channel opportunities we think are big ones and a lot of those would come through relative to chocolate. And I think I kind of categorize that chocolate would be more in line with and slightly better than the category, but probably the biggest inflection point in 2025 versus some of the others that I mentioned. David Palmer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question. Chris Carey : Hi. Hi, everyone. I just wanted to go back to a reference in the prepared remarks that you'll be dealing with fewer headwinds in 2025 than you experienced in 2024. I think it's really a top line comment. Michelle, you flagged convenience stores probably weak into the front half, but then maybe get better. It sounds like you expect execution to get better in-store as well, potentially with a new leader for infection. Just what are the things that when you think about fewer headwinds and the year-over-year helpers that you're really thinking about when you insert that comment in the prepared remarks? Michele Buck : Yeah, there were several, and Steve can jump in if I missed some of them, but we exited the Mexico drink business. So that was a drag on the business this year that we won't experience retail inventory, which I think Steve referenced a little bit earlier. Certainly, some of the pressures that we had at that key retailer around reduced merch that we will have fully lapped the ready-to-eat popcorn softness that we had seen on SkinnyPop again, we should be through most of the lap on that, that was creating pressure. There were some pressures from year two leaky buckets on some innovation, and we've pulled some of those smaller items to get away from that. Steve is there any -- that was the only other one, I think, that we've called out. Steve Voskuil : And then, of course, you have positives on the other side, right? We've got a longer Easter. We've got very strong innovation pipeline, both year 1 and year 2 for next year with some strong investment behind it. Michele has talked about the Suites momentum, the inflection in SkinnyPop. So absence of negatives and opportunities on the growth side. Chris Carey : Okay. Thank you. And then one quick follow-up would be, Michele, you did reference several times in -- throughout this Q&A session, what it sounds like desire for execution just to be a bit better. And clearly, you have new leadership with the business. How would you frame maybe this past couple of years of market share between innovation versus in-store execution that can be merchandising, RGM [ph], what have you. But it just does feel like there's a tinge of execution that you feel like that's been lacking and that can improve. So when you kind of think about the past several years, how meaningful has that execution been in market versus, say, some other factors? Thank you. Michele Buck : Yeah. So I think there have been a couple of areas that I want to do better. Certainly, this past year, our summer activations in market did not perform as strongly as we had hoped, things like Olympics. I think that there are some areas where there were some changing dynamics in the category. So there was increased competition from private label and smaller manufacturers in take-home. So we had a really good innovation calendar but it was focused on sites and on instant consumable and our innovation did incredibly well there. But with that stepped-up level of new competitors in take home, we found that we need even more there. So as we look at seasons, we had some instances where we had a variety of offerings and perhaps our retail partners didn't always have the optimal or choose the optimal portfolio. We think that we can partner with them and influence in a greater way. And then I think just some areas of opportunity, probably not weak execution but opportunity. We talked a lot about some of the work we did on gold standard shelf I take home a few years back. We're implementing that right now for instant consumables. I think that, that will lead to some stellar results for us. So, as well as the focus that we're putting on some of our variety brands portfolio and really executing that well within instant consumables as well. So, those are some of the areas of focus. Chris Carey : That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you so much. Michele Buck : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Leah Jordan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Leah Jordan : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I was seeing if you could provide more color on the increased competition that you're seeing in confection domestically. What do you think is different in the environment now that that smaller players in private label are having a meaningful impact, as you called out? And how do you plan to address these pressures? Michele Buck : So, I think as it comes to private label, certainly, I think that's driven by the consumer pressure and focus on value And certainly, I think retailers looking to -- at their margins and the potential that exists there. I think as it goes to smaller players, some of the some of the barriers to entry with digital media enable a bit more of that to come into the category as well as with sweets because I would say sweets has some -- an easier door to open to the category as well. Where we are really focused is how do we really have the right offerings, the total value proposition. So, if we look at instant consumables, for example, it's always about the highest velocity items everywhere. So, there are some instances where we put out some innovation and shelf space that we took during the pandemic and the items we're doing okay, but now there are some smaller players who came in and have competitive velocities, and we need to switch out some of the items we have for even stronger items. So, I think it's really a focus on that. Leah Jordan : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Rob Dickerson : Great. Thanks so much. Steve, I don't want to beat the horse, so to speak, but I do want to come back a little bit to the pricing conversation for next year. I know you had said previously restated today, you've taken a bit high single-digit pricing on about half of the North America confection portfolio, maybe the total portfolio. But I feel like that still implies probably somewhere around a mid-single-digit range for North America confection in 2025. And I'm just trying to marry that to the comment that pricing next year would be essentially similar to what we're seeing this year because it would seem like it actually would be a little higher next year given some of the pricing on cocoa. So, maybe if you can just kind of help me understand that. Steve Voskuil : Sure. I think the biggest disconnect is probably just due to the mix of items that are being priced. I think we talked a little bit about on a pounds basis, with about 50% of the pounds being priced and when you kind of flow that through the portfolio, that's what kind of gets you back to that, I'd say, similar, not exactly the same, but similar to what we saw this year. Rob Dickerson : Okay. Okay. Fair enough. And then I guess the other question is just kind of around the comment you made in the prepared remarks about kind of trade and media spend increasing a little bit? It sounds like maybe there's a little bit more push on core brands, maybe not Reese's, but brands like Almond Joy and Mounds PAYDAY [ph]. And I just remember, Michele, I don't know if we go back and kind of making this off like 5 years ago or so, right, there was a little bit of an initiative to kind of lean into those brands a little bit. It seemed like maybe you continue to lean on them, but if we lean into them a little bit more now, what does that mean? Does that just mean kind of more social media, overall marketing dynamics? Does it mean maybe a little bit more innovation coming from those brands? Just trying to gauge kind of where you can take those brands maybe improve the overall efficacy of the portfolio. Thanks. That\u2019s all. Michele Buck : Yes. Absolutely. So it is prioritizing the distribution of those brands. Most of those brands, they are biggest parts of their growth is in regular account. So we have king-sized brands, and we have brands that are big regular account. We think now given the focus on consumer value and entry-level price points, really making sure that we have a robust portfolio there and then continuing to invest in those brands to give them the marketing support, which then, of course, leads to those strong velocities that will outpace many of the other newer competitive items who may be trying to game distribution in the category. Rob Dickerson : All right. Thank you so much. Steve Voskuil : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] There are no additional questions at this time. Would you like to make some further remarks? Michele Buck : Yes. Thank you all for joining us today. I look forward to speaking with many of you in the next few days and coming weeks. Operator : Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to your host, Anoori Naughton, Senior Director of Investor Relations for The Hershey Company. Thank you. You may begin. Anoori Naughton : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for The Hershey Company\u2019s fourth quarter 2024 earnings Q&A session. I hope everyone has had the chance to read our press release and listen to our pre-recorded management remarks, both of which are available on our website. In addition, we have posted a transcript of the pre-recorded remark. At the conclusion of today\u2019s live Q&A session, we will also post a transcript and audio replay of this call. Please note that during today\u2019s Q&A session, we may make forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. These statements, including expectations and assumptions regarding the company\u2019s future operations and financial performance, actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based on subsequent events. A detailed listing of such risks and uncertainties can be found in today\u2019s press release and the company\u2019s SEC file. Finally, please note that we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for investors. The presentation of this information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations for the GAAP results are included in this morning\u2019s press release. Joining me today are Hershey\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Michele Buck; and Hershey\u2019s Senior Vice President and CFO, Steve Voskuil. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question. Operator : Thank you. Our first question is from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Lazar : Great. Thanks so much. Good morning, everybody. Michele, I know it\u2019s clearly way too early to get overly prescriptive at this stage on \u201826, but in the prepared remarks, you do mention positioning the company for balanced top-and-bottom-line growth in \u201826. And I was really hoping you could just provide maybe just some context around this, such as, is growth doable in \u201926 if cocoa remains at currently elevated levels? And if so, how do you feel about the ability to take more pricing in \u201826 to get there, even though we don\u2019t yet have a good sense for how the incremental pricing will be received by consumers for this year? I\u2019m really just trying to put some broader parameters around this and sort of what\u2019s embedded in your comment about the potential for balanced growth in \u201826. Michele Buck : Yes, got it. Hey, Steve, do you want to just take a crack at that one? Steve Voskuil : Yes, I\u2019d be happy to. So, as implied, when we say balanced growth, we want to eventually get EPS back on algorithms. And so, as we look to \u201826, one of the benefits of a great hedging and commodity team is we\u2019re not paying the market price. So, you always have the catch-up factor relative to commodity. But that said, just like for 2025, when we look at \u201826, we expect to use the full suite of levers we have to manage cocoa price. And that includes looking at pricing, that includes additional productivity and CI savings, that includes continuing to drive efficiency in SG&A, and even driving more return for the same dollars, in some case, on marketing spend. So, all of those things will be in the consideration set as we take a look at what we can do in 2026. We wouldn\u2019t expect pricing to be easy. That probably would be a conversation we\u2019d have to have and think about internally the impact, but still 80% of our portfolio is less than $4 on the confection side. And so, that would have to be one of the things we take a look at. Andrew Lazar : -- : Michele Buck : Sure. So, it\u2019s a little bit early for us to have the full visibility to those results. What I\u2019d say is what we\u2019re seeing is elasticity is coming in either on par with our expectations, and in some cases, slightly better. So, we are carefully watching that, obviously. We have a lot of confidence in our ability to price. And we strategically selected where we thought it was best to do that. And we certainly always take into account an expectation of where we think cocoa will be. And as we think it\u2019s going to normalize, how we factor that into the pricing decision so that we are really balancing how aggressive we go. So, we will continue to monitor that, but feel good about what we\u2019re seeing today. Andrew Lazar : Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ken Goldman with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Ken Goldman : Hi, thank you. In your prepared remarks, you said you\u2019re prepared to adjust pricing, price pack architecture, et cetera. If your view on commodity markets evolves -- I just wanted to get a little bit more color on what that necessarily means? Is that dependent on how you view underlying supply and demand, or is it really more dependent on, hey, just looking at the futures market and saying, okay, the prices are what they are, right or wrong? Just trying to get a sense of your timeline and how you think about when you might want to make that decision to adjust pricing, or make other decisions around formulations and so forth. Michele Buck : So, Ken, we take both of those things into account. Let me start by talking a little bit about our view on the market. And then, I\u2019m going to turn it over to Steve to talk a little bit about how we balance those factors. We continue to feel good about what we\u2019re seeing in the market fundamentals. We\u2019re continuing to see production increase with nearly half of the production today coming from areas outside of Ivory Coast and Ghana. We think that\u2019s really healthy for the global cocoa supply over time. It\u2019s going be much more diversified. And that diversification is going to provide an inherent resilience, just balancing weather factors and geopolitical factors, et cetera. We\u2019re continuing to take actions in West Africa to continue to help drive resiliency. And as we diversify our impact, it\u2019s going to look -- it\u2019s looking different by market. We\u2019ve made investments in West Africa. We will continue to do that. We\u2019ve also diversified our supply sources. So, we\u2019re watching those fundamentals. And certainly that is one factor for us. At the same time we know that fundamentals and market price aren't exactly aligned, and we certainly take that into account as well. Steve, you want to talk a little bit more about that? Steve Voskuil : Yes, I would just say at the same time that we're, you still see pricing in cocoa as transient right now, we're dealing with the reality on the ground, which is to say we're building plans for '26, we'll be watching the cocoa market in what's happening in reality, a lot through the first-half of the year, but not waiting even for that before setting plans, and again, kind of touching all parts of the P&L in the event we don't see that retrenchment so that we're ready to go for 2026, and as I said earlier, get back to an algorithm opportunity on EPS. Michele Buck : The other thing we do watch is not only what's the price on the exchange, but what's actually happening to those prices in origin, and there is some differential there, and so we take that into account as well. Ken Goldman : Understood. No, that's helpful. Thank you. And then, just a quick follow-up, I think you had answered Andrew's question about what you're seeing for elasticities today. It's great to hear that they're on par or maybe in some cases slightly better. Just curious, what is baked into your guidance? And if you said this, I missed it, but how are you thinking about elasticity as more pricing unfolds throughout this year? Michele Buck : So, we've baked into our guidance historic elasticities at that minus one level. We'll watch those because we do think that depending on factors, there could be upside, but we think that is the prudent approach for us right now. Ken Goldman : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Max Gumport with BNP. Please proceed with your question. Max Gumport : Thanks very much. I have a follow-up question on elasticities and the minus one assumption. I mean, to me, it feels like this is the key unknown for '25, right? You've got cocoa costs largely locked in, pricing implemented, visibility to cost savings pretty clear. And so, could you just give a bit more color on what's informing the minus one and if that applies to your smaller international segment too, particularly in context of a competitor talking about an elasticity level in '25, that would be much more favorable. Thanks very much. Michele Buck : So we do see upside if elasticities come in better. We, again, think that it is a prudent stance to take as we work through the volatile consumer marketplace and some of the pressures that we know exist for consumers. And we have also considered greater elasticities in international in the outlook. We are not the market leader in many of those markets, so not always leading those price increases. So, we take a different stance relative to our approach there. I mean, it's a smaller piece of our business, obviously, so it doesn't have nearly as big of an impact, but we do look at it differently. Max Gumport : Right. Great. Thanks very much. And then, staying on international, realize that it is a smaller segment, but you had a very strong 4Q with broad-based strengths across your markets. So, the commentary of low single-digit growth was heightened competitive activity in '25 stood out to me. Can you talk a bit more about what the competitive activity is you're seeing in those markets where it's more pronounced and how you expect to manage through it? Thanks very much. Steve Voskuil : Sure. Yes, the 4Q was strong. They were helped a little bit by a favorable lap, and we also have some big Black Friday performance in a couple of markets where that was a big holiday. So, strong performance there. When you look at the totality of last year, the business was up about a point. So, I'm more on balance. The '25 outlook doesn't look as different. We saw, I would say, the highest competitive activity in Brazil and Mexico. Brazil in particular was very intense, a lot of promotion. We had a lot of innovation in those markets, and that helped, certainly in the fourth quarter. But again, as we look kind of at the totality of 2025, we expect to see that competition increase, and that's really what's informing the growth there. Max Gumport : Thanks very much. Steve Voskuil : Thanks, Max. Operator : Our next question is from Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Robert Moskow : Hi, thanks for the question. Steve, I think I'll just ask about phasing. Do you expect your gross margin pressure to be pretty even throughout the quarters? Or in fourth quarter, are you fully covered for fourth quarter, or will there be like another hit in fourth quarter when hedges roll over? Steve Voskuil : Sure. So, for the full-year, we're nearly completely covered on cocoa. And so, we don't expect a big hit, maybe kind of a new hit from the outlook in the fourth quarter. If you look at the split of gross margin, we're going to have less gross margin pressure in the first-half, where cocoa will be based on our hedging less, probably in the neighborhood of under 500 basis points. And as we get to the back-half, we'll see more impact. Those hedge positions are going to be higher priced just based on the flow of cocoa. So, definitely more in the back-half than the first-half. Robert Moskow : Okay. And just a quick follow-up for Michele; Michele, are you seeing your competitors take similar actions on pricing? You've been very strategic about where you're going to take it. It doesn't sound like you're taking it in instant consumables yet. Have you seen similar actions, or are there some discrepancies out there? Michele Buck : I guess, I'd say overall, I think the category is very rational. And we have seen most major players taking pricing, including private label, which has also taken pretty aggressive pricing as well. I'd say that pricing has probably been a bit more broad-based, though people tend to cycle through parts of their portfolio as they see appropriate. And price 60% at one time and then go to the next piece. We know that we've tried to be just considerate of pressure in certain channels, but nothing is off the table for us. We are continuously evaluating the entire portfolio. Robert Moskow : Okay, got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Alexia Howard : Good morning, everyone. Michele Buck : Good morning. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. Alexia Howard : Okay, so first of all, can I just ask, on the sales outlook for 2025, it's obviously fairly muted compared to the strong performance this time around. Is that mainly due to the conservative price elasticity assumption, or are there other puts and takes in there? Michele Buck : So, I'd say a couple of things. International is a bit more pressured than we would normally see in our growth algorithm. So, that certainly played a role. We're certainly taking into account the volatility in the marketplace. We do anticipate that our consumption will be a bit stronger than shipments due primarily to retailer inventory in North America confection. And so, that's playing a role as well. In addition, one fewer shipping day. And we do have some commercial activations that are really coming into play closer to the back-half of the year, but those are the key components. Alexia Howard : Follow-up, can I come back to the topic, or not on this call, to the topic of GLP-1s, which have come up in the past? Are you seeing any material impact at the moment? How are you measuring it? And what's the strategy here as that plays out over time? Thank you. And I'll pass it on. Michele Buck : Yes. So, we are seeing no material impacts. We are continuously looking externally to get and evaluate data. We have triangulated both external and internal evidence, including some of the most recent studies, like the recent Cornell Enumerator studies, and they tend to validate our internal views. We have multiple data sources that also support our view that users of the drugs do not eat disproportionately less of our categories. We do know that there's a broader shift in consumer preference for healthier items that has been underway for some time, items that have nutritional claims around low sugar and other things. And we will continue to evolve our portfolio as we continue to track what's important to consumers. Steve Voskuil : Next question. Michele Buck : Hello. Steve Voskuil : Operator. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Peter Galbo : Hey, good morning, Michele and Steve. Thanks for the questions. Steve, maybe just a follow-up on phasing on top line, I know you gave color on 1Q and 2Q in the prepared remarks, but I think there was a comment you just actually just made to Alexei's question around the back-half of the year, 4Q, maybe has one less day. Just want to make sure we have all the moving parts on top line as we think about bridging to the 2% given there's some wonkiness in the comps. Steve Voskuil : Sure. Yes, one quarter, the first quarter has two fewer shipping days, fourth quarter has one. And so, they have one extra. So, net-net, you're one day short for the full-year. Again, pretty minor between those two, between first-half and second-half. But over on the second-half, we'd expect a low single-digit growth. Peter Galbo : Got it. Helpful. And then, Michele, maybe if I could switch gears, there's commentary about being able to participate in the downside of cocoa markets do fall given your risk caps. You spoke a little bit about, I believe, off exchange mechanisms. You're seeing some of the competitors are doing. There's been some reporting about maybe your own activities that have been outside of the norm. So, just wanted to get a deeper understanding of kind of what you're seeing from that perspective, what instruments you're seeing yourselves and your competitors using, and maybe if you can also comment just on your own activity that's maybe been outside the norm. Thanks very much. Michele Buck : So, right now, we are seeing very low commercial participation on the exchange. And yes, we have been looking at alternatives and options of how we approach our cocoa supply chain. Our focus is really, there has been an opportunity to get lower prices in origin versus on the exchange. And we're trying to be very opportunistic about how we approach this whole area and take advantage of the market dislocations in a place that we see that we can come in a bit differently. Steve, anything you would add to that? Steve Voskuil : No, I think we won't get more specific on the types of instruments, but market dislocations sometimes present opportunities. And so, we want to make sure we're looking everywhere we can for opportunities. Peter Galbo : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Todd Palmer with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Todd Palmer : Good morning, and thanks for the question. Maybe just starting out, we could circle back to the elasticity assumption. I just want to make sure I have kind of the starting point, right, when you talk about minus one, it would be without pricing, I guess, what level of growth, roughly, do you assume as a starting point and then the elasticity starts to trigger? And I guess when we think about this coming year, is it different as a starting point than maybe you would have in your long-term algorithm or relatively normal? Michele Buck : So I would say it is -- it's largely similar to how we approach it. I mean, we always say we look at the impact of pricing and there is a volume conversion curve that you go on once you price. And then, we build back up from there relative to the programming that we have to unlock growth and consumption on the brand. We do that on a pack-by-pack and a retailer-by-retailer, brand-by-brand. And that's really what helps to get us to what that number looks like. So, that's how we derive it. The Long Easter helps us this year as somewhat of a starting point, but those programs that we add on top allow us to get better than that minus one. Todd Palmer : Understood. Thanks for that. And then, just in the prepared remarks, there was reference to a timing benefit in the fourth quarter related to inventory valuation. Just any help quantifying this? And then what drove this and whether this has any impact on 2025 at all? Steve Voskuil : Yes, the impact was about $40 million. And it's really related to our new ERP system, which has a much finer allocation of cost between inventory and the P&L based on what we sell. And so, it's sort of a better system. With that system and that precision comes a little bit more variability. So, as we go through the quarters we may see a little bit more of that movement than we had in the past. But it's not going to be material and I wouldn't -- we're not setting our models differently based on that. Tom Palmer : Okay. Thank you. Steve Voskuil : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jim Salera with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Jim Salera : Yes. Thanks for taking our question. Michele, in the prepared remarks, you called out acceleration on the suites portfolio and some successes with the Shaq-a-licious Gummies and Jolly Rancher. Just in thinking about the drivers of potential upside on the portfolio, can you maybe talk about innovation on the non-chocolate portion of the portfolio and how that'll play into some of the advertising efforts you have rolling out this year. Michele Buck : Yes, absolutely. So, as you know, in Q3, we launched in the marketplace a lot of new innovation, including Jolly Rancher innovation, heightened support, Shaq-a-licious Gummies, and then in Q4, we actually purchased Sour Strips. So, all of those things on sweets were new as of kind of mid to late Q3 into the balance of the year. So, as you look at the year of '25, we're going to get a carryover benefit, a pretty strong carryover benefit from those items. In addition to that, we have also recently launched JR Freeze Dried and that's hit the marketplace. So, that is new news on innovation and sweets for this year. We have new news coming later this year that we haven't yet announced. And then, we obviously have distribution and velocity opportunities on Sour Strips as well. So, we have a continued -- nice lineup of continued news and opportunity on sweets as we enter the year and go through the year. Jim Salera : Great, and then when you have your conversations with retail partners on expanding the sweet selection, is that often incremental space that you didn't have before or is it kind of swapping pieces of the chocolate for sweets, especially in like the immediate consumption occasion, cash wrap and the written out there? Michele Buck : Yes, so we under index in sweets, we are underdeveloped. So, for us, it is an opportunity to be gaining incremental distribution, incremental consumer occasion. So, we do look at that as helping us in that way. It also helps us with our seasons portfolio, where we're already quite strong, but being able to get some of these innovative sweets components into season is a new opportunity there as well. Jim Salera : Great. I appreciate the color. I'll pass it on. Operator : Thank you, our next question is from Leah Jordan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Leah Jordan : Good morning, thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the market share declines in everyday chocolate that you noted in the prepared remarks. First curious how that trended versus last quarter and throughout the quarter. And then as you think about potential drivers for improvement going forward, how much do you think is dependent on an improvement just in the cyclical impulse in the C-store channel versus the need to drive bigger innovation like you're planning because competition and newness has just been intensified from smaller players? Michele Buck : Sure. So, I'd say every day is getting better. We have significant improvement with sweets and we've also seen significant improvement in take home. Some of those improvements were driven by strength in the category. And certainly as we lapped some of the retailer specific pressures that we had the prior year and that we lapped through those and got back to a normalized position relative to distribution and merch, that was very helpful. Innovation is an important lever and we are looking across each of our pack types to make sure that we've got that right innovation as there is increased competition for shelf space, having the right innovation within each pack type is incredibly important. So, we have dialed up some of the innovation levels and take home this year. And we think that that will result in TDPs and growth. Next year, really the share outlook is driven by continued acceleration in sweets, continued strength in seasons and improvement in every day. We do have the biggest innovation that we have had ever on Reese coming to the marketplace, and so, more news to come on that later this year, and we'll continue to work with our commercial partners to improve trends in the instant consumable business. That's an area of the portfolio that is driven by some of these macro pressures and the consumer pressure, particularly in convenience store class of trade. There's a little bit of downward category pressure there. We see more momentum and upside on the other areas, but we continue to focus on share there as well. Leah Jordan : That's very helpful. Thank you. And maybe just following up on that C-store discussion, it sounded like last quarter, you were going to invest more in variety brands and lean into your gold standard planogram. So, it sounded like the channel's still soft, but are you starting to see any improvement as you kind of implement those plans? Michele Buck : So, we have seen improvement on our variety portfolio. We saw improvements by about three points in our trends from Q3 to Q4. They are still pressured, but we are seeing some significant improvements and we are in the process of ramping up that gold standard. So, that takes some time to implement. So, you sell it in. It does require a reset by the retailers. So, we are continuing to monitor that, but I have a lot of confidence based on the places where we've tested that. It has provided 2X the impact as the old planogram. So, we're confident in those lifts and we'll continue to see those hit the marketplace as we progress through the year. More of that upside will come closer to mid-year into the second-half. Leah Jordan : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Michael Lavery : Thank you. Good morning. Steve Voskuil : Good morning. Michele Buck : Good morning. Michael Lavery : You mentioned in your prepared remarks, you're seeing coco end-users adapting through reformulation. Could you maybe touch on what exactly you're seeing there and if you are reformulating yourselves as well? Steve Voskuil : So, we have over the last several years always looking at where there may be some opportunities on formulation, but it's critically important we maintain the taste profile and the specialness of our iconic brands. And so, it's a place we look at, we test, and in some parts of our portfolio, over time we've made some changes. We'll continue to look in that space. And I would say in all the changes that we've made thus far, there has been no consumer impact whatsoever, as you can imagine, even on the smallest brand in the portfolio if we were to make a change as extensive as consumer testing. So, it's an area we look at, but we definitely want to make sure that we're focused on the consumer. Michele Buck : We have been seeing some increased global demand across the market for cocoa alternatives. So, we are seeing some folks who are pressured, who perhaps have the opportunity to switch to cocoa butter alternatives. Obviously, we do that where possible, but we're pretty precious about the brands and what they stand for with consumers. But that does exactly -- Michael Lavery : Okay, that's helpful. Michele Buck : Yes, it does create some demand destruction in the market as we see others just do that. Michael Lavery : Okay, got it. And you touched on something I don't think you've mentioned before, which is the potential for cellular agriculture being a long-term solution. How far on the horizon, how far off is that? Is that something to kind of consider as a potential substitute? How should we just think about what role of any of that may play over the next, say few years? Michele Buck : It's something we're watching very closely. I don't think it is necessarily near-term, but I think it can be a game changer and it's certainly getting a lot of investment right now. So, I think it's something to watch. Michael Lavery : Okay, thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question. Chris Carey : Hey, good morning, everyone. Just first, Steve, the implied gross margin for Q1, I think it's like 41% and maybe roughly 35% for the remainder of the year. Is it fair to assume that the core differential there is cocoa inflation or are there other considerations that we should be thinking about? Steve Voskuil : Yes, we'll be -- for the first-half, we'll be down less than 500 basis points, more than that, like we talked about earlier in the second-half. And yes, to answer your question, cocoa's really the biggest component of the inflation in the other areas, some of the other commodities, but also labor, warehousing, and so forth. Those things are more evenly paced over the year. Chris Carey : Okay. Okay, great. And then, Michele, obviously you're announced plans to transition out of your role, which is exciting. Can you maybe provide any more color or just context on the search process, timing, and the sorts of capabilities that you would be looking for as an organization? Thanks so much. Michele Buck : Sure. So, we've had a framework for long-term succession in place always, as companies always do. Now that I have announced a firm date for my retirement, the search practice, or the search process is actively underway, and that is appropriate. Yes, we will conduct a very robust search process led by a search committee on the board. Certainly, we will be recognizing and paying attention to the fast-evolving industry and world that we are all living in and experiencing today, and being very selective to bring on board somebody who has the right skills, experience, qualifications, and people focus to allow us to win during this environment. So, I'm confident we will find the right successor, and I'm working closely with the board on that to ensure the right selection and a seamless transition. But I am absolutely 100% leader-focused in the interim on delivering this '25 plan, continuing to execute our transformation, and making sure I'm positioning the company for our next phase of growth. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Rob Dickerson : Great, thanks so much. I get to around '26, maybe it's a question more for Steve. Michele, you can chime in. I guess the, sort of what I'm hearing today is hopefully the price of coco comes down. Maybe mid-crop comes in okay, supply-demand dynamics start to settle, maybe demand weakens a little bit, so it kind of pulls it down. And I think the direct comment or the line in the prepared remarks, right, that hopefully as you get to '26, you can get a kind of more balanced top and bottom line growth. But then Steve, I kind of heard you also kind of mention on Algo. So, I'm just trying to gauge a little bit better of like how you kind of feel out '26, right? Is it like, yes, clearly if coco comes down a bunch, then our earnings can go up a bunch. If it comes down some, then really what we're hoping for is more on Algo growth, right? Because once you have a year, like this year such that absolute earnings are so far down to me kind of a core question is, okay, we could be back on Algo growth, but is there kind of a scenario that has some decent probability around it such that you could be like way above on Algo growth and kind of try to get back more of those absolute earnings. That's all I have. Thanks so much. Steve Voskuil : Sure, yes, so we see a path, even at these coco prices to EPS growth for '26, again, on the back of some aggressive actions that we talked about earlier that we're framing for execution, depending on what we see, particularly in the first-half of this year. And then, I think there's an opportunity for outside growth. We get some help from coco and we see coco start to backtrack. So, those are kind of our operating assumptions. That's what we mean when we say on Algo, or when we say that we want to see balanced growth for next year. That's what we're shooting for. Rob Dickerson : Okay, okay. And then, makes sense. And then, I guess just quickly while I fully respect that you, I don't think, ever talk about your hedging practices, is it fair to assume that kind of like where coco sits today, right, that maybe you kind of give it a little bit more time before you start to really actively hedge '26? And I think you kind of vaguely touched on that, right? We'll see kind of how it plays out. But if you do think it comes down, like my assumption would be you kind of wait a bit before you start to hedge. Steve Voskuil : Yes, we can't comment too much on the timing of the plan for '26 hedging for competitive reasons, but we've got a great team. They're very close to what's happening in the coco markets and what's happening on exchange, off exchange and other innovative solutions. And so, we're going to continue to take advantage of that. We've got the best coco traders out there working this. So, we're going to leave it in their hands and we'll get more information as the year progresses. Rob Dickerson : All right, super. See you in Florida. Thank you. Steve Voskuil : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from John Baumgartner with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question. John Baumgartner : Good morning. Thanks for the question. Michele -- Michele Buck : Good morning. John Baumgartner : Good morning. I wanted to come back to Alexia's question on the U.S. chocolate category specifically. And in 2024, volume was down about 5%. And that was a little bit worse than 2023, even though pricing in 2024 was about half the magnitude. And it sounds as though the GLP-1s are not a big driver, but that health and wellness may still be having some impact, I guess, independently. So, how would you bucket the factors driving chocolate declines at this point between health and wellness? Any shift into non-chocolate confection versus savory snacks, or maybe just outright demand destruction from prices? It feels like there\u2019s a lot going on simultaneously. Michele Buck : Yes. So, I\u2019d say there is a lot going on. So, I would start and say, if I think about the broad confection category, first of all, sweets has really been a high growth area. So, there\u2019s been some mix that\u2019s been evolving there. Sweets delivers on a different palate experience. Sweets has a value component to it. So, that\u2019s been one factor impacting the overall category and certainly having an impact on chocolate. And that\u2019s been in place for a while. That\u2019s been a longer trend, but continues to be there. I think we are seeing a lot of channel evolution. So, there\u2019s been some pressure in some of the primary channels where a lot of chocolate is sold in areas like convenience. And then, there\u2019s been some growth in some of the unmeasured channels that have traditionally not been as strong across mainstream chocolate. And so, we\u2019re shifting our focuses to really accommodate that. And the overall category growth is really strong in those places. And that\u2019s an opportunity for us and also, I think, for the category. I think the consumer focus on health and wellness is also a continuation. I don\u2019t see it as a massive change. And certainly, we\u2019re seeing really nice growth on our zero sugar line of products and also our protein line of products. Both of which we put a heightened focus on growing. And we see a lot of opportunity on those going forward. John Baumgartner : Thanks, Michele. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. David Palmer : Thanks. Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask you about maybe some big picture growth bucket questions. I mean, primarily I\u2019m curious about seasons, and how you\u2019re thinking about that this year. It\u2019s been a great area for growth. Some tough comparisons maybe have been lapped at this point from COVID. I\u2019m wondering how you\u2019re sort of budgeting and forecasting seasons as a grower this year. And then, if there\u2019s any other commentary from a channel perspective about how you\u2019re thinking this year might play out? Convenience stores also had sort of a post-COVID lack of recovery that I think was notable. And, I\u2019m wondering how you\u2019re thinking about that channel and any other insights. Thanks. Michele Buck : Yes. So, we\u2019re expecting strength in seasons this year. We\u2019ve been pretty consistently doing very well during seasons. I think there\u2019s a very strong emotional component with consumers that makes them want to participate in seasons regardless of what might be going on in the macro environment. And they love their brands that have been part of their traditions and rituals over the years with their families. This year, Easter is advantaged being the late Easter. So, that elongates the season. And we expect strong growth. We expect to gain share there. And we also continue to believe that we\u2019ll do well in the other seasons. As you know, performance in the prior year in a season helps to set up success in the following year. And we feel good about what we delivered. It\u2019s the seasons this year that give us a good foundation as well going into 2025. David Palmer : Any comment on convenience as a channel? Do you think that that\u2019ll be in line with your forecast broadly, or what\u2019s your thoughts there? Michele Buck : Yes. I think that convenience will absolutely be in line with our forecast. We are continuing to forecast some pressure in that channel until we see it stabilize more. So, we\u2019ll lap some parts of that pressure. So, that will be a help, lapping it about the summer timeframe. So, continued softness until we see that lap. David Palmer : That makes sense. Thanks very much. Michele Buck : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude our question-and-answer session. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
